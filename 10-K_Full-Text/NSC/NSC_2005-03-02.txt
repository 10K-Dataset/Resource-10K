Properties
..

GENERAL -

Norfolk Southern
Corporation (
Norfolk
 Southern) was incorporated
on
July 23, 1980
, under the laws of the
Commonwealth
 of
Virginia
..
 
On June l, 1982, Norfolk Southern
acquired control of two major operating railroads, Norfolk and Western Railway
Company (NW) and Southern Railway Company (Southern) in accordance with an
Agreement of Merger and Reorganization dated as of July 31, 1980, and with the
approval of the transaction by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) (now
the Surface Transportation Board [STB]).

Effective

Dec. 31, 1990
,
Norfolk
 Southern transferred all
the common stock of NW to
Southern,
 and
Southern's
 name was changed to Norfolk Southern Railway
Company (Norfolk Southern Railway or NSR).
 

Effective
Sept. 1, 1998
, NW was merged with and
into Norfolk Southern Railway.
 
As
of
Dec. 31, 2004
, all the common stock of
Norfolk Southern Railway was owned directly by
Norfolk
 Southern.

Through
a limited liability company,
Norfolk
 Southern and CSX
Corporation (CSX) jointly own Conrail Inc. (Conrail), whose primary
subsidiary is Consolidated Rail Corporation (CRC).
 
Norfolk
 Southern has a 58% economic
and 50% voting interest in the jointly owned entity, and CSX has the remainder
of the economic and voting interests.
 

CRC owns and operates certain properties (the Shared Assets Areas) for
the joint and exclusive benefit of NSR and CSX Transportation Inc. (CSXT).
 
On
June 1,
,
NSR and
CSXT,
 began operating separate portions of
Conrail’s rail routes and assets.
 

As described below, on
August 27, 2004
, NS, CSX and Conrail
completed a reorganization of Conrail.

Norfolk
Southern makes available free of charge through its website, www.nscorp.com,
its annual report on Form 10‑K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q,
current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as
reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or
furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
 
Additionally, Norfolk
Southern’s
 corporate governance guidelines,
board committee charters, code of ethics and code of ethical conduct for senior
financial officers are available on the company’s website and in print to
any shareholder who requests them.

Unless
otherwise indicated,
Norfolk
 Southern and its
subsidiaries are referred to collectively as NS.

CONRAIL
CORPORATE REORGANIZATION –

On
August 27, 2004
, NS, CSX and Conrail
completed a reorganization of Conrail (Conrail Corporate Reorganization), which
established direct ownership and control by NSR and CSX Transportation, Inc.
(CSXT) of two former CRC subsidiaries, Pennsylvania Lines LLC (PRR) and New
York Central Lines LLC (NYC), respectively.
 
Prior to the Conrail Corporate
Reorganization, NSR operated the routes and assets of PRR and CSXT operated the
routes and assets of NYC, each in accordance with operating and lease
agreements.
 
Pursuant to the Conrail
Corporate Reorganization, the operating and lease agreements were terminated
and PRR and NYC were merged into NSR and CSXT, respectively.
 
The reorganization did not involve the
Shared Assets Areas and did not affect the competitive rail service provided in
the Shared Assets Areas.
 
Conrail
continues to own, manage and operate the Shared Assets Areas as previously
approved by the STB.
 
In connection
with the Conrail Corporate Reorganization, NS, CSX and Conrail obtained a
ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding certain tax matters,
and the STB approved the transaction.
 

As a part of the Conrail Corporate Reorganization, Conrail restructured
its existing

K3

unsecured
 and secured public
indebtedness, with the consent of Conrail’s
debtholders
..
 
See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

RAILWAY
OPERATING REVENUES -

NS' total railway operating revenues were $7.3 billion
in 2004.
 
See the financial
information by traffic segment in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.”

COAL

TRAFFIC

-

Coal, coke and iron ore -- most of which is
bituminous coal -- is NS' railroads' largest commodity group as measured
by revenues.
 
The railroads handled
a total of 181 million tons in 2004, most of which originated on NS' lines
in
West Virginia
,
Virginia
,
Pennsylvania
 and
Kentucky
..
 
Revenues from coal, coke and iron ore
accounted for about 24% of NS' total railway operating revenues in 2004.

Total
coal handled through all system ports in 2004 was 38 million tons.
 
Of this total, 13 million tons
(including coastwise traffic) moved through
Norfolk
,
Virginia
, 4 million tons moved
through the Baltimore Terminal, 14 million tons moved to various docks on
the
Ohio
 River
,
and 7 million tons moved to various
Lake Erie
 ports.
 
Other than coal for export, virtually
all coal handled by NS' railroads was terminated in states east of the
Mississippi River
..

See
the discussion of coal traffic, by type of coal, in Part II, Item 7,
“Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations.”

GENERAL
MERCHANDISE

TRAFFIC

-

General merchandise
traffic is composed of five major commodity groupings:  automotive;
chemicals; metals and construction; agriculture, consumer products and
government; and paper, clay and forest products.
 
The automotive group includes finished
vehicles for BMW, DaimlerChrysler, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Honda,
Isuzu, Jaguar, Land Rover, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Saab,
Subaru, Suzuki,
Toyota
 and Volkswagen, and auto

K5

parts
 for Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Mercedes-Benz and
Toyota
..
 
The chemicals group includes sulfur and
related chemicals, petroleum products, chlorine and bleaching compounds,
plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals, chemical wastes and municipal wastes.
 
The metals and construction group includes
steel, aluminum products, machinery, scrap metals, cement, aggregates, bricks
and minerals.
 
The agriculture,
consumer products and government group includes soybeans, wheat, corn,
fertilizer, animal and poultry feed, food oils, flour, beverages, canned goods,
sweeteners, consumer products, ethanol and items for the military.
 
The paper, clay and forest products
group includes lumber and wood products, pulp board and paper products, wood
fibers, wood pulp, scrap paper and clay.

In
2004, 141 million tons of general merchandise freight, or approximately
67% of total general merchandise tonnage handled by NS, originated online.
 
The balance of general merchandise
traffic was received from connecting carriers at
interterritorial

gateways.
 
The principal interchange
points for NS-received traffic included
Chicago
,
Memphis
,
New Orleans
,
Cincinnati
,
Kansas
 City,
Detroit
,
Hagerstown
, St. Louis/East St. Louis
and
Louisville
..
 

General merchandise carloads handled in 2004 were 2.9 million, the
revenue from which accounted for 55% of NS’ total railway operating
revenues in 2004.

See
the discussion of general merchandise rail traffic by commodity group in
Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis.”

INTERMODAL

TRAFFIC

-

The
intermodal
 market
consists of shipments moving in trailers, domestic and international
containers, and
Roadrailer
® equipment.
 
These shipments are handled on behalf of

intermodal
 marketing companies, international
steamship lines, truckers and other shippers.
 
Intermodal

units handled in 2004 were 2.9 million, the revenues from which accounted
for 21% of NS’ total railway operating revenues for the year.

See
the discussion of
intermodal
 traffic in Part II, Item
7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and
Results of Operations.”

FREIGHT
RATES -

In
2004, NS' railroads continued their reliance on private contracts and exempt
price quotes as their predominant pricing mechanisms.
 
Thus, a major portion of NS' railroads'
freight business is not currently economically regulated by the
government.
 
In general, market
forces have been substituted for government regulation and now are the primary
determinant of rail service prices.
 

However, in 2004 there were significant coal movements moving under
common carrier (tariff) rates that had previously moved under rates contained
in transportation contracts.
 

Beginning Jan. 1, 2002, coal moving to Duke Energy's (Duke)
Belew's
 Creek, Allen, Buck and
Dan
 River generating stations
moved under common carrier rates and beginning April 1, 2002, coal moving to
Carolina Power and Light's (CP&L)
Hyco
 and Mayo
plants moved under common carrier rates.
 

In 2002, Duke and CP&L filed rate reasonableness complaints at the
STB alleging that NS’ tariff rates for the transportation of coal were
unreasonable.
 
On
October 20, 2004
, in a consolidated decision the STB found NS’
rates to be reasonable in both cases.
 

At the
STB’s
 invitation, Duke and
CP&L have each initiated proceedings to determine whether phasing
constraints should apply.
 
Although
management has made an estimate of the ultimate resolution of these cases, the
uncertainty of future developments in the Duke case
and(
or)
the CP&L case may result in adjustments that could have a favorable or
unfavorable material impact on results of operations in a particular quarter or
year.
 
See the discussion of the
rate cases in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

In
2004, NS' railroads were found by the STB not to be “revenue adequate”
based on results for the year 2003.
 

A railroad is “revenue adequate” under the applicable law
when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry's composite cost of
capital.
 
This determination is made
pursuant to a statutory requirement and does not adversely impact NS' liquidity
or capital resources.

K6

PASSENGER
OPERATIONS -

Regularly scheduled passenger trains are operated by Amtrak on
NS' lines between
Alexandria
 and
New Orleans
, between
Greensboro
 and
Selma
,
North Carolina
, between
Chicago
,
Illinois
, and
Detroit
,
Michigan
, and between
Chicago
 and
Harrisburg
,
Pennsylvania
..
 
Commuter trains are operated on the NS
line between
Manassas
 and
Alexandria
 in accordance with
contracts with two transportation commissions of the
Commonwealth
 of
Virginia
..
 
NS also leases the
Chicago
 to
Manhattan
,
Illinois
, line to the Commuter Rail
Division of the Regional Transportation Authority of Northeast Illinois.
 
NS operates lines on which Amtrak
conducts regularly scheduled passenger operations.
 
In addition, NS provides freight service
over lines with significant ongoing Amtrak and commuter passenger operations,
and is conducting freight operations over some
trackage

owned by Amtrak or by New Jersey Transit, the Southeastern Pennsylvania
Transportation Authority, Metro-North Commuter Railroad Company and Maryland
DOT.
 
Finally, passenger operations
are conducted either by Amtrak or by the commuter agencies over
trackage
 owned by Conrail in the Shared Assets Areas.

NONCARRIER
OPERATIONS -

NS'
noncarrier
 subsidiaries engage
principally in the acquisition, leasing and management of coal, oil, gas and
minerals; the development of commercial real estate; telecommunications; and
the leasing or sale of rail property and equipment.
 
In 2004, no such
noncarrier

subsidiary or industry segment grouping of
noncarrier

subsidiaries met the requirements for a reportable business segment set forth
in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131.

RAILWAY PROPERTY

The
NS railroad system extends across 22 states, the
District of Columbia
 and portions of
Canada
..
 
The railroad infrastructure makes the
company very capital intensive with total property of approximately
$21 billion.

Capital
Expenditures -

Capital expenditures for road, equipment and other property for the past five
years were as follows (including capitalized leases):

As
of
Dec. 31, 2004
, the average age of the
locomotive fleet was 16.8 years.
 

During 2004, 50 locomotives, the average age of which was
22.9 years, were retired.
 
The
average age of the freight car fleet at
Dec.
 31, 2004
, was 27.6 years.
 

Between 1988 and 2000, about 29,000 coal cars were 
rebodied
..
 
As a
result, the remaining
servicibility
 of the freight
car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the high percentage of freight
cars built in earlier years.
 
During
2004, 1,829 freight cars were retired.

Ongoing
freight car and locomotive maintenance programs are intended to ensure the
highest standards of safety, reliability, customer satisfaction and equipment
marketability.
 
The freight car bad
order ratio rose in 2000, 2001 and 2002 as a result of decreased maintenance
activity.
 
The decline in 2003
reflected an increase in maintenance activity as well as the retirement of
unserviceable units.
 
The locomotive
bad order ratio includes units out of service for required inspections every 92
days and program work such as overhauls.
 

The elevated ratio through 2004 reflected units out of service related
to the resumption of maintenance and modification activities.

Encumbrances
- -

Certain
railroad equipment is subject to the prior lien of equipment financing
obligations amounting to approximately $930 million as of
Dec. 31, 2004
, and $910 million at
Dec. 31, 2003
..

Track
Maintenance -

Of the approximately 38,200 total miles of track operated, NS had
responsibility for maintaining about 31,000 miles of track with the remainder
being operated under
trackage
 rights.
 
Over 75% of the main line
trackage
 (including first, second, third and branch main

Microwave
System -

The NS microwave system, consisting of approximately
7,400 radio route miles, 423 core stations, 14 secondary stations and
5 passive repeater stations, provides communications between most
operating locations.
 
The microwave
system is used primarily for voice communications, VHF radio control circuits,
data and facsimile transmissions, traffic control operations and AEI data
transmissions.

Traffic
Control -

Of the approximately 16,400 route miles owned by NS, 11,052 miles are
signalized, including 8,030 miles of centralized traffic control (CTC) and
3,022 miles of automatic block signals.

K9

Of the
8,030 miles of CTC, 2,565 miles are controlled by data radio originating at 197
base station radio sites.

Computers -

A computer network
consisting of a centralized data center in
Atlanta
,
Georgia
, and various distributed
computers throughout the company connects the yards, terminals, transportation
offices, rolling stock repair points, sales offices and other key system
locations.
 
Operating and traffic
data are processed and stored to provide customers with information on their
shipments throughout the system.
 

Computer systems provide current information on the location of every
train and each car on line, as well as related waybill and other train and car
movement data.
 
In addition, the
computer systems are utilized to assist management in the performance of a
variety of functions and services including payroll, car and revenue
accounting, billing, material management activities and controls, and special
studies.

ENVIRONMENTAL
MATTERS -

Compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the
protection of the environment is a principal NS goal.
 
To date, such compliance has not
affected materially NS' capital additions, earnings, liquidity or competitive
position.
 
See the discussion of
“Environmental Matters” in Part II, Item 7,
“Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations,” and in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

EMPLOYEES -

NS employed an average
of 28,475 employees in 2004, compared with an average of 28,753 employees in
2003.
 
The approximate average cost
per employee during 2004 was $59,000 in wages and $28,000 in employee benefits.

Approximately
85% of NS' railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements
with 14 different labor unions.
 

See the discussion of “Labor Agreements” in Part II,
Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations.”

GOVERNMENT
REGULATION -

In addition to environmental, safety, securities and other
regulations generally applicable to all businesses, NS' railroads are subject
to regulation by the STB.
 
The STB
has jurisdiction over some rates, routes, conditions of service and the
extension or abandonment of rail lines.
 

The STB also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger or
acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers.
 
The Department of Transportation
regulates certain track and mechanical equipment standards.

The
relaxation of economic regulation of railroads, begun over two decades ago
under the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, has continued.
 
Significant exemptions are TOFC/COFC
(i.e., “piggyback”) business, rail boxcar traffic, lumber,
manufactured steel, automobiles and certain bulk commodities such as sand,
gravel, pulpwood and wood chips for paper manufacturing.
 
Transportation contracts on regulated
shipments effectively remove those shipments from regulation as well.
 
About 75% of NS' freight revenues come
from either exempt traffic or traffic moving under transportation contracts.

Efforts
may be made in 2005 to re-subject the rail industry to unwarranted federal
economic regulation.
 
The Staggers
Rail Act of 1980, which substantially reduced such regulation, encouraged and
enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business, thereby
contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of
the industry.
 
Accordingly, NS will
oppose efforts to
reimpose
 unwarranted economic
regulation.

COMPETITION -

There is continuing
strong competition among rail, water and highway carriers.
 
Price is usually only one factor of
importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific
hauling company.
 
Inventory carrying
costs, service reliability, ease of handling and the desire to avoid loss and
damage during transit are also important considerations, especially for
higher-valued finished goods, machinery and consumer products.
 
Even for raw materials,
semifinished
 goods and work-in-

K10

process
, users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that
minimize problems at successive production stages.

NS’
primary rail competitor is the CSX system; both operate throughout much of the
same territory.
 
Other railroads
also operate in parts of the territory.
 

NS also competes with motor carriers, water carriers and with shippers
who have the additional option of handling their own goods in private carriage.

Certain
marketing strategies among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers
enable carriers to compete more effectively in specific markets.

2004 other income – net includes a $53 million
  net gain from the Conrail Corporate Reorganization.
 
This gain increased net income by $53
  million or 13 cents per diluted share.


2003 operating expenses
  include a $107 million charge for a voluntary separation program.
 
Other income – net includes an
  $84 million charge to recognize the impaired value of certain
  telecommunications assets.
 
These
  charges reduced net income by $119 million, or 30 cents per diluted share.


In
  1998, NS sold all the common stock of its motor carrier subsidiary, North
  American Van Lines, Inc.
 

(NAVL).
 
Accordingly,
NAVL's
 results of operations, financial position and cash
  flows are presented as “Discontinued operations.”
 
Results in 2001 include an additional
  after-tax gain of $13 million, or 3 cents per diluted share, that resulted
  from the expiration of certain indemnity obligations contained in the sales
  agreement.
 
Results in 2003
  include an additional after-tax gain of $10 million, or 3 cents per diluted
  share, resulting from resolution of tax issues related to the transaction.


Net
  income in 2003 reflects two accounting changes, the cumulative effect of
  which increased net income by $114 million, or 29 cents per diluted
  share:
 
a change in accounting for
  the cost to remove railroad crossties, which increased net income by $110
  million, and a change in accounting related to a special-purpose entity that
  leases certain locomotives to NS, which increased net income by $4
  million.
 
This entity’s
  assets and liabilities, principally the locomotives and debt related to their
  purchase, are now reflected in NS’ Consolidated Balance Sheet.


Excludes
  notes payable to Conrail of $716 million in 2003, $513 million in 2002, $301
  million in 2001, and $51 million in 2000.


  operating expenses include $165 million in work force reduction costs for
  early retirement and separation programs.
 
These costs reduced net income by $101
  million or 26 cents per diluted share.

Norfolk Southern Corporation
and Subsidiaries

Management's Discussion and
Analysis of

Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

The
following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and the Selected Financial Data.

OVERVIEW

NS’ results in 2004
reflect substantial increases in traffic volumes as the U.S. economy recovered and
demand for transportation grew.
 
The
U.S. economy grew an estimated 4.4%, and the manufacturing sector expanded
throughout the year.
 
The higher
demand, coupled with the combination of trucking capacity constraints and the
continuing fluidity of the NS network resulted in a substantial increase in
volume and revenues.
 
Carloadings
 were up 603,000 units, or 9%, in 2004 driven by

intermodal
, metals and construction, and coal,
which together accounted for 95% of this increase, and revenues increased $844
million, or 13%.
 
Improved
performance and service levels allowed NS to meet increased demand and led to
the ability to raise rates in response to market demand.
 
The fluidity and efficiency of NS’
system enabled it to handle the record levels of traffic volume and control
expenses.
 
Operating expenses grew
less than the 9% increase in
carloadings
, and the
operating ratio, a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by
operating expenses, improved to 76.7% in 2004.

Looking ahead NS expects
business levels to continue to grow in 2005 but at a more modest pace than seen
in 2004.

SUMMARIZED
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2004 Compared with 2003

Net income was $923 million,
or $2.31 per diluted share, in 2004, up $388 million, or 73%, compared with net
income of $535 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, in 2003.
 
Results in 2003 included a
$10 million, or 3 cents per share, gain from discontinued operations
(see Note 17) and a $114 million, or 29 cents per share, benefit related
to the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles (see
Note 1).
 
Income from
continuing operations before accounting changes was $923 million, or $2.31 per
diluted share, in 2004, compared with $411 million, or $1.05 per diluted share,
in 2003.
 
The increase in 2004 was the
result of higher income from railway operations and also included a $53 million
net
noncash
 gain from the Conrail Corporate
Reorganization
 
reported in
“Other income – net” (see Notes 2 and 3).
 
In addition, the comparisons were
affected by the costs of a voluntary separation program (see Note 11) and the
impairment of certain telecommunications assets (see Note 6), which combined to
reduce income by $119 million, or 30 cents per diluted share, in 2003.

Compared with 2002

Net
income was $535 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, in 2003, up $75 million,
or 16%.
 
Income from continuing
operations before accounting changes was $411 million, or $1.05 per diluted
share, down $49 million, or 11%, compared with 2002, reflecting higher
compensation and benefits costs, which included the costs of the voluntary
separation program, and lower
nonoperating
 income
that reflected the impairment of the telecommunications assets.

9%, rise in general merchandise revenues, a $298 million, or 24%, increase in
intermodal
 revenues and a $228 million, or 15%, improvement
in coal revenues.
 
All general merchandise market groups except automotive posted
volume increases over 2003.
 

As shown in the following table, the revenue improvement was the result
of higher traffic volumes and increased average revenues.
 
The favorable revenue per unit/mix
variance was driven by higher average revenue per unit that reflected higher
rates and increased fuel surcharges, offset in part by the effects of a 17%
increase in lower-priced
intermodal
 traffic volume.

In
2003, revenues increased 3%, reflecting a 2%

 in
general merchandise revenues, a 4% improvement in coal revenues, and a 5%
increase in
intermodal
 revenues.
 
All but automotive within the general
merchandise market group posted revenue increases over 2002.
 
Most of the revenue improvement was the
result of higher traffic volumes.
 

The favorable revenue per unit/mix variance was driven by higher average
revenue per unit, offset in part by the effects of unfavorable changes in the
mix of traffic, particularly a 5% increase in
intermodal

traffic volume.

Beginning

March 1, 2004
, NS modified its fuel
surcharge program for its merchandise and coal traffic.
 
The fuel surcharge program in effect
until that time applied a 2% fuel surcharge to line haul freight charges when
the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price, as published in the Wall
Street Journal, exceeded $28.00 per barrel for 30 consecutive business
days.
 
For each $5.00 per barrel
increase, an

K18

additional
 2% fuel surcharge applied.
 

The revised fuel surcharge is based on the monthly average price of WTI
crude oil.
 
Line haul freight
charges are adjusted by 0.4% for every dollar the average price exceeds $23 per
barrel in the second calendar month prior to the month in which the fuel
surcharge is applied.
 
The
modification in the fuel surcharge program causes the amount charged to more
closely reflect fuel price fluctuations in today’s volatile market.
 
Higher average WTI crude oil prices
resulted in an increase in fuel surcharges in 2004; however, this was offset by
the effect of higher prices for diesel fuel (excluding hedge benefits).

COAL

revenues increased $228
million, or 15%, versus 2003.
 

Traffic volume (carloads) increased 5% primarily due to higher export,
utility and metallurgical coal volumes, which offset declines in coke and iron
ore.
 
Revenue per unit increased
10%, reflecting higher rates, fuel surcharges, a favorable change in the
mix of traffic (the rate of increase in longer haul traffic exceeded that of
short haul traffic) and improved loading productivity (increased tons per car).
 
Coal, coke and iron ore revenues
represented 24% of total railway operating revenues in 2004, and 83% of NS’
coal shipments originated on lines it operates.

NS
is involved in rate cases with two of its utility customers, Duke Energy (Duke)
and Carolina Power & Light (CP&L).
 

In 2002, Duke and CP&L filed rate reasonableness complaints at the
STB alleging that NS’ tariff rates for the transportation of coal were
unreasonable.
 
On
Oct. 20, 2004
, in a consolidated decision, the STB found
NS’ rates to be reasonable in both cases.
 
At the
STB’s

invitation, Duke and CP&L each initiated proceedings to determine whether
phasing constraints should apply.
 

As the STB has explained, the phasing constraint is an independent
constraint relating not to the reasonableness of a rate, but to the reasonableness
of collecting it immediately.
 
The
Interstate Commerce Commission (the predecessor to the STB) had previously
issued guidelines for phasing.
 

These guidelines indicate that phasing of a rate increase will only be
required where the party seeking such relief demonstrates the need for it with
specificity.
 
In balancing the
equities of the particular phasing request, the STB will consider factors
including the requirements of the railroads, the magnitude of the proposed
increase, the magnitude of past increases, the dependence of the utility on
coal, the economic conditions in the final destination market and the economic
conditions in the coal supply area.

The
phasing constraint has never been invoked by a complainant utility in a rate
case, and the STB has never applied it.
 

Therefore, it is unknown how the STB would balance the above factors,
whether it would find the phasing constraint applicable, and if it did, whether
phasing would be ordered retroactively or prospectively or both.
 
Additionally, Duke and CP&L have
appealed the October 2004 STB decision on reconsideration to the D.C. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
 
Although
management has made an estimate of the ultimate resolution of these cases, due
to these uncertainties, future developments in the Duke case and(or) the
CP&L case may result in adjustments that could have a favorable or
unfavorable material impact on results of operations in a particular quarter or
year.
 
Over the long term,
management believes the STB decisions in the Duke and CP&L proceedings will
help support improved pricing for coal transportation services.

Coal
carloads were flat in 2003 while revenues increased 4% versus 2002.
 
Revenue per unit increased 4%,
reflecting favorable developments in 2003 of the coal rate reasonableness
proceedings before the STB, as well as increases resulting from
more longer
 haul business and loading productivity
improvements that led to more tons per car.
 
Coal, coke and iron ore revenues
represented 23% of total railway operating revenues in 2003, and 86% of
NS’ coal shipments originated on lines it operates.

Utility
coal

volume
increased 3%, compared to 2003, as electricity production was up almost 2% in
NS’ service region responding to higher demand driven by a rebounding
U.S.
 economy.
 
Utilities increased burn to meet the
heavier electricity demand and a new rail unloading facility began operating in
April 2004 at a northern utility.
 

Utility coal stockpiles were below target levels across NS’
service area due in part to the increased demand for coal-fired electric
generation.
 
Increased demand for
Eastern U.S.
 coal prompted some
customers to ship coals from non-traditional coal fields in
Wyoming
 and
Colorado
 in addition to more
imported coal.
 
In response, Appalachian
coal production increased slightly in 2004 following declines in 2003 and 2002.

For
2003, utility coal volume increased 1%, compared to 2002, primarily due to a 6%
gain in tonnage moving to the Northeast.
 

These gains were led by a full year’s operation of two projects
completed in 2002 that captured traffic from truck and barge.
 
In the first quarter of 2003, higher
natural gas prices and colder temperatures caused coal-fired generating
stations to run near capacity in the Northeast, reducing the high stockpiles
that were carried forward from 2002.
 

However, the mild temperatures through the remainder of the year
diminished seasonal demand for coal.
 

Volumes to utilities in the South decreased 4% due to milder weather and
extended power plant outages for the installation of environmental
emission-control technology.

The
outlook for utility coal remains positive.
 

The continued growth in demand for electricity and lower-than-targeted
coal stockpiles at the utilities should support increased coal carloads in
2005.
 
Domestic western origin and
imported coals are expected to continue to be an important source of additional
coal supply to overcome the supply imbalance created by increased utility
demand and the supply constraints of traditional coal sources.
 
Natural gas prices are expected to
remain higher and more volatile than coal energy prices.
 
As always, demand will be influenced by
the weather.

A
number of evolving environmental issues remain that
have

the potential to affect the utility coal market, depending upon their
outcome.
 
These include a national
energy policy, proposed multi-emissions legislation, mercury emissions
standards, new source review and ongoing efforts at addressing climate change.
 
Certain utilities have chosen to add
emissions control technologies to their electric generating units in advance of
governmental requirements and are advancing their plans to more fully utilize
their existing coal-fired power plants.

Export coal

volume increased 35% in
2004, compared to 2003, due to sustained strong global demand for high quality
metallurgical coal and
China
’s continued growing
consumption of coal for steel production and electricity generation.
 
The devaluation of the dollar resulted
in lower
U.S.
 coal prices relative to
Australian and Canadian coal prices which made
U.S.
 coals more economical in
traditional European markets.
 
In
addition, ocean vessel rates continued to favor
U.S.
 coals.
 
Volume through
Baltimore
 and
Norfolk
 increased
dramatically.
 
Baltimore
 was up approximately 24,000 carloads,
or

K20

159%,
 and
Norfolk
 was up approximately 16,000
carloads, or 16%.
 
However,
U.S.
 exports in 2004 were
constrained by the tight coal supply from Eastern coal mines.

Export coal
 volume increased 7% in 2003, compared to 2002.
 
Export coal through
Norfolk
, primarily metallurgical
coal, increased by 24% in 2003, benefiting from a decline in exports from
China
..
 
Strong steel production in
China
 shifted Chinese exports of
metallurgical coal to its own domestic consumption.
 
Also, ocean freight rates were at an all
time high.
 
Spot vessel rates from
Australia
 to
Europe
 more than tripled, while
transatlantic rates increased less dramatically.
 
The combination of the gap in ocean
freight rates and the shorter sailing times gave the
U.S.
 a competitive advantage in
European markets.
 
Lastly, the
decline in the value of the dollar against the Euro and Australian Dollar also
increased demand for
U.S.
 metallurgical coal
abroad.
 
Coal exported through
Baltimore
, primarily steam coal,
declined 41% due to strong domestic demand for utility coal.

Export
coal volume for 2005 is expected to continue to show improvement with strong
international demand for metallurgical coal, in addition to a weaker dollar and
higher shipping costs making
U.S.
 coal more competitive.

Domestic
metallurgical

coal, coke and iron ore volume was flat in 2004, when compared
with 2003.
 
Metallurgical coal
volume was up 12%.
 
However, this
was offset by declines in domestic coke and iron ore volumes, principally due
to reduced production at an NS-served producer.

Domestic
metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore volumes decreased 6% in 2003, when
compared to 2002, due to the temporary closing of a large mine that produced
low-volatile coal, the continuing consolidation of the steel industry, and
fewer blast furnaces operating than in the past.

Demand
for domestic metallurgical coal, coke and iron ore is expected to improve in
2005.
 
Blast furnaces are expected
to run near capacity as domestic demand for metallurgical coal continues to
grow.

Other
coal

volumes increased 2% versus 2003, primarily due to new business and the
recovery of the
U.S.
 economy.
 
In 2003, steam coal shipped to
manufacturing plants finished the year down 2% when compared to 2002.

GENERAL
MERCHANDISE

traffic volume increased 4% in 2004 compared to 2003, and revenues increased
9%, principally due to improved volumes in all but the automotive business
group, higher average revenues across all business groups and increased fuel
surcharges.
 
In 2003, general
merchandise traffic volume increased 1% compared to 2002, and revenues
increased 2%, principally due to higher average revenues in most business
groups and higher agriculture traffic volume.

Automotive

traffic volume decreased 2%
in 2004 compared to 2003, primarily due to reduced automotive production at
Ford and GM, partially offset by increased production at
Toyota
 and Honda.
 
In contrast, revenues increased 2%,
reflecting pricing improvements and fuel surcharge increases.

In
2003, automotive traffic volume and revenues decreased 3% compared to 2002,
principally due to reduced vehicle production.

For
2005, automotive revenues are expected to increase, supported by a projected 2%
rise in light vehicle production and volume from two plants that opened late in
2004.

Chemicals

traffic volume increased 5%
and revenues increased 12% in 2004, compared with 2003, reflecting
manufacturers’ increased demand across all chemical business groups.
 
Feedstocks
 and
plastic shipments were up as inventories were restocked in anticipation of
higher product prices related to

K21

increased
 natural gas costs and new propane and asphalt terminals in the
Southeast added carloads.
 
Revenue
per unit reflected higher prices to meet market conditions and fuel surcharges.

Chemicals
traffic volume increased 1% and revenue increased 2% in 2003 compared to
2002.
 
Traffic volume benefited from
higher shipments of industrial intermediates, petroleum and environmental
products, and plastics.
 
Also
contributing to 2003 growth, approximately 2,000 annual carloads of new traffic
were diverted from the waterways and highways.
 
Revenue per unit reflected improved
pricing to meet market conditions, as well as favorable changes in mix.

Chemical
volume is expected to grow in 2005, with several propane and plastic plant
expansions planned and the continued strengthening of the economy.
 
However, volume could be adversely
affected by the price of natural gas and crude oil, which accounts for more
than 50% of the cost of most chemical products and presents a significant
competitive challenge that could cause domestic chemical producers to move
production overseas.

Metals
and construction

traffic volume increased 10% and revenue increased 17% in 2004
compared with 2003.
 
The
improvement was primarily due to increased production at NS-served
integrated mills and mini-mills, the conversion of truck business to rail
resulting from a shortage of flatbed trucks as well as higher scrap

metal volumes resulting from expanded alliances with key scrap metal shippers and
access to new scrap processors and steel mills.
 
Construction traffic volume benefited
from increased residential, commercial and highway construction.

In
2003, metals and construction traffic volume decreased 1%, but revenues
increased 1% compared with 2002.
 

The decline in volume resulted from reduced metals volume (mostly iron
and steel), offset in part by higher construction traffic.
 
Revenue per unit improved 2%, reflecting
favorable pricing and traffic mix changes.

The
outlook for 2005 remains strong for iron and steel markets with new import slab
business and growth in plate, structural, bar/rod and steel rail for both
integrated mills and mini-mills.
 

Construction traffic volume is expected to reflect continued strength in
residential and commercial construction.

Agriculture,
consumer products and government

traffic volume increased 2% and revenue increased
6% in 2004 compared with 2003, driven by ethanol and fertilizer shipments.
 
Ethanol traffic increased 59% primarily
due to the opening of the Northeast market to ethanol as a gasoline
additive.
 
Fertilizer was up 7%
year-over-year
, reflecting higher domestic shipments to
industrial customers and increased exports of phosphates, principally to
China
..
 
Revenue per unit improved 3% as a result
of changes in traffic mix such as increased ethanol traffic and more long
haul
 feed shipments as well as higher prices.

In
2003, agriculture, consumer products and government traffic volume increased 7%
and revenues increased 8% compared with 2002.
 
Commodities contributing most to these
increases were corn, fertilizer, military, sweeteners and wheat.
 
Only feed, food products and beverages
showed a slight decrease.
 
Corn
shipments increased 4% in 2003 and revenue was up 8%.
 
Due to the drought of 2002, which caused
a depletion of inventories, there was a significant increase in demand for corn
to Southeast feed mill customers and poultry producers in eastern
Pennsylvania
,
Maryland
, and
Delaware
, resulting in long haul
rail movements from
Midwest
 suppliers to these areas.
 

Higher fertilizer traffic resulted from the re-opening of a large
phosphate fertilizer plant.
 

Shipments of military vehicles and military equipment increased 36% over
2002 levels due to the war in
Iraq
..

Agriculture,
consumer products and government volume is expected to be higher in 2005,
benefiting from the record grain crop in 2004, expanding markets for ethanol
and improving feed mill business.

K22

Paper,
clay and forest products

traffic volume increased 1% and revenue increased 8% in 2004 compared
with 2003, reflecting yield improvements in all segments except newsprint,
together with higher printing paper, newsprint, pulp board and kaolin shipments
as U.S. paper production and demand for paper products strengthened in 2004.
 
Revenue per unit improved 6% principally
as a result of price increases but also aided by increased fuel surcharges.

In
2003, paper, clay and forest products traffic increased 1% and revenues
increased 5% compared to 2002, principally due to improved domestic demand for
paper products.
 
Paper traffic
benefited from increased domestic orders for consumer products packaging and
from the advertising sector, as well as new business.
 
Newsprint shipments continued to remain
soft, largely due to a prolonged decline in demand.
 
Woodchip volume increased significantly
as NS-served paper mills experienced shortages and were forced to source wood
fiber from more distant suppliers due to wet weather in the Southeast.
 
NS clay revenue was up compared to 2002
due to a strong increase in revenue per carload and a more positive mix as NS
handled more long-haul domestic traffic.
 

Lumber business was soft in early 2003 despite strong demand due in part
to wet weather and several mill closures.
 

Lumber business was up in the fourth quarter as weather in the Southeast
and commodity prices improved.

In
2005, paper, clay and forest product revenues are expected to grow modestly
with the addition of several new lumber distribution centers on NS lines.

INTERMODAL

volume increased 17% and
revenue increased 24% in 2004 compared with 2003.
 
Strong demand was driven by an expanding
economy led by higher consumer spending, industrial production and
international trade, in addition to constraints in truck and other railroads’
capacity.
 
International steamship
volume was up 15%, tied to the growth in
U.S.
 trade volumes through east
and west coast ports.
 
Truckload
volume increased 28% as a result of new business with traditional truckload
companies.
 
Premium business, which
includes parcel and LTL carriers, grew 15% principally due to new parcel
service between
Chicago
 and
New Jersey
..
 
Triple Crown Services Company increased
volume by 8% through an expanded trailer fleet and growth in its geographic
coverage.
 
Revenue per unit improved
6%, reflecting value-based pricing and fuel surcharges.

In
2003,
intermodal
 volume increased 5% and revenues
increased 5% compared to 2002.
 

Volume growth was driven by improved service performance that enabled
the conversion of truck business to rail.
 

Shipments for asset-based truckload carriers increased 14% as these
trucking companies used
intermodal
 to reduce their
exposure to driver shortages and the need for larger fleets.
 
International volume, which represents
45% of
intermodal’s
 volume, grew 9%, primarily
a result of strong import trade and new business driven by enhanced
service.
 
Triple Crown Services
Company’s growth was limited to 1% in 2003, hampered by a fleet at full
capacity.

In
2005,
intermodal
 revenues are expected to grow with
higher levels of truck to rail conversions as prices for motor carrier
services continue to increase as a result of continuing driver and equipment
shortages and high fuel prices.
 
NS
expects to build new terminals in
Ohio
,
Kentucky
,
Virginia
 and
Pennsylvania
 in addition to expanding
existing
intermodal
 terminals.
 
Strong international trade is expected
to create growth opportunities in NS’ international business segment
and available capacity should help grow NS’ domestic and premium segments.
 
Future growth may, however, be tempered
by operating improvements at other railroads, as well as constraints in
the drayage market.

Railway
Operating Expenses

Railway
operating expenses increased 4% in 2004 compared to 2003 and 6% in 2003
compared to 2002.
 
Expenses in 2003
included $107 million of costs related to a voluntary separation program to
reduce the size of the work force, while there was no such program in either
2004 or 2002.
 
Accordingly, the
absence

K23

of

the voluntary separation program in 2004 and 2002 resulted in a 2% reduction in
the 2004 to 2003 year-over-year comparison and a 2% increase in the 2003 to
2002 year-over-year comparison.
 

Carloads rose 9% in 2004 compared to 2003 and 2% in 2003 compared to
2002.

The
railway operating ratio, which measures the percentage of railway operating
revenues consumed by railway operating expenses, was 76.7% in 2004, compared
with 83.5% in 2003 and 81.5% in 2002.
 

The voluntary separation costs added 1.6 percentage points to the 2003
ratio.

The
following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by
major classifications.

Compensation
and benefits

represented 40% of total railway operating expenses and was flat in 2004
compared to 2003, but increased 13% in 2003 compared to 2002.
 
Both comparisons reflect the $107
million costs of the voluntary separation program in 2003.
 
Expenses in 2004 reflected higher
volume-related train and engine payroll expenses, up $39 million; higher wage
rates, which added $37 million; increased stock-based compensation, up
$24 million; and higher management and locomotive engineer performance-based
incentive compensation, which was up $20 million.
 
These increases were offset by lower
nonagreement
 workforce levels, saving $24 million, as well
as the absence of the $107 million expense of the 2003 voluntary separation
program.

In
the third quarter of 2005, NS will adopt Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123 (revised), which requires expensing of stock options.
 
See New Accounting Pronouncements
(below) and Note 1.

Almost
half of the increase in 2003 was the result of the voluntary separation
program.
 
The remainder was
principally due to higher wage rates (including the BLE bonus in lieu of wage
increases), which added $45 million, increased health and welfare benefits
costs, which were up $44 million, and reduced pension income, down
$34 million (see Note 11).
 

Approximately $25 million of the increase in health and welfare
benefit costs was attributable to retirees, reflecting a higher estimated
medical inflation rate.

The
Railroad Retirement and Survivors’ Improvement Act, which took effect
Jan. 1, 2002, allows for investment of Tier II assets in a diversified
portfolio through the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust.
 
The law also provides a mechanism for
automatic adjustment of Tier II payroll taxes should the trust assets fall
below a four-year reserve or exceed a six-year reserve.
 
As a result, the employers’
portion

K24

of

Tier II retirement payroll taxes have been reduced from 14.2% in 2003 to 13.1%
in 2004 and 12.6% in 2005 and thereafter.
  
However, these savings are
expected to continue to be substantially offset by higher payroll taxes on
increased wages and a higher wage base.

Materials,
services and rents

includes items used for the maintenance of railroad lines, structures
and equipment; the costs of services purchased from outside contractors,
including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other
railroads; and the net cost of equipment rentals.
 
This category of expenses increased 12%
in 2004 compared to 2003 and decreased 2% in 2003 compared to 2002.

The
2004 increase was the result of higher purchased services, up $100 million,
including higher costs for volume-related
intermodal

services such as loading of containers and trailers and drayage.
 
In addition, locomotive and freight car
maintenance expenses
rose
 $23 million, and equipment
rents increased $33 million.
 
The
2003 decline reflected lower equipment rents, down $26 million, and reduced
purchased services, down $20 million, including lower expenses for
intermodal
, automotive and bulk transfer services, and
professional and legal fees.

Equipment rents, which includes
 the cost to NS of using equipment (mostly
freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners, less the rent paid to
NS for the use of its equipment, increased 9% in 2004 and decreased 7% in 2003
compared to 2002.
 
The increase in
2004 was principally due to increased volume-related
intermodal

shipments and the absence of favorable settlements that benefited 2003.
 
The decline in 2003 was principally
the result of lower automotive traffic volume in addition to adjustments
relating to periodic studies of equipment rents and favorable settlements of
recent bills.
 
In addition, the
change in accounting related to certain leased locomotives (see Note 1) also
reduced equipment rents.

Locomotive
repair costs increased in 2004 and 2003, due to more maintenance activity
related to the increase in business coupled with the age of the fleet.
 
Locomotive and freight car maintenance
costs are expected to increase further in 2005.

Conrail
rents and services

decreased 24% in 2004 compared to 2003 and increased 2% in 2003
compared to 2002. This item includes amounts due to CRC for operation of the
Shared Assets Areas (see Note 2).
  

Prior to the Conrail Corporate Reorganization, this category also
included amounts due to PRR for use of its operating properties and equipment
as well as NS’ equity in Conrail’s net earnings, and the additional
amortization related to the difference between NS’ investment in Conrail and
its underlying equity (see Note 2).
 

The decline was primarily driven by the Conrail Corporate
Reorganization, which resulted in the consolidated reporting of individual
components of Conrail equity
earnings,
 principally
depreciation, equipment rents and interest expense (see Note 2).
 
NS’ share of equity earnings
post-Conrail Corporate Reorganization is now shown within “Other
income-net.”
 
The increase in
2003 reflects lower Conrail earnings and higher expenses in the Shared Assets
Areas.

Depreciation

expense increased 17% in
2004 compared to 2003 and decreased slightly in 2003 compared to
2002.
 
The increase in 2004 was
primarily a result of the Conrail Corporate Reorganization (see Note 2).
 
In addition, substantial levels of
capital spending affected all years; however, depreciation expense in 2003
benefited from a change in accounting for the cost to remove crossties (see
Note 1, “Properties,” for NS' depreciation policy).

In
2004, NS received the results of a depreciation study from an independent firm
of engineers.
 
The results of the
study, which were implemented in September 2004, prospectively reduced
depreciation expense by approximately $17 million annually.

K25

Diesel
fuel

expenses increased 18% in 2004 compared with 2003 and 11% in 2003 compared to
2002.
 
The increase in 2004 reflects
a 13% increase in the average price per gallon (which includes hedge benefits)
and a 6% increase in consumption.
 

The increase in 2003 reflects an 11% rise in the average price per
gallon including hedge benefits and essentially flat consumption.
 
Expenses in 2004 included a benefit of
$140 million compared with benefits of $59 million in 2003 and $10 million in
2002 from the diesel fuel hedging program (see “Market Risks and Hedging
Activities,” below and Note 16).
 

NS has hedged approximately 36% of expected 2005 diesel fuel
requirements as of
December 31, 2004
, at an average price of 83
cents per gallon.
 
No new hedges
have been entered into since May 2004.
 

Accordingly, if diesel fuel prices remain at their current levels, or
increase further, diesel fuel expense will be higher going forward.

Recently
enacted legislation will repeal the 4.3 cents per gallon excise tax on railroad
diesel fuel and inland waterway fuel by 2007, with the following phased reductions
in 2005 and 2006: by 1 cent per gallon from Jan. 1, 2005 through June 30, 2005;
2 cents per gallon from July 1, 2005 through Dec. 31, 2006; and by the full 4.3
cents thereafter.
 
NS consumes
approximately 500 million gallons of diesel fuel per year.

Casualties
and other claims

expenses (including the estimates of costs related to personal injury,
property damage and environmental matters) decreased 17% in 2004 compared to
2003 and increased 6% in 2003 compared to 2002.
 
The decline reflected favorable personal
injury and freight claims development and higher insurance settlements,
partially offset by increased derailment expenses.
 
The higher expense in 2003 was due to
adverse personal injury claims development and derailments expense as well as
higher insurance costs.

On
Jan. 6, 2005
, a derailment occurred in
Graniteville
,
SC.
 
NS
expects the first quarter of 2005 to reflect operating expenses related to this
incident of between $30 million and $40 million (pretax).
 
The amount includes NS’ self-insured
retention under its insurance policies, as well as other uninsured costs.
 
Although potential losses may exceed
self-insured retention amounts, NS expects at this time that insurance coverage
is adequate to cover such potential claims or settlements.
 
This amount does not include any fines
or penalties that could be imposed.

The
largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury
costs.
 
In 2004, cases involving
occupational injuries comprised about one-third of total employee injury cases
resolved and 24% of the total payments made.
 
With its long-established commitment to
safety, NS continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to
reduce the associated costs.
 
With
respect to occupational injuries, which are not caused by a specific accident
or event, but result from a claimed exposure over time, the benefits of any
existing safety initiatives may not be realized immediately.
 
These types of claims are being asserted
by former or retired employees, some of which have not been actively employed
in the rail industry for decades.

The
rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job-related
accidental injury and occupational claims because of the Federal Employers'
Liability Act (FELA), which is applicable only to railroads.
 
FELA’s

fault-based system, which covers employee claims for job-related injuries,
produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a
no-fault workers' compensation system.

NS
maintains substantial amounts of commercial insurance for potential third-party
liability and property damage claims.
 

It also retains reasonable levels of risk through self-insurance (see
Note 18).
 
NS expects insurance
costs to be higher in 2005.

Other
expenses

increased 5% in 2004 compared to 2003 and 8% in 2003 compared to 2002.
 
The increase in 2004 reflected higher
property and sales and use taxes.
 

The increase in 2003 was primarily

K26

attributable
 to higher state franchise and sales and use taxes, the absence of a
favorable bad debt settlement that benefited 2002 and higher union employee
travel expenses.

Other
income – net

was $89 million in 2004, $19 million in 2003 and $66 million in 2002
(see Note 3).
 
The increase in
2004 reflected the absence of the $84 million telecommunications assets
impairment charge that burdened 2003 (see Note 6) and the gain in 2004
recognized on the Conrail Corporate Reorganization (see Note 2) that
combined to more than offset losses generated by an investment in a limited liability
company that owns and operates facilities that produce synthetic fuel from coal
(see the discussion of tax credit investments below).
 
The decline in 2003 was primarily due to
the $84 million charge that offset increased gains from the sale of properties,
higher corporate-owned life insurance returns and lower interest accruals
related to tax liabilities.

In
June 2004, NS purchased a membership interest in a limited liability company
that owns and operates facilities that produce synthetic fuel from coal.
 
The production of synthetic fuel results
in expenses related to the investments as well as tax credits.
 
The expenses are recorded as a component
of “Other income – net,” and the tax credits, as well as tax
benefits related to the expenses, are reflected in the provision for income
taxes.
 
The synthetic fuel tax
credits are subject to reduction if the average price of oil for a year exceeds
a certain amount under the tax laws.
 

Given current market conditions, it is possible that these tax credits
could be reduced in 2005.
 
Such a
reduction in tax credits would be accompanied by a reduction in the expense
related to the investment, although the net effect would be to reduce the
projected return on the investment.

Income
Taxes

Income
tax expense in 2004 was $379 million for an effective rate of 29%, compared
with effective rates of 30% in 2003 and 35% in 2002.
 
Excluding NS’ equity in Conrail’s
after-tax earnings and the gain on the Conrail Corporate Reorganization, the
effective rate was 31% in 2004, 33% in 2003 and 38% in 2002.

In
2004, the effective rate was reduced by tax credits from synthetic fuel related
investments and the favorable resolution of an IRS audit of a synthetic fuel
related investment (see Note 4).
 
In
2003, the effective rate was reduced by the favorable resolution of prior
years’ tax audits.
 
The
effective rates in all three years benefited from favorable adjustments upon
filing the prior year tax returns and favorable adjustments to state tax
liabilities.

For
the last four years, 30% and 50% bonus depreciation has been allowed for
federal income tax purposes.
 
After
2004, bonus depreciation will not be available.
 
In addition, the Conrail Corporate
Reorganization resulted in NS receiving assets with less future tax
depreciation than book depreciation.
 

As a result, current taxes have been lower in prior years than might be
expected in future years.

NS
has interests in synthetic fuel related investments that result in tax
credits.
 
These synthetic fuel tax
credits expire at the end of 2007.
 

In addition, synthetic fuel tax credits are subject to reduction if the
average price of oil for a year exceeds a certain amount under the tax
laws.
 
Given current market
conditions, it is possible that these tax credits could be reduced in 2005.

Discontinued
Operations

In
2003, income from discontinued operations consisted of a $10 million after-tax
gain related to the resolution of tax issues arising from the sale of NS’
motor carrier subsidiary.

FINANCIAL
CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash
provided by operating activities,

NS' principal source of liquidity, was $1,661
million in 2004,
compared
 with $1,054 million in 2003
and $803 million in 2002.
 
The
improvement in 2004 was primarily due to increased railway operating income.
 
In 2003, the increase reflected a
smaller change in the amount of accounts receivables sold; declines in
receivables sold amounted to $30 million in 2003 and $270 million in 2002 (see
Note 5).

Prior
to the Conrail Corporate Reorganization, a significant portion of payments made
to PRR (which were included in “Conrail Rents and Services” and,
therefore, were a use of cash in “Cash provided by operating
activities”) was borrowed back from a PRR subsidiary under a note due in 2032,
and, therefore, was a source of cash in “Proceeds from
borrowings.”
 
Amounts
outstanding under this note comprised the long-term balance of “Due to
Conrail”, and this note was effectively extinguished by the Conrail
Corporate Reorganization.
 

Subsequent to the Conrail Corporate Reorganization, payments under
“Conrail rents and services” have declined, depreciation charges
have increased, and the net borrowings have been terminated.
 
Accordingly, NS’ cash provided by
operating activities after the Conrail Corporate Reorganization has
increased.
 
NS' net cash flow from
these borrowings amounted to $118 million in 2004, $203 million in 2003 and
$212 million in 2002.

NS'
working capital deficit was $234 million at
Dec.
 31, 2004
, compared with $376 million at
Dec. 31,
..
 
The improvement was principally due to
an increase in cash flow from operations.

NS
expects that cash on hand combined with cash flow from operations will be
sufficient to meet its ongoing obligations including the higher level of debt
maturing in 2005.
 
This expectation
is based on a view that the economy will continue at a moderate growth rate
through 2005.

Contractual
obligations

at Dec. 31, 2004, related to NS' long-term debt (including capital leases) (see
Note 8), operating leases (see Note 9), agreements with CRC (see Note 2),
unconditional purchase obligations (see Note 18) and other long-term
obligations (see Note 18), are as follows:

does not expect to sell any accounts receivable in 2005.

Higher
capital expenditures in 2004 were primarily due to increased locomotive
purchases and investment in roadway projects in addition to Triple Crown
Services Company equipment and freight cars.
 
The increase in 2003 reflects higher
locomotive purchases offset, in part, by lower spending on signal and
electrical projects and computers.

NS
and six other railroads (five Class I railroads and a commuter railroad) have
agreed to participate in the Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation
Efficiency (CREATE) project in
Chicago
..
 
The intent of the proposed public-private
partnership is to reduce rail and highway congestion and add freight and
passenger capacity in the metropolitan
Chicago
 area.
 
The project is estimated to cost $1.5
billion with city, state and federal support.
 
The railroads’ financial
contribution to the project is contingent upon a binding commitment that
establishes the availability, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
railroads, of all required public funding and of third-party properties
necessary to complete the entire project.
 

If public funding is secured, the railroads will contribute a
total of $232 million towards the project with NS’ share slated to
be $34 million over an estimated six‑year period.

Through
its coal car
rebody
 program, which was suspended in
2000, NS converted about 29,000 hopper cars into high-capacity steel gondolas
or hoppers.
 
As a result, the
remaining service life of the freight-car fleet is greater than may be inferred
from the increasing average age shown in the table above.

K29

For
2005, NS has budgeted $938 million for capital expenditures.
 
The anticipated spending includes $671
million for roadway projects, of which $438 million is for track and bridge
program work.
 
Also included are
projects for communications, signal and electrical systems, as well as projects
for environmental and public improvements such as grade crossing separations
and signal upgrades.
 
Other roadway
projects include marketing and industrial development initiatives, including
increasing track capacity and access to coal receivers and vehicle production
and distribution facilities, and continuing investments in
intermodal

infrastructure.
 
Equipment spending
of $225 million includes the purchase of 52 locomotives and upgrades to
existing units, improvements to multilevel automobile racks, and projects
related to computers and information technology, including additional security
and backup systems.

Cash
used for financing activities

was $233 million in 2004, $314 million in 2003 and
$150 million in 2002.
 
The change in
2004 reflected more proceeds from common stock issued in connection with
employee option exercises as well as the elimination of PRR borrowings that
resulted from the Conrail Corporate Reorganization.
 
The increase in 2003 primarily resulted
from a higher net reduction in debt and the $43 million redemption in 2003 of
all publicly held shares of Norfolk Southern Railway’s preferred
stock.
 
Prior to the Conrail
Corporate Reorganization financing activities included loan transactions with a
subsidiary of PRR that were net borrowings of $118 million in 2004, $203
million in 2003 and $212 million in 2002 (see Note 2).
 
Debt was reduced $371 million in 2004,
compared with a decrease of $370 million in 2003 and $303 million in 2002.
 
NS’ debt-to-total capitalization
ratio at year end was 48.5% in 2004 and 50.7% (excluding notes payable to the
PRR subsidiary) in 2003.

NS
currently has in place and available a $1 billion, five-year credit agreement,
which provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes financial
covenants.
 
Additionally, NS has the
ability to issue up to $1 billion of registered debt or equity securities under
its shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which was filed in September 2004
(see Note 8).

APPLICATION
OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with
U.S.
 generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
 
These estimates and assumptions may
require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, and
future events are likely to occur that may require management to change
them.
 
Accordingly, management
regularly reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical
experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that
management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
 
Management discusses the development,
selection and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the
Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.

Pensions
and Other Postretirement Benefits

Accounting
for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires management to make
several estimates and assumptions (see Note 11).
 
These include the expected rate of
return from investment of the plans' assets, projected increases in medical
costs and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected
earnings and mortality.
 
In
addition, the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate
environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present
value.
 
Management makes these
estimates based on the company's historical experience and other information
that it deems pertinent under the circumstances (for example, expectations of
future stock market

K30

performance
).
 
Management engages an
independent consulting actuarial firm to aid it in selecting appropriate
assumptions and valuing its related liabilities.

NS'
net pension benefit, which is included in “Compensation and
benefits” on its Consolidated Income Statement, was $36 million for the
year ended
Dec. 31, 2004
..
 
In recording this amount, NS assumed a
long-term investment rate of return of 9%.
 

Investment experience of the pension fund over the past 10-, 15- and
20-year periods has been in excess of 10%.
 

A one percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would
result in
a
 $18 million change to the pension credit
and, as a result, an equal change in “Compensation and benefits”
expense.
 
Changes that are
reasonably likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age, projected
earnings and mortality would not be expected to have a material effect on NS'
net pension benefit or net pension asset in the future.
 
The net pension asset is recorded at its
net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current interest
rate environment; therefore, management has little discretion in this
assumption.

NS'
net cost for other postretirement benefits, which is also included in
“Compensation and benefits,” was $49 million for the year ended
Dec. 31, 2004
..
 
In
recording this expense and valuing the net liability for other postretirement
benefits, which is included in “Other benefits” as disclosed in
Note 11, management estimated future increases in health-care costs.
 
These assumptions, along with the effect
of a one percentage point change in them, are described in Note 11.

Properties
and Depreciation

Most
of NS' total assets are comprised of long-lived railway properties (see Note
6).
 
As disclosed in Note 1,
NS' properties are depreciated using group depreciation.
 
Rail is depreciated primarily on the
basis of use measured by gross-ton miles.
 

Other properties are depreciated generally using the straight-line
method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives.
 
NS reviews the carrying amount of properties
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount
may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flows.
 
Assets that are deemed impaired as a
result of such review are recorded at the lesser of carrying amount or fair
value.

NS'
depreciation expense is based on management's assumptions concerning service
lives of its properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be
received upon their retirement.
 

These assumptions are the product of periodic depreciation studies that
are performed by a firm of consulting engineers.
 
These studies analyze NS' historical
patterns of asset use and retirement and take into account any expected change
in operation or maintenance practices.
 

NS' recent experience with these studies has been that while they do
result in changes in the rates used to depreciate its
properties,

these changes have not caused a significant effect to its annual depreciation
expense.
 
The studies may also
indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or
in excess) of the amount indicated by the study.
 
Any such deficiency (or excess) is
amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service
lives of the affected class of property.
 

NS' “Depreciation expense” for the year ended
Dec. 31, 2004
, amounted to $598 million.
 
NS' weighted-average depreciation rates
for 2004 are disclosed in Note 6; a one-tenth percentage point increase (or
decrease) in these rates would have resulted in a $27 million increase (or
decrease) to NS' depreciation expense.

Personal
Injury, Environmental and Legal Liabilities

NS'
expense for “Casualties and other claims” amounted to $151 million
for the year ended
Dec. 31, 2004
..
 
Most of this expense was composed of NS'
accrual related to personal injury liabilities (see discussion of FELA in the
discussion captioned “Casualties and other claims” above).
 
Job-related personal injury and
occupational claims are subject to FELA, which is applicable only to
railroads.
 
FELA’s

fault-based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and
inconsistent as compared with

K31

a

no-fault worker’s compensation system.
 
The variability inherent in this system
could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded.
 
In all cases, NS records a liability
when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and estimable.

NS
engages an independent consulting actuarial firm to aid in valuing its personal
injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during the year.
 
For employee personal injury cases, the
actuarial firm studies NS' historical patterns of reserving for claims and
subsequent settlements, taking into account relevant outside influences.
 
An estimate of the ultimate amount of
the liability, which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted claims, is
based on the results of this analysis.
 

For occupational injury claims, the actuarial firm studies NS’
history of claim filings, severity, payments and other relevant facts.
 
Additionally, the estimate of the
ultimate loss for occupational injuries includes a provision for those claims
that have been incurred but not reported by projecting NS’ experience
into the future as far as can be reasonably determined.
 
NS has recorded this actuarially determined
liability.
 
The liability is
dependent upon many individual judgments made as to the specific case reserves
as well as the judgments of the consulting actuary and management in the
periodic studies.
 
Accordingly,
there could be significant changes in the liability, which NS would recognize
when such a change became known.
 

The most recent actuarial study was performed as of
Sept. 30, 2004
, and resulted in a slight decrease to NS' personal
injury liability during the fourth quarter.
 
While the liability recorded is
supported by the most recent study, it is reasonably possible that the
liability could be higher or lower.

NS
is subject to various jurisdictions' environmental laws and regulations.
 
It is NS' policy to record a liability
where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated
reasonably (see Note 18).
 

Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of
all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability
estimates.
 
NS also has established
an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and
interpret its environmental policy.

Operating
expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $11 million in 2004,
$9 million in 2003 and $15 million in 2002, and capital expenditures totaled
approximately $9 million in 2004 and in 
2003,

and $10 million in 2002.
 
Capital
expenditures in 2005 are expected to be comparable to those in 2004.

NS'
balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount
of $64 million at
Dec. 31, 2004
, and $25 million at
Dec. 31, 2003
 (of which $12 million was accounted for as a
current liability at
Dec. 31, 2004
, and $8 million at
Dec. 31, 2003
).
 
The
increase in the liability was the result of the Conrail Corporate
Reorganization and relates to sites on the former PRR properties.
 
At
Dec. 31,
,
the liability represented NS' estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation
costs based on available information at 210 identified locations.
 
On that date, 15 sites accounted
for $32 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be
material.
 
NS anticipates that much
of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be
paid out over a longer period.

At
some of the 210 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with
a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible
parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state
authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint
and several liability for cleanup costs.

With
respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or
comparable state authorities), estimates of NS' ultimate potential financial
exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are
necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently
available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup
technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full
extent of contamination and each potential participant's share of any estimated
loss

K32

(
and
 that participant's ability to bear it), and evolving
statutory and regulatory standards governing liability.
 
NS estimates its environmental
remediation liability on a site-by-site basis, using assumptions and judgments
that management deems appropriate for each site.
 
As a result, it is not practical to
quantitatively describe the effects of changes in these many assumptions and
judgments.
 
NS has consistently
applied its methodology of estimating its environmental liabilities.

The
risk of incurring environmental liability is inherent in the railroad
business.
 
Some of the commodities
in NS' traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, can
pose special risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to
minimize.
 
In addition, several NS
subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is
leased and operated by others, or held for sale.
 
Because environmental problems may exist
on these properties that are latent or undisclosed, there can be no assurance
that NS will not incur environmentally related liabilities or costs with
respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be
estimated reliably at this time.
 

Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and potentially other
unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to
time.
 
The resulting liabilities
could have a significant effect on financial condition, results of operations
or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

However,
based on its assessment of the facts and circumstances now known, management
believes that it has recorded the probable costs for dealing with
those environmental matters of which the Corporation is aware.
 
Further, management believes that it is
unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate,
will have a material adverse effect on NS' financial position, results of
operations or liquidity.

Norfolk
 Southern and certain
subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating
principally to railroad operations.
 

When management concludes that it is probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, it is
accrued through a charge to expenses.
 

While the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits
and claims is dependent on future developments, in management's opinion the
recorded liability, if any, is adequate to cover the future payment of such
liability and claims.
 
However, the
final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with
certainty, and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional
accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular
year or quarter.
 
Any adjustments to
recorded liabilities will be reflected in expenses in the periods in which such
adjustments are known.

Income
Taxes

NS'
net long-term deferred tax liability totaled $6,550 million at
Dec. 31, 2004
 (see Note 4).
 

This liability is estimated based on the expected future tax
consequences of items recognized in the financial statements.
 
After application of the federal
statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the
timing and deductibility of expenses in the corporate income tax returns.
 
For state income and other taxes,
judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various
jurisdictions.
 
A valuation
allowance is recorded if management expects that it is more likely than not
that
its
 deferred tax assets will not be
realized.
 
NS has a $21 million
valuation allowance on $668 million of deferred tax assets as of
Dec. 31, 2004
, reflecting the expectation that most of these
assets will be realized.
 
In
addition, NS has a recorded liability for its estimate of potential income tax
exposures.
 
Management believes this
liability for potential exposure to be adequate.
 
Income tax expense is adjusted to the
extent the final outcome of these matters differs from the amounts
recorded.
 
For every one half
percent change in the 2004 effective rate net income would have changed by $7
million.

K33

OTHER
MATTERS

Labor
Agreements

Approximately
24,000 of NS' railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining
agreements with various labor unions.  These agreements remain in effect
until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act.  NS largely bargains in
concert with other major railroads. Moratorium provisions in the labor
agreements govern when the railroads and the unions may propose labor agreement
changes.  Such proposals were made in late 1999 and, since that time, NS
has reached agreements with most of the major rail labor organizations to
settle that round of bargaining.  These agreements cover approximately 93%
of NS contract employees.  Tentative agreements subject to ratification
have also been reached with the National Conference of Firemen and
Oilers
 and the Sheet Metal Workers International
Association.
 
A 1999 bargaining
round agreement has not yet been reached with the International Association of
Machinists.  On or after
November 1, 2004
, the railroads and the
rail labor unions served new proposals to begin the next bargaining
round.  The outcome of the negotiations cannot be determined at this
point.

Market
Risks and Hedging Activities

NS
uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its
diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates.

In
2001, NS began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel
consumption.
 
The intent of the
program is to assist in the management of NS' aggregate risk exposure to fuel
price fluctuations, which can significantly affect NS' operating margins and
profitability, through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments.

Diesel
fuel costs represented 8% of NS' operating expenses for 2004.
 
The program provides that NS will not
enter into any fuel hedges with
a duration
 of more
than 36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS' average monthly fuel
consumption will be hedged for any month within any 36-month period.

As
of
Dec. 31, 2004
, through swap transactions,
NS has hedged approximately 36% of expected 2005 diesel fuel requirements.
 
The effect of these hedges is to yield
an average cost of 83 cents per hedged gallon, including federal taxes and
transportation.
 
A 10% decrease in
diesel fuel prices would reduce NS' asset related to the swaps by approximately
$24 million as of
Dec. 31, 2004
..

However,
with fuel prices near historic highs and fuel surcharges being collected under
certain tariffs and contracts, NS has not entered into additional hedges since
May 2004.
 
Consequently, the past
pattern of entering into regular monthly swaps may not be indicative of future
hedging activity.
 
If diesel fuel
prices remain at their current levels, or increase further, diesel fuel expense
will be higher going forward.

NS
manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both
fixed- and floating-rate debt instruments and by entering into interest-rate
hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio.

At
Dec. 31, 2004
, NS' debt subject to interest rate fluctuations
totaled $576 million.
 
A 1% increase
in interest rates would increase NS' total annual interest expense related to
all its variable debt by approximately $6 million.
 
Management considers it unlikely that
interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in
a material adverse effect on NS' financial position, results of operations or
liquidity.

K34

Some of NS' capital leases, which carry an average fixed rate of 7%,
were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate
swap agreements.
 
On
Dec. 31, 2004
, the average pay rate under these agreements was
3%, and the average receive rate was 7%.
 

During 2004, the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by
$6 million.
 
A portion of the lease
obligations is payable in Japanese yen.
 

NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each
lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen-denominated obligation.
 
Most of these deposits are held by
foreign banks, primarily Japanese.
 

As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to
Japan
..
 
Counterparties to the interest rate
swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions
believed by management to be creditworthy.

New
Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised),
Share-Based Payment.
 
This
statement, effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after
June 15, 2005
,
establishes standards for accounting for transactions in which an entity
exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, such as stock-based
compensation plans.
 
The statement
applies to all awards granted after the effective date and to awards modified,
repurchased, or cancelled after that date.
 

As the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods will depend
on the levels of future grants, the effect of adoption of this statement cannot
be predicted with certainty.
 

However, had NS adopted this statement in prior periods, the effect of
adoption on net income and earnings per share would have approximated the
amounts shown in the pro forma information included in Note 1.

Proposed
Legislation and Regulations on Safety and Transportation of Hazardous Materials

Legislation introduced in Congress in early 2005 would
give federal regulators increased authority to conduct investigations and levy
substantial fines and penalties in connection with railroad accidents.
 
Federal regulators would also be
required to prescribe new regulations governing railroads' transportation of
hazardous materials.
 
If enacted,
such legislation and regulations could impose significant additional costs on
railroads including NS.
 
In
addition, certain local governments have sought to enact ordinances banning, or
requiring disclosures with respect to, hazardous materials moving by rail
within their borders.
 
If
promulgated and upheld, such ordinances could require the re-routing of
hazardous materials shipments, with the potential for significant additional
costs and network inefficiencies.

Inflation

In
preparing financial statements,
U.S.
 generally accepted
accounting principles require the use of historical cost that disregards the
effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property.
 
NS, a capital-intensive company, has
most of its capital invested in such assets.
 
The replacement cost of these assets, as
well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than
the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost.

FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS

This
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations contains forward-looking statements that may be identified by the
use of words like “believe,” “expect,”
“anticipate” and “project.” Forward-looking statements
reflect management's good-faith evaluation of information currently
available.
 
However, such statements
are dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external
variables over which management has little or no control, including: domestic
and international economic conditions; the business environment in industries
that produce and

K35

consume
rail freight; competition and consolidation within the transportation industry;
fluctuation in prices of key materials, in particular diesel fuel; labor
difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages; legislative and regulatory
developments; changes in securities and capital markets; and natural events
such as severe weather, floods and earthquakes.
 
Forward-looking statements are not, and
should not be relied upon as, a guaranty of future performance or results.
 
Nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate
indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be
achieved.
 
As a result, actual
outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in
forward-looking statements.
 
NS
undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements.

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
Stockholders and Board of Directors

Norfolk
 Southern Corporation:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Norfolk Southern
Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December
 31, 2004
 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes
in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended
December 31, 2004
..
 
In connection with our audits of the
consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the financial statement
schedule as listed in Item 15(A
)2
..
 
These consolidated financial statements
and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of Norfolk Southern
Corporation’s management.
 
Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (
United States
).
 
Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.
 
An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
 
An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
 
We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Norfolk Southern
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.
 

Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein.

As
discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
January 1, 2003
, Norfolk Southern Corporation adopted Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 143,

Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations

, and Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Norfolk
Southern Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework,

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway

Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 28, 2005, expressed an
unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of, and the effective
operation of, internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
Stockholders and Board of Directors

Norfolk
 Southern Corporation:

We
have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Report of
Management, that Norfolk Southern Corporation maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework,

issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway

Commission (COSO).
 
Norfolk Southern
Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting.
 

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment
and an opinion on the effectiveness of Norfolk Southern Corporation’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (
United States
).
 
Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.
 
Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
 
We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with
U.S.
 generally accepted
accounting principles.
 
A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements.
 

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, management's assessment that Norfolk Southern Corporation
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework,

issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway

Commission (COSO).
 
Also, in our
opinion, Norfolk Southern Corporation maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework,

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway
 Commission (COSO).

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

The
following Notes are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

1.
 
Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

Description
of Business

Norfolk
Southern Corporation is a Virginia-based holding company engaged principally in
the rail transportation business, operating approximately 21,300 route miles
primarily in the East and
Midwest
..
 

These consolidated financial statements include Norfolk Southern
Corporation (
Norfolk
 Southern) and its
majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries (collectively, NS).
 
Norfolk
Southern's

major subsidiary is Norfolk Southern Railway Company (NSR).
 
All significant
intercompany

balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The
railroad transports raw materials, intermediate products and finished goods
classified in the following market groups (percent of total railway operating
revenues in 2004): coal (24%);
intermodal
 (21%);
automotive (13%); chemicals (12%); metals/construction (11%);
agriculture/consumer products/ government (10%); and paper/clay/forest products
(9%).
 
Ultimate points of origination
or destination for some of the freight (particularly coal bound for export and
intermodal
 containers) are outside the
United States
..
 
Approximately 85% of NS' railroad
employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 14 different
labor unions.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with
U.S.
 generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
 
Management reviews its estimates,
including those related to the recoverability and useful lives of assets, as
well as liabilities for litigation, environmental remediation, casualty claims,
income taxes, and pension and postretirement benefits.
 
Changes in facts and circumstances may
result in revised estimates.

Cash
Equivalents

“Cash
equivalents” are highly liquid investments purchased three months or less
from maturity.

Investments

Marketable
equity and debt securities are reported at amortized cost or fair value,
depending upon their classification as securities
“held-to-maturity,” “trading” or
“available-for-sale.”
 

Unrealized gains and losses for investments designated as
“available-for-sale,” net of taxes, are recognized in
“Accumulated other comprehensive loss.”

Investments
where NS has the ability to exercise significant influence over but does not
control the entity are accounted for using the equity method in accordance with
APB Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in
Common Stock.”

K46

Materials
and Supplies

“Materials
and supplies,” consisting mainly of fuel oil and items for maintenance of
property and equipment, are stated at the lower of average cost or market.
 
The cost of materials and supplies
expected to be used in capital additions or improvements is included in
“Properties.”

Properties

“Properties”
are stated principally at cost and are depreciated using group
depreciation.
 
Rail is depreciated
primarily on the basis of use measured by gross ton-miles.
 
Other properties are depreciated
generally using the straight-line method over the lesser of estimated service
or lease lives.
 
NS capitalizes
interest on major capital projects during the period of their
construction.
 
Expenditures,
including those on leased assets that extend an asset's useful life or increase
its utility, are capitalized.
 

Maintenance expense is recognized when repairs are performed.
 
When properties other than land and
nonrail
 assets are sold or retired in the ordinary course
of business, the cost of the assets, net of sale proceeds or salvage, is
charged to accumulated depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized through
income.
 
Gains and losses on
disposal of land and
nonrail
 assets are included in
“Other income - net” (see Note 3).

NS
reviews the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable
based on future undiscounted cash flows.
 

Assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded
at the lower of carrying amount or fair value (see Note 6).

Revenue
Recognition

Transportation
revenue is recognized proportionally as a shipment moves from origin to
destination.
 
Refunds are recorded
as a reduction to revenues based on management's best estimate of projected
liability.
 
Switching, demurrage and
other incidental service revenue
is
 recognized when
the services are performed.

Derivatives

NS
does not engage in the trading of derivatives.
 
NS uses derivative financial instruments
to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and in the management
of its mix of fixed and floating-rate debt.
 
Management has determined that these
derivative instruments qualify as either fair-value or cash-flow hedges, having
values that highly correlate with the underlying hedged exposures and have
designated such instruments as hedging transactions.
 
Income and expense related to the
derivative financial instruments are recorded in the same category as generated
by the underlying asset or liability.
 

Credit risk related to the derivative financial instruments is considered
to be minimal and is managed by requiring high credit standards for
counterparties and periodic settlements (see Note 16).

Stock-Based
Compensation

NS
has stock-based employee compensation plans, which are more fully described in
Note 12.
 
NS applies the intrinsic
value recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (APB Opinion No. 25),
and related interpretations in accounting for these plans.

K47

The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if
NS had applied the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” (SFAS No. 123), to stock-based employee compensation:

effective Jan. 1, 2003, and recorded a $110 million net adjustment ($182
million before taxes) for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting on
years prior to 2003.
 
Pursuant to
SFAS No. 143, the cost to remove crossties must be recorded as an expense when
incurred; previously these removal costs were accrued as a component of
depreciation.
 
This change in
accounting lowered depreciation expense (because the depreciation rate for
crossties no longer reflects cost to remove) and increased compensation and
benefits and other expenses (for the costs to remove retired assets).
  
The net effect to total railway
operating expenses and net income was not material.

NS
also adopted
FASB
 Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities,” (FIN No. 46) effective Jan. 1, 2003, and recorded a $4

this change in accounting on years prior to 2003.
 
Pursuant to FIN No. 46, NS has
consolidated a special-purpose entity that leases certain locomotives to NS
(see Note 9).
 
This
entity’s assets and liabilities at
Jan. 1, 2003
, included $169 million of
locomotives and $157 million of debt related to their purchase as well as a $6
million minority interest liability.
 
This
change in accounting increased depreciation and interest expense (to reflect
the locomotives as owned assets) and lowered lease expense.
 
The net effect to total railway
operating expenses and net income was not material.

The
cumulative effect of these changes amounted to $114 million, or 29 cents per
share.

Investment in Conrail and Operations
Over
 Its Lines

Overview

Through a limited
liability company,
Norfolk
 Southern and CSX
Corporation (CSX) jointly own Conrail Inc. (Conrail), whose primary subsidiary
is Consolidated Rail Corporation (CRC).
 

NS has a 58% economic and 50% voting interest in the jointly owned
entity, and CSX has the remainder of the economic and voting interests.
 
CRC owns and operates certain properties
(the Shared Assets Areas) for the joint and exclusive benefit of Norfolk
Southern Railway Company (NSR) and CSX Transportation Inc. (CSXT).
 
The costs of operating the Shared Assets
Areas are borne by NSR and CSXT based on usage.
 
In addition, NSR and CSXT pay CRC a fee
for access to the Shared Assets Areas.

Conrail Corporate Reorganization

On
August 27, 2004
, NS, CSX and Conrail completed a reorganization of Conrail (Conrail
Corporate Reorganization), which established direct ownership and control by
NSR and CSXT of two former CRC subsidiaries, Pennsylvania Lines LLC (PRR) and
New York Central Lines LLC (NYC), respectively.
 
Prior to the Conrail Corporate
Reorganization, NSR operated the routes and assets of PRR and CSXT operated the
routes and assets of NYC, each in accordance with operating and lease
agreements.
 
Pursuant to the Conrail
Corporate Reorganization, the operating and lease agreements were terminated
and PRR and NYC were merged into NSR and CSXT, respectively.
 
The reorganization did not involve the
Shared Assets Areas and did not affect the competitive rail service provided in
the Shared Assets Areas.
 
Conrail
continues to own, manage and operate the Shared Assets Areas as previously
approved by the Surface Transportation Board (STB).
 
In connection with the Conrail Corporate
Reorganization, NS, CSX and Conrail obtained a ruling from the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) regarding certain tax matters, and the STB approved the
transaction.

As a part of the Conrail
Corporate Reorganization, Conrail restructured its existing unsecured and
secured public indebtedness, with the consent of Conrail’s
debtholders
..
 

Prior to the restructuring, there were two series of unsecured public
debentures with an outstanding principal amount of approximately $800 million
and 13 series of secured debt with an outstanding principal amount of
approximately $300 million.
 

Guaranteed debt securities were offered in an approximate 58%/42% ratio
in exchange for Conrail’s unsecured debentures.
 
Of the $800 million unsecured public
debentures, $779 million were tendered and accepted for exchange.
 
Upon completion of the transaction as
described in various SEC filings, the new debt securities became direct
unsecured obligations of NSR and CSXT, respectively, and rank equally with all
existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations, if any, of NSR and
CSXT.
 
Except for interest payments
made in relation to the consummation of the exchange, these new debt securities
have maturity dates, interest rates and principal and interest payment dates
identical to those of the respective series of Conrail’s unsecured
debentures.
 
In addition, these new
debt securities have covenants substantially similar to those of the publicly
traded debt securities of NS and CSX, respectively.

Conrail’s secured debt
and lease obligations remain obligations of Conrail and are supported by leases
and subleases which are the direct lease and sublease obligations of NSR or
CSXT.

NS accounted for the
transaction at fair value, which resulted in the recognition of a $53 million
net gain (reported in “Other income – net”) from the tax-free
distribution to NS of a portion of its investment in Conrail.
 
As a result of the transaction,
NS’ investment in Conrail no longer includes amounts related to PRR and
NYC.
 
Instead the assets and
liabilities of PRR are reflected in their respective line items in NS’
Consolidated Balance Sheet and amounts due to PRR were extinguished.

The amounts shown above for
the net assets received reflect the fair value of such assets.
 
Properties have been valued based on
information received from an independent valuation consultant.
 
Debt has been recorded at fair value
based on interest rates at the time of the reorganization.

On the Consolidated Income
Statement, “Conrail rents and services” is reduced as a result of
the transaction.
 
After the Conrail
Corporate Reorganization, “Conrail rents and services” reflects
only the expenses associated with the Shared Assets Areas, and other expenses
(primarily the depreciation related to the PRR assets) are reflected in their
respective line items.
 
The
transaction’s impact on net income was the $53 million gain discussed
above.
 
Prospectively, the
transaction will not have a significant ongoing effect on net income.

Investment in Conrail

NS is continuing to apply the equity method of accounting to its
remaining investment in Conrail in accordance with APB Opinion No. 18,
"The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common
Stock."
 
NS is amortizing the
excess of the purchase price over Conrail's net equity using the principles of
purchase accounting, based primarily on the estimated remaining useful lives of
Conrail's depreciable property and equipment, including the related deferred
tax effect of the differences in tax and accounting bases for certain
assets.
 
At
Dec. 31, 2004
, the difference between NS' investment in Conrail and its share of
Conrail's underlying net equity was $595 million.

NS' Consolidated Balance Sheet at
Dec. 31, 2004
, includes $17 million of liabilities related to the original
Conrail transaction, principally for contractual obligations to Conrail
employees imposed by the STB when it approved the transaction.
 
Through
Dec. 31, 2004
, NS has paid $186 million of such costs.

Related-Party Transactions

NS provides certain general
and administrative support functions to Conrail, the fees for which are billed
in accordance with several service-provider arrangements and amount to
approximately $7 million annually.

"Conrail rents and
services" includes:
 

(1) expenses for amounts due to PRR for use by NSR of operating
properties and equipment prior to the Conrail Corporate Reorganization,
(2) NS' equity in the earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, prior to
the Conrail Corporate Reorganization, and (3) expenses for amounts due to CRC
for operation of the Shared Assets Areas.
 

After the Conrail Corporate Reorganization, “Conrail rents and
services” includes only expenses for amounts due to CRC for operation of
the Shared Assets Areas.
 
NS’ equity in the earnings of Conrail, net of amortization,
after the reorganization is included in “Other income – net.”

K50

Prior to the Conrail
Corporate Reorganization, a significant portion of the payments made to PRR was
borrowed back from a subsidiary of PRR under a note due in 2032.
 
Amounts outstanding under this note
comprised the long‑term balance of “Due to Conrail,” and this
note was effectively extinguished by the reorganization.
 
“Due to Conrail” included in
current liabilities is composed principally of amounts related to expenses
included in “Conrail rents and services,” as discussed above.

Summary Financial Information
– Conrail

As a result of the Conrail
Corporate Reorganization discussed above, two CRC subsidiaries, PRR and NYC,
were distributed to NS and CSX, respectively, and
CRC’s

public indebtedness was restructured.
 

The results of the operations of these subsidiaries and their net assets
are presented in the following financial information as “Discontinued
Operations.”

Net
deferred income tax liabilities increased by $3,113 million in 2004 as a result
of the Conrail Corporate Reorganization (see Note 2).
 
Except for amounts for which a valuation
allowance has been provided, management believes that it is more likely than
not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable
income to realize the deferred tax assets.
 

The valuation allowance at the end of each year relates to subsidiary
net operating losses that may not be utilized prior to their expiration.
 
The total valuation allowance decreased
$1 million in 2004, $2 million in 2003 and increased $6 million in 2002.

Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) Reviews

Consolidated
federal income tax returns have been examined and Revenue Agent Reports have
been received for all years up to and including 1999.
 
In 2004, the favorable resolution of the
IRS audit of a synthetic fuel-related investment is reflected in the “Tax
credits” line of the reconciliation of statutory rate to the effective
rate.
 
In 2003, the favorable
resolution of prior years’ audits is reflected in the “Other
– net” line of the reconciliation of statutory rate to the
effective rate, as shown above, and comprised most of that line item.
 
The consolidated federal income tax
returns for 2000 through 2003 are being audited by the IRS.
   
The IRS examination for 2000
and 2001 is expected to be completed in the first half of 2005.
 
Management believes that adequate
provision has been made for any additional taxes and interest thereon that
might arise as a result of IRS examinations.

5.
 
Accounts Receivable

NS
has in place an accounts receivable sales program.
 
Under this program a bankruptcy-remote
special purpose subsidiary of NS sells without recourse undivided ownership
interests in a pool of accounts receivable.
 
The buyers have a priority collection
interest in the entire pool of receivables and, as a result, NS has retained
credit risk to the extent the pool of receivables exceeds the amount sold.
 
NS services and collects the receivables
on behalf of the buyers and payments collected from sold receivables can be

K55

reinvested
 in new accounts receivable on behalf of the buyers.
 
Should NS' credit rating drop below
investment grade, the buyers have the right to discontinue this reinvestment.

While
there were some sales during 2004 and 2003, there were no accounts receivable
sold under this arrangement as of
Dec. 31,

and 2003.
 
The change in
“Accounts receivable” included on the Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows related to receivable sales was zero for 2004, compared with a
decrease of $30 million in 2003 and a decrease of $270 million in
2002.
 
The fees associated with
sales, which are based on the buyers' financing costs, are included in
“Other income – net” (see Note 3).

NS'
allowance for doubtful accounts was $9 million at
Dec.
 31, 2004
, and $7 million at
Dec. 31, 2003
..
 
To determine its allowance for doubtful
accounts NS evaluates historical loss experience, which has not been
significant, the characteristics of current accounts, as well as general
economic conditions and trends.

Impairment
of Telecommunications Assets in 2003

In
2003, NS recorded an $84 million non-cash reduction in the carrying value of
certain telecommunications assets to recognize their impaired value in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”
 
NS’ subsidiary, Thoroughbred
Technology and Telecommunications (T-Cubed), developed fiber optic
infrastructure with companies in the telecommunications industry.
 
This industry has been in a severe
downturn and, accordingly, T-Cubed monitored the carrying amount of these
assets through independent fair market value appraisals.
 
As a result of
a
deterioration
 in the long-term prospects for these assets, an updated
appraisal obtained in the fourth quarter of 2003 indicated a significant
decline in their value.
 
T-Cubed continues
to monitor the carrying value of these assets.

Capitalized

Total
interest cost incurred on debt in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $499 million, $509

Pursuant
to the Conrail Corporate Reorganization, NSR issued unsecured public debentures
with a total principal of $452 million and fair value of $595 million that
mature in 2020 and 2043 (see Note 2).
 

The fair value write-up is included in “Discounts and premiums,
net” and reflects interest rates at the time of the reorganization.
 
This write-up is being amortized as a
reduction to interest expense over the life of the instruments with a resulting
average effective interest rate of 6.2%.
 

The new debt securities have covenants substantially similar to other NS
publicly traded debt securities.
 
In
addition, “Capitalized leases” includes $135 million at
Dec. 31, 2004
, related to the fair value of equipment sublease
obligations for equipment that remain secured debt and lease obligations of
Conrail (see Note 2).

In
September 2004, NS exchanged $400 million of its 7.35% notes maturing May 2007
for $442 million of 5.257% notes maturing September 2014.
 
The $42 million difference is being
recognized as additional interest expense over the life of the new notes and is
included in “Discounts and premiums, net.”

The
railroad equipment obligations and the capitalized leases are secured by liens
on the underlying equipment.

Certain
lease obligations require the maintenance of yen-denominated deposits, which
are pledged to the
lessor
 to satisfy yen-denominated
lease payments.
 
These deposits are
included in “Other assets” on the balance sheet and totaled $100
million at
Dec. 31, 2004
, and $96 million at
Dec. 31, 2003
..

Shelf
Registration

In
September 2004, NS filed on Form S-3 a shelf registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Com­mission covering the issu­ance of up to
$550 million of secur­ities.
 

This, together with the $450 million of securities authorized but
unissued
 from a prior $1 billion shelf registration, allows
the company to issue up to $1 billion of registered debt or equity
securities.
 
As of
Dec. 31, 2004
, NS had not issued any securities under this shelf
registration.

Credit
Agreement, Debt Covenants and Commercial Paper

In
August 2004, NS renewed its $1 billion credit facility under substantially the
same terms and conditions as the previous facility for a five-year term
expiring in 2009.
 
Any borrowings
under the credit agreement are contingent on the continuing effectiveness of
the representations and warranties made at the inception of the agreement.
 
NS is subject to various financial
covenants with respect to its debt and under its credit agreement, including a
minimum net worth requirement, a maximum leverage ratio restriction, certain restrictions
on the issuance of further debt by NS or its subsidiaries and the
consolidation, merger or sale of substantially all of NS’ assets.
 
At
Dec. 31,
,
NS was in compliance with all financial covenants.

NS
has the ability to issue commercial paper supported by its $1 billion credit
agreement.
 
At
Dec. 31, 2004
 and
Dec. 31, 2003
, NS had no commercial paper
outstanding.

 Pensions and Other Postretirement
Benefits

Norfolk
 Southern and certain
subsidiaries have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans
covering principally salaried employees.
 

Norfolk
 Southern and certain subsidiaries also provide
specified health care and death benefits to eligible retired employees and
their dependents.
 
Under the present
plans, which may be amended or terminated at NS' option, a defined percentage
of health care expenses
is
 covered, reduced by any
deductibles,
copayments
, Medicare payments and, in
some cases, coverage provided under other group insurance policies.

Asset Management

Eleven
investment firms manage the Company’s defined benefit pension
plan’s assets under investment guidelines approved by the Board of
Directors.
 
Investments are
restricted to domestic fixed income securities, international fixed income
securities, domestic and international equity investments and
unleveraged
 exchange-traded options and financial
futures.
 
Limitations restrict
investment concentration and use of certain derivative instruments.
 
The target asset allocation for equity
is 75% of the pension plan’s assets.
 

Fixed income investments must have an average rating of “AA”
or better and all fixed income securities must be rated “A” or
better except bond index funds.
 
Equity
investments must be in liquid securities listed on national exchanges.
 
No investment is permitted in the
securities of Norfolk Southern Corporation or its subsidiaries (except through
commingled pension trust funds).
 

Investment managers’ returns are expected to exceed selected
market indices by prescribed margins.

NS’
pension plan weighted-average asset allocations at
Dec.
 31, 2004
 and 2003, by asset category, are as follows:

The
postretirement benefit plan assets consist primarily of trust-owned variable
life insurance policies with an asset allocation at
Dec.
 31, 2004
, of 67% in equity securities and 33% in debt securities compared

K60

with
 55% in equity securities and 45% in debt securities at
Dec. 31, 2003
..
 
The
target asset allocation for equity is between 50% and 75% of the plan’s
assets.

The
plans’ assumed future returns are based principally on the asset
allocation and on the historic returns for the plans’ asset classes
determined from both actual plan returns and, over longer time periods, market
returns for those asset classes.

Voluntary Separation Program in 2003

Compensation
and benefits expense in 2003 includes $107 million of costs related to a
voluntary separation program undertaken in the fourth quarter.
 
Through the program, 553
nonagreement
 employees were separated from service, of
which 314 retired under
Norfolk
Southern’s

retirement plan.
 
The costs include
$66 million for separation payments and other benefits of the program and $41
million of costs related to the pension and other benefit plans.

Medicare Changes

The
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (the
Act) was signed into law in December 2003.
 
The Act introduces a new prescription
drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) as well as a federal subsidy to
sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at
least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D.
 
Norfolk
 Southern believes that its
medical plan’s prescription drug benefit will qualify as actuarially
equivalent to Medicare Part D based on a review by the plan’s external
prescription drug administrator of the plan’s prescription drug benefit
compared with the prescription drug benefit that would be paid under Medicare
Part D beginning in 2006.
 
In 2003,
NS elected to take into account these legislative changes in the measurement of
its postretirement benefit obligations in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Staff Position No. 106-1.
 

This resulted in a $45 million decrease in the end-of-year benefit
obligation with a corresponding decline in the unrecognized actuarial loss for
2003.
 
There was no effect on the
net benefit cost in 2003; however, the effects of the Act are reflected as
a reduction of $9 million in the net benefit cost in 2004.

Pension
Assumptions

Pension
and other postretirement benefit costs are determined based on actuarial
valuations that reflect appropriate assumptions as of the measurement date,
ordinarily the beginning of each year.
 

The funded status of the plans is determined using appropriate
assumptions as of each year end.

Health
Care Cost Trend Assumptions

For
measurement purposes at
Dec. 31, 2004
, increases in the per
capita cost of covered health care benefits were assumed to be 9% for 2004 and
8% for 2005.
 
It is assumed the rate
will decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of 5% for 2008 and remain at that
level thereafter.

Assumed
health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported
in the financial statements.

Contributions and Estimated Future Benefit Payments

In 2005, NS expects to
contribute approximately $7 million to its unfunded pension plans for payments
to pensioners and $44 million to its other postretirement benefit plans for
retiree health benefits.

Benefit
payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected
to be paid as follows:

Years
  2010-2014



Beginning
in 2006, the other benefit payments include an estimated annual $3 million
reduction due to the Medicare Part D Subsidy.

Other Postretirement Coverage

Under
collective bargaining agreements, NS and certain subsidiaries participate in a
multi-employer benefit plan, which provides certain postretirement health care
and life insurance benefits to eligible union employees.
 
Premiums under this plan are expensed as
incurred and amounted to $20 million in 2004, $18 million in 2003 and $11
million in 2002.

Section
401(k) Plans

Norfolk
 Southern and certain
subsidiaries provide Section 401(k) savings plans for employees.
 
Under the plans, NS matches a portion of
employee contributions, subject to applicable limitations.
 
NS' expenses under these plans were $12
million in each of 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Stock-Based Compensation

Under
the stockholder-approved Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), a committee of
nonemployee
 directors of the Board may grant stock options,
stock appreciation rights (
SARs
), restricted shares
and performance share units (
PSUs
), up to a maximum
of 88,025,000 shares of Norfolk Southern Common

K64

Stock
(Common Stock).
 
Of these shares,
5,000,000 were approved by the Board for issuance to non-officer participants;
as a broadly based issuance, stockholder approval was not required.
 
Under the Board-approved Thoroughbred
Stock Option Plan (TSOP), the committee may grant stock options up to a maximum
of 6,000,000 shares of Common Stock.
 

Options may be granted for a term not to exceed 10 years, but may not be
exercised prior to the first anniversary of the date of grant.
 
Options are exercisable at the fair
market value of Common Stock on the date of grant.

The
LTIP also permits the payment – on a current or a deferred basis and in
cash or in stock – of dividend equivalents on shares of Common Stock
covered by options or
PSUs
 in an amount commensurate
with dividends paid on Common Stock.
 

Tax absorption payments also are authorized in amounts estimated to
equal the federal and state income taxes applicable to shares of Common Stock
issued subject to a share retention agreement.

Accounting
Method

As
disclosed in Note 1, NS applies APB Opinion 25 and related interpretations in
accounting for awards made under the plans.
 
Accordingly, grants of
PSUs
, restricted shares, dividend equivalents, tax
absorption payments and
SARs
 result in charges to net
income, while grants of stock options have no effect on net income.
 
Related compensation costs were $53
million in 2004, $29 million in 2003 and $23 million in 2002.
 
NS recognized additional paid-in capital
of $30 million in 2004, $2 million in 2003 and $6 million in 2002 related to
the tax benefit generated by stock option exercises.

Note
1 includes a table that illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per
share had NS applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to
stock-based employee compensation.
 

The pro forma amounts include compensation costs calculated using the
Black-
Scholes
 option-pricing model, with average
expected option lives of five years; average risk-free interest rates of 3.2%
in 2004, 2.8% in 2003 and 4.6% in 2002; average stock-price volatilities of 35%
in 2004, 33% in 2003 and 32% in 2002; and dividend yields of zero.
 
These assumptions produced per-share
grant-date fair values of $7.95 in 2004, $6.60 in 2003 and $8.26 in 2002.

Derivative Financial Instruments

On
Jan. 1, 2001, NS adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”
(SFAS No. 133), as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain
Hedging Activities” (SFAS No. 138).
 

The Statements establish accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments and hedging activities, requiring that all derivatives
be recognized in the financial statements as either assets or liabilities and
that
 they be measured at fair value.
 
Changes in fair value are recorded as
adjustments to the assets or liabilities being hedged in “Other
comprehensive income,” or in current earnings, depending on whether the
derivative is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting, the type of hedge
transaction represented and the effectiveness of the hedge.
 
The settlements of the hedges will
result in the reclassification into diesel fuel expense of the related gains or
losses recorded as a component of “Other comprehensive income.”

NS
uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its
diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates.
 
NS does not engage
in the trading of derivatives.
 

Management has determined that its derivative financial instruments
qualify as either fair-value or cash-flow hedges, having values that highly
correlate with the underlying hedged exposures, and has designated such
instruments as hedging transactions.
 

Credit risk related to the derivative financial instruments is
considered to be minimal and is managed by requiring high credit standards for
counterparties and periodic settlements.

K70

Diesel
Fuel Hedging

NS
has hedged a significant portion of its diesel fuel consumption.
 
The intent of the hedges is to assist in
the management of NS' aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations, which
can significantly affect NS' operating margins and profitability.
 
In order to minimize this risk, NS has
entered into a series of swaps in order to lock in the purchase prices of some
of its diesel fuel.
 
Management has
designated these derivative instruments as cash-flow hedges of the exposure to
variability in expected future cash flows attributable to fluctuations in
diesel fuel prices.

Following
is a summary of NS' diesel fuel swaps:

  into during the year

Hedges
are entered into periodically by competitive bid among selected counterparties;
however, no hedges have been placed since May 2004.
 
The goal of this hedging strategy is to
reduce the variability of fuel costs over an extended period of time while
minimizing the incremental cost of hedging.
 
The program provides that NS will not
enter into any fuel hedges with
a duration
 of more
than 36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS' average monthly fuel
consumption will be hedged for each month within any 36-month period.
 
After taking into account the effect of
the hedging, diesel fuel costs represented 8% of NS' operating expenses for the
year ended
Dec. 31, 2004
, and 7% for each of the
years ended
Dec. 31, 2003
 and 2002.

NS'
fuel hedging activity resulted in decreases in diesel fuel expenses of $140
million, $59 million and $10 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.
 
Ineffectiveness, or
the extent to which changes in the fair value of the heating oil contracts do
not offset changes in the fair values of the expected diesel fuel transactions,
was approximately $5 million in 2004 and less than $1 million in both 2003 and
2002.

Interest
Rate Hedging

NS
manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both
fixed and floating-rate debt instruments, and by entering into interest rate
hedging transactions.
 
NS had $151
million, or 2.2%, and $186 million, or 2.8%, of its fixed rate debt portfolio
hedged as of
Dec. 31, 2004
, and
Dec. 31, 2003
, respectively, using interest rate swaps that
qualify for and are designated as fair-value hedge transactions.
 
NS’ interest rate hedging activity
resulted in decreases in interest expenses of $6 million, $10 million and $9
million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
 
These swaps have been effective in
hedging the changes in fair value of the related debt arising from changes in
interest rates and, accordingly, there has been no impact on earnings resulting
from ineffectiveness associated with these derivative transactions.

Fair
Values

The
fair values of NS' diesel fuel derivative instruments as of
Dec. 31, 2004
 and
2003,
 were determined
based upon current fair market values as quoted by an independent third
party.
 
Fair values of interest rate
swaps were determined based upon the present value of expected future cash
flows discounted at the appropriate implied spot rate from the spot rate yield
curve.
 
Fair value adjustments are
noncash

transactions
 and, accordingly, are excluded from the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows.
 
“Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss),” a component of “Stockholders'
equity,” included unrealized gains of $75 million (pretax) as of Dec. 31,
2004, and $40 million (pretax) as of Dec. 31, 2003, related to the fair value
of derivative fuel hedging transactions that will terminate within twelve
months of the respective dates.
 
Any
future gain or loss actually realized will be based on the fair value of the
derivative fuel hedges at the time of termination.

Discontinued Operations - Motor Carrier

On
March 28, 1998
, NS sold all the common stock of North American Van
Lines, Inc.
 
(NAVL),
its motor carrier subsidiary.
 

Results in 2003 include an additional after-tax gain of $10 million, or
3 cents per share (basic and diluted), that resulted from resolution of tax
issues related to the transaction.

Commitments and Contingencies

Lawsuits

Norfolk
 Southern and certain
subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating
principally to railroad operations.
 

When management concludes that it is probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, it is
accrued through a charge to earnings.
 

While the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits
and claims is dependent on future developments, in management's opinion, the
recorded liability is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability
and claims.
 
However, the final
outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty,
and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that
could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter.
 
Any adjustments to the recorded
liability will be reflected in earnings in the periods in which such
adjustments are known.

Casualty Claims

Casualty
claims include employee personal injury and occupational claims as well as
third-party claims.
 
NS engages an
independent consulting actuarial firm to aid in valuing its liability for
personal injury, occupational and third-party claims.
 
Job-related accidental injury and
occupational claims are subject to the Federal Employers’ Liability Act
(FELA), which is applicable only to railroads.
 
FELA’s

fault-based system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as
compared with a no-fault workers’ compensation system.
 
The variability inherent in this system
could result in actual costs being very

K72

different
 from the liability recorded.
 

While the ultimate amount of claims incurred is dependent on
future developments, in management’s opinion, the recorded liability
after considering applicable insurance coverage is adequate to cover the future
payments of claims and is supported by the most recent actuarial study.
 
In all cases, NS records a liability
when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and estimable.

Employee personal injury
claims

– The largest component of casualties and other claims expense is
employee personal injury costs.
 
The
actuarial firm engaged by NS provides quarterly studies to aid in valuing its
employee personal injury liability and estimating its employee personal injury
expense.
 
The actuarial firm studies
NS’ historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent
settlements, taking into account relevant outside influences.
 
The actuary uses the results of these
analyses to estimate the ultimate amount of the liability, which includes
amounts for incurred but unasserted claims.
 
NS adjusts its liability to the
actuarially determined amount on a quarterly basis.
 
The estimate of loss liabilities is
subject to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events
such as jury decisions, court interpretations or legislative changes and as
such the actual emergence of loss may vary from the actuarial estimate.

Occupational claims

– Occupational claims
(including asbestosis and other respiratory diseases, as well as repetitive
motion) are often not caused by a specific accident or event but rather result
from a claimed exposure over time.
 

Many such claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some
of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades.
 
The actuarial firm provides an estimate
of the occupational claims liability based upon NS’ history of claim
filings, severity, payments and other pertinent facts.
 
The liability is dependent upon
management’s judgments made as to the specific case reserves as well as
judgments of the consulting actuarial firm in the periodic studies.
 
The actuarial firm’s estimate of
ultimate loss includes a provision for those claims that have been incurred but
not reported by analyzing industry data and projecting NS’ experience into
the future as far as can be reasonably determined.
 
NS adjusts its liability to the
actuarially determined amount on a quarterly basis.
 
However, it is possible that the
recorded liability may not be adequate to cover the future payment of
claims.
 
Adjustments to the recorded
liability are reflected in operating expenses in the periods in which such
adjustments become known.

Third-party claims

– NS records a
liability for third-party claims including those for highway crossing
accidents, trespasser and other injuries, automobile liability, property damage
and lading damage.
 
The actuarial
firm assists with the calculation of potential liability for third-party
claims, except lading damage, based upon NS’ experience including number
and timing of incidents, amount of payments, settlement rates, number of open
claims and legal defenses.
 
The
actuarial estimate includes a provision for claims that have been incurred but
have not yet been reported.
 
Each
quarter NS adjusts its liability to the actuarially determined amount.
 
Given the inherent uncertainty in the
ultimate outcome of third-party claims, it is possible that future settlement
costs may differ from the estimated liability recorded.

Environmental
Matters

NS
is subject to various jurisdictions' environmental laws and regulations.
 
It is NS' policy to record a liability
where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated
reasonably.
 
Claims,
if any, against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS are
reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) on the balance sheet and
are not netted against the associated NS liability.
 
Environmental engineers regularly
participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any
necessary adjustments to liability estimates.
 
NS also has established an Environmental
Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its
environmental policy.

K73

NS'
Consolidated Balance Sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in
the amount of $64 million at
Dec. 31,
,
and $25 million at
Dec. 31, 2003
 (of which $12 million was
accounted for as a current liability at
Dec. 31,
,
and $8 million at
Dec. 31, 2003
).
 
The increase in the liability was the
result of the Conrail Corporate Reorganization and relates to sites on the
former PRR properties.
 
At
Dec. 31, 2004
, the liability represented NS' estimate of the
probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 210
known locations.
 
On that date, 15
sites accounted for $32 million of the liability, and no individual site was
considered to be material.
 
NS
anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years;
however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period.

At
some of the 210 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with
a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible
parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state
authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint
and several liability for cleanup costs.

With
respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or
comparable state authorities), estimates of NS' ultimate potential financial
exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are
necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently
available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup
technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full
extent of contamination and each potential participant's share of any
estimated loss (and that participant's ability to bear it), and evolving
statutory and regulatory standards governing liability.

The
risk of incurring environmental liability – for acts and omissions, past,
present and future - is inherent in the railroad business.
 
Some of the commodities in NS' traffic
mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, can pose special
risks that NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize.
 
In addition, several NS subsidiaries
own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased and
operated by others, or held for sale.
 

Because environmental problems may exist on these properties that are
latent or undisclosed, there can be no assurance that NS will not incur
environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the
amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time.
 
Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving
these and potentially other unidentified environmental sites and matters are
likely to arise from time to time.
 

The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial
condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

However,
based on its assessment of the facts and circumstances now known, management
believes that it has recorded the probable costs for dealing with
those environmental matters of which the Corporation is aware.
 
Further, management believes that it is
unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will
have a material adverse effect on NS' financial position, results of operations
or liquidity.

Insurance

NS
obtains on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries commercial insurance for
potential losses for third-party liability and first-party property
damages.
 
Specified levels of risk
are retained on a self-insurance basis (up to $25 million per occurrence for
bodily injury and property damage to third parties and $12.5 million per
occurrence for property owned by NS or in NS’ care, custody or control).

K74

Purchase
Commitments

NSR
had outstanding purchase commitments of approximately $121 million in connection
with its 2005 capital program.
 
In
addition,
Norfolk
 Southern has committed to purchase
telecommunications services totaling $26 million through 2007.

Change-In-Control
Arrangements

Norfolk
 Southern has compensation
agreements with officers and certain key employees that become operative only
upon a change in control of the Corporation, as defined in those
agreements.
 
The agreements provide
generally for payments based on compensation at the time of a covered
individual's involuntary or other specified termination and for certain other
benefits.

Guarantees

In
a number of instances, NS and its subsidiaries have agreed to indemnify lenders
for additional costs they may bear as a result of certain changes in laws or
regulations applicable to their loans.
 

Such changes may include impositions or modifications with respect to
taxes, duties, reserves, liquidity, capital adequacy, special deposits, and
similar requirements relating to extensions of credit by, deposits with, or the
assets or liabilities of such lenders.
 

Similar provisions exist in NS' accounts receivable sales program.
 
The nature and timing of changes in laws
or regulations applicable to NS' financings are inherently unpredictable, and
therefore NS' exposure in connection with the foregoing indemnifications cannot
be quantified.
 
No liability has
been recorded related to these indemnifications.
 
In the case of one type of equipment
financing,
NSR's
 Japanese leveraged leases, NSR may
terminate the leases and ancillary agreements if such a change-in-law indemnity
is triggered.
 
Such a termination
would require NSR to make early termination payments that would not be expected
to have a material adverse effect on NS' financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity.

NS
has indemnified parties in a number of transactions for
U.S.
 income tax withholding
imposed as a result of changes in
U.S.
 tax law.
 
In all cases, NS has the right to unwind
the related transaction if the withholding cannot be avoided in the
future.
 
Because these indemnities
would be triggered and are dependent upon a change in the tax law, the maximum
exposure is not quantifiable.
 

Management does not believe that it is likely that it will be required
to make any payments under these indemnities.

NS
has outstanding warranty liabilities primarily related to work performed at its
locomotive facilities.
 
NS has
recorded a reserve of less than $1 million as of
Dec.
 31, 2004
 and $1 million as of
Dec. 31, 2003
, for these warranties.

As
of
Dec. 31, 2004
, certain
Norfolk
 Southern subsidiaries are
contingently liable as guarantors with respect to $8 million of
indebtedness of an entity in which they have an ownership interest, the
Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis, due in 2019.
 
Six other railroads are also jointly and
severally liable as guarantors for this indebtedness.
 
No liability has been recorded related
to this guaranty.

Subsequent Event

On
Jan. 6, 2005
, a derailment occurred in
Graniteville
,
SC.
 
NS
expects the first quarter of 2005 to reflect operating expenses related to this
incident of between $30 million and $40 million (pretax).
 
The amount includes NS’
self-insured retention under its insurance policies, as well as other uninsured
costs.
 
Although potential losses
may exceed self-insured retention amounts NS expects at this time, that
insurance coverage is adequate to cover such potential claims or
settlements.
 
This amount does not
include any fines or penalties that could be imposed.

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

Norfolk
Southern’s

Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the
effectiveness of NS' disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of December 31,
2004.
 
Based on such evaluation,
such officers have concluded that, as of
December 31, 2004
, NS' disclosure controls and procedures
are effective in alerting them on a timely basis to material information
relating to NS (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be
included in NS' periodic filings under the Exchange Act.

Internal Control
Over
 Financial Reporting

The management of
Norfolk

Southern is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting.
 

The Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the Corporation’s
ability to record, process, summarize and report reliable financial data.
 
Management recognizes that there are
inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over
financial reporting, including the possibility of human error and the
circumvention or overriding of internal control.
 
Accordingly, even effective internal
control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation.
 
Further, because of changes in
conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may
vary over time.

In order to ensure that the

Corporation’s
 

internal
 control over financial reporting is effective,
management regularly assesses such controls and did so most recently for its
financial reporting as of
December
 31, 2004
..
 
This
assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over
financial reporting set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the
Treadway
 Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

.
 
Based on our assessment, management has
concluded that the Corporation maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of
December
 31, 2004
..

The Board of Directors, acting
through its Audit Committee, is responsible for the oversight of the
Corporation's accounting policies, financial reporting and internal
control.
 
The Audit Committee of the
Board of Directors is comprised entirely of outside directors who are independent
of management.
 
The independent
registered
public accounting firm and the internal auditors
have
 full and unlimited access to the Audit Committee, with or without
management, to discuss the adequacy of internal control over financial
reporting, and any other matters which they believe should be brought to the
attention of the Audit Committee.

Norfolk
Southern’s

management has issued a report of its assessment of internal control over
financial reporting, and Norfolk
Southern’s

independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report on this
assessment.
 
These reports appear in
Item II, Part 8 of this report on Form 10-K.

During the fourth quarter
of 2004, management has not identified any changes in NS' internal controls
over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, NS’ internal controls over financial
reporting.

Norfolk

Southern Corporation
Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)

Established
on
June 28, 1983
, and approved by the
stockholders at their Annual Meeting most recently on
May 10, 2001
, LTIP was adopted to promote the success of
Norfolk
 Southern by providing an
opportunity for officers and other key employees to acquire a proprietary
interest in the Corporation.
 
On
January 23, 2001
, the Board of Directors approved the issuance of an
additional 5,000,000 shares of authorized but
unissued

Common Stock under LTIP to participants who are not officers of
Norfolk
 Southern.
 
The issuance of these shares was
broadly-based, and stockholder approval of these shares was not required.
 
Accordingly, this portion of LTIP is
included in the number of securities available for future issuance for plans
not approved by stockholders.
 
Also
on that date, the Board adopted an amended plan which included the reservation
for issuance of an additional 30,000,000 shares of authorized but
unissued
 Norfolk Southern Common Stock, with no more than 6
million of such additional shares to be awarded as restricted shares or
performance shares (including performance share units earned as performance
shares).
 
This amended plan was
approved by stockholders on
May 10, 2001
..

Non-employee
directors, officers and other key employees residing in the
United States
 or
Canada
 are eligible for selection
to receive LTIP awards.
 
Under LTIP,
the Compensation Committee (Committee) may grant incentive stock options,
nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares and
performance share units (in addition, dividend equivalents may be awarded for
options and

K79

performance
 share units).
 
The
Committee may establish such terms and conditions for the awards as provided in
the plan.

For
options, the option price per share will not be less than 100% of the fair
market value of
Norfolk
Southern's

Common Stock on the effective date the option is granted.
 
All options are subject to a vesting
period of at least one year, and the term of the option will not exceed ten
years.
 
LTIP specifically prohibits
option
repricing
 without stockholder approval, except
for capital adjustments.

Performance
share units are performance-based awards which are earned upon achievement of
goals the Committee establishes at the time of the grant for three equally weighted
performance criteria approved by the stockholders -- return on average invested
capital, operating ratio, and total return to NS stockholders as compared with
the total return on all stocks comprising the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price
Index -- and the units may be payable as shares of Norfolk Southern Common
Stock or in cash.

Norfolk

Southern Corporation
Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan

The
Board adopted the Norfolk Southern Corporation Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan
(“TSOP”) on January 26, 1999, to promote the success of Norfolk
Southern by providing an opportunity for
nonagreement

employees to acquire a proprietary interest in Norfolk Southern and thereby to
provide an additional incentive to
nonagreement

employees to devote their maximum efforts and skills to the advancement,
betterment, and prosperity of Norfolk Southern and its stockholders.
 
The plan has not been approved by
stockholders.
 
Six million shares of
authorized but
unissued
 Common Stock were reserved
for issuance under TSOP.

Active
full-time
nonagreement
 employees residing in the
United States

Under TSOP,
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors may grant
nonqualified stock options and may establish such terms and conditions as
provided in the plan.

The
option price per share will not be less than 100% of the fair market value of
Norfolk
Southern's

Common Stock on the effective date the option is granted.

Directors' Restricted Stock Plan

The
Norfolk Southern Corporation Directors' Restricted Stock Plan
(“Plan”) was adopted on
January 1,
,
and is designed to increase ownership of
Norfolk
Southern's

Common Stock by its non-employee directors so as to further align their
ownership interest in
Norfolk
 Southern with that of
stockholders.
 
The Plan has not been
approved by stockholders.
 

Currently, a maximum of 66,000 shares of Corporation Common Stock may be
granted under the Plan.
 
To make the
grants to eligible directors,
Norfolk
 Southern purchases, through
one or more subsidiary companies, the number of shares required in open-market
transactions at prevailing market prices, or makes such grants from Common
Stock already owned by one or more of
Norfolk
Southern's

subsidiary companies.

Only
non-employee directors, who are not and never have been employees of
Norfolk
 Southern, are eligible to
participate in the Plan.
 
Upon
becoming a director, each eligible director receives a one-time grant of 3,000
restricted shares of Norfolk Southern Common Stock.
 
No individual member of the Board
exercises discretion concerning the eligibility of any director or the number
of shares granted.

K80

The
restriction period begins on the date of the grant and ends on the earlier of
death or six months after the eligible director ceases to be a director by
reason of disability or retirement.
 

Directors will forfeit the right to receive the restricted shares if
they cease to serve as a director of
Norfolk
 Southern for reasons other
than their disability, retirement or death.
