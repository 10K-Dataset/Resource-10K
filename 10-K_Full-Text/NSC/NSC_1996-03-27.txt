          GENERAL - Norfolk Southern Corporation (Norfolk Southern)
was incorporated on July 23, 1980, under the laws of the Commonwealth
of Virginia.  On June l, 1982, Norfolk Southern acquired control of
two major operating railroads, Norfolk and Western Railway Company
(NW) and Southern Railway Company (Southern).  In accordance with an
Agreement of Merger and Reorganization dated as of July 31, 1980, and
related Plans of Merger, and with the approval of the transaction by
the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), each issued share of NW's
common stock was converted into one share of Norfolk Southern Common
Stock and each issued share of Southern common stock was converted
into l.9 shares of Norfolk Southern Common Stock.  The outstanding
shares of Southern's preferred stock remained outstanding without
change.

          Effective December 31, 1990, Norfolk Southern transferred
all the common stock of NW to Southern, and Southern's name was
changed to Norfolk Southern Railway Company (Norfolk Southern
Railway).  As of February 29, 1996, all the common stock of NW
(100 percent voting control) is owned by Norfolk Southern Railway, and
all the common stock of Norfolk Southern Railway and 12 percent of its
voting preferred stock (resulting in 94.6 percent voting control) are
owned directly by Norfolk Southern.

          On June 21, 1985, Norfolk Southern acquired control of North
American Van Lines, Inc. and its subsidiaries (NAVL), a diversified
motor carrier.  In accordance with an Acquisition Agreement dated 
May 2, 1984, and with the approval of the transaction by the ICC, 
Norfolk Southern acquired all the issued and outstanding common stock 
of NAVL.  During 1993, NAVL underwent a restructuring (see discussion 
on page 6 and in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
on page 73) designed to enhance its opportunities to return to
profitability.

          Unless indicated otherwise, Norfolk Southern and its
subsidiaries are referred to collectively as NS.

          RAILROAD OPERATIONS - As of December 31, 1995, NS'
railroads operated more than 14,500 miles of road in the states of
Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New York,
North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee,
Virginia and West Virginia, and the Province of Ontario, Canada.  Of
this total, 12,208 miles are owned with the balance operated under
lease or trackage rights; most of this total are main line track.
In addition, NS' railroads operate approximately 11,000 miles of
passing, industrial, yard and side tracks.

  PAGE 5


          NS' railroads have major leased lines between Cincinnati,
Ohio, and Chattanooga, Tennessee, and in the State of North
Carolina.

          The Cincinnati-Chattanooga lease, covering about 335
miles, expires in 2026, and is subject to an option to extend the
lease for an additional 25 years, at terms to be agreed upon.

          The North Carolina leases, covering approximately
330 miles, expired by their terms at the end of 1994.  Following
extensive negotiations, the terms of renewal contained in a Lease
Extension Agreement were approved by the respective parties' boards
of directors in August 1995, and, subject to a court challenge as to
the presence of the required quorum of private stockholders ("Quorum
Challenge"), by the stockholders of North Carolina Railroad Company
(NCRR) at their meeting in December.  Also, certain NCRR
stockholders earlier had filed four separate, and still-pending,
derivative actions challenging the adequacy of the new rental terms,
which provide for an annual rental of $8.0 million in 1995, with
adjustments for inflation in each of the succeeding years of the
lease.  Pending resolution of the Quorum Challenge, NS' railroads
continue to operate over NCRR lines under the rental terms contained
in the Lease Extension Agreement.  If the Quorum Challenge is
successful, and if the NCRR is unable to obtain stockholder approval
of the Lease Extension Agreement at a subsequent meeting, NS'
railroads could be required to operate over these NCRR lines under
conditions prescribed by regulatory authority, or they might operate
over one or more alternate routes.  Whatever the ultimate resolution
of this matter, it is not expected to have a material effect on NS'
consolidated financial position.

          NS' lines carry raw materials, intermediate products and
finished goods primarily in the Southeast and Midwest and to and
from the rest of the United States and parts of Canada.  These lines
also transport overseas freight through several Atlantic and Gulf
Coast ports.  Atlantic ports served by NS include:  Norfolk, Va.;
Morehead City, N.C.; Charleston, S.C.; Savannah and Brunswick, Ga.;
and Jacksonville, Fl.  Gulf Coast ports served include:  Mobile,
Al., and New Orleans, La.

          The lines of NS' railroads reach most of the larger
industrial and trading centers of the Southeast and Midwest, with
the exception of those in central and southern Florida.  Atlanta,
Birmingham, New Orleans, Memphis, St. Louis, Kansas City (Missouri),
Chicago, Detroit, Cincinnati, Buffalo, Norfolk, Charleston, Savannah
and Jacksonville are among the leading centers originating and
terminating freight traffic on the system.  In addition, a haulage
arrangement with the Florida East Coast Railway allows NS' railroads
to provide single-line service to and from south Florida, including
the port cities of Miami, West Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale.  The
system's lines also reach many individual industries, mines (in
western Virginia, eastern Kentucky and southern West Virginia) and
businesses located in smaller communities in its service area.  The
traffic corridors carrying the heaviest volumes of freight include
those from the Appalachian coal fields of Virginia, West Virginia
and Kentucky to Norfolk and Sandusky, Oh.; Buffalo to Chicago and
Kansas City; Chicago to Jacksonville (via Cincinnati, Chattanooga
and Atlanta); and Washington, D.C./Hagerstown, Md., to New Orleans
(via Atlanta and Birmingham).
  PAGE 6


          Buffalo, Chicago, Hagerstown, Jacksonville, Kansas City,
Memphis, New Orleans and St. Louis are major gateways for
interterritorial system traffic.

          NS rail subsidiaries and other railroads have entered into
service interruption agreements, effective December 30, 1994,
providing indemnities to parties affected by a strike over specified
industry issues.  If NS were so affected, it could receive daily
indemnities from non-affected parties; if parties other than NS were
affected, NS could be required to pay indemnities to those parties.
If NS were required to pay the maximum amount of indemnities
required of it under these agreements--an event considered unlikely
at this time--such liability should not exceed approximately $85
million.

          MOTOR CARRIER OPERATIONS - DOMESTIC OPERATIONS - NAVL's
principal transportation activity is the domestic, irregular route
common and contract carriage of used household goods and special
commodities between points in the United States.  NAVL also operates
as an intrastate carrier of property in 19 states.

          Prior to its restructuring in 1993, NAVL's domestic motor
carrier business was organized into three primary divisions:
Relocation Services (RS) specializing in residential relocation of
used household goods; High Value Products (HVP) specializing in office
and industrial relocations and transporting exhibits; and Commercial
Transport (CT) specializing in the transportation of truckload
shipments of general commodities.  In 1993, NAVL underwent a
restructuring involving termination of the CT Division and sale of the
operations of Tran-Star, Inc. (Tran-Star), NAVL's refrigerated
trucking subsidiary.  In 1993, NAVL discontinued CT's operations,
transferred some parts of CT's business to other divisions and began
selling CT's assets that were not needed in NAVL's other operations.
The sale of Tran-Star's operations was completed on December 31, 1993.

          During 1995, the RS and HVP divisions conducted operations
through a network of over 400 agents at approximately 700 locations in
the United States.  Agents are local moving and storage companies that
provide NAVL with such services as solicitation, packing and
warehousing in connection with the movement of household goods and
specialized products.  NAVL's future domestic operations are expected
to be conducted principally through the RS and HVP divisions.

           Customized Logistics Services (CLS) was established in 1993
as an operating unit of the HVP Division.  CLS' business is to focus
NAVL's resources to respond to a variety of customer needs for
integrated logistics services.  The services include emergency parts
order fulfillment, time-definite transportation and in-transit merge
programs.

          FOREIGN OPERATIONS - NAVL's foreign operations are conducted
through the RS and HVP Divisions and through foreign subsidiaries,
including North American Van Lines Canada, Ltd.  The latter subsidiary
provides motor carrier service for the transportation of used
household goods and specialized commodities between most points in
Canada through a network of approximately 170 agent locations.  NAVL's
international operations consist primarily of forwarding used
household goods to and from the United States and between foreign
countries through a network of approximately 330 foreign agents 
  PAGE 7


and representatives.  NAVL's international operations are 
structurally aligned with the services provided by its domestic 
operating divisions.  All international household goods operations 
and related subsidiaries in Alaska and Canada are assigned to the 
RS Division.  The remaining international operations, which include 
subsidiaries in the United States, Germany and the United Kingdom, 
are involved in the transportation of selected general and specialized 
commodities and are assigned to the HVP Division.

          TRIPLE CROWN OPERATIONS - Until April 1993, Norfolk
Southern's intermodal subsidiary, Triple Crown Services, Inc. (TCS),
offered intermodal service using RoadRailer (Registered
Trademark) (RT) equipment and domestic containers.  RoadRailer(RT)
units are enclosed vans which can be pulled over highways in tractor-
trailer configuration and over the rails by locomotives.  On April 1,
1993, the business, name and operations of TCS were transferred to
Triple Crown Services Company (TCSC), a partnership in which
subsidiaries of Norfolk Southern and Consolidated Rail Corporation
(CR) are equal partners.  RoadRailer(RT) equipment owned or leased by
TCS (which was renamed TCS Leasing, Inc.) is operated by TCSC.
Because NS indirectly owns only 50 percent of TCSC, the revenues of
TCSC are not consolidated with the results of NS.  TCSC offers door-to-
door intermodal service using RoadRailer(RT) equipment and domestic
containers in the corridors previously served by TCS, as well as
service to the New York and New Jersey markets via CR.  Major traffic
corridors include those between New York and Chicago, Chicago and
Atlanta, and Atlanta and New York.

          TRANSPORTATION OPERATING REVENUES - NS' total transportation
operating revenues were $4.67 billion in 1995.  These revenues were
received for the transportation of revenue freight: 280.6 million tons
by rail and 1.2 million tons by motor carrier.  Of the rail tonnage,
219.4 million tons originated on line, 242.7 million tons terminated
on line (including 187.1 million tons of local traffic -- originating
and terminating on line) and approximately 5.6 million tons was
overhead traffic (neither originating nor terminating on line).

  PAGE 10


          COAL TRAFFIC - Coal, coke and iron ore--most of which is
bituminous coal--is NS' railroads' principal commodity group.  NS'
railroads originated 114.2 million tons of coal, coke and iron ore in
1995 and handled a total of 125.1 million tons.  Originated tonnage
decreased 0.4 percent from 114.7 million tons in 1994, and total tons
handled decreased 0.6 percent from 125.9 million tons in 1994.
Revenues from coal, coke and iron ore, which accounted for 27 percent
of NS' total transportation operating revenues and 34 percent of total
revenue ton miles in 1995, were $1.24 billion, a decrease of 2 percent
from $1.26 billion in 1994.

          Of the 111.2 million tons of coal originating on NS railroad
lines in 1995, the approximate breakdown by origin state is as
follows:   41.2 million tons from West Virginia, 34.4 million tons
from Virginia, 23.1 million tons from Kentucky, 7.1 million tons from
Illinois, 3.6 million tons from Alabama, 1.6 million tons from
Tennessee, and 0.2 million tons from Indiana.  Of this NS-origin coal,
approximately 25.7 million tons moved for export, principally through
NS pier facilities at Norfolk (Lamberts Point), Va.; 18.6 million tons
moved to domestic and Canadian steel industries; 58.7 million tons of
steam coal moved to electric utilities; and 8.2 million tons moved to
other industrial and miscellaneous users.  NS' railroads moved
9.4 million tons of originated coal to various docks on the Ohio River
for further movement by barge and 3.3 million tons to various Lake
Erie ports.  Other than coal for export, virtually all coal handled by
NS' railroads was terminated in states situated east of the
Mississippi River.

          Total coal tonnage handled through all system ports in 1995
was 41.7 million.  Of this total, 69 percent moved through the pier
facilities at Lamberts Point.  In 1995, total tonnage handled at
Lamberts Point, including coastwise traffic, was 28.9 million tons, a
4 percent increase from the 27.8 million tons handled in 1994.

  PAGE 11


          See the discussion of coal traffic, by type of coal, in
Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis," on page 35.

          MERCHANDISE RAIL TRAFFIC - The merchandise traffic group
consists of Intermodal and five major commodity groupings
(Paper/Forest; Chemicals; Automotive; Agriculture; and
Metals/Construction).  Total NS railroad merchandise revenues
increased in 1995 to $2.66 billion, a 4 percent increase over 1994.
Railroad merchandise carloads handled in 1995 were 3.18 million,
compared with 3.03 million handled in 1994, an increase of 5 percent.

          Intermodal results, for 1993 and later, reflect the effect
of the formation, in April 1993, of TCSC, a partnership between NS and
Conrail subsidiaries (see also page 7).  This partnership provides
RoadRailer(RT) and domestic container services previously offered by a
wholly owned subsidiary of NS.  Because NS owns only 50 percent of
TCSC, its revenues are not consolidated.  NS' intermodal revenues
include only revenues for rail service NS provides the partnership.
Excluding this partnership effect, 1994 intermodal revenues increased
14%, compared with 1993.

          In 1995, 105.2 million tons of merchandise freight, or
approximately 68 percent of total rail merchandise tonnage handled by
NS, originated on line.  The balance of NS' railroad merchandise
traffic was received from connecting carriers (mostly railroads, with
some truck, water and highway as well), usually at interterritorial
gateways.  The principal interchange points for NS-received traffic
included Chicago, Memphis, New Orleans, Cincinnati, Kansas City,
Detroit, Hagerstown, St. Louis/East St. Louis, and Louisville.

           Revenues in all six market groups comprising merchandise
traffic improved in 1995 over 1994, and in 1994 over 1993.  The
biggest gains in 1995 were in Intermodal, up $44.9 million;
Automotive, up $22.0 million; and Metals/Construction, up
$18.1 million.

           See the discussion of merchandise rail traffic by commodity
group in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis," on
page 35.
  PAGE 12


          MOTOR CARRIER TRAFFIC - Motor carrier revenues declined
1 percent to $656.2 million in 1995.  Gains in the HVP division were
offset by reductions in RS.  In 1994, motor carrier revenues were
$663.2 million, down 7 percent from 1993, which included six months of
revenues from truckload operations prior to the restructuring of NAVL
(see page 6).  Adjusted for the effect of discontinued truckload
operations in 1993, motor carrier operating revenues in 1994 increased
15 percent.

          DOMESTIC OPERATIONS now are conducted through NAVL's RS and
HVP divisions.  In 1995, total domestic shipments for these divisions
were 381,121, up 0.5 percent from 1994.  Further comments about each
division follow.

          Domestic shipments of used household goods transported by
the RS Division fall into three market categories.  Approximately
51 percent of the domestic shipment volume comes from the sale of
moving services to individual consumers.  Another 38 percent comes
from corporations and other businesses that pay for the relocation of
their employees.  The remaining 11 percent is derived from military,
government and other sources.  Total domestic RS Division shipments in
1995 represented 29 percent of the NAVL domestic motor carrier
shipments transported by the two primary divisions.  Total domestic
revenues from this division were down 4 percent, compared with 1994,
and represented 42 percent of total revenues from operations.

          The HVP Division specializes in providing transportation
services in less-than-truckload (LTL) and truckload (TL) quantities of
sensitive products.  These products are divided into the following
categories:  office furniture and equipment, exhibits and displays,
electronic equipment, industrial machinery, commercial relocation, LTL
furniture and selected general commodities.  Total HVP Division
shipments transported in 1995, including TL and LTL, represented
71 percent of the NAVL domestic motor carrier shipments transported by
the two primary divisions.  Revenues from this division were down
2 percent from 1994 levels and represented 46 percent of total
revenues from operations.

          FOREIGN OPERATIONS include NAVL's Canadian subsidiary, North
American Van Lines Canada, Ltd., as well as operating subsidiaries in
England and Germany.  Foreign operations involving the transportation
of used household goods and selected general and specialized
commodities generated revenues of $81.8 million in 1995, up 15 percent
from 1994.  Revenues from foreign operations represented 12 percent of
NAVL's total revenues.

  PAGE 13



          FREIGHT RATES - In 1995 NS' railroads continued their
reliance on private contracts and exempt price quotes as their
predominant pricing mechanisms.  Thus, a major portion of NS'
railroads' freight business is not economically regulated by the
government.  In general, market forces have been substituted for
government regulation and now are the primary determinant of rail
service prices.  This situation is not expected to change in 1996
after the January 1 termination of the ICC and transfer of its
functions to a new agency, the Surface Transportation Board (STB).

          In 1995, the ICC found NS' railroads "revenue inadequate"
based on results for the year 1994.  A railroad is "revenue
inadequate" under the Interstate Commerce Act when its return on net
investment does not exceed the rail industry's composite cost of
capital.

          The revenue adequacy measure is used by the STB as one of
the factors in its determination of reasonableness of regulated
rates.

          Pricing and service flexibility afforded by the Motor
Carrier Act of 1980 and the Household Goods Transportation Act of
1980 has resulted in NAVL's increased emphasis on innovative pricing
action in order to remain competitive.  Since 1980, NAVL has
increasingly operated as a contract carrier.  As of December 31,
1995, domestic contract carriage agreements accounted for the
following percentage of shipments:  RS Division, 31 percent and HVP
Division, 81 percent.

          PASSENGER OPERATIONS - Regularly scheduled passenger
operations on NS' lines consist of Amtrak trains operating between
Alexandria and New Orleans, and between Charlotte and Selma, N.C.
Former Amtrak operations between East St. Louis and Centralia, Il.,
were discontinued by Amtrak on November 3, 1993.  Commuter trains
continued operations on the NS line between Manassas and Alexandria
under contract with two transportation commissions of the
Commonwealth of Virginia, providing for reimbursement of related
expenses incurred by NS.  During 1993, a lease of the Chicago to
Manhattan, Il., line to the Commuter Rail Division of the Regional
Transportation Authority of Northeast Illinois replaced an agreement
under which NS had provided commuter rail service for the Authority.

          NONCARRIER OPERATIONS - Norfolk Southern's noncarrier
subsidiaries engage principally in the acquisition and subsequent leasing
of coal, oil, gas and timberlands, the development of commercial real
estate and the leasing or sale of rail property and equipment.  In 1995,
no such noncarrier subsidiary or industry segment grouping of noncarrier
subsidiaries met the requirements for a reportable business segment set
forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 14.

          The average age of the freight car fleet at December 31,
1995, was 22.0 years.  During 1995, NS retired 7,247 freight cars.  As
of December 31, 1995, the average age of the locomotive fleet was
15.7 years.  During 1995, NS retired 67 locomotives, the average age
of which was 22.6 years.  Since 1988, NS has rebodied more than
20,500 coal cars.  As a result, the remaining serviceability of the
freight car fleet is greater than is inferable from the high
percentage of freight cars built in earlier years.

          NS continues freight car and locomotive maintenance
programs to ensure the highest standards of safety, reliability,
customer satisfaction and equipment marketability.  In recent years,
the bad order ratio reflects the storage of certain types of cars
which are not in high demand.  Funds were not spent to repair cars
for which present and future customers' needs could be adequately
met without such repair programs.  Also, NS' own standards of what
constitutes a "serviceable" car have risen, and NS continues its
disposition program for underutilized, unserviceable and overage
cars.  In this connection, NS began an orderly disposition of up to
17,000 freight cars in October 1994.  Through the end of 1995, 7,272
of these cars had been sold.


  PAGE 17


          TRACKAGE - All NS trackage is standard gauge, and the rail
in approximately 95 percent of the main line trackage (including
first, second, third and branch main tracks, all excluding trackage
rights) is rail ranging from 100 to 140 pounds per yard.  Of the
22,514 miles of track maintained by NS as of December 31, 1995, 15,787
were laid with welded rail.



          MICROWAVE SYSTEM - The NS microwave system, consisting of
6,600 radio path miles, 376 active stations and 5 passive repeater
stations, provides communications for Norfolk, Buffalo, Detroit, Fort
Wayne, Chicago, Kansas City, St. Louis, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, New
Orleans, Jacksonville, Memphis, Cincinnati and most operating
locations between these cities.  The microwave system provides service
for approximately 17,200 individual telephone circuits.  The microwave
system is used principally for voice communications, VHF radio control
circuits, data and facsimile transmissions, traffic control
operations, AEI data transmissions and relay of intelligence from
defective equipment detectors.  Extension of microwave communications
to low density or operations support facilities is accomplished via
microwave interface to buried fiber-optic or copper cables.

          TRAFFIC CONTROL - Of a total of 12,885 road miles operated
by NS, excluding trackage rights over foreign lines, 5,400 road miles
are governed by centralized traffic control systems (of which
100 miles are controlled by data radio from eight microwave site
locations) and 2,800 road miles are equipped for automatic block
system operation.

  PAGE 18


          COMPUTERS - Data processing facilities connect the yards,
terminals, transportation offices, rolling stock repair points, sales
offices and other key locations on NS to the central computer complex
in Atlanta, Ga.  System operating and traffic data are compiled and
stored to provide customers with information on their shipments
throughout the system.  Data processing facilities are capable of
providing current information on the location of every train and each
car on line, as well as related waybill and other train and car
movement data.  Additionally, this facility affords substantial
capacity for, and is utilized to assist management in the performance
of, a wide variety of functions and services, including payroll, car
and revenue accounting, billing, material management activities and
controls, and special studies.

          OTHER - NS has extensive facilities for support of railroad
operations, including freight depots, car construction shops,
maintenance shops, office buildings, and signals and communications
facilities.

          MOTOR CARRIER PROPERTY:

          REAL ESTATE - NAVL owns and leases real estate in support of
its operations.  Principal real estate holdings include NAVL's
headquarters complex and warehouse and vehicle maintenance facilities
in Fort Wayne, Indiana, vehicle maintenance facilities in Fontana,
California, and terminal facilities in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and
Great Falls, Montana.  NAVL also leases facilities throughout the
United States for sales offices, maintenance facilities and for
warehouse, terminal and distribution center operations.

          EQUIPMENT - NAVL relies extensively on independent
contractors (owner-operators) who supply the power equipment
(tractors) used to pull NAVL trailers.  Agents also provide a
substantial portion of NAVL's equipment needs, particularly for the
transportation of household goods, by furnishing tractors and trailers
on either a permanent or an intermittent lease basis.

          As of December 31, 1995, agents and owner-operators together
supplied 3,519 tractors, representing 97 percent of the U.S. power
equipment operated in NAVL service.  Also as of December 31, 1995,
NAVL owned 3,097 trailer units, representing 54 percent of the U.S.
trailer fleet in NAVL service.  The remaining 46 percent was provided
mainly by agents and owner-operators.  Agents and owner-operators also
provided 1,081 straight trucks, or 98 percent of such units in NAVL
service.

          NAVL has an extensive program for the repair and maintenance
of its trailer equipment.  In 1995, approximately 14,000 work orders 
were completed at NAVL's facility in Fort Wayne.  As of December 31, 
1995, the average age of trailer equipment in the NAVL fleet was 
8.4 years.

          COMPUTERS - NAVL relies extensively on data processing
facilities for shipment planning and dispatch functions as well as
shipment tracing.  Data processing capabilities are also utilized in
revenue processing functions, driver and agent account settlement
activity, and internal accounting and record keeping service.

  PAGE 19


          ENCUMBRANCES - Certain railroad equipment is subject to the
prior lien of equipment financing obligations amounting to
approximately $545.4 million as of December 31, 1995, and
$521.9 million at December 31, 1994.  In addition, a significant
portion of NS' properties is subject to liens securing, as of 
December 31, 1995, and 1994, approximately $77.2 million and 
$83.9 million of mortgage debt, respectively.

          Many of the tractors utilized in NAVL service are purchased
by NAVL from manufacturers and resold to agents and owner-operators
under a NAVL-sponsored financing program.  At December 31, 1995, NAVL
had $18.4 million in such tractor contracts receivable.  This program
allows NAVL to generate the funds necessary to purchase the tractors
and to resell them under favorable financing terms.  The equipment is
sold under conditional sales contracts with the agents and owner-
operators.

           NS' capital spending and maintenance programs are and have
been designed to assure NS' ability to provide safe, efficient and
reliable transportation services.  For 1996, NS is planning
$708 million of capital spending, of which $699 million will be for
railway projects and $9 million for motor carrier property.  NS
anticipates that a portion of its locomotive acquisitions in 1996 will
be financed using capitalized leases similar to the 1995 leases (see
note 6 on page 63).  In 1996, equipment financing needs may be
somewhat lower than in 1995, as proceeds from the sale of freight cars
will be used for some equipment acquisitions.  Looking further ahead,
total rail and motor carrier spending are expected to continue to be
similar to 1994 and 1995 levels.  A substantial portion of future
capital spending is expected to be funded through internally generated
cash, although debt financing will continue as the primary funding
source for equipment acquisitions.
  PAGE 20


          ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS - Compliance with federal, state and
local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
environment is a principal NS goal.  To date, such compliance has not
affected materially NS' capital additions, earnings, liquidity or
competitive position.

          See the discussion of "Environmental Matters" in Part II,
Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis" on page 35, and in
Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 74.

          EMPLOYEES - NS employed an average of 26,944 employees in
1995, compared with an average of 27,168 in 1994.  The approximate
average cost per employee during 1995 was $42,835 in wages and $17,792
in employee benefits.  Approximately 74 percent of these employees are
represented by various labor organizations.  A tentative settlement
was reached with the United Transportation Union, which represents the
largest number of employees in the railroad industry.  The settlement
requires ratification by the members before acceptance.  The
negotiation of this settlement demonstrated that national handling
produces the quickest path to agreement.  Negotiations with the other
unions are progressing.

          GOVERNMENT REGULATION - In addition to environmental,
safety, securities and other regulations generally applicable to all
businesses, NS' railroads are subject to regulation by the Surface
Transportation Board (STB), which succeeded the ICC on January
1, 1996.  The STB has jurisdiction over some rates, routes, conditions
of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines.  The STB
also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger or acquisition of
control of and by rail common carriers.  The Department of
Transportation regulates certain track and mechanical equipment
standards.

          The relaxation of economic regulation of railroads, begun
over a decade ago by the ICC under the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, is
expected to continue under the STB.  Thus it appears that additional
rail business will be exempted from regulation in the future.
Significant exemptions for NS' railroads are TOFC/COFC (i.e.,
"piggyback") business, rail boxcar traffic, lumber, manufactured
steel, automobiles and certain bulk commodities such as sand, gravel,
pulpwood and wood chips for paper manufacturing.  Transportation
contracts on regulated shipments, which no longer require regulatory
approval, effectively remove those shipments from regulation as well.
Over 80 percent of NS' freight revenues come from either exempt
traffic or traffic moving under transportation contracts.

          For motor carrier operations conducted by NAVL, the
Department of Transportation and the STB are the principal regulatory
entities.  The STB exercises jurisdiction over the relationship
between carriers and owner-operators, and carrier practices and common
carrier rates relating to the transportation of household goods.  The
primary focus of the Department of Transportation is on driver
qualification and safety standards, including maximum trailer length
and width.
  PAGE 21


          COMPETITION - There is continuing strong competition among
rail, water and highway carriers.  Price is usually only one factor of
importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and
specific hauling company.  Inventory carrying costs, service
reliability, ease of handling and the desire to avoid loss and damage
during transit are increasingly important considerations, especially
for higher valued finished goods, machinery and consumer products.
Even for raw materials, semi-finished goods and work-in-process, users
are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements which minimize
problems at successive production stages.

          NS' primary rail competitor is the CSX system; both operate
throughout much of the same territory.  Other railroads also operate
in parts of the territory.  NS also competes with motor carriers,
water carriers and with shippers who have the additional option of
handling their own goods in private carriage.  Increasingly,
cooperative strategies between railroads (such as the TCSC partnership
involving NS and CR, see page 7) and between railroads and motor
carriers enable carriers to compete more effectively in specific
markets.

          NAVL continues to face vigorous competition due to
deregulation and overcapacity in the industry that will keep profits
at a modest level.  While service remains a key issue, many shippers
now place greater emphasis on price.  For the RS Division, contract
carriage and volume discount programs dominate the corporate
relocation segment, and guaranteed price options are common to the
individual consumer segment.  Contract carriage agreements are also
utilized extensively by the HVP Division to meet the service and price
requirements of its customers.

Item 3.   Legal Proceedings.
- ------    -----------------

          North Carolina - Fiber Optic Cable.  In October 1995, two
individuals, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly
situated, instituted an action in the United States District Court for
the Western District of North Carolina against Sprint Communications
Company, L.P. and Norfolk Southern Railway Company.  Plaintiffs allege
they sustained RICO and trespass damages in the amount of $100 million
(trebled) as a result of the defendants' installing, pursuant to an
agreement, fiber optic cable on property in which the plaintiffs
further allege the Railway's only property right was an easement for
railway operations.  Management, after consulting with its legal
counsel, is of the opinion that the Railway has meritorious defenses
to both the RICO and trespass claims and that ultimate liability,
should there be any, will not materially affect the consolidated
financial position of NS.



Item 4.   Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
- ------    ---------------------------------------------------

          There were no matters submitted to a vote of security
holders during the fourth quarter of 1995.

Executive Officers of the Registrant.
- -------------------------------------

          Norfolk Southern's officers are elected annually by the
Board of Directors at its first meeting held after the annual meeting
of stockholders, and they hold office until their successors are
elected.  There are no family relationships among the officers, nor
any arrangement or understanding between any officer and any other
person pursuant to which the officer was selected.  The following
table sets forth certain information, as of March 1, 1996, relating to
these officers:

                  Management's Discussion and Analysis
            of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with
the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes beginning on page 52 and
the Eleven-Year Financial Review beginning on page 28.

SUMMARIZED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

1995 Compared with 1994
- -----------------------
     Net income in 1995 was a record $712.7 million, up 7% over 1994
earnings of $667.8 million. Excluding a $20.4 million after-tax charge
for an early retirement program in 1995, net income would have been
$733.1 million, up 10%. These results were driven primarily by improved
income from railway operations, up $52.1 million, or 5% (excluding the
early retirement charge), and by greater nonoperating income, up $56.6
million, or 66%. Railway operating revenues increased $93.7 million, or
2%, while railway operating expenses, excluding the early retirement
charge, were up only $41.6 million, or 1%. Income from motor carrier
operations of $24.5 million was $2.4 million, or 11%, higher than in
1994. Nonoperating income of $141.8 million was up $56.6 million, due to
a $30.5 million ($18.8 million after-tax) gain resulting from the partial
redemption of a real estate partnership interest and a $26.2 million
increase in gains on property sales (see Note 2 on page 59). Interest
expense on debt was up $11.8 million, or 12%, largely a result of higher
rates of interest on commercial paper debt.

1994 Compared with 1993
- -----------------------
     Net income was $667.8 million in 1994, compared with $772.0 million
in 1993. However, 1993 net income was increased by $223.3 million,
related to the implementation of required accounting changes (see Note 1
on page 57), and reduced by $46.2 million for the prior years' effect of
a federal income tax rate increase (see Note 3 on page 60). Excluding the
effects of the 1993 accounting changes and the tax rate increase, 1993
net income was $594.9 million, and 1994 net income was up 12%.
     Income from railway operations produced most of the improvement,
increasing $128.0 million, or 14%. These results reflected a 5% increase
in railway operating revenues (largely due to higher traffic volume)
combined with only a 2% increase in railway operating expenses. Income
from motor carrier operations improved to $22.1 million in 1994, compared
with a $4.6 million loss in 1993, excluding the 1993 restructuring charge
(see Note 15 on page 73). Nonoperating income was $85.2 million, compared
with $136.8 million in 1993, principally a result of reduced gains on
sales of stock and property.

DETAILED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Railway Operating Revenues
- --------------------------
     Railway operating revenues were $4.01 billion in 1995, compared with
$3.92 billion in 1994 and $3.75 billion in 1993. The $93.7 million
improvement in 1995, compared with 1994, was largely attributable to
increases in the intermodal ($44.9 million), automotive ($22.0 million)
and metals/construction ($18.1 million) market groups. The $172.2 million
improvement in 1994, compared with 1993, was primarily attributable to
increases in the intermodal, coal and chemicals market groups.

          Condition and Results of Operations.  (continued)
          -----------------------------------

     Traffic volume changes in 1995 were mixed, with improvements in
automotive, agriculture, metals/construction and intermodal partially
offsetting declines in the other three market groups. Traffic volume
increased or remained steady for all market groups in 1994. These volume
gains accounted for most of the revenue improvement in 1995 and all the
improvement in 1994 as illustrated by the following table.

     Average revenue per unit rose in 1995 due to moderate rate
increases. The revenue per unit variance in 1994 was principally
attributable to growth in shorter haul and double-stack business, both of
which generally have lower average rates.
     COAL traffic volume declined 1%, and revenues were down 2%, from
1994. In 1995, coal revenues represented 31% of total railway operating
revenues, and 91% of coal shipments originated on NS' lines. As shown in
the following table, coal tonnage by type remained stable in 1995,
compared with 1994. However, utility coal tonnage in 1994 increased
significantly.

          Condition and Results of Operations.  (continued)
          -----------------------------------

     Utility coal traffic had been expected to grow in 1995, but instead
decreased slightly due to moderate weather throughout much of the NS
service region during the first half of the year and to sustained periods
of maximum generation from several Southeastern nuclear power plants. The
mild weather pattern actually began in third-quarter 1994, causing a
number of NS' utility customers to start 1995 with high coal inventories.
However, inventories began to normalize, as seasonal weather returned to
the service region in midsummer, and nuclear plants began to power down
for refueling and repairs in third-quarter 1995. Compliance with Phase I
of the Clean Air Act Amendments, which took effect on January 1, 1995,
increased shipments of both NS- and foreign-line-originated, low-sulfur
coal. A significant proportion of the mines served by NS produce coal
that satisfies both Phase I and the more stringent Phase II requirements,
which take effect on January 1, 2000.
     In 1994, utility coal traffic was up early in the year as a result
of bitter weather and the resulting depletion of coal stockpiles. The
pace at which 1994 outperformed 1993 slowed as the weather normalized.
New movements of western coal into Georgia also contributed to the 1994
increase.
     The near-term outlook for utility coal is favorable, as most NS-
served utilities began 1996 with normal or somewhat low inventory levels.
The long-term outlook is less certain due to the deregulation and ongoing
restructuring of the utility industry, although low-sulfur coal traffic
should increase with the approach of the Phase II deadline of the Clean
Air Act.
     Export coal traffic in 1995 benefited from the continued recovery of
the European steel-producing economy. Demand from other parts of the
world also improved. Brazil, Belgium, France, Romania and Japan took
increased amounts of NS coal. In addition, NS began handling
metallurgical coal for steel production in Mexico. Congestion and high
barge rates on the Mississippi River caused an increase in movements to
NS' coal piers in Norfolk, Va.
     Export coal traffic at the beginning of 1994 reflected the poor
demand also seen in 1993. Shipments remained somewhat depressed as a
result of the weak European economy and strong competition from other
producing countries. Economic recovery in Europe and Japan improved
demand for steel and electricity, and the coal supply-demand situation
tightened during 1994. As a result, delivery times were longer and prices
rose during 1994.
     A recent softening in world demand for steel could limit near-term
growth in export metallurgical coal shipments. However, demand for export
steam coal is increasing, and NS is working to increase participation in
this market.

          Condition and Results of Operations.  (continued)
          -----------------------------------

     Steel coal domestic traffic was up slightly in 1995 due to
completion of extended coke oven work at one facility and continued
strong demand for domestic coke for making steel. In 1994, traffic was
reduced by the closing of one coke battery. Advanced technologies that
allow production of steel with little or no coke could cause this market
to decline slowly over the long term. However, NS could participate in
the movement of non-coking coal used by technologies such as pulverized
coal injection.
     Other coal consists of traffic for industries that burn coal to
generate energy used in manufacturing processes and often for the
production of electricity for in-plant use and outside sales. Lower
demand for electricity due to mild weather, as discussed above, continued
to affect this market in 1995. In addition, some industries switched to
natural gas as a fuel source. This market is expected to remain stable in
coming years, as growth through innovative packaged delivery services
offsets some additional loss to natural gas.


     MERCHANDISE traffic volume rose 5%, and revenues increased by $112.2
million, or 4%, compared with 1994. Merchandise traffic volume in 1994
increased 8%, and revenues, excluding, for comparative purposes, the
effect of the Triple Crown Services Company (TCSC) partnership (see
discussion on page 41), increased by $151.3 million, or 6%, compared with
1993. All six market groups comprising merchandise traffic reported
increased revenues in 1995 over 1994 and in 1994 over 1993.
     PAPER/FOREST traffic declined 1%; however, revenues were up 3%,
compared with 1994. Paper and pulpwood products traffic was even with
1994, while lumber traffic suffered from weak housing starts in 1995. For
1994, paper/forest volume and revenues were about even with 1993,
reflecting weak paper production, severe winter weather and floods in
south Georgia. Some of the weakness in paper was offset by a gain in
lumber traffic due, in part, to the opening of five new lumber
distribution centers in 1994. Moderate growth is expected for 1996 based
on the anticipated completion of several wood-chip mills and an
improvement in housing starts.

- -------   -------------------------------------------------
          Condition and Results of Operations.  (continued)
          -----------------------------------

     CHEMICALS traffic and revenues showed little change compared with
1994. Increases for general chemicals were overshadowed by weakness in
the plastics and fertilizer markets. However, 1994 showed a 9% traffic
increase and an 8% revenue increase, compared with 1993. The demand for
chemicals increased in 1994, and shipments of fertilizer and plastics
were stronger than prior years. A resumption of moderate growth is
expected for 1996, as the fertilizer and plastics markets strengthen and
demand for liquefied petroleum gas grows.


     AUTOMOTIVE traffic rose 3%, and revenues--their highest in NS'
history--increased 5% over 1994. This growth occurred even though some
plants served by NS were shut down or operating at reduced capacity.
These effects were mitigated by strong production at selected plants that
produce popular cars and trucks. In 1994, automotive traffic had remained
steady, and revenues increased 1%, compared with 1993, due to retooling
downtime at four plants. Moderate growth is expected to continue in 1996,
as plant retoolings are completed and new plants come on line. The GM
plant at Wentzville, Mo., should resume production early in 1996 after
remaining down for two years. NS also should see more traffic from the
expanded Toyota plant at Georgetown, Ky.; from BMW's new facility at
Greer, S.C.; and in 1997, from the Mercedes plant under construction in
Tuscaloosa, Ala.


     AGRICULTURE traffic rose 2%, and revenues increased 3%, compared
with a strong 1994. This growth was driven by a 6% increase in grain and
soybean traffic, a result of higher shipments from the Midwest to the
Southeast primarily for the poultry industry.
     Agriculture traffic in 1994 rose 7%, and revenues increased 9%. This
performance reflected record corn and soybean harvests and improved car
utilization through greater use of 50- and 100-car unit trains. This
market group is expected to continue to grow as poultry consumption
increases, with a commensurate rise in demand for feed grain. Industrial
development efforts may bring several new feed mills on line in 1996.

          Condition and Results of Operations.  (continued)
          -----------------------------------

     METALS/CONSTRUCTION traffic rose slightly, and revenues were up 6%.
Most of the revenue increase was in the steel and aluminum markets,
driven by strong demand, improved pricing and traffic from a new steel
mini-mill in Butler, Ind. These results were partially offset by reduced
demand for construction products, reflecting postponement of some highway
projects and general weakness in residential construction.
Metals/construction traffic in 1994 was strong, with both volume and
revenues increasing 9%, compared with 1993. Most of the revenue gain was
in shipments of steel due to exceptionally strong industry demand.
Increased housing starts and new projects, such as at the Chesapeake Bay
Bridge Tunnel, may improve construction traffic in 1996. Moderate growth
is expected for metals.


     INTERMODAL volume rose 12%, and revenues increased 11%. Although
intermodal traffic levels nationwide declined in 1995, NS intermodal
achieved record levels of volume, revenues and profitability, led by
container shipments in both domestic and international service. During
1995, a seven-year agreement with Hanjin Shipping Company was signed
under which NS will handle nearly all of Hanjin's international container
business in NS' territory east of the Mississippi River. EMP, the
container equipment-sharing arrangement with Union Pacific and Conrail,
contributed significantly to domestic growth. Almost all the increase in
international container business was attributable to new services,
thereby increasing NS' market share. Domestic business was augmented by
growth in the trucking segment, as both truckload and less-than-truckload
companies increased their use of NS intermodal. Additionally, intermodal
marketing companies increased their business on NS. Service and facility
improvements are expected to result in a further market-share increase in
1996.

          -----------------------------------

     Intermodal traffic in 1994 rose 13%, and revenues rose 9%, compared
with 1993. However, revenues reflect the effect of the formation in April
1993 of TCSC. This partnership provides RoadRailer (RT) and domestic
container services previously offered by a wholly owned subsidiary of NS.
Because NS owns only 50% of TCSC, its revenues are not consolidated. NS'
intermodal revenues include only revenues for rail service NS provides
the partnership. Excluding this partnership effect, 1994 intermodal
revenues increased 14%, compared with 1993. As was the case in 1995, the
1994 growth in intermodal was led by an increase in container business.
The export container segment improved, as the economies in Europe
recovered and countries in the Asia/Pacific region experienced rapid
growth in production. Revenues from domestic container movements also
improved, as NS increased its market share. Much of this growth was
related to aggressive facility and transit-time improvements, including
expanding or upgrading five terminal facilities.


Railway Operating Expenses
- --------------------------
     Railway operating expenses in 1995 totaled $2.95 billion, an
increase of $75.2 million. However, 1995 expenses included a $33.6
million charge for an early retirement program (see Note 10 on page 67).
Excluding the early retirement charge, 1995 railway operating expenses
were up only $41.6 million, or 1%, on a 3% increase in traffic volume.
Similarly, railway operating expenses in 1994 were $2.87 billion, a 2%
increase, compared with 1993, despite a 7% increase in traffic volume.
     As a result, the NS railway operating ratio, which measures the
percentage of revenues consumed by expenses, was a record 72.7 (excluding
the early retirement charge) and continues to be the best among the major
railroads in the United States.

          Condition and Results of Operations.  (continued)
          -----------------------------------

     COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS, which represents about half of total
railway operating expenses, increased 8% in 1995 and declined 1% in 1994.
     The 1995 increase was principally a result of: (1) the early
retirement charge of $33.6 million; (2) higher wages; (3) increased
performance-based compensation accruals, particularly those linked to the
NS stock price, which rose nearly $19 per share in 1995; and (4) higher
health care costs for agreement employees.
     The 1994 decline was principally due to (1) lower accruals for
performance-based compensation plans as a result of a lower stock price;
(2) reduced accruals for postretirement benefits resulting from a change
in the benefit plan's creditable service period (see Note 11 on page 69);
(3) the expiration of the Railroad Retirement Repayment Tax in June 1993;
(4) the effect of the early retirement program in 1993 (see Note 10 on
page 67); and (5) productivity improvements as a result of continuing
reductions in train crew sizes.
     Materials, services and rents consists of items used for the
maintenance of the railroad's lines, structures and equipment; the cost
of services purchased from outside contractors, including the net costs
of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other railroads; and the
net cost of equipment rentals. This category decreased 6% in 1995 but
increased 2% in 1994.
     The 1995 decrease of $41.9 million reflected initiatives to improve
asset utilization that resulted in (1) re-engineering of rail-line and
freight-car maintenance practices that reduced repair and maintenance
expenses and facilitated the closure of two repair facilities; (2)
reduced locomotive repair costs due to older locomotives' being replaced
with new units; (3) disposition of excess freight cars (see "Cash used
for investing activities" on page 46), resulting in a reduction in the
number of freight cars to be maintained; and (4) short-term leasing of
certain older locomotives to other railroads, which reduced net equipment
rental expense. Also contributing to the improvement was a decline in
equipment rental expenses, resulting from the partial deprescription
(deregulation by the ICC) of car-hire rates among railroads, which began
in 1994. These favorable results were somewhat offset by increased
expenses related to the 12% growth in intermodal traffic.
     The 1994 increase of $10.7 million was principally due to higher
joint-facility and leased-road costs and to increased locomotive repair
costs, resulting mostly from higher traffic volume. However, a decrease
in other railroads' use of NS' facilities also contributed to the
increase in joint-facilities expense. Partially offsetting these
increases was a decline in equipment rent expenses resulting from the
partial deprescription of car-hire rates.
     Depreciation expense (see Note 1 "Properties" on page 57 for NS'
depreciation policy) was up 4% in 1995 and 3% in 1994. The increases in
both periods were due to property additions, reflecting substantial
levels of capital spending over the last several years.
     Diesel fuel costs rose 1% in 1995 and 5% in 1994. The 1995 increase
was primarily due to a small increase in the average price paid for
diesel fuel. Because even fuel-efficient locomotives consume substantial
quantities of diesel fuel, a slight price increase translates into large
cost increases. The increase in 1994 diesel fuel costs was entirely
driven by higher consumption, a result of a 7% increase in carloadings.
On average, fuel prices in 1994 were slightly lower than in 1993.
     Casualties and other claims (including estimates of costs related to
personal injury, property damage and environmental matters) decreased 10%
in 1995 but increased 13% in 1994 over 1993. Both of these fluctuations
primarily were attributable to environmental clean-up costs in 1994
associated with a tankcar leak.
     The largest component of "Casualties and other claims" is personal
injury expense. Although there has been a favorable trend in the number
of accidental injuries since 1990, much of the financial benefit from
this decline unfortunately has been offset by higher costs related to non-
accidental "occupational" claims and by an increase in the cost of third-
party injury claims arising from accidents at grade crossings. NS is
actively involved in efforts to reduce the risk of all accidents and is
placing particular emphasis on programs involving grade-crossing safety.

          Condition and Results of Operations.  (continued)
          -----------------------------------

     The rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to job-related
accidental injury and occupational claims because of an outmoded law, the
Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), originally passed in 1908 and
applicable only to railroads. This law, which covers employees' claims
for on-the-job injuries, produces results that are unpredictable and
inconsistent, at a far greater cost to the rail industry than the no-
fault workers' compensation system to which non-rail competitors are
universally subject. The railroads have been unsuccessful so far in
efforts to persuade Congress to replace the FELA with a no-fault workers'
compensation system.
     Other expenses increased 4% in 1995, and increased 12% in 1994. The
1995 increase was due to higher sales, use and franchise taxes. The 1994
increase was due to favorable property tax settlements in 1993 and to
higher relocation expenses in 1994 related to new job assignments
following the early retirement program in 1993.

Motor Carrier Results
- ---------------------
     Motor carrier operating income was $24.5 million, compared with
$22.1 million in 1994 and with an operating loss of $54.9 million in
1993. The large loss reported in 1993 was almost entirely attributable to
a restructuring of the business as described below. In 1995, because
certain expenses were below original estimates, $3.9 million of the
restructuring charge taken in 1993 was reversed. The ongoing operations,
comprised of Relocation Services (RS) and High Value Products (HVP),
produced operating income of $20.6 million in 1995, $22.1 million in
1994, and $14.4 million in 1993.
     A restructuring decision was made in 1993 due to persistently poor
performance in the general commodities operations despite repeated
turnaround efforts. The restructuring led to the liquidation of the
Commercial Transport (CT) Division and the sale of Tran-Star (TS), a
refrigerated carrier. A restructuring charge of $50.3 million was
recorded in 1993 (see Note 15 on page 73).

     RS' revenues depend on four primary segments of household goods
transportation: corporate relocation accounts, individual shipments,
military, and international shipments. RS' 1995 revenues decreased 4%
from 1994 after having increased 3% over 1993. In 1995, international
shipments and domestic corporate account business gained 6% and 5%,
respectively. These gains were more than offset, however, by lower
individual business (6%), lower military volume (17%) and decreased
Canadian volume, primarily military related (30%). Revenue per shipment
improved nearly 3% in 1995. In 1994, volume gains were achieved in the
military and C.O.D. segments, although prices were flat. Domestic market-
share gains were partially offset by reduced revenues from

  PAGE 44


Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
- -------   -------------------------------------------------
          Condition and Results of Operations.  (continued)
          -----------------------------------

Canadian operations. The total number of household-goods moves industry-
wide has declined about 1% per year in each of the past six years.
Changes in domestic and Canadian policy relating to military staffing
levels may result in additional reduction in the overall number of moves
available in the industry. There are six major van lines in this market,
and competition is likely to remain intense.
     HVP's main line of business is transporting office products,
sensitive equipment, and exhibits and displays. A Customized Logistics
Services (CLS) segment provides integrated logistics services. A
Blanketwrap segment, formerly part of the discontinued CT Division,
provides specialized handling of uncartoned truckload freight. HVP's
revenues increased 2%, compared with a strong 1994, and 29% in 1994,
compared with 1993. Traditional HVP business, Blanketwrap and CLS
experienced continued growth with their core accounts in 1995. These
gains were partially offset by a decrease in air-freight revenue due to
the rationalization of certain service centers. The increase in 1994 was
due to (1) the inclusion of Blanketwrap, which was in HVP for only two
months of 1993, and (2) to CLS, which was awarded a major logistics
contract by IBM in third-quarter 1993. In an effort to improve timeliness
and efficiency, HVP expanded its distribution network in 1995 and
increased scheduled services. Additional growth in the CLS segment is
possible, as more shippers look to logistics providers like NAVL to
provide logistics expertise to reduce overall shipping and handling
costs.
     Motor carrier operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were
96.3%, 96.7%, and 107.7%, respectively, in 1995, 1994 and 1993. The
highly unfavorable 1993 operating ratio was principally related to losses
sustained in the truckload operations and the restructuring charge
associated with discontinuing those operations.
     NAVL's ongoing operations generated operating ratios of 96.9%, 96.7%
and 97.5%, respectively, in 1995, 1994 and 1993. Intense price
competition in the motor carrier industry is likely to keep margins at a
modest level and will require carriers to continue to focus on cost
reductions.

Income Taxes
- ------------
     Income tax expense in 1995 was $402.0 million for an effective rate
of 36.1%, compared with an effective rate of 36.3% in 1994 and 38.9% in
1993. Absent the federal income tax rate increase in 1993 (see Note 3 on
page 60), income tax expense that year would have been $295.8 million for
an effective rate of 32.9%.
     The below statutory rate in 1995 results from investments in
corporate-owned life insurance and coal-seam gas properties, and
favorable adjustments upon filing the 1994 tax returns. The below
statutory rate in 1994 was due to favorable adjustments resulting from
settlement of federal income tax years 1988 and 1989, an adjustment to
the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and a favorable
adjustment upon filing the 1993 tax returns. Deferred tax expense was an
unusually high proportion of total tax expense in 1994. A corresponding
reduction is reflected in 1994 current tax expense for the effects of
expenditures that affect book and tax accounts in different years,
primarily in the areas of compensation, motor carrier restructuring and
property.
     The low effective rate for 1993 (excluding the rate increase) was
partially due to tax benefits related to the motor carrier restructuring
(see Note 15 on page 73). Also in 1993, current tax expense increased and
deferred tax expense decreased because of tax payments made in
anticipation of Revenue Agent Reports for the 1988-1989 federal tax audit
(see Note 3 on page 60 for the components of income tax expense).

Accounting Changes and New Accounting Pronouncements
- ----------------------------------------------------
     1994 - Effective January 1, 1994, NS adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities" (SFAS 115). SFAS 115 did not have a significant
effect on NS (see also Note 1 on page 58).

  PAGE 45


Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
- -------   -------------------------------------------------
          Condition and Results of Operations.  (continued)
          -----------------------------------

     1993 - Effective January 1, 1993, NS adopted required accounting for
postretirement benefits other than pensions, postemployment benefits and
income taxes (see Note 1 on page 58 for a discussion of these accounting
changes). The net cumulative effect of these non-cash adjustments
increased 1993 net income by $223.3 million, or $1.60 per share.
     NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS - In March 1995, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement No. 121, "Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed Of" (SFAS 121). This standard establishes the accounting and
reporting requirements for recognizing and measuring impairment of long-
lived assets to be either held and used or held for disposal. SFAS 121 is
effective for years beginning after December 15, 1995. NS does not expect
SFAS 121 to have a material effect on its financial statements.
     In October 1995, the FASB issued Statement No. 123, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation" (SFAS 123). This standard defines a fair-value-
based method of accounting for stock-based compensation plans. However,
the standard also allows measurement of compensation cost using the
intrinsic-value-based method of accounting prescribed in Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB 25). Companies that choose to retain
APB 25 for measurement will be required to provide pro forma footnote
disclosures effective for 1996 financial statements. NS expects to
continue recording stock-based compensation costs based on APB 25 and,
beginning in 1996, to provide the pro forma disclosures required under
SFAS 123.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     FINANCIAL CONDITION refers to the assets, liabilities and
stockholders' equity of an organization (see Consolidated Balance Sheets
on page 54). LIQUIDITY refers to the ability of an organization to
generate adequate amounts of cash, principally from operating results or
through borrowing power, to meet its short-term and long-term cash
requirements (see Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on page 55).
CAPITAL RESOURCES refers to the ability of an organization to raise funds
through the sale of either debt or equity (stock) securities.

     CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, which is NS' principal source
of liquidity, increased $93.1 million, or 8%, in 1995, compared with 1994
and $269.7 million, or 31%, in 1994, compared with 1993. Since the NS
consolidation in 1982, cash provided by operating activities has been
sufficient to fund dividend requirements, debt repayments and a
significant portion of capital spending. The improvement in 1995 was
primarily a result of increased income from operations (excluding the
early retirement charge, a non-cash item) and improved billing and
collection of receivables. The 1994 increase was largely attributable to
increased income from operations and to lower income tax payments.
  PAGE 46


Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
- -------   -------------------------------------------------
          Condition and Results of Operations.  (continued)
          -----------------------------------

     Implementation of the labor portion of the 1991 special charge also
contributed to the fluctuations in cash provided by operations. In 1995,
1994 and 1993, $29.3 million, $41.9 million and $36.1 million,
respectively, were for such labor costs. In 1993, failure to reach
agreement on terms for certain further savings led to a partial reversal
of the 1991 special charge (see Note 16 on page 74). Looking ahead, the
labor portion of the special charge is expected to require approximately
$30 million in 1996 to achieve productivity gains permitted by the
agreements. NS regards this cash outflow as an investment because, in
view of the high cost of labor and fringe benefits, these payments
produce significant future savings. In 1995, it is estimated that NS'
expenses were reduced by $160 million as a result of these programs and,
upon full implementation, there should be additional savings of about
$10 million per year.


     CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES increased 16% in 1995, compared
with 1994, and was up 4% in 1994, compared with 1993. Property additions
account for most of the spending in this category.


  PAGE 47


Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
- -------   -------------------------------------------------
          Condition and Results of Operations.  (continued)
          -----------------------------------

     Since 1988, NS has rebodied more than 20,500 coal cars and plans to
continue that program at the rate of about 3,200 cars per year for the
next several years. This work, performed at NS' Roanoke Car Shop,
converts hopper cars into high-capacity steel gondolas or hoppers. As a
result, the remaining service life of the freight car fleet is greater
than is inferable from the increasing average age shown in the table
above.
     Efforts to hold down capital spending while increasing business are
ongoing as NS seeks to maximize utilization of its assets. In this
connection, NS began an orderly disposition of up to 17,000 freight cars
in October 1994. Through the end of 1995, 7,272 of these cars were sold,
with proceeds of $42 million included in "Property sales and other
transactions" in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In 1995 and
1993, this line item reflected proceeds from large land sales (see Note 2
on page 59).
     For 1996, NS is planning $708 million of capital spending, of which
$699 million is for railway projects and $9 million is for motor carrier
property. NS anticipates that a portion of its locomotive acquisitions
will be financed using capitalized leases similar to the 1995 leases (see
Note 6 on page 63). In 1996, equipment financing needs are expected to be
somewhat lower than in 1995, as proceeds from the sale of freight cars
may be used for some locomotive acquisitions. Barring unforeseen events,
total rail and motor carrier capital spending are expected to continue to
be similar to 1994 and 1995 levels.
     In 1994, large borrowings on corporate-owned life insurance,
reflected in "Investment sales and other transactions" in the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, offset much of the use of cash for
property additions in that year.
     CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES declined 3% in 1995, compared
with 1994, but increased 56% in 1994, compared with 1993. The reduction
in 1995 was primarily attributable to lower debt repayments; 1994 had
included the maturity of a large mortgage (see Note 6 on page 63 for debt
maturities). The 1994 increase was a result of increased purchases under
the stock purchase program (see Note 13 on page 73). Cash spent since
1987 to purchase and retire stock totaled $2.9 billion, of which $338.2
million, $344.8 million and $138.1 million was spent in 1995, 1994 and
1993, respectively. Through December 31, 1995, NS had purchased 63.9
million of a total 65 million shares authorized under the stock purchase
programs.
     On January 23, 1996, the NS Board authorized a new program to
acquire up to 30 million additional shares of common stock. NS plans to
complete these purchases, dependent on market conditions and other
factors, by the end of the year 2000. Some debt is expected to be issued
to finance a portion of these purchases. Also on January 23, 1996, NS
increased its quarterly dividend, payable in March, from 52 cents to 56
cents per share. The effect of this 7.7% dividend increase on cash
outflows will be offset, to some extent, by a reduction in the number of
shares outstanding as a result of the stock purchase programs.

          Condition and Results of Operations.  (continued)
          -----------------------------------

Hedging Activities
- ------------------
     Certain NS subsidiaries have entered into hedging transactions
relating to diesel fuel purchases, foreign exchange transactions and
interest rate swaps. The notional amount of diesel fuel and foreign
exchange agreements settled from 1993 through 1995 was less than $2
million, and outstanding agreements at December 31, 1995, were less than
$5 million. As discussed under "Capital Leases" in Note 6 on page 63, NS
has made limited use of interest rate swaps in connection with certain
equipment financings.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

     NS is subject to various jurisdictions' environmental laws and
regulations. It is NS' policy to record a liability where such liability
or loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Claims, if any,
against third parties for recovery of clean-up costs incurred by NS are
reflected as receivables in the balance sheet and are not netted against
the associated NS liability. Environmental engineers participate in
ongoing evaluations of all identified sites, and--after consulting with
counsel--any necessary adjustments to initial liability estimates are
made. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed
of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy.
     Operating expenses for environmental protection totaled
approximately $13 million in 1995 and are anticipated to increase
somewhat in 1996. Capital expenditures for environmental projects
amounted to approximately $8 million in 1995 and are expected to be at
the same level in 1996. As of December 31, 1995, NS' balance sheet
included a reserve for environmental exposures in the amount of $44
million (of which $12 million is accounted for as a current liability),
which is NS' present best estimate of ultimate liability at 96 identified
locations. On that date, eight sites accounted for $16 million of the
reserve, and no individual site was considered to be material. NS
anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years;
however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period.
     At many of the 96 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in
conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as
potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state
statutes, which often impose joint and several liability for clean-up
costs.
     At one such site, the EPA alleged in 1995 that The Alabama
Great Southern Railroad Company ("AGS"), a subsidiary of NS' rail
subsidiary, is responsible, along with several other entities
believed to be financially solvent, for past and future clean-up
and monitoring costs at the Bayou Bonfouca NPL Superfund site
located in Slidell, La. The site was owned by the parent of an
AGS predecessor from 1882 until 1902. Bridge timbers used in the
1882 construction of the predecessor's bridge across Lake
Pontchartrain were treated at the site. On March 20, 1996, NS
learned that the United States filed suit on March 11 to recover
$100 million and other unspecified amounts from AGS and from some
of--but not from all--the entities it earlier identified as
potentially responsible parties. AGS believes it never owned,
operated or had any other culpable connection to the site and
denies responsibility; however, because the amount of liability,
if any, that ultimately may be assessed against NS or AGS cannot
be estimated reliably at this time, the materiality of such
amount to NS' financial position, results of operation or
liquidity in a particular quarter or year cannot be evaluated.
     With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS
or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS' ultimate
potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all
such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs
  PAGE 49


Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
- -------   -------------------------------------------------
          Condition and Results of Operations.  (continued)
          -----------------------------------

of currently available clean-up techniques, the likely development of new
clean-up technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the
nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participant's
share of any estimated loss (and that participant's ability to bear it)
and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability.
     The risk of incurring environmental liability--for acts and
omissions, past, present and future--is inherent in the railroad
business. Some of the commodities, particularly those classified as
hazardous materials, in NS' traffic mix can pose special risks that NS
and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize. In addition, several NS
subsidiaries own or have owned in the past land holdings used as
operating property, or which are leased or may have been leased and
operated by others, or held for sale. Because certain conditions may
exist on these properties related to environmental problems that are
latent or undisclosed, there can be no assurance that NS will not incur
liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and
materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably now. Moreover, lawsuits
and claims involving these and other now-unidentified environmental sites
and matters are likely to arise from time to time. The resulting
liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition,
results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.
     However, based on its assessments of the facts and circumstances now
known and, after consulting with its legal counsel, Management believes
that it has recorded appropriate estimates of liability for those
environmental matters of which the Corporation is aware. Further,
Management believes that it is unlikely that any identified matters,
either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect
on NS' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

INFLATION

     Generally accepted accounting principles require the use of
historical cost in preparing financial statements. This approach
disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property.
NS, a capital-intensive company, has approximately $13.6 billion invested
in such assets. The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the
related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the
amounts reported on the basis of historical cost.

INDUSTRY TRENDS

- - A tentative settlement was reached with the United Transportation
  Union, which represents the largest number of employees in the
  railroad industry. The settlement requires ratification by the members
  before acceptance. The negotiation of this settlement demonstrated
  that national handling produces the quickest path to agreement.
  Negotiations with the other unions are progressing.

- - NS and other railroads are continuing to seek opportunities to share
  traffic routes and facilities, furthering the goals of providing
  seamless service to customers and maximizing efficiency of the
  respective railroads.

- - NS is closely monitoring recent merger and consolidation activities
  within the railroad industry in light of its own long-term strategic
  objectives to protect the interests of its stockholders.

- - NS and the rail industry are continuing their efforts to replace the
  FELA with no-fault workers' compensation laws comparable to those
  covering employees in other industries.

              NORFOLK SOUTHERN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
               Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The following notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial
statements.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Description of Business
- -----------------------
     Norfolk Southern Corporation is a Virginia-based holding company
engaged principally in the transportation of freight by rail, primarily
in the Southeast and Midwest, and the operation of a motor carrier
providing household moving and specialized freight handling services in
the United States and Canada. The consolidated financial statements
include Norfolk Southern Corporation (Norfolk Southern) and its majority-
owned and controlled subsidiaries (collectively NS). The major
subsidiaries are Norfolk Southern Railway Company and North American Van
Lines, Inc. (NAVL). All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
     Rail freight consists of raw materials, intermediate products and
finished goods classified in the following market groups: coal,
paper/forest, chemicals, automotive, agriculture, metals/construction and
intermodal. All groups are approximately equal in size based on revenues
except for coal, which accounts for about one third of railway revenues.
Ultimate destinations for some of the freight and a portion of the coal
shipped are outside the United States.

Use of Estimates
- ----------------
     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires Management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Cash Equivalents
- ----------------
     "Cash equivalents" are highly liquid investments purchased three
months or less from maturity.

Investments
- -----------
     "Investments" are reported at amortized cost or fair value depending
upon their classification as held-to-maturity, trading or available-for-
sale securities in accordance with SFAS No. 115 (see "Required Accounting
Changes" below).

Materials and Supplies
- ----------------------
     "Materials and supplies," consisting mainly of fuel oil and items
for maintenance of property and equipment, are stated at average cost.
The cost of materials and supplies expected to be used in capital
additions or improvements is included in "Properties."

  PAGE 58


Item 8.   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. (continued)
- -------   -------------------------------------------

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

Properties
- ----------
     "Properties" are stated principally at cost and are depreciated
using group depreciation. Rail is primarily depreciated on the basis of
use measured by gross ton miles. The effect of this method is to write
off these assets over 42 years on average. Other properties are
depreciated generally using the straight-line method over estimated
service lives at annual rates that range from 1% to 25%. In 1995, the
overall depreciation rate averaged 2.7% for roadway and 4.3% for
equipment. NS capitalizes interest on major capital projects during the
period of their construction. Maintenance expense is recognized when
repairs are performed. When properties, other than land and non-rail
assets, are sold or retired in the ordinary course of business, the cost
of the assets, net of sale proceeds or salvage, is charged to accumulated
depreciation rather than recognized through income. Gains and losses on
disposal of land and non-rail assets are included in other income (see
Note 2).

Revenue Recognition
- -------------------
     Revenue is recognized proportionally as a shipment moves from origin
to destination.

Earnings Per Share
- ------------------
     "Earnings per share" in any period are computed by dividing net
income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
that period. Decreases in the number of shares outstanding are the result
of the stock purchase program described in Note 13.

Required Accounting Changes
- ---------------------------
     1994 - Effective January 1, 1994, NS adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities" (SFAS 115), which addresses the accounting and
reporting for investments in equity securities that have readily
determinable fair values and for all investments in debt securities. The
implementation of SFAS 115 had no impact on earnings and resulted in a
small change in stockholders' equity, reflecting unrealized market
changes in certain investments, net of the related deferred taxes.
     1993 - Effective January 1, 1993, NS adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions" (SFAS 106), and Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits" (SFAS 112). SFAS 106 requires accrual of the cost of specified
health care and death benefits over an employee's creditable service
period rather than, as was the previously prevailing practice, accounting
for such expenses on a pay-as-you-go basis. SFAS 112 requires recognition
of the cost of benefits payable to former or inactive employees after
employment but before retirement on an accrual basis. For NS, such
postemployment benefits consist principally of obligations under the long-
term disability plan. NS recognized the effects of these changes in
accounting on the immediate recognition basis. The cumulative effect on
years prior to 1993 of adopting SFAS 106 and SFAS 112 increased pretax
expenses $360.2 million ($223.8 million after-tax), and $31.8 million
($19.7 million after-tax), respectively (see also Note 11).

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

     Also effective January 1, 1993, NS adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109).
SFAS 109 requires a liability approach for measuring deferred tax assets
and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement and
tax bases of assets and liabilities at each balance sheet date using
enacted tax rates in effect when those differences are expected to
reverse. The cumulative effect on years prior to 1993 of adopting SFAS
109 increased net income $466.8 million (see also Note 3).
     The effect on net income and earnings per share of implementing the
accounting changes was to increase net income and earnings per share
$223.3 million and $1.60 per share, respectively.

3. INCOME TAXES

1993 Federal Income Tax Rate Increase
- -------------------------------------
     In August 1993, Congress enacted the Revenue Reconciliation Act of
1993, which increased the federal corporate income tax rate from 34% to
35%, retroactive to January 1, 1993. The tax rate increase had two
components that, as required by SFAS 109, were recognized in 1993
earnings.
     The first component relates to the increased income tax rate's
effect on 1993 earnings, which increased the provision for income taxes
and reduced net income by $7.9 million, or $0.06 per share. The second
component increased the provision for the net deferred tax liability in
the Consolidated Balance Sheet, which reduced that year's net income by
$46.2 million, or $0.33 per share. Excluding this one-time, non-cash
charge of $0.33 per share, 1993 earnings per share before accounting
changes would have been $4.27.

3. INCOME TAXES (continued)

Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Reviews
- --------------------------------------
     Consolidated federal income tax returns have been examined and
Revenue Agent Reports have been received for all years up to and
including 1989. The consolidated federal income tax returns for 1990
through 1992 are being audited by the IRS. Management believes that
adequate provision has been made for any additional taxes and interest
thereon that might arise as a result of these examinations.

Tax Benefit Leases
- ------------------
     In January 1995, the United States Tax Court issued a preliminary
decision that would disallow some of the tax benefits a subsidiary of NS
purchased from a third party pursuant to a safe harbor lease agreement in
1981. Management continues to believe that NS ultimately should incur no
loss from this decision, because the lease agreement provides for full
indemnification if any such disallowance is sustained.

3. INCOME TAXES (continued)

Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities
- -----------------------------------
     Certain items are reported in different periods for financial
reporting and income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
were recorded in recognition of these differences in accordance with SFAS
109.

     Except for amounts for which a valuation allowance is provided,
Management believes the deferred tax assets will be realized. The
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of January 1, 1993, was
$9.8 million. The net change in the total valuation allowance was a $0.1
million increase for 1995, a $9.5 million decrease for 1994 and a $1.1
million increase for 1993.

  PAGE 63


Item 8.   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. (continued)
- -------   -------------------------------------------



Capitalized Interest
- --------------------
     Total interest cost incurred on debt in 1995, 1994 and 1993 was
$127.4 million, $119.4 million and $120.2 million, respectively, of which
$14.0 million, $17.8 million and $21.6 million was capitalized.


6. DEBT

Commercial Paper Program
- ------------------------
     NS' commercial paper debt totaled $518.0 million and $517.3 million
as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
     Commercial paper debt is due within one year, but $500 million has
been classified as long-term because NS has the ability through its $500
million revolving credit back-up facility to convert this obligation into
longer term debt. NS intends to refinance the commercial paper either by
issuing additional commercial paper or by replacing commercial paper
notes with long-term debt.
     The $500 million credit agreement is effective through 1999,
provides for interest on borrowings at prevailing rates and contains
customary financial covenants, including principally a minimum tangible
net worth requirement of $3.3 billion and a restriction on the creation
or assumption of certain liens.

Item 8.   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. (continued)
- -------   -------------------------------------------

6. DEBT (continued)


Shelf Registration
- ------------------
     In 1991, NS filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a
shelf registration statement on Form S-3 covering the issuance of up to
$750 million principal amount of unsecured debt securities. In March
1991, NS issued and sold $250 million principal amount of its 9% notes
due March 1, 2021. In February 1992, NS issued and sold $250 million
principal amount of its 7-7/8% notes due February 15, 2004. These notes
are not redeemable prior to maturity and are not entitled to any sinking
fund.

Capital Leases Obligations
- --------------------------
     During the first quarter of 1995, an NS rail subsidiary entered into
capital leases covering new locomotives. The related capital lease
obligations totaling $104.5 million were reflected in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet as debt and, because they were non-cash transactions, were
excluded from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The lease
obligations carry an average stated interest rate of 8.4% but were
converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap
agreements. The interest rates on these obligations are based on the six-
month London Interbank Offered Rate and are reset every six months with
changes in interest rates accounted for as an adjustment of interest
expense. As a result, NS is exposed to the market risk associated with
fluctuations in interest rates. To date, while such rate fluctuations
have been nominal, their effects have been favorable. Counterparties to
the interest rate swap agreements are major financial institutions
believed by Management to be credit-worthy. NS' use of interest rate
swaps has been limited to those discussed above.

10. PENSION PLANS

     Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries have defined benefit
pension plans that principally cover salaried employees. Pension benefits
are based primarily on years of creditable service with NS and
compensation rates near retirement. Contributions to the plans are made
on the basis of not less than the minimum funding standards set forth in
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. Assets
in the plans consist mainly of common stocks.

10. PENSION PLANS (continued)

Early Retirement Programs
- -------------------------
     During 1995 and 1993, NS completed voluntary early retirement
programs for salaried employees. The principal benefit for those who
participated in these programs was enhanced pension benefits, which are
reflected in the accumulated benefit obligation. The charge for these
programs is included in "Compensation and benefits" expense and was 
$33.6 million in 1995 (including $8.3 million related to postretirement
benefits other than pensions) and $42.4 million in 1993. The 1995 program
was accepted by 272 employees; the 1993 program, by 378 employees.

401(k) Plans
- ------------
     Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries provide 401(k) savings
plans for employees. Under the plans, NS matches a portion of the
employee contributions, subject to applicable limitations. NS' expenses
under these plans were $7.0 million, $5.1 million and $5.2 million in
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.


11. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

     Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries provide specified health
care and death benefits to eligible retired employees and their
dependents. Under the present plans, which may be amended or terminated
at NS' option, a defined percentage of health care expenses is covered,
reduced by any deductibles, co-payments, Medicare payments and, in some
cases, coverage provided by other group insurance policies. The cost of
such health care coverage to a retiree may be determined, in part, by the
retiree's years of creditable service with NS prior to retirement. Death
benefits are determined based on various factors, including, in some
cases, salary at time of retirement.
     NS continues to fund benefit costs principally on a pay-as-you-go
basis. However, in 1991, NS established a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary
Association (VEBA) account to fund a portion of the cost of future health
care benefits for retirees. NS last made a corporate contribution of $10
million in 1994 to the VEBA.
     Effective January 1, 1994, NS amended the attribution period for
postretirement health care benefits. The amendment generally provides for
benefits to be determined ratably over a 10-year period based on
creditable service commencing at age 45, or from date of hire if
employment began after age 45. The amendment reduced the accumulated
postretirement health care benefit obligation by $90 million, which will
be amortized as a reduction in annual cost on a pro rata basis over a six-
year period.

11. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS (continued)


  PAGE 71


Item 8.   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. (continued)
- -------   -------------------------------------------

11. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS (continued)

     For measurement purposes, an 11% increase in the per capita cost of
covered health care benefits was assumed for 1996. The rate was assumed
to decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of 5.5% and remain at that
level for 2005 and thereafter. The health care cost trend rate has a
significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements.
To illustrate, increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by one
percentage point in each year would increase the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 1995, by about 
$35 million and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components 
of net postretirement benefit cost for the year 1995 by about $4 million.
     The weighted-average discount rate used in determining the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, the salary increase
assumption and the long-term rate of return on plan assets are the same
as those used for the pension plans (see table of rate assumptions in
Note 10).
     The VEBA trust holding the plan assets is not expected to be subject
to federal income taxes, as the assets are invested entirely in trust-
owned life insurance.
     Under collective bargaining agreements, NS and certain subsidiaries
participate in a multi-employer benefit plan, which provides certain
postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to eligible union
employees. Premiums under this plan are expensed as incurred and amounted
to $3.7 million, $4.8 million and $5.3 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993,
respectively.


12. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

     Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan approved by stockholders at their
1995 annual meeting, a disinterested committee of the Board of Directors
may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), and
performance share units (PSUs), up to a maximum 17,675,000 shares of
Norfolk Southern common stock. Grants of SARs and PSUs result in charges
to earnings, while grants of stock options have no effect on earnings.
Options may be granted for a term not to exceed 10 years but may not be
exercised prior to the first anniversary date of grant. Options are
exercisable at the fair market value of Norfolk Southern stock on the
date of grant.
     The plan also permits the payment--on a current or a deferred basis
and in cash or in stock--of dividend equivalents on shares of common
stock covered by options or PSUs granted after December 31, 1989, in an
amount commensurate with dividends paid on common stock. Tax absorption
payments, in an amount estimated to equal the federal and state income
taxes applicable to shares of common stock issued subject to a share
retention agreement, also are authorized. Dividend equivalents and tax
absorption payments, if made, result in charges to operating expenses.
     Through 1991, SARs were granted on a one-for-one basis in tandem
with certain stock options. Upon the exercise of an SAR, the optionee
receives in common stock or cash or both the amount by which the fair
market value of common stock on the exercise date exceeds the option
price. Exercise of an SAR or option cancels any related option/SAR.
Because of regulations issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission
in 1991, plan participants surrendered, without cash or other
consideration, all outstanding SARs granted after 1988. Future grants of
SARs are not anticipated at this time. SARs outstanding as of each year
end were as follows:  46,562 in 1995; 74,519 in 1994; and 95,852 in 1993.

12. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (continued)

Performance Share Units
- -----------------------
     PSUs were added to the Long-Term Incentive Plan as approved in 1989
and amended in 1995. PSUs entitle participants to earn shares of common
stock at the end of a three-year performance cycle based upon achievement
of certain predetermined corporate performance goals. PSU grants totaled
252,500 in 1995; 163,000 in 1994; and 160,500 in 1993. Shares earned and
issued may be subject to share retention agreements and held by NS for up
to five years.

  PAGE 73


Item 8.   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. (continued)
- -------   -------------------------------------------

13. STOCK PURCHASE PROGRAMS

     Since 1987, the Board of Directors has authorized the purchase and
retirement of up to 65 million shares of common stock. Purchases under
the programs have been made with internally generated cash, and with
proceeds from the sale of commercial paper notes and from the issuance of
long-term debt.
     The decreases in the average number of outstanding common shares are
the result of these purchase programs. Since the first purchases in
December 1987 and through December 31, 1995, NS has purchased and retired
63,932,000 shares of its common stock under these programs at a cost of
$2.9 billion. Future purchase decisions are dependent on market
conditions, the economy, cash needs and alternative investment
opportunities.
     On January 23, 1996, the NS Board authorized a new program to
acquire up to 30 million additional shares of common stock.


14. FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

     The fair values of "Cash and cash equivalents," "Short-term
investments," "Accounts receivable," "Short-term debt" and "Accounts
payable" approximate carrying values because of the short maturity of
these financial instruments. "Short-term investments" are reported at
fair value in accordance with SFAS 115 (see Note 1). At December 31, 1995
and 1994, all "short-term investments" were designated as available for
sale.
     The fair value of long-term "Investments" approximated $297 million
and $261 million at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively. Quoted
market prices were used to determine the fair value of marketable
securities which, beginning in 1994 (see Note 1, "Required Accounting
Changes"), were recorded at fair value. Marketable securities reflect
$3.5 million of unrealized holding gains at December 31, 1995, and $2.0
million of unrealized holding losses at December 31, 1994. Underlying net
assets were used to estimate the fair value of non-marketable
investments; however, if any such investment was sold after the end of
the year, its sales price determined its fair value for these purposes.
For the remaining investments, consisting principally of corporate-owned
life insurance, the carrying value approximates fair value (see Note 4
for carrying values of "Investments").
     The fair value of "Long-term debt," including current maturities,
approximated $1.77 billion at December 31, 1995, and $1.63 billion at
December 31, 1994. The fair values of debt were estimated based on quoted
market prices or discounted cash flows using current interest rates for
debt with similar terms, company rating and remaining maturity (see Note
6 for carrying values of "Long-term debt").


15. MOTOR CARRIER RESTRUCTURING IN 1993

     In mid-1993, NS began a restructuring of its motor carrier
subsidiary by seeking buyers for the truckload freight portion of NAVL,
which consisted of the Commercial Transport Division (CT), a nationwide
truckload carrier, and Tran-Star (TS), a refrigerated carrier. The
restructuring resulted in the liquidation or transfer to other divisions
of most of CT's assets and, in December 1993, the sale of TS' operations.
NAVL's revenues and expenses after June 30, 1993, reflect the results of
its remaining operations.
     In 1993, as a result of these planned dispositions, NS recorded a
$50.3 million pretax ($32.3 million after-tax) charge and recognized an
additional tax benefit of $36.8 million.
     The proceeds from the December 31, 1993, sale of TS' operations are
reflected in "Investment sales and other" in the 1993 Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows.

  PAGE 74


Item 8.   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. (continued)
- -------   -------------------------------------------

16. PARTIAL REVERSAL OF SPECIAL CHARGE IN 1993

     Included in 1991 results was a $680 million special charge for labor
force reductions and asset write-downs. However, based on NS' success in
eliminating reserve board positions in 1992 and 1993, and on events
occurring in the third quarter of 1993, the accrual included in the 1991
special charge related to labor was reduced by $46 million, which was
reflected as a credit in "Compensation and benefits" expense. The
principal factor contributing to the reversal was the failure in 1993 to
reach agreement on terms for certain further labor savings. Accordingly,
it became apparent that a surplus existed in the labor portion of the
provision established in the 1991 special charge.


17. CONTINGENCIES

Lawsuits
- --------
     Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous
lawsuits relating principally to railroad operations. While the final
outcome of these lawsuits cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the
opinion of Management, after consulting with its legal counsel, that the
amount of NS' ultimate liability will not materially affect NS'
consolidated financial position.

Debt Guarantees
- ---------------
     As of December 31, 1995, certain Norfolk Southern subsidiaries are
contingently liable as guarantors with respect to $66 million of
indebtedness of related entities.

Change-in-Control Arrangements
- ------------------------------
     Norfolk Southern has compensation agreements with officers and
certain key employees, which become operative only upon a change in
control of the Corporation, as defined in those agreements. The
agreements provide generally for payments based on compensation at the
time of a covered individual's involuntary or other specified termination
and for certain other benefits.

Environmental Matters
- ---------------------
     NS is subject to various jurisdictions' environmental laws and
regulations. It is NS' policy to record a liability where such liability
or loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Claims, if any,
against third parties for recovery of clean-up costs incurred by NS are
reflected as receivables in the balance sheet and are not netted against
the associated NS liability. Environmental engineers participate in
ongoing evaluations of all identified sites, and--after consulting with
counsel--any necessary adjustments to initial liability estimates are
made. NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed
of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy.
     As of December 31, 1995, NS' balance sheet included a reserve for
environmental exposures in the amount of $44 million (of which $12
million is accounted for as a current liability), which is NS' present
best estimate of ultimate liability at 96 identified locations. On that
date, eight sites accounted for $16 million of the reserve, and no
individual site was considered to be material. NS anticipates that the
majority of this liability will be paid out over five years; however,
some costs will be paid out over a longer period.

  PAGE 75


Item 8.   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. (continued)
- -------   -------------------------------------------

17. CONTINGENCIES (continued)

     At many of the 96 locations, certain NS subsidiaries, usually in
conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as
potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state
statutes, which often impose joint and several liability for clean-up
costs.
     With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS
or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of NS' ultimate
potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all
such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs
of currently available clean-up techniques, the likely development of new
clean-up technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the
nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participant's
share of any estimated loss (and that participant's ability to bear it)
and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability.
     The risk of incurring environmental liability--for acts and
omissions, past, present and future--is inherent in the railroad
business. Some of the commodities, particularly those classified as
hazardous materials, in NS' traffic mix can pose special risks that NS
and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize. In addition, several NS
subsidiaries own, or have owned in the past, land holdings used as
operating property, or which are leased or may have been leased and
operated by others, or held for sale. Because certain conditions may
exist on these properties related to environmental problems that are
latent or undisclosed, there can be no assurance that NS will not incur
liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and
materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably now. Moreover, lawsuits
and claims involving these and other now-unidentified environmental sites
and matters are likely to arise from time to time. The resulting
liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition,
results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.
     However, based on its assessments of the facts and circumstances now
known and, after consulting with its legal counsel, Management believes
that it has recorded appropriate estimates of liability for those
environmental matters of which the Corporation is aware. Further,
Management believes that it is unlikely that any identified matters,
either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect
on NS' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

                      INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


The Stockholders and Board of Directors
Norfolk Southern Corporation:

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Norfolk Southern
Corporation and subsidiaries as listed in Item 8. In connection with our
audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the
consolidated financial statement schedule listed in Item 14(a)2. These
consolidated financial statements and this consolidated financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements and this consolidated financial statement schedule
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Norfolk Southern Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and
1994, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1995, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, the related consolidated financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements
taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1, the Company changed its methods of accounting in
1993 by adopting the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board's Statement 109, Accounting for Income Taxes; Statement 106,
Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions;
and Statement 112, Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits.
