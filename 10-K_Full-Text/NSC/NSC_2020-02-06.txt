PART I

NORFOLK SOUTHERN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Item 1. Business and Item 2. Properties

GENERAL

– Our company, Norfolk Southern Corporation (Norfolk Southern), is a Norfolk, Virginia-based company that owns a major freight railroad, Norfolk Southern Railway Company (NSR).  We were incorporated on July 23, 1980, under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia.  Our common stock (Common Stock) is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol “NSC.”

Unless indicated otherwise, Norfolk Southern Corporation and its subsidiaries, including NSR, are referred to collectively as NS, we, us, and our.

RAILROAD OPERATIONS

– At December 31, 2019, our railroad operated approximately 19,500 route miles in 22 states and the District of Columbia.

Our system reaches many manufacturing plants, electric generating facilities, mines, distribution centers, transload facilities, and other businesses located in our service area.

Corridors with heaviest freight volume:

•

New York City area to Chicago (via Allentown and Pittsburgh)

•

Chicago to Macon (via Cincinnati, Chattanooga, and Atlanta)

•

Central Ohio to Norfolk (via Columbus and Roanoke)

•

Birmingham to Meridian

•

Cleveland to Kansas City

•

Memphis to Chattanooga

K4

The miles operated, which include major leased lines between Cincinnati, Ohio, and Chattanooga, Tennessee, and an exclusive operating agreement for trackage rights over property owned by North Carolina Railroad Company, were as follows:

We operate freight service over lines with significant ongoing Amtrak and commuter passenger operations, and conduct freight operations over trackage owned or leased by Amtrak, New Jersey Transit, Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, Metro-North Commuter Railroad Company, Maryland Department of Transportation, and Michigan Department of Transportation.

The following table sets forth certain statistics relating to our railroads’ operations for the past five years:

RAILWAY OPERATING REVENUES

–

Total railway operating revenues were $11.3 billion in 2019.  Following is an overview of our three commodity groups.  See the discussion of merchandise revenues by major commodity group, intermodal revenues, and coal revenues and tonnage in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

K5

MERCHANDISE

–

Our merchandise commodity group is composed of five groupings:

•

Chemicals includes sulfur and related chemicals, petroleum products (including crude oil), chlorine and bleaching compounds, plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals, and chemical wastes.

•

Agriculture products includes soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizer, livestock and poultry feed, food products, food oils, flour, sweeteners, and ethanol.

•

Metals and construction includes steel, aluminum products, machinery, scrap metals, cement, aggregates, sand, minerals, transportation equipment, and items for the U.S. military.

•

Automotive includes finished motor vehicles and automotive parts.

•

Forest and consumer includes lumber and wood products, pulp board and paper products, wood fibers, wood pulp, scrap paper, clay, beverages, canned goods, and consumer products

Merchandise carloads handled in 2019 were 2.4 million, the revenues from which accounted for 60% of our total railway operating revenues.

INTERMODAL

–

Our intermodal commodity group consists of shipments moving in domestic and international containers and trailers.  These shipments are handled on behalf of intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, premium customers and asset owning companies.  Intermodal units handled in 2019 were 4.2 million, the revenues from which accounted for 25% of our total railway operating revenues.

COAL

–

Revenues from coal accounted for 15% of our total railway operating revenues in 2019.  We handled 102 million tons, or 0.9 million carloads, in 2019, most of which originated on our lines from major eastern coal basins, with the balance from major western coal basins received via the Memphis and Chicago gateways.  Our coal franchise supports the electric generation market, serving approximately 60 coal generation plants, as well as the export, domestic metallurgical and industrial markets, primarily through direct rail and river, lake, and coastal facilities, including various terminals on the Ohio River, Lamberts Point in Norfolk, Virginia, the Port of Baltimore, and Lake Erie.

FREIGHT RATES

–

Our predominant pricing mechanisms, private contracts and exempt price quotes, are not subject to regulation.  In general, market forces are the primary determinant of rail service prices.

RAILWAY PROPERTY

Our railroad infrastructure makes us capital intensive with net property of approximately $32 billion on a historical cost basis.

Property Additions

–

Property additions for the past five years were as follows:

Our capital spending and replacement programs are and have been designed to assure the ability to provide safe, efficient, and reliable rail transportation services.

K6

Equipment

–

At December 31, 2019, we owned or leased the following units of equipment:

The following table indicates the number and year built for locomotives and freight cars owned at December 31, 2019:

K7

The following table shows the average age of our owned locomotive and freight car fleets at December 31, 2019, and information regarding 2019 retirements:

Track Maintenance

–

Of the approximately 35,600 total miles of track on which we operate, we are responsible for maintaining approximately 28,400 miles, with the remainder being operated under trackage rights from other parties responsible for maintenance.

Over 84% of the main line trackage (including first, second, third, and branch main tracks, all excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights) has rail ranging from 131 to 155 pounds per yard with the standard installation currently at 136 pounds per yard.  Approximately 44% of our lines, excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights, carried 20 million or more gross tons per track mile during 2019.

The following table summarizes several measurements regarding our track roadway additions and replacements during the past five years:

Traffic Control

–

Of the approximately 16,400 route miles we dispatch, about 11,300 miles are signalized, including 8,500 miles of centralized traffic control (CTC) and 2,800 miles of automatic block signals.  Of the 8,500 miles of CTC, approximately 7,600 miles are controlled by data radio originating at 355 base station radio sites.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

–

Compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is one of our principal goals.  To date, such compliance has not had a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity, or competitive position.  See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

EMPLOYEES

–

The following table shows the average number of employees and the average cost per employee for wages and benefits:

Approximately 80% of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. See the discussion of “Labor Agreements” in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

K8

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

–

In addition to environmental, safety, securities, and other regulations generally applicable to all business, our railroads are subject to regulation by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB).  The STB has jurisdiction to varying extents over rates, routes, customer access provisions, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines.  The STB has jurisdiction to determine whether we are “revenue adequate” on an annual basis based on the results of the prior year.  A railroad is “revenue adequate” on an annual basis under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry’s composite cost of capital.  This determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement.  The STB also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers.

The relaxation of economic regulation of railroads, following the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, included exemption from STB regulation of the rates and most service terms for intermodal business (trailer-on-flat-car, container-on-flat-car), rail boxcar shipments, lumber, manufactured steel, automobiles, and certain bulk commodities such as sand, gravel, pulpwood, and wood chips for paper manufacturing.  Further, all shipments that we have under contract are effectively removed from commercial regulation for the duration of the contract.  Approximately 90% of our revenues comes from either exempt shipments or shipments moving under transportation contracts; the remainder comes from shipments moving under public tariff rates.

Efforts have been made over the past several years to increase federal economic regulation of the rail industry, and such efforts are expected to continue in 2020.  The Staggers Rail Act of 1980 substantially balanced the interests of shippers and rail carriers, and encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate, invest in their infrastructure, and compete for business, thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry.  Accordingly, we will continue to oppose efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation.

Government regulations are further discussed within Item 1A “Risk Factors” and the safety and security of our railroads are discussed within the “Security of Operations” section contained herein.

COMPETITION

–

There is continuing strong competition among rail, water, and highway carriers.  Price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company.  Inventory carrying costs, service reliability, ease of handling, and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations, especially for higher-valued finished goods, machinery, and consumer products.  Even for raw materials, semi-finished goods, and work-in-progress, users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages.

Our

primary rail competitor is CSX

Corporation (CSX); both NS and CSX operate throughout much of the same territory.  Other railroads also operate in parts of the territory.  We

also compete with motor carriers, water carriers, and with shippers who have the additional options of handling their own goods in private carriage, sourcing products from different geographic areas, and using substitute products.

Certain marketing strategies to expand reach and shipping options among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable

railroads

to compete more effectively in specific markets.

SECURITY OF OPERATIONS

– We continue to enhance the security of our rail system.  Our comprehensive security plan is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the Association of American Railroads (AAR) post September 11, 2001.  The AAR Security Plan defines four Alert Levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry to mitigate the risk of terrorist, violent extremist or seriously disruptive cyber-attack increases or decreases.  The Alert Level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas:  (1) operations (including transportation, engineering, and mechanical); (2) information technology and communications; and, (3) railroad police.  All of our Operations Division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers, as appropriate, of any change in Alert Level and any additional responsibilities they may incur due to such change.

Our security plan also complies with U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials.  As part of the plan, security awareness training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety,

K9

and is integrated into hazardous material training programs.  Additionally, location-specific security plans are in place for rail corridors in certain metropolitan areas referred to as High Threat Urban Areas (HTUA).  Particular attention is aimed at reducing risk in a HTUA by: (1) the establishment of secure storage areas for rail cars carrying toxic-by-inhalation (TIH) materials; (2) the expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying TIH materials; (3) reducing the number of unattended loaded tank cars carrying TIH materials; and (4) cooperation with federal, state, local, and tribal governments to identify those locations where security risks are the highest.

We also operate six facilities that are under U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Maritime Security Regulations.  With respect to these facilities, each facility’s security plan has been approved by the applicable Captain of the Port and remains subject to inspection by the USCG.

Additionally, we continue to engage in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Transportation Security Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), the USCG, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Defense, and various state Homeland Security offices.

In 2019, through the Norfolk Southern Operation Awareness and Response Program as well as participation in the Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response Program, we provided rail accident response training to approximately 5,700 emergency responders, such as local police and fire personnel.  Our other training efforts throughout 2019 included participation in tabletop and full scale exercises for local, state, and federal agencies. We also have ongoing programs to sponsor local emergency responders at the Security and Emergency Response Training Course conducted at the AAR Transportation Technology Center in Pueblo, Colorado.

We also continually evaluate ourselves for appropriate business continuity and disaster recovery planning, with test scenarios that include cybersecurity attacks. Our risk-based information security program helps ensure our defenses and resources are aligned to address the most likely and most damaging potential attacks, to provide support for our organizational mission and operational objectives, and to keep us in the best position to detect, mitigate, and recover from a wide variety of potential attacks in a timely fashion.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

The risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements.  The information set forth in this Item 1A “Risk Factors” should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this annual report, including    Item 7

“

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

”

and Item 8

“

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

”

Significant governmental legislation and regulation over commercial, operating and environmental matters could affect us, our customers, and the markets we serve.

Congress can enact laws that could increase economic regulation of the industry.

Railroads presently are subject to commercial regulation by the STB, which has

jurisdiction to varying extents over rates, routes, customer access provisions, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail

lines.  The STB also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control of and by rail common

carriers.  Additional economic regulation of the rail industry by Congress or the STB, whether under new or

existing laws, could have a significant negative impact on our ability to negotiate prices for rail services, on railway operating revenues, and on the

efficiency of our operations.  This potential material adverse effect

could also result in reduced capital spending on our rail network or abandonment of lines.

Railroads are also subject to the enactment of laws by Congress and regulation by the DOT and the DHS, which regulate most aspects of our operations related to safety and security.  The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008, the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2015, and the implementing regulations promulgated by the FRA (collectively “the PTC laws and regulations”) require us (and each other Class I railroad) to implement, on certain mainline track where intercity and commuter passenger railroads operate and where TIH hazardous materials are

K10

transported, an interoperable positive train control system (PTC).  PTC is a set of highly advanced technologies designed to prevent train-to-train collisions, speed-related derailments, and certain other accidents caused by human error, but PTC will not prevent all types of train accidents or incidents.  We met the deadline under the PTC laws and regulations to install all hardware and to implement PTC on some of those rail lines, and we are required to fully implement PTC on the remainder of those rail lines by December 31, 2020.

In addition, other railroads’ implementation schedules could impose additional interoperability requirements and accelerated timelines on us, which could impact our operations over other railroads if not met.

Full implementation of PTC will result in additional operating costs and capital expenditures, and PTC implementation may result in reduced operational efficiency and service levels, as well as increased compensation and benefits expenses, and increased claims and litigation costs.

Our operations are subject to extensive federal and state environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air; discharges to waterways or groundwater supplies; handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and other materials; and the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases.  The risk of incurring environmental liability, for acts and omissions, past, present, and future, is inherent in the railroad business.  This risk includes property owned by us, whether currently or in the past, that is or has been subject to a variety of uses, including our railroad operations and other industrial activity by past owners or our past and present tenants.

Environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, and we could incur environmental liabilities or costs, the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time, with respect to one or more of these properties.  Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time.

Concern over climate change has led to significant federal, state, and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  Restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on GHG emissions, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs, decrease the amount of traffic handled, and decrease the value of coal reserves we own.

In addition, legislation and regulation related to GHGs could negatively affect the markets we serve and our customers.  Even without legislation or regulation, government incentives and adverse publicity relating to GHGs could negatively affect the markets for certain of the commodities we carry and our customers that (1) use commodities that we carry to produce energy, including coal, (2) use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry, or (3) manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy.

As a common carrier by rail, we must offer to transport hazardous materials, regardless of risk.

Transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury and

property (including environmental) damage, and compromise critical parts of our rail network.  The cost of a catastrophic rail

accident involving hazardous materials could exceed our insurance coverage.  We have obtained insurance for potential losses for

third-party liability and first-party property damages (see Note


to the Consolidated Financial Statements);

however, insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or, if

available, may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us.

We may be affected by general economic conditions.

Prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions could affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry.  Economic conditions could also result in bankruptcies of one or more large customers.

Significant increases in demand for rail services could result in the unavailability of qualified personnel and locomotives.

In addition, workforce demographics and training

requirements, particularly for engineers and conductors, could have a

negative impact on our ability to meet short-term demand for rail service.  Unpredicted increases in demand for rail services

may exacerbate such risks.

K11

We may be affected by energy prices.

Volatility in energy prices could have a significant effect on a variety of items including, but not limited to: the economy; demand for transportation services; business related to the energy sector, including crude oil, natural gas, and coal; fuel prices; and fuel surcharges.

We face competition from other transportation providers.

We are subject to competition from motor carriers, railroads and, to a lesser extent, ships, barges, and pipelines, on the basis of transit time, pricing, and quality and reliability of service.  While we have used primarily internal resources to build or acquire and maintain our rail system, trucks and barges have been able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities.  Any

future improvements, expenditures, legislation, or regulation

materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in which we operate (such as granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations or adoption of autonomous commercial vehicles) could have a material adverse effect on our

operations.

The operations of carriers with which we interchange may adversely affect our operations.

Our ability to provide rail service to customers in the U.S. and Canada depends in large part upon our ability to maintain collaborative relationships with connecting carriers (including shortlines and regional railroads) with respect to, among other matters, freight rates, revenue division, car supply and locomotive availability, data exchange and communications, reciprocal switching, interchange, and trackage rights.  Deterioration in the operations of or service provided by connecting carriers, or in our relationship with those connecting carriers, could result in our inability to meet our customers’ demands or require us to use alternate train routes, which could result in significant additional costs and network inefficiencies.  Additionally, any significant consolidations, mergers or operational changes among other railroads may significantly redefine our market access and reach.

We rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations.

If we experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems, including computer hardware, software, and communications equipment, we could experience a service interruption, a security breach, or other operational difficulties.  We also face cybersecurity threats which may result in breaches of systems, or compromises of sensitive data, which may result in an inability to access or operate systems necessary for conducting operations and providing customer service, thereby impacting our efficiency and/or damaging our corporate reputation.  Additionally, if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or we are unable to implement new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service.

The vast majority of our employees belong to labor unions, and labor agreements, strikes, or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations.

Approximately

80%

of our railroad employees are covered by collective

bargaining agreements with various labor unions. If unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage,

or other slowdown, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations.  Additionally, future national

labor agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, could significantly

increase our costs for health care, wages, and other benefits.

We may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.

The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, commercial disputes, freight loss and other property damage, and other matters. Job-related personal injury and occupational claims are subject to the Federal Employer’s Liability Act (FELA), which is applicable only to railroads. FELA’s fault-based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault worker’s compensation system. The variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being different from the liability recorded.

Any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving any or all of freight loss, property damage, personal injury, and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on us to the extent not covered by insurance.  We have obtained insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and first-party property damages; however, insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or, if available, may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us.

K12

Severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures.

Severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena, including hurricanes, floods, fires, and earthquakes, may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs, increased liabilities, and decreased revenues.

We may be affected by terrorism or war.

Any terrorist attack, or other similar event, any government response thereto, and war or risk of war could cause significant business interruption.  Because we play a critical role in the nation’s transportation system, we could become the target of such an attack or have a significant role in the government’s preemptive approach or response to an attack or war.

Although we currently maintain insurance coverage for third-party liability arising out of war and acts of terrorism, we maintain only limited insurance coverage for first-party property damage and damage to property in our care, custody, or control caused by certain acts of terrorism.  In addition, premiums for some or all of our current insurance programs covering these losses could increase dramatically, or insurance coverage for certain losses could be unavailable to us in the future.

We may be affected by supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of some of our supplier markets.

We consumed approximately 451 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2019.  Fuel

availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or

rationing regulations.  A severe fuel supply shortage arising from production curtailments, increased demand in

existing or emerging foreign markets, disruption of oil imports, disruption of domestic refinery production, damage

to refinery or pipeline infrastructure, political unrest, war or other factors could impact us as well as our customers and other transportation companies.

Due to the capital intensive nature, as well as the industry-specific requirements of the rail industry, high barriers of entry exist for potential new suppliers of core railroad items, such as locomotives and rolling stock equipment.  Additionally, we compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of locomotives and certain track and rolling stock materials.  Changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited supplier markets could result in increased prices or significant shortages of materials.

The state of capital markets could adversely affect our liquidity.

We rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements, including the issuance of debt instruments, as well as the sale of certain receivables.  Significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including the credit markets, or deterioration of our financial position due to internal or external factors could restrict or eliminate our access to, and/or significantly increase the cost of, various financing sources, including bank credit facilities and issuance of corporate bonds.  Instability or disruptions of the capital markets and deterioration of our financial position, alone or in combination, could also result in a reduction in our credit rating to below investment grade, which could prohibit or restrict us from accessing external sources of short- and long-term debt financing and/or significantly increase the associated costs.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

In 2007, various antitrust class actions filed against us and other Class I railroads in various Federal district courts regarding fuel surcharges were consolidated in the District of Columbia by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation.  In 2012, the court certified the case as a class action.  The defendant railroads appealed this certification, and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia vacated the District Court’s decision and remanded the case for further consideration.  On October 10, 2017, the District Court denied class certification.  The decision was upheld by the Court of Appeals on August 16, 2019.  Since that decision, various individual cases have been filed in multiple jurisdictions.  We believe the allegations in the complaints are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the cases.  We do not believe the outcome of these proceedings will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes.

OVERVIEW

We are one of the nation’s premier transportation companies.  Our Norfolk Southern Railway Company subsidiary operates approximately 19,500 route miles in 22 states and the District of Columbia, serves every major container port in the eastern United States, and provides efficient connections to other rail carriers.  Norfolk Southern is a major transporter of industrial products, including chemicals, agriculture, and metals and construction materials.  In addition, we operate the most extensive intermodal network in the East and are a principal carrier of coal, automobiles, and automotive parts.

The execution of the initiatives in our strategic plan allowed us to achieve records for income from railway operations and railway operating ratio (a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses) for the year.  We continued our focus on improving the efficiency of our operations and utilization of our assets, allowing us to reduce our operating expenses by 3% in the face of a 1% revenue decline.

SUMMARIZED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Income from railway operations rose in 2019 as a 3% reduction in railway operating expenses more than offset the impact of a 1% decline in railway operating revenues.  In addition to higher income from railway operations, net income and diluted earnings per share growth in 2019 also benefited from a lower effective tax rate.  Our continuing share repurchase program contributed to diluted earnings per share growth that exceeded that of net income.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“tax reform”) was signed into law. The following table adjusts our 2017 U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) financial results to exclude the effects of tax reform, specifically, the effects of remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities related to the reduction of the federal tax rate from 35% to 21% (the “2017 tax adjustments”).  We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally and believe this information provides useful supplemental information to investors to facilitate making period-to-period comparisons by excluding the 2017 tax adjustments.  While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies.

K18

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In the table below and the paragraph following, references to 2017 results and related comparisons use the adjusted, non-GAAP results from the reconciliation in the table above.

Income from railway operations increased in 2018 as compared to 2017, as a 9% increase in railway operating revenues more than offset a 4% increase in adjusted operating expenses.  In addition to higher income from railway operations, net income and diluted earnings per share growth in 2018 also benefited from a lower effective tax rate, primarily due to the enactment of tax reform.  Finally, our share repurchase program resulted in diluted earnings per share growth that exceeded that of net income.

DETAILED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Railway Operating Revenues

The following tables present a three-year comparison of revenues, volumes (units), and average revenue per unit by major commodity group.  At the beginning of 2019, we made changes in the categorization of certain commodity groups within Merchandise.  Prior period railway operating revenues, units, and revenue per unit have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation (see Note 2).

K20

Revenues decreased $162 million in 2019 but increased $907 million in 2018 compared to the prior years.  As reflected in the table below, lower 2019 revenues were the result of decreased volumes, partially offset by higher average revenue per unit, driven by pricing gains.  The rise in 2018 revenues was the result of higher average revenue per unit, driven by pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by the mix-related impacts of increased intermodal volume and decreased coal volume.  In addition, overall volume also increased.

The table below reflects the components of the revenue change by major commodity group.

Approximately 90% of our revenue base is covered by contracts that include negotiated fuel surcharges.  These revenues totaled $578 million, $657 million, and $359 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

For 2020, merchandise and intermodal revenues are expected to increase, while coal revenues are anticipated to decline, resulting in overall revenues that are expected to be flat.

MERCHANDISE

revenues increased in both 2019 and 2018 compared with the prior years.  In 2019, revenues grew due to higher average revenue per unit, driven by pricing gains, which were partially offset by volume declines in all commodity groups.  In 2018, revenues grew due to higher average revenue per unit, driven by pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue, as well as higher volumes.  Volume gains in chemicals and agriculture products were partially offset by declines in automotive traffic.

Chemicals

revenues rose in both 2019 and 2018 compared with the prior years.  In 2019, the rise was the result of higher average revenue per unit, due to pricing gains, which were partially offset by volume declines.  Volume declines in natural gas, petroleum products, organic and inorganic chemicals, and plastics were partially offset by gains in crude oil and municipal waste.  In 2018, the rise was the result of higher volume and higher average revenue per unit, due to pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue.  Volumes grew due to increased shipments of crude oil, liquefied petroleum gas, plastics, and municipal waste shipments, partially offset by a decrease in coal ash shipments.

Agriculture products

revenues rose in both 2019 and 2018 compared to the prior years.  Growth in 2019 was due to higher average revenue per unit, a result of pricing gains, which more than offset volume declines.  Volumes were down due to decreased shipments of ethanol, soybeans, and fertilizer, partially offset by increases in corn shipments.  Growth in 2018 was due to higher average revenue per unit, a result of pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenues, and higher volume.  Higher ethanol and fertilizer shipments more than offset declines in soybean and corn shipments.

Metals and construction

revenues declined in 2019 but increased in 2018 compared to the prior years.  In 2019, volume declines were largely offset by higher average revenue per unit, the result of pricing gains.  Volume declines in iron and steel, coil, sand, and scrap metal were partially offset by increases in aggregates shipments due to improved service and market strength.  In 2018, higher average revenue per unit, the result of pricing gains and

K21

higher fuel surcharge revenue, drove the increase while volumes remained flat.  Volume increases in frac sand shipments for use in natural gas drilling in the Marcellus and Utica regions were offset by declines in aggregates, cement, aluminum, and iron and steel.

Automotive

revenues were flat in 2019 and increased in 2018 compared to the prior years.  In 2019, higher average revenue per unit, driven by price increases, offset volume declines that were primarily the result of decreases in U.S. light vehicle production and the United Automobile Workers strike in the fourth quarter.  In 2018, higher average revenue per unit, driven by price increases and higher fuel surcharge revenues, more than offset volume declines.  Traffic declines were the result of shortages of availability of multilevel equipment and scheduled automotive plant downtime.

Forest and consumer

revenues were flat in 2019 and increased in 2018 compared to the prior years.  In 2019, higher average revenue per unit, the result of pricing gains, offset volume declines.  Volume declines were primarily driven by reduced shipments of pulpboard, lumber and wood, and kaolin.  In 2018, higher average revenue per unit, the result of pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue drove the increase while volumes remained flat.  Gains in pulpboard, a result of tightened truck capacity, were offset by decreases in pulp, woodchip, and graphic paper.

INTERMODAL

revenues decreased in 2019, but increased considerably in 2018 compared to the prior years.  The decline in 2019 was driven by lower volumes, which were partially offset by higher average revenue per unit, a result of pricing gains.  The rise in 2018 was driven by higher average revenue per unit, a result of increased fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains, and higher volume.

Intermodal units by market were as follows:

Domestic

volume fell in 2019 but increased in 2018.  Volume was challenged in 2019 by stronger over-the-road competition.  The rise in 2018 benefited from continued highway conversions due to tighter capacity in the truck market, higher truckload pricing, and growth from existing accounts.

International

volume increased in both periods reflecting increased demand from new and existing customers, despite 2019 volume being somewhat tempered by tariff concerns.

COAL

revenues decreased in 2019, but increased in 2018 compared with the prior years.  The decrease in 2019 was a result of lower volume, which was partially offset by higher average revenue per unit, driven by pricing gains.  Revenue growth in 2018 was the result of higher average revenue per unit, largely the result of pricing gains, which more than offset volume declines.

K22

As shown in the following table, total tonnage decreased in both periods.

Utility coal

tonnage declined in both periods from continued headwinds from low natural gas prices as well as  additional natural gas and renewable energy generating capacity, that were slightly offset by our service improvements and customer inventory rebuilding.

Export coal

tonnage decreased in 2019 but increased in 2018. The decline in 2019 was a result of weak thermal seaborne pricing and coal supply disruptions at certain mines.  The increase in 2018 was due to strong seaborne pricing that resulted in higher demand for U.S. coal.

Domestic metallurgical coal

tonnage was down in both years.  The decline in 2019 was a reflection of challenging overall market conditions including softening domestic steel demand, customer sourcing changes, and plant outages.  The decline in 2018 was a reflection of customer sourcing changes.

Industrial coal

tonnage decreased in both years driven by customer sourcing changes and pressure from natural gas conversions.

Railway Operating Expenses

Railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications were as follows:

In 2019, expenses fell as our strategic initiatives to improve productivity resulted in lower compensation, equipment rents, and materials expense.  These decreases along with lower fuel prices and consumption were partially offset by lower gains on property sales, increased depreciation, and a write-off of a $32 million receivable as a result of a legal dispute.  In 2018, expenses rose due to higher fuel prices as well as volume-related increases and costs associated with overall lower network velocity, partially offset by higher gains on property sales.

K23

Compensation and benefits

decreased in 2019, reflecting changes in:

•

employment levels (down $117 million),

•

incentive and stock-based compensation (down $83 million),

•

overtime and recrews (down $45 million),

•

higher capitalized labor ($9 million),

•

2018 employment tax refund ($31 million unfavorable in 2019),

•

pay rates (up $76 million), and

•

other (down $27 million).

In 2018, compensation and benefits decreased, a result of changes in:

•

employment levels (down $61 million),

•

health and welfare benefit rates for agreement employees (down $34 million),

•

employment tax refund ($31 million benefit),

•

incentive and stock-based compensation (down $7 million),

•

pay rates (up $34 million),

•

overtime and recrews (up $58 million), and

•

other (down $13 million).

Our employment averaged 24,587 in 2019, compared with 26,662 in 2018, and 27,110 in 2017.

Purchased services and rents

includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals.  In 2017, this line item includes a $151 million benefit from the 2017 tax adjustments ($36 million in purchased services and $115 million in equipment rents) in the form of higher income of certain equity investees.

The increase in purchased services in 2019 was the result of increased technology-related expenses, expenses associated with our headquarters relocation, and increased intermodal-related costs partially offset by decreased transportation activities.  The increase in purchased services in 2018 was largely the result of the absence of the benefit from the 2017 tax adjustments, higher intermodal volume-related costs, additional transportation and engineering activities as well as higher technology costs.

Equipment rents, which includes our cost of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to us for the use of our equipment, decreased in 2019, but increased in 2018.  In 2019, the decrease was largely due to improved network velocity and the absence of short-term locomotive resource costs incurred in the prior year.  In 2018, the rise was due to the absence of the benefits from the 2017 tax adjustments, the impact of slower network velocity, the cost of additional short-term locomotive resources as well as growth in volume.

Fuel

expense, which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations, decreased in 2019, but increased in 2018.  The change in both years was principally due to locomotive fuel prices (down 8% in 2019 and up 25% in 2018) which decreased expenses $82 million in 2019 but increased expenses $208 million in 2018.  Locomotive fuel consumption decreased 4% in 2019, but increased 3% in 2018.  We consumed

K24

approximately 451 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2019, compared with 472 million gallons in 2018 and 458 million gallons in 2017.

Depreciation

expense increased in both periods, a reflection of growth in our roadway and equipment capital base as we continue to invest in our infrastructure and rolling stock, and technology.

Materials and other

expenses increased in 2019 but decreased in 2018 as shown in the following table.

Materials expense decreased in 2019, due primarily to lower locomotive repair costs as a result of fewer locomotives in service.  In 2018, the increase was primarily a result of higher locomotive repair costs.

Casualties and other claims expenses include the estimates of costs related to personal injury, property damage, and environmental matters.  The 2019 expense increased, primarily the result of higher costs related to environmental remediation matters and higher personal injury costs.  The 2018 expense increased, primarily the result of higher derailment-related costs.

Other expense increased in 2019 but decreased in 2018, largely a result of gains from sales of operating properties.  Gains from operating property sales amounted to $64 million, $158 million, and $79 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.  In 2019, the increase was additionally impacted by the write-off of a $32 million receivable as a result of a legal dispute.  In 2018, the decline was also impacted by the inclusion of net rental income from operating property previously included in “Other income – net” of $78 million, partially offset by increased costs as a result of the relocation of our train dispatchers to Atlanta, Georgia.

Other income – net

Other income – net increased in 2019 but decreased in 2018.  The increase in 2019 was driven by higher returns on corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) investments and increased gains on sales of non-operating property, which more than offset a $49 million impairment loss related to our natural resource assets that we are actively marketing to sell.  The decline in 2018 was driven by the absence of net rental income as discussed above and unfavorable returns from COLI investments.

Income Taxes

The effective income tax rate was 22.0% in 2019, compared with 23.1% in 2018 and negative 72.8% in 2017.  Both 2019 and 2018 benefited from favorable reductions in deferred taxes for state tax law changes and certain business tax credits, while 2019 and 2017 benefited from higher returns from COLI.  Income taxes in 2018 benefited from the effects of the enactment of tax reform in late 2017 that lowered the federal corporate income tax rate.  Income taxes in 2017 included a benefit of $3,331 million related to the effects of the enactment of tax reform from the reduction in our net deferred tax liabilities driven by the change in the federal rate.  All three years benefited from favorable tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation.

K25

For 2020, we expect the effective income tax rate to range from 23% to 24%.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash provided by operating activities,

our principal source of liquidity, was $3.9 billion in 2019, $3.7 billion in 2018, and $3.3 billion in 2017.  The increases in both 2019 and 2018 were primarily the result of improved operating results.  We had working capital deficits of $219 million and $729 million at December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively.  Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash totaled $580 million and $446 million at December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively.  We expect cash on hand combined with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing obligations.

Contractual obligations

at December 31, 2019, include interest on fixed-rate long-term debt, long-term debt (Note 9), unconditional purchase obligations (Note 17), operating leases (Note 10), long-term advances from Conrail and agreements with Consolidated Rail Corporation (CRC) (Note 6), and unrecognized tax benefits (Note 4):

*  This amount is shown in the Other column because the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated.

Off balance sheet arrangements

consist primarily of unrecognized obligations, including unconditional purchase obligations and future interest payments on fixed-rate long-term debt, which are included in the table above.  In addition, we entered into a synthetic lease during 2019 which is discussed further in Note 10.

Cash used in investing activities

was $1.8 billion in 2019, compared with $1.7 billion in 2018, and $1.5 billion in 2017.  In 2019, increased corporate owned life insurance activity and higher property additions were partially offset by increased proceeds from property sales.  In 2018, higher property additions drove the increase.

Capital spending and track and equipment statistics can be found within the “Railway Property” section of Part I of this report on Form 10-K.  For 2020, we expect capital spending to approximate 16% to 18% of revenues.

Cash used in financing activities

was $2.0 billion in 2019, compared with $2.3 billion in 2018, and $2.0 billion in 2017. Both year-over-year comparisons reflect higher debt repayments and increased dividends.  In 2019, the decrease was also impacted by fewer repurchases of common stock.  In 2018, the increase was also impacted by increased repurchases of common stock, but tempered by increased proceeds from borrowings.

Share repurchases totaled $2.1 billion in 2019, $2.8 billion in 2018, and $1.0 billion in 2017 for the purchase and retirement of 11.3 million, 17.1 million (including 7.0 million shares repurchased for $1.2 billion under the Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) program), and 8.2 million shares, respectively.  As of December 31, 2019, 28.0 million shares remain authorized by our Board of Directors for repurchase.  The timing and volume of future

K26

share repurchases will be guided by our assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors.  Any near-term purchases under the program are expected to be made with internally generated cash, cash on hand, or proceeds from borrowings.

In May 2019, we issued $200 million of 3.80% senior notes due 2028, $400 million of 4.10% senior notes due 2049, and $200 million of 5.10% senior notes due 2118.  In November 2019, we issued $400 million of 2.55% senior notes due 2029, and $400 million of 3.40% senior notes due 2049.

In May 2019, we also renewed and amended our accounts receivable securitization program, increasing our maximum borrowing capacity from $400 million to $450 million with a term expiring in May 2020.  We had no amounts outstanding at both December 31, 2019 and 2018.

We discuss our credit agreement and our accounts receivable securitization program in Note 9, and we have authority from our Board of Directors to issue an additional $1.6 billion of debt or equity securities through public or private sale, all of which provide for access to additional liquidity should the need arise.  Our debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 44.5% at December 31, 2019, compared with 42.0% at December 31, 2018.

Upcoming annual debt maturities are disclosed in Note 9.  Overall, our goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support our business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  These estimates and assumptions may require judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, and future events are likely to occur that may require us to make changes to these estimates and assumptions.  Accordingly, we regularly review these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in the business environment, and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  The following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in Note 1.

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires us to make several estimates and assumptions (Note 12).  These include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans’ assets and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality.  In addition, the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value.  We make these estimates based on our historical experience and other information that we deem pertinent under the circumstances (for example, expectations of future stock market performance).  We utilize an independent actuarial consulting firm’s studies to assist us in selecting appropriate actuarial assumptions and valuing related liabilities.

In recording our net pension benefit, we assumed a long-term investment rate of return of 8.25%, which was supported by the long-term total rate of return on plan assets since inception, as well as our expectation of future returns.  A one-percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a $23 million change in pension expense.  We review assumptions related to our defined benefit plans annually, and while changes are likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age, projected earnings, and mortality, they are not expected to have a material effect on our net pension expense or net pension liability in the future.  The net pension liability is recorded at net present value using discount rates that are based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments.  We utilize analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans are matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds.  We use the results of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans.  A one-percentage point change to this discount rate assumption would result in about an $18 million change in pension expense.

K27

Properties and Depreciation

Most of our assets are long-lived railway properties (Note 7). “Properties” are stated principally at cost and are depreciated using the group method whereby assets with similar characteristics, use, and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes and depreciated using a composite depreciation rate.  See Note 1 for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates in this area.

Expenditures, including those on leased assets, that extend an asset’s useful life or increase its utility are capitalized. Expenditures capitalized include those that are directly related to a capital project and may include materials, labor, and other direct costs, in addition to an allocable portion of indirect costs that relate to a capital project.  A significant portion of our annual capital spending relates to the replacement of self-contructed assets.  Costs related to repairs and maintenance activities that, in our judgment, do not extend an asset’s useful life or increase its utility are expensed when such repairs are performed.

Depreciation expense for 2019 totaled $1.1 billion.  Our composite depreciation rates for 2019 are disclosed in

Note 7; a one year increase (or decrease) in the estimated average useful lives of depreciable assets would have resulted in an approximate $40 million decrease (or increase) to depreciation expense.

Personal Injury

Casualties and other claims expense, included in “Materials and other” in the Consolidated Statements of Income, includes our accrual for personal injury liabilities.

To aid in valuing our personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue with respect to such claims during the year, we utilize studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm.  The actuarial firm studies our historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements, taking into account relevant outside influences.  We adjust the liability quarterly based upon our assessment and the results of the study.  Our estimate is subject to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events and as such the ultimate loss sustained may vary from the estimated liability recorded.

For a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates in accounting for personal injury see Note 17.

Income Taxes

Our net deferred tax liability totaled $6.8 billion at December 31, 2019 (Note 4).  This liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements.  After application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in our income tax returns.  For state income and other taxes, judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions.  A valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized.  We have a $54 million valuation allowance on $513 million of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2019, reflecting the expectation that almost all of these assets will be realized.

OTHER MATTERS

Labor Agreements

Approximately 80% of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions.  Pursuant to the Railway Labor Act, these agreements remain in effect until new agreements are reached, or until the bargaining procedures mandated by the Railway Labor Act are completed.  We largely bargain nationally in concert with other major railroads, represented by the National Carriers Conference Committee.  Moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and unions may propose changes to the agreements.

K28

The next round of bargaining commenced on November 1, 2019 with both management and the unions serving their formal proposals for changes to the collective bargaining agreements.

Market Risks

At December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding debt subject to interest rate fluctuations.  Market risk for fixed-rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2019, and amounts to an increase of approximately $2.1 billion to the fair value of our debt at December 31, 2019.  We consider it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

New Accounting Pronouncements

For a detailed discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see Note 1.

Inflation

In preparing financial statements, GAAP requires the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property.  As a capital-intensive company, we have most of our capital invested in long-lived assets.  The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

K32

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors

Norfolk Southern Corporation:

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Norfolk Southern Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in stockholders’ equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes and financial statement schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts as listed in Item 15(A)2 (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of  December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated  February 6, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Change in Accounting Principle

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of January 1, 2019, due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) and related amendments.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

K34

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgment. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Assessment of capitalization of property expenditures

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, expenditures that extend an asset’s useful life or increase its utility are capitalized.  The Company has recorded $31,614 million in net book value of properties at December 31, 2019 and has recorded $2,019 million in property additions for the year ended December 31, 2019. Expenditures capitalized include those that are directly related to a capital project and may include materials, labor and other direct costs, in addition to an allocable portion of indirect costs that relate to a capital project.  A significant portion of the Company's annual capital spending relates to the replacement of self-constructed assets.  Costs related to repair and maintenance activities, that in the Company's judgment, do not extend an asset’s useful life or increase its utility are expensed when such repairs are performed.

We identified the assessment of capitalization of property expenditures as a critical audit matter. A higher degree of auditor judgment was required in determining procedures and evaluating audit results related to the capitalization or expense treatment of purchased services and compensation due to their usage for both self-constructed assets and repairs and maintenance.

The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company’s capitalization process, including controls that establish whether a project is a capital or repair expenditure and the appropriateness of accumulated charges to capitalized projects.  We selected a sample of capital projects and assessed the capital nature of the project. We obtained support for a sample of property addition expenditures and tested the classification of the related expenditure as capital, which included inquiry with Company personnel regarding the relevance of the sampled expenditure to the capital project.

1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

Norfolk Southern Corporation is a Virginia-based holding company engaged principally in the rail transportation business, operating approximately

19,500

route miles primarily in the East and Midwest.  These consolidated financial statements include Norfolk Southern and its majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries (collectively, NS, we, us, and our).  Norfolk Southern’s major subsidiary is NSR.  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

NSR and its railroad subsidiaries transport raw materials, intermediate products, and finished goods classified in the following commodity groups (percent of total railway operating revenues in 2019): intermodal (


%); chemicals (


%); coal (


%); agriculture products (


%); metals and construction (


%); automotive (


%); and, forest and consumer (


%).  Although most of our customers are domestic, ultimate points of origination or destination for some of the products transported (particularly coal bound for export and some intermodal shipments) may be outside the U.S.  Approximately


% of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  We periodically review our estimates, including those related to the recoverability and useful lives of assets, as well as liabilities for litigation, environmental remediation, casualty claims, income taxes and pension and other postretirement benefits.  Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Transportation revenue is recognized proportionally as a shipment moves from origin to destination, and related expenses are recognized as incurred.  Certain of our contract refunds (which are primarily volume-based incentives) are recorded as a reduction to revenues on the basis of management’s best estimate of projected liability, which is based on historical activity, current shipment counts and expectation of future activity.  Certain accessorial services may be provided to customers under their transportation contracts such as switching, demurrage and other incidental service revenues.  These are distinct performance obligations that are recognized at a point in time when the services are performed or as contractual obligations are met.

Cash Equivalents

“Cash equivalents” are highly liquid investments purchased three months or less from maturity.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $


million and $


million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  To determine our allowance for doubtful accounts, we evaluate historical loss experience (which has not been significant), the characteristics of current accounts, and general economic conditions and trends.

K41

Materials and Supplies

“Materials and supplies,” consisting mainly of items for maintenance of property and equipment, are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value.  The cost of materials and supplies expected to be used in property additions or improvements is included in “Properties.”

Investments

Investments in entities over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence but do not control the entity are accounted for using the equity method, whereby the investment is carried at the cost of the acquisition plus our equity in undistributed earnings or losses since acquisition.

Properties

“Properties” are stated principally at cost and are depreciated using the group method whereby assets with similar characteristics, use, and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes and depreciated using a composite depreciation rate.  This methodology treats each asset class as a pool of resources, not as singular items.  We use  approximately


depreciable asset classes.  “Depreciation” in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows includes both depreciation and depletion on operating and nonoperating properties.

Depreciation expense is based on our assumptions concerning expected service lives of our properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be received upon their retirement.  In developing these assumptions, we utilize periodic depreciation studies that are performed by an independent outside firm of consulting engineers and approved by the STB.  Our depreciation studies are conducted about every

three years

for equipment and every

six years

for track assets and other roadway property.  The frequency of these studies is consistent with guidelines established by the STB.  We adjust our rates based on the results of these studies and implement the changes prospectively.  The studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by the study.  Any such deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the affected class of property, as determined by the study.

Key factors that are considered in developing average service life and salvage estimates include:

•

statistical analysis of historical retirement data and surviving asset records;

•

review of historical salvage received and current market rates;

•

review of our operations including expected changes in technology, customer demand, maintenance practices and asset management strategies;

•

review of accounting policies and assumptions; and

•

industry review and analysis.

The composite depreciation rate for rail in high density corridors is derived based on consideration of annual gross tons as compared to the total or ultimate capacity of rail in these corridors.  Our experience has shown that traffic density is a leading factor in the determination of the expected service life of rail in high density corridors.  In developing the respective depreciation rate, consideration is also given to several rail characteristics including age, weight, condition (new or second-hand) and type (curved or straight).

We capitalize interest on major projects during the period of their construction.  Expenditures, including those on leased assets, that extend an asset’s useful life or increase its utility are capitalized.  Expenditures capitalized include those that are directly related to a capital project and may include materials, labor, and other direct costs, in addition to an allocable portion of indirect costs that relate to a capital project.  A significant portion of our annual capital spending relates to the replacement of self-constructed assets.  Removal activities occur in conjunction with replacement and are estimated based on the average percentage of time employees replacing assets spend on removal functions.  Costs related to repairs and maintenance activities that, in our judgment, do not extend an asset’s useful life or increase its utility are expensed when such repairs are performed.

K42

When depreciable operating road and equipment assets are sold or retired in the ordinary course of business, the cost of the assets, net of sale proceeds or salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized in earnings.  Actual historical cost values are retired when available, such as with most equipment assets.  The use of estimates in recording the retirement of certain roadway assets is necessary based on the impracticality of tracking individual asset costs.  When retiring rail, ties and ballast, we use statistical curves that indicate the relative distribution of the age of the assets retired.  The historical cost of other roadway assets is estimated using a combination of inflation indices specific to the rail industry and those published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.  The indices are applied to the replacement value based on the age of the retired assets.  These indices are used because they closely correlate with the costs of roadway assets.  Gains and losses on disposal of operating land are included in “Materials and other” expenses.  Gains and losses on disposal of nonoperating land and nonrail assets are included in “Other income – net” since such income is not a product of our railroad operations.

A retirement is considered abnormal if it does not occur in the ordinary course of business, if it relates to disposition of a large segment of an asset class and if the retirement varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies, which inherently consider the impact of normal retirements on expected service lives and depreciation rates.  Gains or losses from abnormal retirements would be recognized in income from railway operations.

We review the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flows.  Assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value.

New Accounting Pronouncements

The FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

,” and related amendments, which are jointly referred to as Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606. This standard replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP and requires entities to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.  A performance obligation is defined as a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer.  A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.  We adopted the provisions of this standard on January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method.  There was no cumulative effect of initially applying the standard, nor was there any material difference in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared with GAAP that was in effect prior to January 1, 2018.  See Note 2 for additional information.

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, “

Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost

.”  This update requires segregation of net benefit costs between operating and nonoperating expenses and requires retrospective application.  We adopted the standard on January 1, 2018.  Under the new standard, only the service cost component of defined benefit pension cost and postretirement benefit cost are reported within “Compensation and benefits” and all other components of net benefit cost are presented in “Other income – net” on the Consolidated Statements of Income, whereas under the previous standard all components were included in “Compensation and benefits.”  The retrospective application resulted in an increase to “Compensation and benefits” expense and an offsetting increase to “Other income – net” on the Consolidated Statements of Income of $


million for the year ended December 31, 2017, with no impact on “Net income.”

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, “

Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

.”  This update is intended to reclassify the stranded tax effects resulting from tax reform from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) to retained earnings.  The amount of the reclassification is the difference between the amount initially charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income at the previously enacted U.S. federal corporate income tax rate that remains in AOCI and the amount that would have been charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income using the newly enacted U.S. federal corporate income tax rate.  In the first quarter of 2018, we adopted the provisions of ASU 2018-02 resulting in an increase to

K43

“Accumulated other comprehensive loss” of $


million and a corresponding increase to “Retained income,” with no impact on “Total stockholders’ equity.”

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “

Leases (Topic 842)

,” and subsequent amendments, which replaced existing lease guidance in GAAP.  We adopted the standard on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method and used the effective date as our date of initial application.  See Note 10 for additional information.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “

Credit Losses - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

,” which replaces the current incurred loss impairment method with a method that reflects expected credit losses.  We adopted the standard on January 1, 2020.  Because credit losses associated from our trade receivables have historically been insignificant, we do not expect this standard to have a material effect on our financial statements.

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “

Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes

,” which adds new guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes, changes the accounting for certain income tax transactions, and makes other minor changes.  The new standard is effective as of January 1, 2021, and early adoption is permitted for any interim period for which financial statements have not been issued.  We do not expect this standard to have a material effect on our financial statements.  We will not adopt the standard early.

2.

Railway Operating Revenues

The following table disaggregates our revenues by major commodity group:

At the beginning of 2019, we recategorized certain commodities within Merchandise major commodity groups to

better align with how we internally manage these commodities.  Prior period amounts have been reclassified to

conform to the current presentation with no net impact to overall Merchandise revenue or total railway operating

revenues.  Specifically, certain commodities were shifted between chemicals, agriculture products, metals and construction, and forest and consumer.

We recognize the amount of revenue we expect to be entitled to for the transfer of promised goods or services to

customers.  A performance obligation is created when a customer under a transportation contract or public tariff submits a bill of lading to NS for the transport of goods.  These performance obligations are satisfied as the shipments move from origin to destination.  As such, transportation revenue is recognized proportionally as a shipment moves, and related expenses are recognized as incurred.  These performance obligations are generally short-term in nature with transit days averaging approximately one week or less for each commodity group.  The customer has an unconditional obligation to pay for the service once the service has been completed.  Estimated revenue associated with in-process shipments at period-end is recorded based on the estimated percentage of service

K44

completed to total transit days.  We had no material remaining performance obligations at December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Revenue related to interline transportation services that involve another railroad is reported on a net basis.  Therefore, the portion of the amount that relates to another party is not reflected in revenue.

Under the typical payment terms of our freight contracts, payment for services is due within

fifteen days

of billing the customer, thus there are no significant financing components.

“Accounts receivable – net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets includes both customer and non-customer receivables as follows:

Non-customer receivables include non-revenue-related amounts due from other railroads, governmental entities, and others.  “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets includes non-current customer receivables of $


million and $


million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  In 2019, we wrote off a $


million non-current customer receivable resulting from a legal dispute and this expense is included in “Materials and other” on the Consolidated Statements of Income.  We do not have any material contract assets or liabilities at December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Certain accessorial services may be provided to customers under their transportation contracts such as switching, demurrage and other incidental service revenues.  These are distinct performance obligations that are recognized at a point in time when the services are performed or as contractual obligations are met.  This revenue is included within each of the commodity groups and represents approximately


% and


% of total “Railway operating revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Income Taxes

Reconciliation of Statutory Rate to Effective Rate

“Income taxes” on the Consolidated Statements of Income differs from the amounts computed by applying the statutory federal corporate tax rate as follows:

Tax reform, enacted in 2017, lowered the Federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and made numerous other tax law changes.  GAAP requires companies to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment.  As a result, in 2017, “Purchased services and rents” included a $


million benefit for earnings generated from reductions to net deferred tax liabilities at certain equity investees and “Income taxes” included a $

3,331

million benefit primarily due to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the lower rate.

K46

Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities

Certain items are reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax purposes.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in recognition of these differences.

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are as follows:

Except for amounts for which a valuation allowance has been provided, we believe that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets.  The valuation allowance at the end of each year primarily relates to subsidiary state income tax net operating losses and state investment tax credits that may not be utilized prior to their expiration.  The total valuation allowance increased by $


million in 2019, $


million in 2018, and $


million in 2017.

Uncertain Tax Positions

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2019 are potential benefits of $


million that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.  Unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amount recorded.

K47

The statute of limitations on Internal Revenue Service examinations has expired for all years prior to 2015.  We have amended our 2012 income tax return to request a refund of $


million, which is not included in the above balance of unrecognized tax benefits.  We would recognize a tax benefit of around $


million if the refund is allowed.  State income tax returns generally are subject to examination for a period of three to four years after filing of the return.  In addition, we are generally obligated to report changes in taxable income arising from federal income tax examinations to the states within a period of up to two years from the date the federal examination is final.  We have various state income tax returns either under examination, administrative appeal, or litigation.

5.

Fair Value Measurements

FASB ASC 820-10,

“Fair Value Measurements,”

established a framework for measuring fair value and a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels, as follows:

The asset or liability’s fair value measurement level within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The fair values of “Cash and cash equivalents,” “Accounts receivable

–

net,” and “Accounts payable,” approximate carrying values because of the short maturity of these financial instruments.  The carrying value of COLI is recorded at cash surrender value and, accordingly, approximates fair value.  There are no other assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2019 or 2018.

The carrying amounts and estimated fair values, based on Level 1 inputs, of long-term debt consisted of the following at December 31:

Investments

Investment in Conrail

Through a limited liability company, we and CSX jointly own Conrail, whose primary subsidiary is CRC.  We have a


% economic and


% voting interest in the jointly owned entity, and CSX has the remainder of the economic and voting interests.  We are amortizing the excess of the purchase price over Conrail’s net equity using the principles of purchase accounting, based primarily on the estimated useful lives of Conrail’s depreciable property and equipment, including the related deferred tax effect of the differences in book and tax accounting bases for such assets, as all of the purchase price at acquisition was allocable to Conrail’s tangible assets and liabilities.

At December 31, 2019, based on the funded status of Conrail’s pension plans, we decreased our proportional investment in Conrail by $


million.  This resulted in a loss of $


million recorded to “Other comprehensive loss”.

At December 31, 2018, based on the funded status of Conrail’s pension plans, we decreased our proportional investment in Conrail by $


million.  This resulted in a loss of $


million recorded to “Other comprehensive loss” and a combined federal and state deferred tax liability of $


million.

At December 31, 2019, the difference between our investment in Conrail and our share of Conrail’s underlying net equity was $


million.  Our equity in the earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, included in “Purchased services and rents,” which offsets the costs of operating the Shared Assets Areas, was $


million for 2019, $


million for 2018, and $


million for 2017 (including $


million related to the enactment of tax reform

–

see Note 4).  Equity in earnings are included in the “Other

–

net” line item within operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

CRC owns and operates certain properties (the Shared Assets Areas) for the joint and exclusive benefit of NSR and CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT).  The costs of operating the Shared Assets Areas are borne by NSR and CSXT based on usage.  In addition, NSR and CSXT pay CRC a fee for access to the Shared Assets Areas.  “Purchased services and rents” and “Fuel” include expenses payable to CRC for operation of the Shared Assets Areas totaling $


million in 2019, $


million in 2018, and $


million in 2017.  Future payments for access fees due to CRC under the Shared Assets Areas agreements are as follows: $


million in each of 2020 through 2023 and $


million thereafter.  We provide certain general and administrative support functions to Conrail, the fees for which are billed in accordance with several service-provider arrangements and approximate $


million annually.

K49

“Accounts payable” includes $


million at December 31, 2019, and $


million at December 31, 2018, due to Conrail for the operation of the Shared Assets Areas.  “Other liabilities” includes $


million at both December 31, 2019 and 2018 for long-term advances from Conrail, maturing in 2044, that bear interest at an average rate of

2.9

%.

Investment in TTX

NS and eight other North American railroads jointly own TTX Company (TTX).  NS has a

19.65

% ownership interest in TTX, a railcar pooling company that provides its owner-railroads with standardized fleets of intermodal,

automotive, and general use railcars at stated rates.

Amounts paid to TTX for use of equipment are included in “Purchased services and rents.”  This amounted to $


million, $


million, and $


million of expense, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.  Our equity in the earnings of TTX, which offset the costs and are also included in “Purchased services and rents,” totaled $


million for 2019, $


million for 2018, and $


million for 2017 (including $


million related to the enactment of tax reform

–

The impairment loss is reflected in “Gains and losses on properties” in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2019.  At December 31, 2018, these assets were reflected in other property within “Properties” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, reflecting costs of obtaining rights to natural resources of $

In May 2019, we also renewed and amended our accounts receivable securitization program, increasing the program’s maximum borrowing capacity from $


million to $


million with a term expiring in May 2020.  Under this facility, NSR sells substantially all of its eligible third-party receivables to a subsidiary, which in turn may transfer beneficial interests in the receivables to various commercial paper vehicles.  Under this facility, we received $


million in 2019 and $


million in 2018, and paid $


million and $

no

amounts outstanding at both December 31, 2019 and 2018, and our available borrowing capacity was $


million and $

The January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2018 “Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash” line item in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows includes restricted cash of $


million which reflects deposits held by a third-party bond agent as collateral for certain debt obligations, which matured on October 1, 2019.  The restricted cash balance is included as part of “Other current assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2018.

Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “

Leases (Topic 842)

,” and subsequent amendments, which replaced existing lease guidance in GAAP and requires lessees to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for leases greater than twelve months and disclose key information about leasing arrangements.  We adopted the standard on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method and used the effective date as our date of initial application.  Financial information will not be updated and the disclosures required under the new standard will not be provided for dates and periods before January 1, 2019.  Upon adoption of the standard, we recognized ROU assets and corresponding lease liabilities of $


million on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 1, 2019.  There were no adjustments to “Retained income” on adoption.

The new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients for transition.  We elected the package of practical expedients under the transition guidance which permitted us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions for lease identification and lease classification on expired or existing contracts and whether initial direct costs previously capitalized would qualify for capitalization under FASB ASC 842.  We also elected the practical expedient related to land easements, which allowed us to not reassess our current accounting treatment for existing agreements on land easements, which are not accounted for as leases.  We did not elect the hindsight practical expedient to determine the reasonably certain lease term for existing leases.

K53

The new standard also provides practical expedients and recognition exemptions for an entity’s ongoing accounting policy elections.  We elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify.  This means, for those leases that qualify, we do not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities.  We also elected the practical expedient not to separate lease and non-lease components for all of our leases.

We are committed under long-term lease agreements for equipment, lines of road, and other property.  Some of these agreements contain variable payment provisions that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the lease commencement date, and are therefore not included in our future minimum lease payments.  These variable lease agreements include usage-based payments for equipment under service contracts, lines of road, and other property.  Our long-term lease agreements do not contain any material restrictive covenants.

Our equipment leases have remaining terms of less than


year to


years and our lines of road and land leases have remaining terms of less than


year to


years.  Some of these leases include options to extend the leases for up to


years and some include options to terminate the leases within


days.  Because we are not reasonably certain to exercise these renewal options, the options are not considered in determining the lease term, and associated payments are excluded from future minimum lease payments.

Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet.  We recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Operating lease amounts included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were as follows:

The components of total lease expense, primarily included in

“Purchased services and rents,” were as follows:

At December 31, 2019, we do not have any material finance lease assets or liabilities, nor do we have any material subleases.

K54

In March 2019, we entered into a non-cancellable lease for an office building with an estimated construction cost of $


million.  The lease will commence upon completion of the construction (for which we are a construction agent) of the office building which is expected to be in 2021.  The initial term of the lease is

five years

with options to renew, purchase, or sell the office building at the end of the lease term.  Upon lease commencement, the ROU asset and lease liability will be determined and recorded.  The lease also contains a residual value guarantee of up to

ninety

percent of the total construction cost.

Other information related to operating leases was as follows:

As the rates implicit in most of our leases are not readily determinable, we use a collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of future payments.  We use the portfolio approach and group leases into short, medium, and long-term categories, applying the corresponding incremental borrowing rates to these categories of leases.

During 2019, ROU assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities were $


million.  During 2019, cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities was $


million and is included in operating cash flows.  During 2019, cash proceeds from a sale and leaseback transaction were $


million and the gain on the transaction was $


million.

Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases were as follows:

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

We have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans covering principally salaried employees.  We also provide specified health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retired employees; these plans can be amended or terminated at our option.  Under our self-insured retiree health care plan, for those participants who are not Medicare-eligible, certain health care expenses are covered for retired employees and their dependents, reduced by any deductibles, coinsurance, and, in some cases, coverage provided under other group insurance policies.  Those participants who are Medicare-eligible are not covered under the self-insured retiree health care plan, but instead are provided with an employer-funded health reimbursement account which can be used for reimbursement of health insurance premiums or eligible out-of-pocket medical expenses.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations and Plan Assets

K57

Our accumulated benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans is $

2.3

billion and $

2.2

billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  Our unfunded pension plans, included above, which in all cases have no assets, had projected benefit obligations of $


million and $


million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and had accumulated benefit obligations of $


million and $


million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Cost Components

Other Changes in Plan Assets and Benefit Obligations Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income

Net gains arising during the year for pension benefits were due primarily to higher actual returns on plan assets, partially offset by a decrease in discount rates.  Net losses arising during the year for other postretirement benefits were due primarily to a decrease in discount rates, partially offset by higher actual returns on plan assets.

K58

The estimated net losses for the pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic cost over the next year are $


million.  The estimated prior service benefit for the other postretirement benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit over the next year is $


million.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Assumptions

Costs for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined based on actuarial valuations that reflect appropriate assumptions as of the measurement date, ordinarily the beginning of each year.  The funded status of the plans is determined using appropriate assumptions as of each year end.

A summary of the major assumptions follows:

To determine the discount rates used to measure our benefit obligations, we utilize analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and other postretirement benefit plans were matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds.  We use the results of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans.

We use a spot rate approach to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

Health Care Cost Trend Assumptions

For measurement purposes at December 31, 2019, increases in the per capita cost of pre-Medicare covered health care benefits were assumed to be

6.25

% for 2020.  It is assumed the rate will decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of

5.0

% for 2025 and remain at that level thereafter.

K59

Assumed health care cost trend rates affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements.

To illustrate, a one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend would have the following effects:

Asset Management

Eleven

investment firms manage our defined benefit pension plans’ assets under investment guidelines approved by our Benefits Investment Committee that is composed of members of our management.  Investments are restricted to domestic and international equity securities, domestic and international fixed income securities, and unleveraged exchange-traded options and financial futures.  Limitations restrict investment concentration and use of certain derivative investments.  The target asset allocation for equity is


% of the pension plans’ assets.  Fixed income investments must consist predominantly of securities rated investment grade or higher.  Equity investments must be in liquid securities listed on national exchanges.  No investment is permitted in our securities (except through commingled pension trust funds).

Our pension plans’ weighted average asset allocations, by asset category, were as follows:

The other postretirement benefit plan assets consist primarily of trust-owned variable life insurance policies with an asset allocation at December 31, 2019 of


% in equity securities and


% in debt securities compared with


% in equity securities and


% in debt securities at December 31, 2018.  The target asset allocation for equity is between


% and


% of the plan’s assets.

The plans’ assumed future returns are based principally on the asset allocations and historical returns for the plans’ asset classes determined from both actual plan returns and, over longer time periods, expected market returns for those asset classes.  For 2020, we assume an

8.25

% return on pension plan assets.

K60

Fair Value of Plan Assets

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for pension plan assets measured at fair value.

Common stock:  Shares held by the plan at year end are valued at the official closing price as defined by the exchange or at the most recent trade price of the security at the close of the active market.

Common collective trusts:  The readily determinable fair value is based on the published fair value per unit of the trusts.  The common collective trusts hold equity securities, fixed income securities and cash and cash equivalents.

Fixed income securities:  Valued based on quotes received from independent pricing services or at an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for the security at year end using observable market-based inputs.

Commingled funds:  The readily determinable fair value is based on the published fair value per unit of the funds.  The commingled funds hold equity securities.

Cash and cash equivalents:  Short-term Treasury bills or notes are valued at an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for the security at year end using observable market-based inputs; money market funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the funds are traded.

The following table sets forth the pension plans’ assets by valuation technique level, within the fair value hierarchy.  There were no level 3 valued assets at December 31, 2019 or 2018.

K61

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for other postretirement benefit plan assets measured at fair value.

Trust-owned life insurance:  Valued at our share of the net assets of trust-owned life insurance issued by a major insurance company.  The underlying investments of that trust consist of a U.S. stock account and a U.S. bond account but may retain cash at times as well.  The U.S. stock account and U.S. bond account are valued based on readily determinable fair values.

The other postretirement benefit plan assets consisted of trust-owned life insurance with fair values of $


million and $


million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and are valued under level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  There were no level 1 or level 3 valued assets.

Contributions and Estimated Future Benefit Payments

In 2020, we expect to contribute approximately $


million to our unfunded pension plans for payments to pensioners and approximately $


million to our other postretirement benefit plans for retiree health and death benefits.  We do not expect to contribute to our funded pension plan in 2020.

Benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:

K62

Other Postretirement Coverage

Under collective bargaining agreements, Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries participate in a multi-employer benefit plan, which provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to eligible union employees.  Premiums under this plan are expensed as incurred and totaled $


million in 2019, $


million in 2018, and $


million in 2017.

Section 401(k) Plans

Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries provide Section 401(k) savings plans for employees.  Under the plans, we match a portion of employee contributions, subject to applicable limitations.  Our matching contributions, recorded as an expense, under these plans were $


million in 2019 and $


million in both 2018 and 2017.

13.

Stock-Based Compensation

Under the stockholder-approved Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), the Compensation Committee (Committee), which is made up of nonemployee members of the Board of Directors, or the Chief Executive Officer (when delegated authority by such Committee), may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock units (RSUs), restricted shares, performance share units (PSUs), and performance shares, up to a maximum of

104,125,000

shares of our Common Stock, of which

9,294,726

remain available for future grants as of December 31, 2019.

The number of shares remaining for issuance under the LTIP is reduced (i) by


for each award granted as a stock option or stock-settled SAR, or (ii) by

1.61

for an award made in the form other than a stock option or stock-settled SAR.  Under the Board-approved Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan (TSOP), the Committee may grant stock options up to a maximum of

6,000,000

shares of Common Stock.  We use newly issued shares to satisfy any exercises and awards under the LTIP and the TSOP.

The LTIP also permits the payment, on a current or a deferred basis and in cash or in stock, of dividend equivalents on shares of Common Stock covered by stock options, RSUs, or PSUs in an amount commensurate with regular quarterly dividends paid on Common Stock.  With respect to stock options, if employment of the participant is terminated for any reason, including retirement, disability, or death, we have no further obligation to make any dividend equivalent payments.  Regarding RSUs, we have no further obligation to make any dividend equivalent payments unless employment of the participant is terminated as a result of qualifying retirement or disability. Should an employee terminate employment, they are not required to forfeit dividend equivalent payments already received.  Outstanding PSUs do not receive dividend equivalent payments.

The Committee granted stock options, RSUs and PSUs pursuant to the LTIP and granted stock options pursuant to the TSOP for the last three years as follows:

K63

Beginning in 2018, recipients of certain RSUs and PSUs pursuant to the LTIP who retire prior to October 1st will forfeit awards received in the current year.  Receipt of certain LTIP awards is contingent on the recipient having executed a non-compete agreement with the company.

We account for our grants of stock options, RSUs, PSUs, and dividend equivalent payments in accordance with FASB ASC 718, “

Compensation - Stock Compensation

.”  Accordingly, all awards result in charges to net income while dividend equivalent payments, which are all related to equity classified awards, are charged to retained income.  Compensation cost for the awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.

Related compensation costs and tax benefits during the year were:

Stock Options

Option exercise prices will be at least the higher of (i) the average of the high and low prices at which Common Stock is traded on the grant date, or (ii) the closing price of Common Stock on the grant date.  All options are subject to a vesting period of at least

one year

, and the term of the option will not exceed

ten years

.  Holders of the options granted under the LTIP who remain actively employed receive cash dividend equivalent payments for

four years

in an amount equal to the regular quarterly dividends paid on Common Stock.  Dividend equivalent payments are not made on the TSOP options.

For all years, options granted under the LTIP and the TSOP may not be exercised prior to the fourth and third anniversaries of the date of grant, respectively, or if the optionee retires or dies before that anniversary date, may not be exercised before the later of one year after the grant date or the date of the optionee’s retirement or death.

The fair value of each option awarded in 2019 and 2018 was measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model.  The fair value of each option awarded in 2017 was measured on the date of grant using a binomial lattice-based option valuation model.  Expected volatility is based on implied volatility from traded options on, and historical volatility of, Common Stock.  Historical data is used to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model.  For the 2019 and 2018 grant years, historical exercise data is used to estimate the average expected option term.  For the 2017 grant year, the average expected option term is derived from the output of the valuation model and represents the period of time that all options granted are expected to be outstanding, including the branches of the model that result in options expiring unexercised.  The average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.  A dividend yield of

zero

was used for the LTIP options during the vesting period.  For 2019, 2018, and 2017, a dividend yield of

2.06

%,

1.94

%, and

2.04

%, respectively, was used for all vested LTIP options and all TSOP options.

The assumptions for the LTIP and TSOP grants for the last three years are shown in the following table:

K64

A summary of changes in stock options is presented below:

The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding at December 31, 2019 was $


million with a weighted average remaining contractual term of


years.  Of these options outstanding,

1,856,019

were exercisable and had an aggregate intrinsic value of $


million with a weighted average exercise price of $

88.48

and a weighted average remaining contractual term of

2.9

years.

The following table provides information related to options exercised for the last three years:

At December 31, 2019, total unrecognized compensation related to options granted under the LTIP and the TSOP was $


million, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately

1.6

years.

Restricted Stock Units

Beginning in 2018, RSUs granted primarily have a

four

-year ratable restriction period and will be settled through the issuance of shares of Common Stock.  RSUs granted prior to 2018 have a

five

-year restriction period and will also be settled through the issuance of shares of Common Stock.  Certain RSU grants include cash dividend equivalent payments during the restriction period in an amount equal to regular quarterly dividends paid on Common Stock.

K65

A summary of changes in RSUs is presented below:

At December 31, 2019, total unrecognized compensation related to RSUs was $


million, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately

2.6

years.

Performance Share Units

PSUs provide for awards based on the achievement of certain predetermined corporate performance goals at the end of a

three

-year cycle and are settled through the issuance of shares of Common Stock.  All PSUs will earn out based on the achievement of performance conditions and some will also earn out based on a market condition.  The market condition fair value was measured on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model.

A summary of changes in PSUs is presented below:

At December 31, 2019, total unrecognized compensation related to PSUs granted under the LTIP was $


million, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately

1.7

years.

Earnings Per Share

The following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share:

In each year, dividend equivalent payments were made to holders of stock options and RSUs.  For purposes of computing basic earnings per share, dividend equivalent payments made to holders of stock options and RSUs were deducted from net income to determine income available to common stockholders.  For purposes of computing diluted earnings per share, we evaluate on a grant-by-grant basis those stock options and RSUs receiving dividend equivalent payments under the two-class and treasury stock methods to determine which method is more dilutive for each grant.  For those grants for which the two-class method was more dilutive, net income was reduced by dividend equivalent payments to determine income available to common stockholders.  The dilution calculations exclude options having exercise prices exceeding the average market price of Common Stock of

zero

for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and

0.2

million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Commitments and Contingencies

Lawsuits

We and/or certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations.  When we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, it is accrued through a charge to earnings.  While the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future developments, in our opinion, the recorded liability is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims.  However, the final outcome of any of

K69

these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter.  Any adjustments to the recorded liability will be reflected in earnings in the periods in which such adjustments become known.

In 2007, various antitrust class actions filed against us and other Class I railroads in various Federal district courts regarding fuel surcharges were consolidated in the District of Columbia by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation.  In 2012, the court certified the case as a class action.  The defendant railroads appealed this certification, and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia vacated the District Court’s decision and remanded the case for further consideration. On October 10, 2017, the District Court denied class certification.  The decision was upheld by the Court of Appeals on August 16, 2019. Since that decision, various individual cases have been filed in multiple jurisdictions.  We believe the allegations in the complaints are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the cases.  We do not believe the outcome of these proceedings will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

Casualty Claims

Casualty claims include employee personal injury and occupational claims as well as third-party claims, all exclusive of legal costs.  To aid in valuing our personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue with respect to such claims during the year, we utilize studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm.  Job-related personal injury and occupational claims are subject to FELA, which is applicable only to railroads.  FELA’s fault-based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault workers’ compensation system.  The variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being different from the liability recorded.  While the ultimate amount of claims incurred is dependent on future developments, in our opinion, the recorded liability is adequate to cover the future payments of claims and is supported by the most recent actuarial study.  In all cases, we record a liability when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and reasonably estimable.

Employee personal injury claims

– The largest component of casualties and other claims expense is employee personal injury costs.  The independent actuarial firm engaged by us provides quarterly studies to aid in valuing our employee personal injury liability and estimating personal injury expense.  The actuarial firm studies our historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements, taking into account relevant outside influences.  The actuarial firm uses the results of these analyses to estimate the ultimate amount of liability.  We adjust the liability quarterly based upon our assessment and the results of the study.  Our estimate of the liability is subject to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events such as jury decisions, court interpretations, or legislative changes.  As a result, actual claim settlements may vary from the estimated liability recorded.

Occupational claims

– Occupational claims include injuries and illnesses alleged to be caused by exposures which occur over time as opposed to injuries or illnesses caused by a specific accident or event.  Types of occupational claims commonly seen allege exposure to asbestos and other claimed toxic substances resulting in respiratory diseases or cancer.  Many such claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been employed in the rail industry for decades.  The independent actuarial firm provides an estimate of the occupational claims liability based upon our history of claim filings, severity, payments, and other pertinent facts.  The liability is dependent upon judgments we make as to the specific case reserves as well as judgments of the actuarial firm in the quarterly studies.  The actuarial firm’s estimate of ultimate loss includes a provision for those claims that have been incurred but not reported.  This provision is derived by analyzing industry data and projecting our experience.  We adjust the liability quarterly based upon our assessment and the results of the study.  However, it is possible that the recorded liability may not be adequate to cover the future payment of claims.  Adjustments to the recorded liability are reflected in operating expenses in the periods in which such adjustments become known.

Third-party claims

– We record a liability for third-party claims including those for highway crossing accidents, trespasser and other injuries, property damage, and lading damage.  The actuarial firm assists us with the calculation

K70

of potential liability for third-party claims, except lading damage, based upon our experience including the number and timing of incidents, amount of payments, settlement rates, number of open claims, and legal defenses.  We adjust the liability quarterly based upon our assessment and the results of the study.  Given the inherent uncertainty in regard to the ultimate outcome of third-party claims, it is possible that the actual loss may differ from the  estimated liability recorded.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to various jurisdictions’ environmental laws and regulations.  We record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and reasonably estimable.  Environmental specialists regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates.

Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include liabilities for environmental exposures of $


million at December 31, 2019, and $


million at December 31, 2018, of which $


million is classified as a current liability at the end of both 2019 and 2018.  At December 31, 2019, the liability represents our estimates of the probable cleanup, investigation, and remediation costs based on available information at


known locations and projects compared with


locations and projects at December 31, 2018.  At December 31, 2019,

sixteen

sites accounted for $


million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material.  We anticipate that much of this liability will be paid out over

five years

; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period.

At

eleven

locations, one or more of our subsidiaries in conjunction with a number of other parties have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 or comparable state statutes that impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs.  We calculate our estimated liability for these sites based on facts and legal defenses applicable to each site and not solely on the basis of the potential for joint liability.

With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by us or by the Environmental Protection Agency or comparable state authorities), estimates of our ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites can change over time because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, unpredictable contaminant recovery and reduction rates associated with available cleanup technologies, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participant’s share of any estimated loss (and that participant’s ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability.

The risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions, past, present, and future, is inherent in the railroad business.  Some of the commodities we transport, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, pose special risks that we work diligently to reduce.  In addition, several of our subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased and operated by others, or held for sale.  Because environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, there can be no assurance that we will not incur environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time.  Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and potentially other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time.  The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

Based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances now known, we believe we have recorded the probable and reasonably estimable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which we are aware.  Further, we believe that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

K71

Insurance

We obtain on behalf of ourself and our subsidiaries insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and first-party property damages.  With limited exceptions, we are currently insured above $


million and below $

1.1

billion ($

1.5

billion for specific perils) per occurrence and/or policy year for bodily injury and property damage to third parties and above $


million and below $


million per occurrence and/or policy year for property owned by us or in our care, custody, or control.

Purchase Commitments

At December 31, 2019, we had outstanding purchase commitments totaling approximately $

1.2

billion for locomotives, track material, long-term service contracts, track and yard expansion projects in connection with our capital programs as well as freight cars and containers through 2024.

Change-In-Control Arrangements

We have compensation agreements with certain officers and key employees that become operative only upon a change in control of Norfolk Southern, as defined in those agreements.  The agreements provide generally for payments based on compensation at the time of a covered individual’s involuntary or other specified termination and for certain other benefits.

Indemnifications

In a number of instances, we have agreed to indemnify lenders for additional costs they may bear as a result of certain changes in laws or regulations applicable to their loans.  Such changes may include impositions or modifications with respect to taxes, duties, reserves, liquidity, capital adequacy, special deposits, and similar requirements relating to extensions of credit by, deposits with, or the assets or liabilities of such lenders.  The nature and timing of changes in laws or regulations applicable to our financings are inherently unpredictable, and therefore our exposure in connection with the foregoing indemnifications cannot be quantified.  No liability has been recorded related to these indemnifications.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the assistance of management, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) at December 31, 2019.  Based on such evaluation, our officers have concluded that, at December 31, 2019, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to our ability to record, process, summarize, and report reliable financial data.  We recognize that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control.  Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation.  Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.

Our Board of Directors, acting through its Audit Committee, is responsible for the oversight of our accounting policies, financial reporting, and internal control.  The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors is comprised of outside directors who are independent of management.  The independent registered public accounting firm and our internal auditors have full and unlimited access to the Audit Committee, with or without management, to discuss the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, and any other matters which they believe should be brought to the attention of the Audit Committee.

We have issued a report of our assessment of internal control over financial reporting, and our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2019.  These reports appear in Item 8 of this report on Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

During the fourth quarter of 2019, we have not identified any changes in internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially effect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Norfolk Southern Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan

Established on June 28, 1983, and approved by our stockholders at their Annual Meeting held on May 10, 1984, LTIP was adopted to promote the success of our company by providing an opportunity for non-employee Directors, officers, and other key employees to acquire a proprietary interest in the Corporation.  The Board of Directors amended LTIP on January 23, 2015, which amendment was approved by shareholders on May 14, 2015, to include the reservation for issuance of an additional 8,000,000 shares of authorized but unissued Common Stock.

The amended LTIP adopted a fungible share reserve ratio so that, for awards granted after May 13, 2010, the number of shares remaining for issuance under the amended LTIP will be reduced (i) by 1 for each award granted as an option or stock-settled SAR, or (ii) by 1.61 for an award made in the form other than an option or stock-settled SAR.  Any shares of Common Stock subject to options, PSUs, restricted shares, or RSUs which are not issued as Common Stock will again be available for award under LTIP after the expiration or forfeiture of an award.

K76

Non-employee Directors, officers, and other key employees residing in the United States of America or Canada are eligible for selection to receive LTIP awards.  Under LTIP, the Committee, or the Corporation’s chief executive officer to the extent the Committee delegates award-making authority pursuant to LTIP, may grant incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, SARs, RSUs, restricted shares, PSUs, and performance shares.  In addition, dividend equivalent payments may be awarded for options, RSUs, and PSUs.  Awards under LTIP may be made subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances and the Committee may establish such other terms and conditions for the awards as provided in LTIP.

For options granted after May 13, 2010, the option price will be at least the higher of (i) the average of the high and low prices at which Common Stock is traded on the date of grant, or (ii) the closing price of Common Stock on the date of the grant.  All options are subject to a vesting period of at least one year, and the term of the option will not exceed ten years.  LTIP specifically prohibits option repricing without stockholder approval, except that adjustments may be made in the event of changes in our capital structure or Common Stock.

PSUs entitle a recipient to receive performance-based compensation at the end of a three-year cycle based on our performance during that period.  For the 2019 PSU awards, corporate performance will be based directly on return on average capital invested, with total return to stockholders serving as a modifier, and will be settled in shares of Common Stock.  In 2016, the Committee also granted an “accelerated turnaround incentive” award in the form of a PSU with a three-year performance that was based on equally weighted standards established by the Committee for operating ratio and earnings per share.  We did not meet the performance criteria for operating ratio and therefore no payout for the accelerated turnaround incentive award was achieved.

RSUs are payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock at the end of a restriction period.  During the restriction period, the holder of the RSUs has no beneficial ownership interest in the Common Stock represented by the RSUs and has no right to vote the shares represented by the units or to receive dividends (except for dividend equivalent payment rights that may be awarded with respect to the RSUs).  The Committee at its discretion may waive the restriction period, but settlement of any RSUs will occur on the same settlement date as would have applied absent a waiver of restrictions, if no performance goals were imposed.  RSUs will be settled in shares of Common Stock.

Norfolk Southern Corporation Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan

Our Board of Directors adopted TSOP on January 26, 1999, to promote the success of our company by providing an opportunity for nonagreement employees to acquire a proprietary interest in our company and thereby to provide an additional incentive to nonagreement employees to devote their maximum efforts and skills to the advancement, betterment, and prosperity of our company and our stockholders.  Under TSOP there were 6,000,000 shares of authorized but unissued Common Stock reserved for issuance.  TSOP has not been and is not required to have been approved by our stockholders.

Active full-time nonagreement employees residing in the United States of America or Canada are eligible for selection to receive TSOP awards.  Under TSOP, the Committee, or the Corporation’s chief executive officer to the extent the Committee delegates award-making authority pursuant to TSOP, may grant nonqualified stock options subject to such terms and conditions as provided in TSOP.

The option price may not be less than the average of the high and low prices at which Common Stock is traded on the date of the grant.  All options are subject to a vesting period of at least one year, and the term of the option will not exceed ten years.  TSOP specifically prohibits repricing without stockholder approval, except for capital adjustments.

Norfolk Southern Corporation Directors’ Restricted Stock Plan (Plan)

The Plan was adopted on January 1, 1994, and was designed to increase ownership of Common Stock by our non-employee Directors so as to further align their ownership interest in our company with that of our stockholders.  The Plan has not been and is not required to have been approved by our stockholders.

Effective January 23, 2015, the Board amended the Plan to provide that no additional awards will be made under the Plan.  Prior to that amendment, only non-employee Directors who are not and never have been employees of our company were eligible to participate in the Plan.  Upon becoming a Director, each eligible Director received a one-time grant of 3,000 restricted shares of Common Stock.  No additional shares may be granted under the Plan.  No individual member of the Board exercised discretion concerning the eligibility of any Director or the number of shares granted.

The restriction period applicable to restricted shares granted under the Plan begins on the date of the grant and ends on the earlier of the recipient’s death or the day after the recipient ceases to be a Director by reason of disability or retirement.  During the restriction period, shares may not be sold, pledged, or otherwise encumbered.  Directors forfeit the restricted shares if they cease to serve as a Director of our company for reasons other than their disability, retirement, or death.
