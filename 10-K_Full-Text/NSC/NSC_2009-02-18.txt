GENERAL -

Norfolk Southern Corporation (Norfolk
Southern) is a Norfolk, Virginia based company that controls a major freight
railroad, Norfolk Southern Railway Company.
 
Norfolk Southern Railway Company is
primarily engaged in the rail transportation of raw materials, intermediate
products, and finished goods primarily in the Southeast, East, and Midwest and,
via interchange with rail carriers, to and from the rest of the United
States.
 
Norfolk Southern also transports
overseas freight through several Atlantic and Gulf Coast ports.
 
Norfolk Southern provides comprehensive
logistics services and offers the most extensive intermodal network in the eastern
half of the United States.
 
The
common stock of Norfolk Southern is listed on the New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE) under the symbol “NSC.”

Norfolk
Southern was incorporated on July 23, 1980, under the laws of the Commonwealth
of Virginia.
 
On June l, 1982,
Norfolk Southern acquired control of two major operating railroads, Norfolk and
Western Railway Company (NW) and Southern Railway Company (Southern) in
accordance with an Agreement of Merger and Reorganization dated as of July 31,
1980, and with the approval of the transaction by the Interstate Commerce
Commission (now the Surface Transportation Board [STB]).
 
Effective December 31, 1990, Norfolk
Southern transferred all the common stock of NW to Southern, and Southern’s
name was changed to Norfolk Southern Railway Company (Norfolk Southern Railway
or NSR).

1998, NW was merged with and into Norfolk Southern Railway.
 
As of December 31, 2008, all the common
stock of Norfolk Southern Railway was owned directly by Norfolk Southern.

Through
a limited liability company, Norfolk Southern and CSX Corporation (CSX) jointly
own Conrail Inc. (Conrail), whose primary subsidiary is Consolidated Rail
Corporation (CRC).
 
Norfolk Southern
has a 58% economic and 50% voting interest in the jointly owned entity, and CSX
has the remainder of the economic and voting interests.
 
CRC owns and operates certain properties
(the Shared Assets Areas) for the joint and exclusive benefit of NSR and CSX
Transportation Inc. (CSXT) (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

RAILWAY
OPERATING REVENUES –

NS’ total railway operating revenues were $10.7 billion
in 2008.
 
See the financial
information by traffic segment in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

COAL TRAFFIC –

Coal, coke, and iron
ore – most of which is bituminous coal – is NS’
railroads’ largest commodity group as measured by revenues.
 
The railroads handled a total of 194.2 million
tons in 2008, most of which originated on NS’ lines in West Virginia,
Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky.
 

Revenues from coal, coke, and iron ore accounted for about 29% of NS’
total railway operating revenues in 2008.

Total
coal handled through all system ports in 2008 was 41.8 million tons.
 
Of this total, 18.9 million tons
(including coastwise traffic) moved through Norfolk, Virginia, 5.7 million tons
moved through the Baltimore Terminal, 11.3 million tons moved to various
docks on the Ohio River, and 5.9 million tons moved to various Lake Erie ports.
 
Other than coal for export, virtually
all coal handled by NS’ railroads was terminated in states east of the
Mississippi River.

See
the discussion of coal traffic, by type of coal, in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

GENERAL
MERCHANDISE TRAFFIC -

General merchandise traffic is composed of five major commodity
groupings:  automotive; chemicals; metals and construction;
agriculture, consumer products and government; and paper, clay and forest
products.
 
The automotive group
includes finished vehicles for BMW, Chrysler, Ford Motor Company, General
Motors, Honda, Isuzu, Jaguar, Land Rover, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi,
Nissan, Saab, Subaru, Suzuki, Toyota, and Volkswagen, and auto parts for Ford
Motor Company, General Motors, Mercedes-Benz, and Toyota.
 
The chemicals group includes sulfur and
related chemicals, petroleum products, chlorine and bleaching compounds,
plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals, chemical wastes, and municipal
wastes.
 
The metals and construction
group includes steel, aluminum products, machinery, scrap metals, cement,
aggregates, bricks, and minerals.
 

The agriculture, consumer products, and government group includes
soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizer, animal and poultry feed, food oils, flour,
beverages, canned goods, sweeteners, consumer products, ethanol, and items for
the military.
 
The paper, clay and
forest products group includes lumber and wood products, pulp board and paper
products, wood fibers, wood pulp, scrap paper, and clay.

In 2008, 135 million tons of general
merchandise freight, or approximately 67% of total general merchandise tonnage
handled by NS, originated online.
 

The balance of general merchandise traffic was received from
connecting carriers at interterritorial gateways.
 
The principal interchange points for
NS-received traffic included Chicago, Memphis, New Orleans, Cincinnati, Kansas
City, Detroit, Hagerstown, St. Louis/East St. Louis, and Louisville.
 
General merchandise carloads handled in
2008 were 2.6 million, the revenues from which accounted for 52% of
NS’ total railway operating revenues in 2008.

See
the discussion of general merchandise rail traffic by commodity group in
Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

INTERMODAL TRAFFIC -

The intermodal market
consists of shipments moving in trailers, domestic and international
containers, and Roadrailer® equipment.
 

These shipments are handled on behalf of intermodal marketing companies,
international steamship lines, truckers, and other shippers.
 
Intermodal units handled in 2008 were 3 million,
the revenues from which accounted for 19% of NS’ total railway operating
revenues for the year.

See
the discussion of intermodal traffic in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

FREIGHT
RATES -

In
2008, NS’ railroads continued their reliance on private contracts and
exempt price quotes as their predominant pricing mechanisms.
 
Thus, a major portion of NS’
railroads’ freight business is not currently economically regulated by
the government.
 
In general, market
forces have been substituted for government regulation and now are the primary
determinant of rail service prices.

In 2008, NS’ railroads were found by the STB
to be “revenue adequate” based on results for the year 2006.
 
The STB has not made its revenue
adequacy determination for the year 2007.
 

A railroad is “revenue adequate” under the applicable law
when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry’s composite
cost of capital.
 
This determination
is made pursuant to a statutory requirement.

Microwave
System -

The NS microwave system, consisting of approximately 7,400 radio
route miles, 426 core stations, 30 secondary stations, and 5 passive
repeater stations, provides communications between most operating
locations.
 
The microwave system is
used primarily for voice communications, VHF radio control circuits, data and
facsimile transmissions, traffic control operations, and AEI data
transmissions.

Traffic
Control -

Of the approximately 15,900 route miles owned by NS, about 11,000 miles are
signalized, including 8,000 miles of centralized traffic control (CTC) and 3,000 miles
of automatic block signals.
 

Of the 8,000 miles of CTC, approximately 3,000 miles are controlled
by data radio originating at 266 base station radio sites.

Computers -

A computer network
consisting of a centralized data center in Atlanta, Georgia, and various
distributed computers throughout the company connects the yards, terminals,
transportation offices, rolling stock repair points, sales offices, and other
key system locations.
 
Operating and
traffic data are processed and stored to provide customers with information on
their shipments throughout the system.
 

Computer systems provide current information on the location of every
train and each car on line, as well as related waybill and other train and car
movement data.
 
In addition, the
computer systems are utilized to assist management in the performance of a
variety of functions and services including payroll, car and revenue
accounting, billing, material management activities and controls, and special
studies.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS -

Compliance with federal,
state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
environment is a principal NS goal.
 

To date, such compliance has not affected materially NS’ capital
additions, earnings, liquidity, or competitive position.
 
See “Legal Proceedings,”
Part I, Item 3; “Personal Injury, Environmental, and Legal Liabilities”
in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations;” and Note 17 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.”

GOVERNMENT REGULATION -

In addition to
environmental, safety, securities, and other regulations generally applicable
to all businesses, NS’ railroads are subject to regulation by the
STB.
 
The STB has jurisdiction over
some rates, routes, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, and the extension
or abandonment of rail lines.
 
The
STB also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger, or acquisition of
control of and by rail common carriers.
 

The Federal Railroad Administration regulates certain track and
mechanical equipment standards.

The
relaxation of economic regulation of railroads, begun over two decades ago
under the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, includes exemptions of intermodal business
(trailer-on-flat-car, container-on-flat-car), rail boxcar traffic, lumber,
manufactured steel, automobiles, and certain bulk commodities such as sand, gravel,
pulpwood, and wood chips for paper manufacturing.
 
Transportation contracts on regulated shipments
effectively remove those shipments from regulation as well for the duration of
the contract.
 
About 86% of NS’
freight revenues come from either exempt traffic or traffic moving under
transportation contracts.

Efforts were made in 2008 to re-subject the rail
industry to increased federal economic regulation and such efforts are expected
to continue in 2009.
 
The Staggers
Rail Act of 1980, which substantially balanced such regulation, encouraged and
enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business, thereby
contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the
revitalization of the industry.
 

Accordingly, NS will continue to oppose efforts to reimpose increased
economic regulation.

COMPETITION –

There is continuing
strong competition among rail, water, and highway carriers.
 
Price is usually only one factor of
importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific
hauling company.
 
Inventory carrying
costs, service reliability, ease of handling, and the desire to avoid loss and
damage during transit are also important considerations, especially for
higher-valued finished goods, machinery, and consumer products.
 
Even for raw materials, semifinished
goods, and work-in-process, users are increasingly sensitive to transport
arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages.

NS’
primary rail competitor is the CSX system; both operate throughout much of the
same territory.
 
Other railroads
also operate in parts of the territory.
 

NS also competes with motor carriers, water carriers, and with shippers
who have the additional option of handling their own goods in private carriage.

Certain
marketing strategies among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers
enable carriers to compete more effectively in specific markets.

SECURITY OF OPERATIONS –

NS has taken significant steps to provide enhanced
security for the NS rail system.  In particular, NS has developed and
implemented a comprehensive security plan that is modeled on and was developed
in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the Association of American
Railroads (AAR) post September 11, 2001.  The AAR Security Plan defines
four Alert Levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being
applied across the railroad industry as the terrorist threat increases or decreases. 
The Alert Level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three
general areas: (1) operations (including transportation, engineering, and
mechanical); (2) information technology and communications; and (3) railroad
police.  Although security concerns preclude public disclosure of its
contents, the NS Departmental Security Plan outlines the protocol within NS for
all concerned to be notified of AAR Alert Level changes.  All NS
Operations Division employees are advised by their supervisors or train
dispatchers, as appropriate, of any change in Alert Level and any additional
responsibilities they may incur due to such change.

The NS plan also effectively
addresses and complies with Department of Transportation security regulations
pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of
hazardous materials.  As part of the plan, security awareness training is
given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material
transportation safety, and this training is integrated into recurring hazardous
material training and re-certification programs.  Toward that end, NS,
working closely with the National Transit Institute at Rutgers University, has developed
a four-module uniform national training program.
 
NS also has worked with the
Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in developing other industry training
programs.
 
More in-depth security
training has been given to those select NS employees who have been given
specific security responsibilities, and additional, location-specific security
plans have been developed for certain metropolitan areas and each of six port
facilities served by NS.  With respect to the ports, each facility plan
has been approved by the applicable Captain of the Port and subject to
inspection by the U.S. Coast Guard.

Additionally,
NS engages in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state
agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the TSA,
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Federal Railroad Administration
(FRA), the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and various
state Homeland Security offices.
 
As
one notable example, an NS Police Special Agent, under the auspices of the AAR,
has been assigned to the National Joint Terrorism Task Force (NJTTF) operating
out of FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C. to represent and serve as liaison
to the North American rail industry.
 

This arrangement improves logistical flow of vital security and law
enforcement information with respect to the rail industry as a whole, while
having the post filled by an NS Special Agent has served to foster a strong
working relationship between NS and the FBI.
 
NS also has become a member of the
Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program sponsored by U.S.
Customs.  C-TPAT allows NS to work closely with U.S. Customs and its
customers to develop measures that will help ensure the integrity of freight
shipments moving on NS, particularly those moving to or from a foreign country.
 
Based on participation in C-TPAT, NS has
ensured that its plan meets all current applicable security recommendations
made by U.S. Customs.

Similarly, NS is guided in
its operations by various supplemental security action items issued by DHS and
U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), U.S. Coast Guard Maritime Security
requirements, as well as voluntary security action items developed in 2006 in
collaboration with TSA, DOT, and the freight railroads.
 
Many of the action items are based on
lessons learned from DHS and DOT security assessments of rail corridors in High
Threat Urban Areas (HTUA) begun in 2004.
 

Particular attention is paid to: (1) the establishment of secure storage
areas for rail cars carrying toxic-by-inhalation (TIH) materials; (2) the
expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying TIH materials; (3)
the minimization of unattended loaded tank cars carrying TIH materials; and (4)
cooperation with federal, state, local and tribal governments to identify,
through risk assessments, those locations where security risks are the highest.
 
These action items and NS’
compliance initiatives are outlined in the various departmental sections of the
NS Departmental Security Plan.
 
NS
is also taking the appropriate actions to ensure compliance with the 2008 TSA
Final Rule addressing Rail Security Sensitive Materials, and the 2008
Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (
PHMSA)
rail-routing regulations outlined in Docket HM-232E.

In 2008, through
participation in the Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response
(TRANSCAER) Program, NS provided rail accident response training to
approximately 4,300 emergency responders, such as local police and fire
personnel, representing over 25,000 man-hours of emergency response training.
 
NS also conducted railroad operations
classes for FBI agents and the railroad liaison agents from Joint Terrorism
Task Forces.
 
NS’ other
training efforts throughout 2008 included participation in 15 drills including
2 major full-scale exercises with various local, state, and federal
agencies conducted in accordance with the DHS Exercise and Evaluation Program.
 
NS also has ongoing programs to sponsor
local emergency responders at tank car emergency response training programs
conducted at the AAR Transportation Technology Center in Pueblo, Colorado.
 
Also, the NS annual TRANSCAER
Whistle-Stop train makes stops in numerous cities, its special training cars
serving as a resource to an audience of nearly 1,000 emergency responders
annually.

Improvements in equipment
design also are expected to play a role in enhancing rail security.
 
The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials
Safety Administration (
PHMSA), in coordination with
the FRA, is amending the Hazardous Materials Regulations to prescribe enhanced
safety measures for rail transportation of TIH materials, including interim
design standards for railroad tank cars.
 

The rule mandates commodity-specific improvements in safety features and
design standards for newly manufactured DOT specification tank cars and an
improved top fittings performance standard.
 
The interim standards established in
this rule will enhance the accident survivability of TIH tank cars.

Item 1A.
 
Risk Factors

NS is subject
to significant governmental legislation and regulation over commercial,
environmental, and operating matters.

Railroads
are subject to the enactment of laws by Congress that could increase economic
regulation of the industry.
 
Railroads
presently are subject to commercial regulation by the STB, which has
jurisdiction over some routes, rates and fuel surcharges, conditions of service,
and the extension or abandonment of rail lines.
 
The STB also has jurisdiction over the
consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control of and by rail common
carriers.
 
Additional economic regulation of the rail
industry by Congress or the STB, whether under new or existing laws, could have
a significant negative impact on NS’ ability to determine prices for rail
services and result in a material adverse effect in the future on NS’ financial
position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.
 
This potential material adverse effect
could also result in reduced capital spending on NS’ rail network.

Railroads
are subject to safety and security regulation by the DOT and the DHS, which
regulate most aspects of NS’ operations.
 
Compliance with the Rail Safety
Improvement Act of 2008 will result in additional operating costs associated
with the statutory mandate to implement positive train control by 2015.
 
In addition, NS’ failure to comply
with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on
NS.

NS’ operations
are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and
regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air; discharges to
waterways or ground water supplies; handling, storage, transportation, and
disposal of waste and other materials; and the cleanup of hazardous material or
petroleum releases. The risk of incurring environmental liability – for
acts and omissions, past, present, and future – is inherent in the
railroad business.  Property owned by NS, whether currently or in the
past, is and has been subject to a variety of uses, including NS railroad
operations and other industrial activity by past owners or past and present
tenants of NS.
 
Environmental
problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, and NS
could incur environmental liabilities or costs, the amount and materiality of
which cannot be estimated reliably at this time, with respect to one or more of
these properties.  Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving other
unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to
time, and the resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on
financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or
quarter.

NS, as a common carrier by rail, must offer to
transport hazardous materials, regardless of risk.

Transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic
losses in terms of personal injury and property damage costs, and compromise
critical parts of our rail network.

NS
may be affected by terrorism or war.

Any terrorist
attack, or other similar event, any government response thereto, and war or risk
of war could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect
NS’ results of operations, financial position, and liquidity in a
particular year or quarter.
 
Because
NS plays a critical role in the nation’s transportation system, it could
become the target of such an attack or have a significant role in the
government’s preemptive approach or response to an attack or war.

Although NS
currently maintains insurance coverage for third-party liability arising out of
war and acts of terrorism, it maintains only limited insurance coverage for
first-party property damage and damage to property in NS’ care, custody,
or control caused by certain acts of terrorism.
 
In addition, premiums for some or all of
NS’ current insurance programs covering these losses could increase
dramatically, or insurance coverage for certain losses could be unavailable to
NS in the future.

NS may be
affected by general economic conditions.

Prolonged negative
changes in domestic and global economic conditions affecting the producers and
consumers of the commodities NS carries may have an adverse effect on its
operating results, financial position, and liquidity.
 
Economic conditions resulting in
bankruptcies of one or more large customers could have a significant impact on NS’
financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or
quarter.

NS may be affected by the impact of
environmental regulation on its utility coal customers and/or the value of
certain NS assets.

A number of evolving environmental issues could affect
the U.S. utility coal market, including potential regional programs aimed at
capping and reducing power plant CO


emissions and ongoing efforts
at addressing climate change.
 

Although certain utilities have begun adding or are planning to add
emissions control technologies to their electric generating units, allowing
them to utilize their existing coal-fired power plants, future regulatory
developments in this area could have a negative effect on NS’ utility
coal customers and/or the value of coal reserves owned by NS and thus an
adverse effect on NS’ operating results, financial position, and
liquidity.

NS
faces competition from other transportation providers.

NS is subject to competition from motor carriers, railroads, and
to a lesser extent, ships, barges, and pipelines, on the basis of transit time,
pricing, and the quality and reliability of service.
 
While NS has used primarily internal
resources to build or acquire and maintain its rail system, trucks and barges
have been able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities. Any
future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or
reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in
which NS operates, or legislation granting materially greater latitude for
motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations, could have a
material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or liquidity
in a particular year or quarter.

The operations of carriers with which NS
interchanges may adversely affect its operations.

NS’ ability to provide rail service to customers in the U.S.
and Canada depends in large part upon its ability to maintain cooperative
relationships with connecting carriers with respect to, among other matters,
freight rates, revenue divisions, car supply and locomotive availability, data
exchange and communications, reciprocal switching, interchange, and trackage
rights.
 
Deterioration in the
operations of, or service provided by connecting carriers, or in our
relationship with those connecting carriers,
could result in NS’ inability to meet its customers’
demands or require NS to use alternate train routes, which could result in
significant additional costs and network inefficiencies.

NS
relies on technology and technology improvements in its business operations.

If NS experiences significant disruption or failure of one or more
of its information technology systems, including computer hardware, software,
and communications equipment, NS could experience a service interruption,
security breach, or other operational difficulties, which could have a material
adverse impact on its results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity
in a particular year or quarter.
 

Additionally, if NS does not have sufficient capital to acquire new
technology or if it is unable to implement new technology, NS may suffer a
competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing
other modes of transportation service, which could have a material adverse
effect on its financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a
particular year or quarter.

The vast
majority of NS employees belong to labor unions, and labor agreements, strikes,
or work stoppages could adversely affect its operations.

A
pproximately 26,000, or
about 85%, of NS railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining
agreements with various labor unions. 
If
unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown,
NS could experience a significant disruption of its operations.
 
Additionally, future national labor
agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor
agreements, could significantly increase NS’ costs for healthcare, wages,
and other benefits.
 
Any of these
factors could have a material adverse impact on NS’ financial position, results
of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

NS may be
subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant
expenditures.

The nature of NS’ business exposes it
to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and
employment, personal injury, commercial disputes, freight loss and other
property damage, and other matters.
 
Job-related

personal injury and occupational
claims are subject to the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA), which
is applicable only to railroads.  FELA’s fault-based tort system
produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a
no-fault worker’s compensation system.
 
The variability inherent in this system
could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded.

Any material
changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving
any or all of freight loss or property damage, personal injury, and
environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on NS’
operating results, financial condition, and liquidity to the extent not covered
by insurance.
 
NS has obtained
insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and first-party
property damages.
 
Specified levels
of risk are retained on a self-insurance basis (currently up to $25 million and
above $1 billion per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage to
third parties and $25 million and above $175 million per occurrence for
property owned by NS or in its care, custody, or control).
 
Insurance is available from a limited
number of insurers and may not continue to be available or, if available, may
not be obtainable on terms acceptable to NS.

Severe weather could result in significant
business interruptions and expenditures.

Severe weather
conditions and other natural phenomena, including hurricanes, floods, fires,
and earthquakes, may cause significant business interruptions and result in
increased costs, increased liabilities, and decreased revenues, which could
have an adverse effect on NS’ financial position, results of operations,
or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

Unpredictability
of demand for rail services resulting in the unavailability of qualified
personnel could adversely affect NS’ operational efficiency and ability
to meet demand.

Workforce demographics, training
requirements, and the availability of qualified personnel, particularly
engineers and trainmen, could each have a negative impact on NS’ ability
to meet demand for rail service. Unpredictable increases in demand for rail
services may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on NS’
operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on its financial
position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

NS may be affected by supply constraints
resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of some of its
supplier markets.

NS

consumes about 500 million gallons of diesel fuel each year.
 
Fuel availability could be affected by
any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation
or rationing regulations.
 
If a
severe fuel supply shortage arose from production curtailments, increased
demand in existing or emerging foreign markets, disruption of oil imports,
disruption of domestic refinery production, damage to refinery or pipeline
infrastructure, political unrest, war or other factors, NS’ financial position,
results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter could be materially
adversely affected.
 
Also, such an
event would impact NS as well as its customers and other transportation
companies.

Due to the capital intensive nature and industry-specific requirements
of the rail industry, there are high barriers of entry for potential new
suppliers of core railroad items, such as locomotives and rolling stock
equipment.
 
Additionally, NS competes
with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the
production of certain track materials, such as rail and ties.
 
Changes in the competitive landscapes of
these limited-supplier markets could result in increased prices or material
shortages that could materially affect NS’ financial position, results of
operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

The state of capital markets could adversely affect NS’ liquidity.

NS
 from
time-to-time relies on the capital markets to provide some of its capital
requirements, including the issuance of long-term debt instruments and
commercial paper, as well as the sale of certain receivables.
 
Significant instability or disruptions
of the capital markets, including the credit markets, or deterioration of NS’
financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or eliminate
NS’ access to, and/or significantly increase the cost of, various
financing sources, including bank credit facilities and issuance of corporate
bonds.
 
Instability or disruptions
of the capital markets and deterioration of NS’ financial condition, alone
or in combination, could also result in a reduction in NS’ credit rating
to below investment grade, which could prohibit or restrict NS from accessing
external sources of short- and long-term debt financing and/or significantly
increase the associated costs.

Legal Proceedings

The Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency has notified Norfolk Southern that it intends to seek
penalties and require Norfolk Southern to take remedial actions in connection
with alleged violations of the Clean Air and Water Acts stemming from the
operation of our coal dock in Ashtabula, Ohio.  The Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection has submitted to NS a proposed Consent
Assessment of Civil Penalty with respect to several alleged environmental
releases from September 2007 to the present.
 
Although NS will contest liability and
the imposition of any penalties, because these governmental proceedings with
respect to environmental laws and regulations involve potential fines,
penalties or other monetary sanctions in excess of $100,000, we describe them
here consistent with SEC rules and requirements.
 
NS does not believe that the outcome of
these proceedings will have a material effect on its financial position,
results of operations, or liquidity.

On November 6, 2007, various
antitrust class actions filed against NS and other Class 1 railroads in various
Federal district courts regarding fuel surcharges were consolidated in the
District of Columbia by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. 
NS believes the allegations in the complaints are without merit and intends to
vigorously defend the cases.  NS does not believe that the outcome of
these proceedings will have a material effect on its financial position,
results of operations, or liquidity.
 

A lawsuit containing similar allegations against NS and four other major
railroads that was filed on March 25, 2008, in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Minnesota was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff subject to a
tolling agreement entered into in August 2008.

On April 24, 2008, the United
States Department of Justice (DOJ) brought an action against NS for
alleged violations of federal environmental laws resulting from the discharge
of chlorine and oil that occurred as a result of the January 6, 2005
derailment in Graniteville, SC, including claims for civil penalties as well as
injunctive relief.  On June 24, 2008, NS filed a motion to dismiss DOJ’s
claims, contending that insufficient facts have been alleged to support such
claims.  NS does not believe that the resolution of these claims will have
a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or
liquidity.

to 75 million, and shortened the repurchase term by five years to December 31,
2010.

Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Norfolk Southern Corporation
and Subsidiaries

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

The
following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the
Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and the Selected Financial Data.

OVERVIEW

NS’ 2008 net income rose 17% largely on the
strength of a 19% increase in income from railway operations.
 
Operating results reflected higher
average revenue per unit (including fuel surcharge revenue) that more than
offset the effects of increased operating expenses and lower traffic volume.
 
Operating revenues increased 13% and
operating expenses rose 11% compared to 2007, resulting in a lower operating
ratio (a measure of the amount of revenues consumed by expenses) of 71.1%, as compared
with 72.6% in 2007.

Cash provided by operating activities was
$2.7 billion, exceeding $2 billion for the fourth consecutive year.
 
Coupled with net borrowings of $280 million,
this provided funding for increased capital expenditures, share repurchases, and
higher dividends.

During 2008, NS purchased and retired 19.4 million
shares of NS common stock at a total cost of $1.1 billion under the share
repurchase program which the Board of Directors approved in November 2005 and
subsequently amended in March 2007 to authorize the repurchase of up to
75 million shares of NS common stock through December 31, 2010.
 
In total, NS has purchased and retired 64.7 million
shares under this program at a cost of $3.3 billion.

Looking ahead, NS expects revenues to decline in
2009, reflecting lower traffic volume due to the weak economy and decreased
fuel surcharge revenue resulting from lower fuel prices.
 
NS plans to continue to improve service,
maintain a market-based approach to pricing, and reduce volume-related costs.

SUMMARIZED
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2008 Compared with 2007

Net income in 2008 was $1.7
billion, up $252 million, or 17%, compared with 2007.
 
Diluted earnings per share were $4.52,
up 84¢, or 23%.
 
The greater
percentage increase in per share earnings was due to fewer shares outstanding
as a result of NS’ share repurchase program (see Note 13).
 
The increase in net income was primarily
due to higher income from railway operations that was offset in part by higher
income taxes (see Note 3).
 
Railway
operating revenues increased $1.2 billion, as higher average revenue per unit (including
fuel surcharges) outweighed lower traffic volumes.
 
Railway operating expenses increased $730
million, principally due to higher fuel costs and increased compensation and
benefits expenses.

Oil prices affect NS’
results of operations in a variety of ways and can have an overall favorable or
unfavorable impact in any particular quarter or year.
 
In addition to the impact of oil prices
on general economic conditions and traffic volume, oil prices directly affect
NS’ revenues through market-based fuel surcharges and contract escalators
(see “Railway Operating Revenues”) and also affect fuel costs (see “Railway
Operating Expenses”).
 
For 2008,
oil prices had an overall favorable impact on income from railway
operations.
 
Future changes in oil
prices may cause volatility in operating results that could be material to a
particular quarter or year.

2007 Compared with 2006

Net income in 2007 was $1.5
billion, down $17 million, or 1%, compared with 2006.
 
Diluted earnings per share were $3.68,
up 11¢, or 3%, reflecting fewer shares outstanding as a result of NS’
share repurchase program (see Note 13).
 
The decrease in net income was primarily
due to higher income taxes and lower non‑operating items that offset higher
income from railway operations.
 

Railway operating revenues increased $25 million, as higher average
revenue per unit overshadowed lower traffic volumes.
 
Railway operating expenses decreased $3
million, principally due to lower volume-related expenses that offset higher
fuel expense.

Revenues
increased $1.2 billion in 2008 and $25 million in 2007.
 
As shown in the table below, both
revenue improvements were the result of increased average revenue per unit,
including fuel surcharge revenue, which more than offset decreased traffic
volumes.
 
Fuel surcharge revenue
amounted to $1.6 billion in 2008 (up $830 million) compared to
$792 million in 2007 and $1 billion in 2006.
 
If fuel prices remain at or near
year-end 2008 levels, fuel surcharge revenues in 2009 will be substantially
lower, with a corresponding effect on revenue per unit.

Many
of Norfolk Southern’s negotiated fuel surcharges for coal and general
merchandise traffic are based on the monthly average price of West Texas
Intermediate Crude Oil (WTI Average Price).
 
These surcharges are reset the first day
of each calendar month based on the WTI Average Price for the second preceding
calendar month.
 
This two-month lag
in computing WTI Average Price coupled with the sharp drop in fuel prices late
in the year increased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately $100 million
for the year.

Both comparisons reflect
large increases in average revenue per unit, a result of higher rates and increased
fuel surcharges.
 
Traffic volumes in
both years declined.
 
For 2008, traffic
volumes for all commodity groups except coal and agriculture/consumer
products/government decreased.
 
In
2007, traffic volumes for all commodity groups except agriculture/consumer
products/government and chemicals decreased.

On January 26, 2007, the Surface
Transportation Board (STB) issued a decision that the type of fuel surcharge
imposed by NS and most other large railroads – a fuel surcharge based on
a percentage of line haul revenue – would no longer be permitted for
regulated traffic that moves under public (tariff) rates.
 
The STB gave the railroads a 90‑day
transition period to adjust their fuel surcharge programs.
 
During the second quarter of 2007, NS discontinued
assessing fuel surcharges on its published (non-intermodal) public rates.
 
Adjustments to public prices now reflect
ongoing market conditions.
 
The
traffic moving under these tariffs and public quotes comprises about 10% of
Norfolk Southern’s total revenue base.

COAL

revenues increased $796
million, or 34%, compared with 2007, reflecting higher rates, including fuel
surcharges, and a 4% increase in traffic volume.
 
Coal average revenue per unit was up 29%
compared with 2007, reflecting higher rates (which were comprised of pricing
increases, contract escalators and the effect of increased longer-haul export
coal traffic) and increased fuel surcharges.
 
For 2009, average revenue per unit is
expected to decline reflecting the effects of lower fuel surcharges and
contract escalators.

Coal
represented 29% of NS’ revenues in 2008 and 79% of shipments handled
originated on NS’ lines.
 
As
shown in the following table, increased shipments of export, utility, and domestic
metallurgical coal more than offset lower industrial shipments.

Coal r
evenues in 2007 decreased $15 million, or 1%,
compared with 2006, as a 2% reduction in tonnage handled more than offset a 3%
increase in average revenue per unit.
 

Carloads declined 3%, a higher percentage than the change in tonnage
handled because of increased average tonnage per car.
 
Coal represented 25% of NS’
revenues in 2007, and 78% of shipments handled originated on NS’ lines.

NS is currently involved in
litigation with Virginia Electric and Power Company/Old Dominion Electric
Cooperative (Virginia Power) regarding rate adjustment provisions in a
transportation contract between them.
 

In 2007, the Virginia Supreme Court issued a decision that remanded the
case to the trial court on the grounds that neither of its prior decisions
constituted a final order.  In April 2008, the trial court entered a final
order granting NS monetary damages, including interest, and prescribing the
methodology for determining future rates.
 

Virginia Power filed a notice of appeal and the Virginia Supreme Court
has agreed to hear the appeal.  Future developments and the ultimate
resolution of this matter could result in NS recognizing additional
revenues related to this dispute, which could have a favorable impact on
results of operations in a particular year or quarter.

Utility
coal

tonnage increased 1%, compared with 2007, a result of modest stockpile growth
in the Northeast.

In
2007, utility coal tonnage decreased 4% compared with 2006, reflecting high stockpile
levels (particularly in the Southeast) that led to reduced shipments, despite
fairly strong electric generation (up 4%) in the NS service region.
 
In addition, the temporary closure of a
major coal mine as well as the loss of business to barge transportation
contributed to the decline.

For
2009, utility coal tonnage is expected to weaken, with lower electric demand as
a result of a weak economy.

Export coal

tonnage increased 48%
compared to 2007, reflecting increased global demand coupled with
weather-related supply constraints in Australia, reduced export volume from
China, and the weak U.S. dollar.
 

Norfolk volume increased about 51,000 carloads, or 39%, and Baltimore
volume was up about 28,000 carloads, or 102%.

Export
coal tonnage in 2007 increased 25% compared to 2006, primarily due to increased
demand reflecting a lower valued U.S. dollar as well as loading delays at
Australian ports.
 
Norfolk volume
increased by approximately 26,000 cars, or 25%, and Baltimore volume was up
approximately 4,500 cars, or 19%.

For
2009, export coal tonnage is expected to decrease, reflecting a significant
reduction in worldwide steel production, increasing competition into Europe due
to changes in ocean freight rates, and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar
against other currencies.

Domestic
metallurgical

coal, coke, and iron ore tonnage increased 2% compared with 2007, reflecting the
start up of a new coke plant.

In
2007, domestic metallurgical coal, coke, and iron ore tonnage decreased 14%
compared with 2006.
 
The decrease
was primarily due to coke furnace outages, mine production outages, and reduced
spot iron ore traffic.

For
2009, domestic metallurgical coal, coke, and iron ore tonnage is expected to be
down due to lower domestic steel demand.

Other
coal

tonnage (principally steam coal shipped to industrial plants) decreased 13% in
2008 compared to 2007 principally due to coal supply constraints.
 
In 2007, other coal tonnage increased 6%
versus 2006, primarily due to new business and stronger demand.

For
2009, other coal tonnage is expected to be flat compared to 2008.

GENERAL
MERCHANDISE

revenues in 2008 increased $296 million, or 6%, compared with 2007, as a 15%
increase in average revenue per unit, reflecting continued market-based pricing
and higher fuel surcharges, more than offset an 8% decline in traffic volume.

In
2007, general merchandise revenues increased $90 million, or 2%, compared with
2006, as a 6% increase in average revenue per unit, more than offset a 4% decline
in traffic volume.
 
Revenue in 2007
included $26 million related to a volume-related contract settlement with
an automotive customer.

Agriculture,
consumer products, and government

revenue increased 22% in 2008 compared with
2007.
 
The revenue improvement
resulted from higher average revenue per unit, which reflected increased rates
and higher fuel surcharge revenues.
 

Traffic volume increased 2% as more ethanol, military, feed, soybeans,
and food oils shipments offset declines in fertilizers, corn, beverages, and
consumer products.

Agriculture,
consumer products, and government revenue increased 5% in 2007 compared with
2006.
 
The revenue improvement
resulted from higher average revenue per unit, which reflected higher
rates.
 
Traffic volume rose modestly
as more corn, fertilizer, and ethanol shipments were mitigated by less
government and consumer product volume.

For 2009, agriculture revenue is expected to post
modest growth, benefiting from increasing demand for biofuel products including
ethanol, biodiesel, and feed ingredients from their production, and slightly
higher average revenue per unit (including fuel surcharges).
 
However, lower volumes in corn, soybeans,
and fertilizer shipments due to softer demand along with declines in consumer
products markets are expected to partially offset this growth.

Metals and construction

revenue increased 9% in
2008 as a 15% increase in average revenue per unit that resulted from increased
rates and higher fuel surcharge more than offset the effects of a 5% decrease
in traffic volume.
 
The decline in
volume was due to reduced demand for construction materials and lower coil,
iron, and steel shipments, reflecting the weak housing and automotive sectors.

Metals and construction revenue decreased 2% in 2007
as a 5% increase in average revenue per unit that resulted from higher rates was
more than offset by the effects of a 6% decrease in traffic volume.
 
The decline in volume was principally
due to lower iron, steel, and coil shipments and reduced demand for
construction materials, both reflecting the soft automotive and housing sectors.

For 2009, metals and construction revenues are
expected to decline as a result of decreased traffic volumes due to lower steel
production in North America coupled with continued weakness in the housing and
automotive sectors and lower average revenue per unit (including fuel
surcharges).

Chemicals

revenue in 2008 increased 6%, compared with 2007, a
result of increased rates and higher fuel surcharge revenue.
 
Traffic volume declined 8%, reflecting
continued weakness in both industrial intermediates and plastics (linked to
housing construction declines) in addition to miscellaneous chemicals and
petroleum-based products.

In 2007, chemicals revenue increased 8% compared
with 2006, reflecting higher rates in all groups.
 
Traffic volume rose modestly as more
shipments of industrial intermediates offset fewer shipments in the petroleum,
miscellaneous chemicals, and plastics markets, which continued to reflect
weakness in housing-related demand.

For 2009, chemicals revenue is expected to decline
as a result of reduced volumes, reflecting a weak economic outlook with fewer
housing starts and construction-related weaknesses, and lower average revenue
per unit (including fuel surcharges).

Paper, clay, and forest products

revenue increased 4% in
2008 compared with 2007 due to a 13% increase in average revenue per unit which
more than offset an 8% decrease in traffic volume.
 
The volume decline reflected the
continued housing slowdown and increased trucking capacity available to paper
customers.

Paper, clay, and forest products revenue decreased
3% in 2007 compared with 2006 as the effects of higher average revenue per unit
were more than offset by an 8% decrease in traffic volume reflecting the
housing slowdown and decline in conventional paper markets.

For 2009, paper, clay, and forest products revenues
are expected to decline due to economy-related volume declines, including the
effects of increased trucking capacity, and lower average revenue per unit
(including fuel surcharges).

Automotive

revenues
decreased 16% in 2008 compared to 2007 as lower traffic volumes offset higher
average revenue per unit.
 
Volumes
decreased 23%, reflecting reduced North American sales and production.
 
Automotive manufacturers, especially the
domestic producers, continued to experience significant sales declines during
the year.  Three assembly plants closed during the year and six
implemented shift reductions.
 
In
addition, one manufacturer temporarily closed an assembly plant to retool for a
new product in 2010.
 
As of year
end, Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler combined operated 14 of 24 assembly
plants served by NS.
 
NS continues
to monitor the state of the automotive industry and the collectability of the
associated receivables.

Automotive revenues were flat in 2007 compared with
2006 as lower traffic volumes offset higher average revenue per unit.
 
Revenue in 2007 included a
$26 million volume-related contract settlement.
 
Volume decreased 5%, reflecting softness
in demand for vehicles as well as parts, and the closure in June 2007 of an NS-served
plant.

For 2009, automotive revenues are expected to decrease
reflecting continued production cutbacks and lower average revenue per unit
(including fuel surcharges).

INTERMODAL

revenues increased $137 million, or 7%, compared
with 2007, as a 10% increase in average revenue per unit (including fuel
surcharges) offset a 3% reduction in traffic volumes.
 
Domestic volume (which includes
truckload and intermodal marketing companies’ [IMC] volumes) increased 8%
compared with 2007, reflecting the relative fuel efficiency of intermodal
versus over-the-road transportation and service improvements.
 
International traffic volume declined 9%,
primarily driven by the weak economy and less inland rail movement of West
Coast port traffic that was partially offset by East Coast port volume
growth.
 
The Premium business, which
includes parcel and less-than-truckload (LTL) carriers, decreased 6%, as
reduced private empty movements and soft parcel business offset LTL
conversions.
 
Triple Crown Services
Company (Triple Crown), a service with rail-to-highway trailers, experienced a 3%
drop in volume primarily driven by reduced auto parts shipments.

Intermodal revenues in 2007 decreased
$50 million, or 3%, compared with 2006, as a 4% reduction in traffic volumes offset
a 2% increase in average revenue per unit.
 

Truckload volume decreased 10%
compared with 2006 and domestic IMC volume declined 4%.
 
Traffic volume for Triple Crown dropped 3%.
 
The declines for truckload, IMC, and
Triple Crown were primarily due to lower national demand for dry van shipments
resulting from continued weakness in the housing and automotive markets and
increased over-the-road competition.
 

International traffic volume decreased 4% reflecting reduced shipments
of empty containers and less inland rail transportation of West Coast port
traffic, which offset volume growth from East Coast port traffic.
 
Premium business was up 2% reflecting
gains in parcel shipments that offset modest declines in LTL shipper traffic.

For 2009, intermodal revenue
is expected to decrease from 2008 primarily due to weak economic conditions, pressures
from the drayage market and lower average revenue per unit (including fuel
surcharges).

Railway
Operating Expenses

Railway
operating expenses in 2008 were $7.6 billion, up $730 million, or 11%,
compared to 2007.
 
Expenses in 2007
were about even with expenses in 2006.
 

The increase in 2008 was primarily due to higher fuel costs and
increased compensation and benefits expenses.
 
The 2007 comparison reflected
volume-related decreases offset by higher fuel expense.

The
railway operating ratio, which measures the percentage of operating revenues
consumed by operating expenses, improved to 71.1% in 2008, compared with 72.6%
in 2007 and 72.8% in 2006.

The following table shows the changes in railway
operating expenses summarized by major classifications.

Compensation
and benefits

,
which represents 35% of total railway operating expenses, increased $132 million,
or 5%, compared with 2007, primarily due to higher incentive compensation (up $66 million);
increased wage rates (up $54 million); costs associated with lump-sum
payments due under a new Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET)
agreement ($31 million); higher payroll taxes (up $15 million); and, the
absence of the 2007 employment tax refund ($9 million).
 
These were partially offset by lower
costs associated with trainees (down $19 million), lower health and
welfare benefits resulting from higher employee contributions (down $19 million),
and lower stock-based compensation (down $7 million).
 
In 2008, compensation and benefits
expense benefited from a net pension credit of $39 million; however, primarily
due to the market decline in pension assets (see Note 10), NS does not expect a
similar benefit in 2009.

In
2007, compensation and benefits decreased $85 million, or 3%, compared
with 2006, primarily due to lower incentive compensation (down $48 million),
lower volume-related payroll (down $37 million), the absence of the prior year
retirement and waiver agreements with former executives as well as the cost of
the regular stock-based grant to the former Chief Executive Officer ($24
million), lower stock-based compensation (down $13 million), and lower payroll
taxes (down $12 million).
 

These were partially offset by increased wage rates (up $27 million)
and higher medical costs (up $27 million).

NS
employment averaged 30,709 in 2008 compared with 30,806 in 2007 and 30,541 in
2006.
 
The increase in 2007 in the
number of employees was almost exclusively in operating department personnel to
improve service needs, as well as to prepare for expected retirements.
 
NS continues to monitor forecasted
volumes in light of current economic conditions to ensure appropriate employment
levels for service needs.

Purchased
services and rents

includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors,
including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other
railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals.
 
This category of expenses increased $48 million,
or 3%, in 2008 compared to 2007, but decreased $27 million, or 2%, in 2007
compared to 2006.

Purchased
services costs were $1,242 million in 2008, $1,172 million in 2007 and
$1,165 million in 2006.
 
The
increase in 2008 reflected higher intermodal operations costs, transportation
operating costs, and professional and legal services.
 
In 2007, higher expenses for maintenance
activities were largely offset by volume-related declines.

Equipment
rents, which includes the cost to NS of using equipment (mostly freight cars)
owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to NS for the use
of its equipment, amounted to $357 million, $379 million and $413 million
for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
 

The decreases in 2008 and 2007 were principally due to lower shipment
volumes and improved fleet utilization.

Fuel

expense, which includes the cost of locomotive fuel
as well as other fuel used in railway operations, increased $469 million,
or 40%, in 2008 compared with 2007, and increased $74 million, or 7%, in
2007 compared with 2006.
 
Fuel
expense is recorded net of hedge benefits, although there have been no such
benefits since May 2006 when the program wound down (see “Market Risks
and Hedging Activities,” below and Note 16).
 
The increase in 2008 reflected a 45%
increase in the price per gallon of locomotive fuel offset in part by a 3%
decline in consumption.
 
The
increase in 2007 reflected a 9% increase in the price per gallon of locomotive
fuel as well as the absence of hedge benefits offset in part by a 4% decline in
consumption.

Legislation enacted in the first quarter of 2005
repealed the 4.3¢ per gallon excise tax on railroad diesel fuel for 2007,
with the following phased reductions in 2005 and 2006: 1¢ per gallon from January
1, 2005 through June 30, 2005; 2¢ per gallon from July 1, 2005
through December 31, 2006; and by the full 4.3¢ thereafter.
 
NS consumes about 500 million gallons of
locomotive diesel fuel per year.

Depreciation

expense increased $29 million, or 4%, in 2008
compared to 2007, and $37 million, or 5%, in 2007 compared to 2006.
 
In both years, substantial capital
investments and improvements resulted in higher depreciation expense.

Materials and other

expenses (including the estimates
of costs related to personal injury, property damage, and environmental
matters) increased $52 million, or 7%, in 2008 compared with 2007, but decreased
$2 million in 2007 compared with 2006, as shown in the following table.

The increase in 2008 was primarily due to costs associated
with the Avondale Mills settlement related to the Graniteville accident (see
below), as well as higher loss and damage claims and increased material costs for
equipment and roadway repairs.
 

These increases were partially offset by favorable personal injury
claims development.

In April 2008, NS settled the
lawsuit brought by Avondale Mills for claims associated with the January 6,
2005, derailment in Graniteville, SC.  A portion of the settlement will
not be reimbursed by insurance and was included in 2008 expenses.  The
total liability related to the derailment represents NS’ best estimate
based on current facts and circumstances.
 
The estimate includes amounts related to
business property damage and other economic losses, personal injury and
individual property damage claims, as well as third-party response costs.
 
NS’ commercial insurance policies
are expected to cover substantially all expenses related to this derailment
above the unreimbursed portion and NS’ self-insured retention, including
NS’ response costs and legal fees.  The Consolidated Balance Sheets
reflect current and long-term receivables for estimated recoveries from NS’
insurance carriers.
 
NS is engaged
in arbitration with one of its insurance carriers that failed to respond to an insurance
claim submitted by NS.  NS believes these expenses are covered by the
insurance policy and that recovery of the contested amount is probable, in that
NS expects the arbitrator will determine the settlement amounts to be
reasonable and that the insurer’s refusal to consent to and to fund the
settlement was a breach of contract.
 

Accordingly, NS has recorded the full recovery attributable to such
carrier ($100 million).
 
In
October 2008, another of NS’ insurance carriers provided the preliminary
findings of its review of NS’ reimbursement request and reported that it
may dispute a portion of that request.
 

NS has initiated arbitration against the carrier and believes that all
expenses contained in the reimbursement request are covered by the insurance
policy and that recovery is probable.

The decline in materials and other expense in 2007
was primarily due to lower derailment and personal injury costs, offset in part
by higher property and other taxes, and increased materials costs for maintenance
activities.

The largest component of casualties and other claims
expense is personal injury costs.
 

Cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 52% of total
employee injury cases resolved and about 29% of total payments made.
 
With its long-established commitment to
safety, NS continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to
reduce the associated costs.
 
With
respect to occupational injuries, which are not caused by a specific accident
or event but allegedly result from a claimed exposure over time, the benefits
of any existing safety initiatives may not be realized immediately.
 
These types of claims are being asserted
by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been actively employed in
the rail industry for decades.
 
The
rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job-related
accidental injury and occupational claims because of the Federal Employers’
Liability Act (FELA), which is applicable only to railroads.
 
FELA’s fault-based system, which covers
employee claims for job-related injuries, produces results that are
unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault workers’
compensation system.

NS maintains substantial amounts of insurance for
potential third-party liability and property damage claims.
 
It also retains reasonable levels of
risk through self-insurance (see Note 17).
 

NS expects insurance costs to be slightly higher in 2009.

Other Income – Net

Other income – net
 was $110 million in
2008, $93 million in 2007, and $149 million in 2006 (see Note 2).
 
The increase in 2008 reflected the
absence of expenses related to synthetic fuel investments (see “Income
Taxes” below), reduced other interest expense ($27 million) largely
due to adjustments to reflect the outcome of certain tax examinations and
higher coal royalties (up $12 million).
 
These benefits were offset in part by
lower returns and higher borrowing costs on corporate-owned life insurance
(down $38 million), lower interest income (down $25 million), fewer
gains on sales of property and investments (down $22 million), and lower
equity in the earnings of Conrail (down $16 million), which reflects the
absence of a tax audit settlement recorded by Conrail in 2007
($18 million).

The decrease in 2007 reflected lower interest income
($31 million), higher expenses associated with synthetic fuel-related tax
credit investments ($15 million), and lower returns from corporate-owned
life insurance ($15 million) that combined to offset higher equity in earnings
of Conrail ($20 million).

NS
has membership interests representing ownership in companies that owned and
operated facilities that produced synthetic fuel from coal.
 
In addition, NS purchased two facilities
that produced synthetic fuel from coal in 2007.
 
The production of synthetic fuel resulted
in tax credits as well as expenses related to the investments.
 
The expenses are recorded as a component
of “Other income – net,” and the tax credits, as well as tax
benefits related to the expenses, are reflected in “Provision for income
taxes” (see further discussion below).

Income
Taxes

Income
tax expense in 2008 was $1 billion, for an effective rate of 38%, compared with
effective rates of 35% in 2007 and 34% in 2006.
 
The increase in the rate for 2008 was
primarily due to the absence of synthetic fuel-related tax credits that expired
at the end of 2007.
 
The increase in
the rate for 2007 largely resulted from Illinois tax legislation which
increased deferred taxes by $19 million (see Note 3).

The
tax credits generated by NS’ synthetic fuel-related investments reduced
the effective tax rate by 3% in 2007 and 2006.
 
Net income in 2007 reflected
$5 million less in net benefits from these credits, as compared with the
same period of 2006, as shown below:

During
2008, NS resolved both the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination of its 2004
and 2005 consolidated federal income tax returns and its appeal of the 2002 and
2003 IRS examination without a material effect in income tax expense.
 
NS’ consolidated federal income
tax returns for 2006 and 2007 are being audited by the IRS.

FINANCIAL
CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash
provided by operating activities,

NS’ principal source of liquidity, was $2.7 billion in 2008
compared with $2.3 billion in 2007 and $2.2 billion in 2006.
 
The improvement in 2008 resulted from increased
railway operating income and from bonus tax depreciation which reduced current
tax payments.
 
The improvement in
2007 resulted from favorable changes in working capital as well as a modest
increase in income from railway operations.
 
NS had working capital deficits of $106 million
at December 31, 2008, and $273 million at December 31, 2007.
 
The improvement was largely the result
of increased cash and cash equivalents.
 

NS expects that cash on hand combined with cash flow provided by
operating activities will be sufficient to meet its ongoing obligations.
 
NS’ cash and cash equivalents balances
totaled $618 million and $206 million at
December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

Contractual obligations

at December 31, 2008, comprised
of NS’ long-term debt (including capital leases) (see Note 7),
operating leases (see Note 8), agreements with CRC (see Note 4), unrecognized
tax benefits (see Note 3), long-term advances from Conrail (see Note 4), and
unconditional purchase obligations (see Note 17), were as follows:

Cash used in investing activities

was $1.2 billion in
2008, compared with $1 billion in 2007 and $684 million in 2006.
 
The increase in 2008 primarily reflected
increased property additions.
 
The increase
in 2007 primarily reflected lower net proceeds from short-term investment activities
and increased property additions.

Property
additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category.

For 2009, NS has budgeted
$1.41 billion for capital expenditures.
 
The anticipated spending includes $698 million
for roadway projects, including the normalized replacement of rail, ties and
ballast and the improvement or replacement of bridges.
 
Planned equipment spending of
$124 million provides for the acquisition of over 500 super jumbo covered
hoppers and continued spending on improvements to the locomotive fleet,
including the rebuild and upgrade of existing units.
 
Planned investments in facilities and
terminals total $141 million, primarily for intermodal terminals and
equipment to add capacity to the intermodal network and bulk transfer
facilities to support the ethanol market.
 

Infrastructure investments of $170 million are planned for network
improvements to increase mainline capacity as well as various public/private partnership
investments such as the Heartland Corridor and the Chicago CREATE project.
 
Norfolk Southern also expects to spend
$67 million related to computers, systems and information technology.
 
All capital expenditures are expected to
be made with internally generated funds.

The Heartland Corridor is a package of proposed
clearance improvements and other facilities that will create a seamless
high-capacity intermodal route across Virginia and West Virginia to Midwest
markets.
 
During 2006, NS and the
states of Ohio, West Virginia and Virginia each entered into a Memorandum of
Agreement with the Federal Highway Administration with respect to the tunnel
clearance component of the Heartland Corridor that governs the release of up to
$95 million in authorized federal funding.
 
In 2006, NS also entered into agreements
with two states governing the use of up to $11 million in state funding
for the Heartland Corridor rail double-stack clearance project.
 
NS began work on the Heartland Corridor
tunnel clearances in October 2007 and the entire project is expected to be
completed in 2010.
 
NS expects to
spend about $100 million over 2009 and 2010 in connection with this project.

The Chicago Region
Environmental and Transportation Efficiency (CREATE) project is a
public-private partnership to reduce rail and highway congestion and add
freight and passenger capacity in the metropolitan Chicago area.
 
NS and other railroads have agreed to
participate in CREATE.
 
A portion of
the public funding has been approved and the parties have developed a list of
projects to be included in Phase I of the project.
 
A total of $100 million in public
funding has been secured for Phase I and the railroads have contributed an
additional $100 million.
 
The
railroads expect to complete Phase I by the end of 2010.
 
As currently planned, the total project
is estimated to cost $1.5 billion with city, state and federal
support.
 
If additional public
funding is secured, the railroads are expected to contribute a total of
$232 million towards the entire project.
 
NS expects to spend approximately
$15 million in 2009 related to CREATE projects.

The Meridian Speedway is a 320 mile rail line
between Meridian, Mississippi and Shreveport, Louisiana.
 
On May 1, 2006, NS and Kansas City
Southern (KCS) formed a joint venture, Meridian Speedway LLC (MSLLC), pursuant
to which NS would contribute $300 million in cash, substantially all of
which will be used for capital improvements over a period of approximately
three years, in exchange for a 30% interest in the joint venture.
 
To date, NS has contributed $274 million.
 
At the formation of MSLLC, KCS
contributed the Meridian Speedway.
 

NS is recognizing its pro rata share of the joint venture’s
earnings or loss as required under the equity method of accounting.
 
NS’ total investment in MSLLC is
supported by the fair value of the rail line as well as intangible assets
obtained through the transaction.
 

The joint venture is expected to increase capacity and improve service
over the Meridian Speedway into the Southeast.

Pan Am Southern
LLC (PAS) will include the PAS Lines, which consist of a 155-mile main line
track that runs between Mechanicville, New York and Ayer, Massachusetts, along
with 281 miles of secondary and branch lines, including trackage rights in New
York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont.  PAS, when
formed, will be a joint venture between NS and Pan Am Railways, Inc. (Pan Am)
pursuant to which Pan Am expects to contribute the PAS Lines and NS expects to
contribute cash and other property valued at $140 million, a significant
portion of which will be used for capital improvements to the PAS Lines and the
related construction of new intermodal and automotive terminals in the Albany,
New York area.  The joint venture is subject to regulatory approvals and
other customary closing conditions.

The
Crescent Corridor is a multistate network of infrastructure improvements and
other facilities geared toward creating a seamless, high-capacity intermodal
route spanning 11 states from New Jersey to Louisiana and offering
truck-competitive service along several major interstate highway corridors,
including I-81 and I-85, as well as I‑20, I-40, I-59, and I-75.
 
Based on the public benefits that stand
to be derived in the form of highway congestion relief, NS plans to implement
the Crescent Corridor through a series of public-private partnerships.
 
Although there is not yet a single,
integrated plan for the Crescent Corridor, preliminary work
has begun and is slated to continue in 2009, including
continued infrastructure improvements and other design and engineering work
along the Virginia portion of the Corridor consistent with our matching
obligation with respect to funds provided by the Commonwealth of Virginia
..
 
NS expects to spend approximately $30 million
related to Crescent Corridor projects in 2009.

The
MidAmerica Corridor is a proposed cooperative arrangement between NS and
Canadian National Railway (CN) to effectively share track between Chicago,
St. Louis, Kentucky, and Mississippi in order to establish more efficient
routes for traffic moving between the mid-western and southeastern U.S.,
including potential coal traffic moving to NS-served southeastern utility
plants from CN-served Illinois Basin coal producers.
 
To implement the MidAmerica Corridor,
NS, at its option, would expend funds during the next five years to upgrade the
rail line operated by West Tennessee Railway between Fulton, Kentucky, and
Corinth, Mississippi, a line over which NS would operate pursuant to recently
obtained trackage rights.
 
The
MidAmerica Corridor arrangement is subject to negotiation of definitive
agreements between NS and CN, regulatory approvals, and other customary closing
conditions.

Cash
used in financing activities

was $1.1 billion in 2008, compared with $1.6 billion in 2007
and $1.3 billion in 2006.
 
The decrease
in 2008 reflected a net increase in debt, compared with a net decline in 2007,
which was offset in part by higher dividend payments.
 
The increase in 2007 reflected higher
share repurchases as a part of NS’ share repurchase program (see Note
13), as well as higher debt repayments and increased dividend payments.

Share repurchases totaled $1.1 billion in 2008,
$1.2 billion in 2007, and $964 million in 2006 for the purchase and
retirement of 19.4 million, 23.6 million, and 21.7 million shares,
respectively, of common stock as part of NS’ share repurchase
program.
 
In
March 2007, NS’ Board of Directors amended NS’ share repurchase
program by increasing the authorized amount of share repurchases from 50
million to 75 million shares and shortening the authorized period from 2015
to 2010.
 
To date, almost all of the
purchases under the program have been made with internally generated cash.
 
However, future funding sources could include
proceeds from the issuance of debt, including the use of the receivable
securitization program (see Note 7).
 

The timing and volume of purchases is guided by management’s
assessment of market conditions and other pertinent facts.
 
Due to economic and market conditions,
NS reduced its share repurchases during the fourth quarter of 2008, and the amount
of future purchases is uncertain due to the economic climate.

T
hrough a private offering,
NS issued and sold $600 million of unsecured notes in April 2008 (see Note
7), and subsequently exchanged substantially all of these unregistered
securities with essentially identical securities registered under the
Securities Act of 1933.
 
In January
2009, through another private offering, NS issued $500 million of
unsecured notes at 5.75% due 2016 (see Note 7).
 
The net proceeds from the offering were
$494 million after deducting the purchase discount and expenses.
 
NS has agreed to exchange the
unregistered securities with essentially identical securities registered under
the Securities Act of 1933.

Subsequent to the January
2009 offering, NS has remaining authority from its board of directors to issue
and sell up to $500 million of additional debt or equity securities through
public or private sale.
  
The
Form S-3 shelf registration statements previously filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) are no longer effective under SEC’s Rule
415(a)(5), which provides for a three-year term.
 
NS expects to file a new Form S-3
registration statement during the first quarter of 2009.

NS has in place and available a $1 billion,
five-year credit agreement expiring in 2012, which provides for borrowings at
prevailing rates and includes covenants.
 

NS had no
amounts outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2008, and NS
is in compliance with all of the covenants.
 
NS also has an accounts receivable
securitization program which was renewed with a new 364-day term ending in
October 2009.
 
In addition, NS has
the ability to directly access the debt markets.

Looking forward, NS’ annual debt maturities
are relatively modest and stable from year to year (see Note 7).
 
NS expects to refinance maturing debt
over the next several years and modestly increase current debt levels.
 
Overall, NS’ goal is to maintain a
capital structure with appropriate leverage to support NS’ business
strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles.

APPLICATION
OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
 
These estimates and assumptions may require
significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, and future
events are likely to occur that may require management to make changes to these
estimates and assumptions.
 

Accordingly, management regularly reviews these estimates and assumptions
based on historical experience, changes in the business environment, and other
factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
 
Management regularly discusses the
development, selection, and disclosures concerning critical accounting
estimates with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.

Pensions
and Other Postretirement Benefits

Accounting
for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires management to make
several estimates and assumptions (see Note 10).
 
These include the expected rate of
return from investment of the plans’ assets, projected increases in
medical costs, and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their
projected earnings and mortality.
 

In addition, the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the
interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to
their present value.
 
Management
makes these estimates based on the company’s historical experience and
other information that it deems pertinent under the circumstances (for example,
expectations of future stock market performance).
 
Management utilizes an independent
consulting actuarial firm’s studies to assist it in selecting appropriate
assumptions and valuing its related liabilities.

NS’ net pension
benefit, which is included in “Compensation and benefits” on its
Consolidated Statements of Income, was $39 million for the year ended December
31, 2008.
 
In recording this amount,
NS assumed a long-term investment rate of return of 9%, which was supported by
the long-term total rate of return on plan assets since inception. Given the
uncertain economic outlook and the recent volatility in corporate bond indices,
management reduced its long-term investment rate of return to 8.75% for 2009.  A
one percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in an
$18 million change to the pension credit and, as a result, an equal change in “Compensation
and benefits” expense. Changes that are reasonably likely to occur in
assumptions concerning retirement age, projected earnings, and mortality would
not be expected to have a material effect on NS’ net pension benefit or
net pension liability in the future. The net pension liability is recorded at
its net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current
interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments.
In 2008 and 2007, NS utilized an analysis in which the projected annual cash
flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans were matched with a
yield curve based on an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds.
NS used the results of the yield curve to select the discount rate that matches
the payment stream of the benefits in these plans.
 
In 2006, NS referred to Moody’s
seasoned Aa corporate bond yields and the changes in such yields in
establishing the discount rate.

NS’ net cost for other
postretirement benefits, which is also included in “Compensation and
benefits,” was $69 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
 
In recording this expense and valuing the
net liability for other postretirement benefits, which is included in “Other
postretirement benefits,” management estimated future increases in
health-care costs. These assumptions, along with the effect of a one percentage
point change in them, are described in Note 10.

Properties
and Depreciation

Most
of NS’ total assets are long-lived railway properties (see Note 5).
 
As disclosed in Note 1, NS’
properties are depreciated using group depreciation.
 
Rail is depreciated primarily on the
basis of use measured by gross-ton miles.
 

Other properties are depreciated generally using the straight-line
method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives.
 
NS reviews the carrying amount of
properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such
carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash
flows.
 
Assets that are deemed
impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lesser of carrying
amount or fair value.

NS’
depreciation expense is based on management’s assumptions concerning
service lives of its properties as well as the expected net salvage that will
be received upon their retirement.
 
In
developing these assumptions, NS’ management utilizes periodic
depreciation studies that are performed by an outside firm of consulting
engineers.
 
These studies analyze NS’
historical patterns of asset use and retirement and take into account any
expected change in operation or maintenance practices.
 
NS’ recent experience with these
studies has been that while they do result in changes in the rates used to
depreciate its properties, these changes have not caused a significant effect
to its annual depreciation expense.
 

The studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated
depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by the
study.
 
Any such deficiency (or
excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining
service lives of the affected class of property.
 
NS’ depreciation expense for the
year ended December 31, 2008, amounted to $804 million.
 
NS’ weighted-average depreciation
rates for 2008 are disclosed in Note 5; a one-tenth percentage point increase
(or decrease) in these rates would have resulted in a $28 million increase
(or decrease) to depreciation expense.

Personal
Injury, Environmental, and Legal Liabilities

NS’
expense for casualties and other claims, included in “Materials and
other,” amounted to $180 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
 
Most of this expense was NS’
accrual related to personal injury liabilities.
 
Job-related personal injury and
occupational claims are subject to FELA, which is applicable only to
railroads.
 
FELA’s fault-based
tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as
compared with a no-fault worker’s compensation system.
 
The variability inherent in this system
could result in actual costs being very different from the liability
recorded.
 
In all cases, NS records
a liability when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and
estimable.

To
aid in valuing its personal injury liability and determining the amount to
accrue during the year, NS’ management utilizes studies prepared by an
independent consulting actuarial firm.
 

For employee personal injury cases, the actuarial firm studies NS’
historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements, taking
into account relevant outside influences.
 

An estimate of the ultimate amount of the liability, which includes
amounts for incurred but unasserted claims, is based on the results of this
analysis.
 
For occupational injury
claims, the actuarial firm studies NS’ history of claim filings,
severity, payments and other relevant facts.
 
Additionally, the estimate of the
ultimate loss for occupational injuries includes a provision for those claims
that have been incurred but not reported by projecting NS’ experience
into the future as far as can be reasonably determined.
 
NS has recorded this actuarially
determined liability.
 
The liability
is dependent upon many individual judgments made as to the specific case
reserves as well as the judgments of the consulting actuary and management in
the periodic studies.
 
Accordingly,
there could be significant changes in the liability, which NS would recognize
when such a change became known.
 

The most recent actuarial study, completed in the fourth quarter of 2008,
resulted in a decrease to NS’ personal injury liability during the fourth
quarter.
 
While the liability
recorded is supported by the most recent study, it is reasonably possible that
the ultimate liability could be higher or lower.

NS
is subject to various jurisdictions’ environmental laws and
regulations.
 
It is NS’ policy
to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount
can be estimated reasonably (see Note 17).
 
Claims, if any, against third parties
for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS, are reflected as receivables
(when collection is probable) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are not
netted against the associated NS liability.
 
Environmental engineers regularly
participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any
necessary adjustments to liability estimates.
 
NS also has established an Environmental
Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its
environmental policy.

Operating
expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately $18 million in
2008, $16 million in 2007 and $19 million in 2006, and capital
expenditures for environmental matters totaled approximately $7 million in
both 2008 and 2007, and $6 million in 2006.
 
Capital expenditures for environmental
matters in 2009 are expected to be about $9 million.

NS’ Consolidated Balance Sheets included
liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of $42 million at December
31, 2008, and $46 million at December 31, 2007 (of which $12 million is
classified as a current liability at the end of each period).
 
At December 31, 2008, the liability
represented NS’ estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs
based on available information at 148 known locations.
 
As of that date, 13 sites accounted
for $22 million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to
be material.
 
NS anticipates that
much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs
will be paid out over a longer period.

At 30
locations, one or more NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of
other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980,
or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint and several liability
for cleanup costs.

With respect to known environmental sites (whether
identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of
NS’ ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the
aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely
varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development
of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the
nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participant’s
share of any estimated loss (and that participant’s ability to bear it),
and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability.
 
NS estimates its environmental
remediation liability on a site-by-site basis, using assumptions and judgments
that management deems appropriate for each site.
 
As a result, it is not practical to
quantitatively describe the effects of changes in these many assumptions and
judgments.
 
NS has consistently
applied its methodology of estimating its environmental liabilities.

On April 24, 2008, the United States Department of
Justice (DOJ) brought an action against NS for alleged violations of federal
environmental laws resulting from the discharge of chlorine and oil that
occurred as a result of the January 6, 2005, derailment in Graniteville, SC,
including claims for civil penalties as well as injunctive relief.
 
On June 24, 2008, NS filed a motion to
dismiss DOJ’s claims, contending that insufficient facts have been
alleged to support such claims.
 
NS
does not believe that the outcome of these proceedings will have a material
effect on its financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

Based on an assessment of known facts and
circumstances, management believes that it is unlikely that any such known facts
and circumstances, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a
material adverse effect on NS’ financial position, results of operations,
or liquidity.

Norfolk
Southern and certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other
claims relating principally to railroad operations.
 
When management concludes that it is
probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can
be reasonably estimated, it is accrued through a charge to expenses.
 
While the ultimate amount of liability
incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future
developments, in management’s opinion the recorded liability, if any, is
adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims.
 
However, the final outcome of any of
these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable
or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be
significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter.
 
Any adjustments to recorded liabilities
will be reflected in expenses in the periods in which such adjustments are
known.

Income
Taxes

NS’
net long-term deferred tax liability totaled $6.4 billion at December 31, 2008
(see Note 3).
 
This liability is
estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in
the financial statements.
 
After
application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is
required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in the corporate
income tax returns.
 
For state
income and other taxes, judgment is also required with respect to the
apportionment among the various jurisdictions.
 
A valuation allowance is recorded if
management expects that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets
will not be realized.
 
NS had an $11 million
valuation allowance on $991 million of deferred tax assets as of December
31, 2008, reflecting the expectation that most of these assets will be
realized.

In addition, NS has a
recorded liability for its estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return.
 

Judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state
tax laws and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position
will be sustained on examination and, if so, judgment is also required as to
the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon
settlement with the taxing authority.
 

Management believes this liability for uncertain tax positions to be
adequate.
 
Income tax expense is
adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes
available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded.
 
For every one half percent change in the
2008 effective tax rate net income would have changed by $14 million.

OTHER
MATTERS

Labor
Agreements

Approximately 26,000, or about 85%, of NS’
railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various
labor unions.
 
These agreements
remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act (RLA).
 
NS largely bargains nationally, in
concert with other major railroads.
 

Moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads
and the unions may propose changes.

The most recent national bargaining round began in
late 2004.
 
Since that time, the railroads
have reached national agreements that extend through 2009 with all of the rail
unions.
 
Additionally, the current
agreement with BLET extends through 2014.
 

Because NS has reached separate agreements with the BLET and the
American Train Dispatchers Association (ATDA), only the health and welfare
provisions from the national agreements apply to NS’ locomotive engineers
and ATDA-represented dispatchers.
 
A
small number of longshoremen at Ashtabula (Ohio) Docks are represented by the
International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) and do not participate in
national bargaining.
 
Negotiations
are continuing with that organization.

Market
Risks and Hedging Activities

NS
has used derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in
its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates.

In
2001, NS began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel
consumption.
 
The intent of the
program was to assist in the management of NS’ aggregate risk exposure to
fuel price fluctuations, which can significantly affect NS’ operating
margins and profitability, through the use of one or more types of derivative
instruments.
 
No new hedges have
been entered into since May 2004, and the last remaining contracts were settled
in the second quarter of 2006, bringing an end to the benefits from the
program.
 
Locomotive diesel fuel
costs represented 14% of NS’ operating expenses for 2006.

NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates by issuing both fixed- and floating-rate debt instruments and by
entering into interest-rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix
within its debt portfolio.

At December 31, 2008, NS’ debt subject to
interest rate fluctuations totaled $317 million.
 
A 1% point increase in interest rates
would increase NS’ total annual interest expense related to all its
variable debt by approximately $3 million.
 
Management considers it unlikely that
interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in
a material adverse effect on NS’ financial position, results of
operations, or liquidity.

Some of NS’ capital leases, which carry an
average fixed rate of 7%, were effectively converted to variable rate
obligations using interest rate swap agreements.
 
On December 31, 2008, the average pay
rate under these agreements was 3%, and the average receive rate was 7%.
 
During 2008 and 2007, the effect of the
swaps was to reduce interest expense by approximately $1 million in both
periods.
 
A portion of the lease obligations
is payable in Japanese yen.
 
NS
eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease
with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen-denominated obligation.
 
Most of these deposits are held by
foreign banks, primarily Japanese.
 

As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to
Japan.
 
Counterparties to the
interest rate swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial
institutions believed by management to be creditworthy.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.”
 
This statement, effective for interim or
annual reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2007, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value in U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
 
Effective January 1, 2008, NS adopted
this standard related to financial instrument assets and liabilities with no
effect on NS’ consolidated financial statements.
 
NS will adopt the provisions of this
standard relative to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are
not remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis in the first quarter of
2009.
 
NS does not expect that it
will have an effect on NS’ consolidated financial statements.

In June 2008, the FASB
issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 03-6-1, “Determining
Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions are
Participating Securities.”
 

This FSP addresses whether instruments granted in share-based payment
transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, need
to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under
the two-class method as described in SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per Share.”
 
NS will adopt the FSP, which affects the
calculation of earnings per share, in the first quarter of 2009.
 
The provisions of the FSP are to be
applied retrospectively.
 
NS expects
that it will not have a material effect on NS’ consolidated financial
statements.

FSP No. 132(R)-1, “Employers’
Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets,” was issued on December 30,
2008.
 
This statement, effective for
fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009, clarifies an employer’s
disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other
postretirement plan.
 
This statement
prescribes expanded disclosures regarding investment allocation decisions, categories
of plan assets, inputs, and valuation techniques used to measure fair value,
the effect of Level 3 inputs on changes in plan assets and significant
concentrations of risk.
 
NS will
adopt the FSP at the end of 2009 and expects it will not have a material effect
on NS’ consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 160 (SFAS 160), “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
Financial Statements,” which requires that noncontrolling (minority)
interests be reported as a component of equity.
 
NS will adopt the statement in the first
quarter of 2009 and expects it will not have a material effect on NS’
consolidated financial statements.

Inflation

In
preparing financial statements, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
require the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on
the replacement cost of property.
 

NS, a capital-intensive company, has most of its capital invested in
such property.
 
The replacement cost
of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be
substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical
cost.

Proposed Legislation and Regulations on Safety and
Transportation of Hazardous Materials

Federal regulations were
adopted in late 2008 on safety and transportation of hazardous materials.
 
NS is in compliance with those
regulations currently effective and expects to be in compliance with those
regulations to become effective at a later date.

FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS

This
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations contains forward-looking statements that may be identified by the
use of words like “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate”
and “project.” Forward-looking statements reflect management’s
good-faith evaluation of information currently available.
 
However, such statements are dependent
on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external variables over
which management has little or no control, including:
 
domestic and international economic
conditions; interest rates; the business environment in industries that produce
and consume rail freight; competition and consolidation within the
transportation industry; the operations of carriers with which NS interchanges;
acts of terrorism or war; fluctuation in prices of key materials, in particular
diesel fuel; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages;
legislative and regulatory developments; results of litigation; changes in
securities and capital markets; disruptions to NS’ technology
infrastructure, including computer systems; and natural events such as severe
weather, hurricanes, and floods.
 
For
a discussion of significant risk factors applicable to NS, see Part I, Item 1A “Risk
Factors.”
 
Forward-looking
statements are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guarantee of future
performance or results, nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate
indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be
achieved.
 
As a result, actual
outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in
forward-looking statements.
 
NS
undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements.

Norfolk
Southern Corporation

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting.
 
In order to
ensure that the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting
is effective, management regularly assesses such controls and did so most
recently for its financial reporting as of December 31, 2008.
 
This assessment was based on criteria
for effective internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal
Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
 

Based on this assessment, management has concluded that the Corporation
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2008.

KPMG LLP, independent registered public accounting
firm, has audited the Corporation’s financial statements and issued an
attestation report on the Corporation’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2008.

Report of Independent Registered Public

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Norfolk Southern Corporation:

We have audited Norfolk Southern Corporation’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based
on criteria established in

Internal
Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Norfolk Southern Corporation’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of
Management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion,
Norfolk Southern Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based
on criteria established in

Internal
Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited,
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Norfolk Southern
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the
related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders’ equity,
and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2008, and our report dated February 18, 2009 expressed an
unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Norfolk Southern Corporation:

We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Norfolk Southern Corporation
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related
consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and
cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended
December 31, 2008. In connection with our audits of the consolidated
financial statements, we also have audited financial statement schedule as
listed in Item 15(A)2. These consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Norfolk Southern Corporation
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year
period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.
 

Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein.

As discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements, Norfolk Southern Corporation adopted Financial Accounting Standards
Board Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,

effective
January 1, 2007 and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers’
Accounting for

Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans,

effective
December 31, 2006.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Norfolk
Southern Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework,

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and
our report dated February 18, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting

Norfolk Southern Corporation
and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

The
following Notes are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

1.
 
Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

Description
of Business

Norfolk
Southern Corporation is a Virginia-based holding company engaged principally in
the rail transportation business, operating approximately 21,000 route miles
primarily in the East and Midwest.
 

These consolidated financial statements include Norfolk Southern
Corporation (Norfolk Southern) and its majority-owned and controlled
subsidiaries (collectively, NS).
 

Norfolk Southern’s major subsidiary is Norfolk Southern Railway
Company (NSR).
 
All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

NSR and its railroad subsidiaries transport raw
materials, intermediate products and finished goods classified in the following
market groups (percent of total railway operating revenues in 2008): coal (29%);
intermodal (19%); agriculture/consumer products/government (12%);
metals/construction (12%); chemicals (12%); paper/clay/forest products (8%);
and automotive (8%).
 
Although most
of NS’ customers are domestic, ultimate points of origination or
destination for some of the products transported (particularly coal bound for
export and some intermodal containers) may be outside the United States.
 
Approximately 85% of NS’ railroad
employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor
unions.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
 
Management periodically reviews its
estimates, including those related to the recoverability and useful lives of
assets, as well as liabilities for litigation, environmental remediation,
casualty claims, income taxes, and pension and other postretirement
benefits.
 
Changes in facts and
circumstances may result in revised estimates.

Revenue
Recognition

Transportation revenue is recognized proportionally
as a shipment moves from origin to destination and related expenses are recognized
as incurred.
 
Refunds (which are
primarily volume-based incentives) are recorded as a reduction to revenues on
the basis of management’s best estimate of projected liability, which is
based on historical activity, current traffic counts and the expectation of
future activity.
 
NS regularly
monitors its contract refund liability, and historically, the estimates have
not differed significantly from the amounts ultimately refunded.
 
Switching, demurrage and other
incidental service revenues are recognized when the services are performed.

Derivatives

NS
does not engage in the trading of derivatives.
 
NS has used derivative financial
instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and in
the management of its mix of fixed and floating-rate debt.
 
Management has determined that these
derivative instruments qualify as either fair-value or cash-flow hedges, having
values that highly correlate with the underlying hedged exposures, and has
designated such instruments as hedging

transactions.
 
Income and expense related to the
derivative financial instruments are recorded in the same category as generated
by the underlying asset or liability.
 

Credit risk related to the derivative financial instruments is
considered to be minimal and is managed by requiring high credit standards for
counterparties and periodic settlements (see Note 16).

Cash
Equivalents

“Cash
equivalents” are highly liquid investments purchased three months or less
from maturity.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

NS’
allowance for doubtful accounts was $5 million at December 31, 2008, and December
31, 2007.
 
To determine its
allowance for doubtful accounts, NS evaluates historical loss experience (which
has not been significant), the characteristics of current accounts, as
well as general economic conditions and trends.

Materials
and Supplies

“Materials
and supplies,” consisting mainly of fuel oil and items for maintenance of
property and equipment, are stated at the lower of average cost or market.
 
The cost of materials and supplies
expected to be used in capital additions or improvements is included in “Properties.”

Investments

Debt securities classified as “held-to-maturity”
are reported at amortized cost and marketable equity and debt securities classified
as “trading” or “available-for-sale” are recorded at fair
value.
 
Unrealized after-tax gains
and losses for investments designated as “available-for-sale,” are
recognized in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss.”

Investments
where NS has the ability to exercise significant influence over but does not
control the entity are accounted for using the equity method in accordance with
APB Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in
Common Stock.”

Properties

“Properties”
are stated principally at cost and are depreciated using group
depreciation.
 
Rail is depreciated
primarily on the basis of use measured by gross ton-miles.
 
Other properties are depreciated
generally using the straight-line method over the lesser of estimated service
or lease lives.
 
Depletion of
natural resources (see Note 2) is based on units of production.
 
Depreciation in the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows includes depreciation and depletion.
 
NS capitalizes interest on major capital
projects during the period of their construction.
 
Expenditures, including those on leased
assets that extend an asset’s useful life or increase its utility, are
capitalized.
 
Expenditures
capitalized include those that are directly related to a capital project and
may include materials, labor, and equipment, in addition to an allocable
portion of indirect costs that clearly relate to a particular project.
 
Costs related to repairs and maintenance
activities that do not extend an asset’s useful life or increase its
utility are expensed when such repairs are performed.
 
When properties other than land and
nonrail assets are sold or retired in the ordinary course of business, the cost
of the assets, net of sale proceeds or salvage, is charged to accumulated
depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized through income.
 
Gains and losses on disposal of land and
nonrail assets are included in “Other income - net” (see Note 2)
since such income is not a product of NS’ railroad operations.

NS
reviews the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable
based on future undiscounted cash flows.
 

Assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded
at the lower of carrying amount or fair value.

Required Accounting Changes

Effective January 1, 2008,
NS adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,”
related to financial instrument assets and liabilities with no effect on NS’
consolidated financial statements.
 

This statement, effective for interim or annual reporting periods
beginning after November 15, 2007, establishes a framework for measuring fair
value in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures
about fair value measurements.

Effective January 1, 2007, NS adopted Financial
Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), “Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” which clarifies accounting for uncertainty
in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in
accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.”
 
FIN 48 prescribes a recognition
threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be
taken in a tax return.
 
Under the
guidelines of FIN 48, an entity should recognize the financial statement
benefit of a tax position if it determines that it is more likely than not that
the position will be sustained on examination (see Note 3).

Effective December 31, 2006,
NS adopted SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans” (SFAS 158) (see Note 10).

Effective January 1, 2006, NS
adopted SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” [SFAS 123(R)].
 
This statement applies to awards
granted, modified, repurchased or cancelled after the effective date as well as
awards that are unvested at the effective date and includes, among other
things, the requirement to expense the fair value of stock options.
 
The standard also requires that awards
to be settled in cash be measured at fair value at each reporting date until
ultimate settlement.
 
NS adopted
SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective method, which requires application of
the standard to all awards granted, modified, repurchased or cancelled on or
after January 1, 2006, and to all awards for which the requisite service
has not been rendered as of such date.
 

In accordance with the modified prospective approach, prior period
financial statements have not been restated to reflect the impact of SFAS
123(R).
 
Under SFAS 123(R), all new
awards granted to retirement eligible employees must be expensed
immediately.
 
Under APB Opinion No.
25 and related interpretations, such awards were amortized over the stated
service period.

In June 2008, the FASB
issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 03-6-1, “Determining
Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions are
Participating Securities.”
 

This FSP addresses whether instruments granted in share-based payment
transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, need
to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under
the two-class method as described in SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per Share.”
 
NS will adopt the FSP, which affects the
calculation of earnings per share, in the first quarter of 2009.
 
The provisions of the FSP are to be
applied retrospectively.
 
NS expects
that it will not have a material effect on NS’ consolidated financial statements.

as well as the costs incurred by those subsidiaries in their operations.
 
NS had a 40.5% interest in a limited
liability company that owned and operated facilities that produced synthetic
fuel from coal.
 
In addition, in
2007 NS purchased two facilities that produced synthetic fuel from coal.
 
The production of synthetic fuel resulted
in tax credits as well as expenses related to the investments.
 
The expenses are included in “Expenses
related to synthetic fuel investments” above.
 
The tax credits related to the synthetic
fuel investments expired at the end of 2007 and are no longer available.

Illinois enacted tax
legislation in August 2007, revised in January 2008, that modified the way
transportation companies apportion their taxable income to the state.
 
The change resulted in an increase in NS’
deferred income tax liability in the third quarter of 2007, as required by SFAS
No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” which increased deferred
tax expense by $1 million in 2008 and $19 million in 2007.

Deferred
Tax Assets and Liabilities

Certain
items are reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax
purposes.
 
Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recorded in recognition of these differences.
 
The tax effects of temporary differences
that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred
tax liabilities are as follows:

Except
for amounts for which a valuation allowance has been provided, management
believes that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations
will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax
assets.
 
The valuation allowance at
the end of each year relates to subsidiary state income tax net operating
losses that may not be utilized prior to their expiration.
 
The total valuation allowance increased $1 million
in 2008 and 2007, and decreased $1 million in 2006.

$


Included in the balance of
unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2008, are potential benefits of $60 million
that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.
 
As a result of the implementation of
FIN 48 on January 1, 2007 (see Note 1), NS recognized a $10 million
increase to stockholders equity, $2 million of which related to
investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
 
Unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted in
the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or
the final outcome differs from the amount recorded.

NS expects that the total
amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2008, will decrease by approximately
$55 million in 2009 due to tax positions for which there was an
uncertainty about the timing of deductibility in earlier years but
deductibility may become certain by the close of 2009.
 
NS’ consolidated federal income
tax returns for 2006 and 2007 are being audited by the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS).
 
NS anticipates that the IRS
will complete its examination of the 2006 and 2007 years within the next twelve
months.
 
It is reasonably possible
that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change due to the completion
of the IRS examination of the 2006 and 2007 years, but an estimate of the
change cannot be made.
 
State income
tax returns generally are subject to examination for a period of three to four
years after filing of the return.
 

In addition, NS is generally obligated to report changes in taxable
income arising from federal income tax examinations to the states within a
period of up to two years from the date the federal examination is final.
 
NS has various state income tax returns
either under examination, administrative appeals, or litigation.
 
It is reasonably possible that the
amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in 2009 as a result of the
lapse of state statutes of limitations, but the amount is not expected to be
significant.
 
NS does not expect
that any of the above potential changes in unrecognized tax benefits will have
a material effect on NS’ financial position, results of operations, or
liquidity.

Interest related to
unrecognized tax benefits, which is included in “Other income – net,”
amounted to $15 million of income in 2008, $12 million of expense in
2007 and $2 million of income in 2006.
 

Penalties related to tax matters are included in “Provision for
income taxes” and totaled zero in each of 2008, 2007, and 2006.
 
NS has recorded a liability of $20 million
at December 31, 2008, and $28 million at December 31, 2007, for the
payment of interest on unrecognized tax benefits.
 
NS has no liability recorded at December
31, 2008, and December 31, 2007, for the payment of penalties on
unrecognized tax benefits.

“Other
equity method investments” above includes $267 million at December
31, 2008, and $240 million at December 31, 2007, related to NS’
investment in Meridian Speedway LLC, a joint venture formed with Kansas City
Southern in 2006.

Investment
in Conrail

Through a limited liability company, Norfolk Southern
and CSX Corporation (CSX) jointly own Conrail Inc. (Conrail), whose primary
subsidiary is Consolidated Rail Corporation (CRC).
 
NS has a 58% economic and 50% voting
interest in the jointly owned entity, and CSX has the remainder of the economic
and voting interests.
 
NS is
applying the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail in
accordance with APB Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for
Investments in Common Stock.”
 

NS is amortizing the excess of the purchase price over Conrail’s
net equity using the principles of purchase accounting, based primarily on the
estimated useful lives of Conrail’s depreciable property and equipment,
including the related deferred tax effect of the differences in tax accounting
bases for such assets, as all of the purchase price at acquisition was
allocable to Conrail’s tangible assets and liabilities.

At December 31, 2008, based on the funded status of Conrail’s
pension plans, recorded in accordance with SFAS 158, NS reduced its
proportional investment in Conrail by $60 million.
 
This resulted in a $55 million loss
recorded to “other comprehensive income (loss)” and a combined
federal and state deferred tax asset of $5 million.
 
At December 31, 2007, NS’ year-end
SFAS 158 adjustment increased its proportional investment in Conrail by
$6 million.
 
This resulted in
$5 million of income recorded to “other comprehensive income (loss)”
and a combined federal and state deferred tax liability of about $1 million.
 
At December 31, 2008, the difference
between NS’ investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail’s
underlying net equity was $551 million.
 
NS’ equity in the earnings of
Conrail, net of amortization, included in “Other income – net”
was $29 million, $45 million, and $25 million in 2008, 2007, and
2006, respectively.

CRC
owns and operates certain properties (the Shared Assets Areas) for the joint
and exclusive benefit of NSR and CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT).
 
The costs of operating the Shared Assets
Areas are borne by NSR and CSXT based on usage.
 
In addition, NSR and CSXT pay CRC a fee
for access to the Shared Assets Areas.
 

“Purchased services and rents” and “Fuel” include
expenses for amounts due to CRC for operation of the Shared Assets Areas totaling
$131 million in 2008 and $126 million in both 2007 and 2006.
 
Future minimum lease payments due to CRC under the
Shared Assets Areas agreements are as follows: $29 million in each of
2009 through 2013 and $305 million thereafter.
 
NS provides certain general and
administrative support functions to Conrail, the fees for which are billed
in accordance with several service-provider arrangements and amount to
approximately $7 million annually.

“Accounts payable” includes $82 million
at December 31, 2008, and $78 million at December 31, 2007, due to Conrail
for the operation of the Shared Assets Areas.
 
In addition, “Other liabilities”
includes $133 million at December 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007, for long-term
advances from Conrail, maturing 2035, that bear interest at an average
rate of 4.4%.

During the second quarter of 2008, $200 million
of commercial paper matured and was refinanced as part of a private offering
under which NS issued and sold $600 million of unsecured notes at 5.75%
due 2018.
 
NS subsequently exchanged
substantially all of these unregistered securities with essentially identical
securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933.

In November 2007, NS entered into a $500 million
receivables securitization facility under which NSR sells substantially all of
its eligible third-party receivables to an NS subsidiary, which in turn may
transfer beneficial interests in the receivables to various commercial paper
vehicles.
 
Amounts received under
the facility are accounted for as borrowings.
 
Under this facility, NS received $425 million
and repaid $375 million in 2008.
 

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the amounts outstanding under the
facility were $300 million at an average variable interest rate of 3.01%
and $250 million at an average variable interest rate of 5.57%,
respectively.
 
The facility has a
364-day term which was renewed and amended in October 2008; however, NS
intends to refinance these borrowings by issuing long-term debt, which is
supported by its $1 billion credit agreement (see below).
 
Accordingly, amounts outstanding are
included in the line item “Long-term debt” in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.
 
At December 31,
2008, and December 31, 2007, the amounts of receivables included in “Accounts
receivable – net” serving as collateral for these borrowings were $719 million
and $778 million, respectively.

The
railroad equipment obligations and the capitalized leases are secured by liens
on the underlying equipment.
 

Certain lease obligations require the maintenance of yen-denominated
deposits, which are pledged to the lessor to satisfy yen-denominated lease
payments.
 
These deposits are included
in “Other assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $85 million
at December 31, 2008, and $80 million at December 31, 2007.

Issuance
of Debt or Equity Securities

NS has authority from its
board of directors for the issuance and public or private sale of up to $1
billion of debt or equity securities.
 

Under this authority, NS issued $500 million of unsecured notes in
January 2009 at 5.75% due in 2016 in a private offering.
 
The net proceeds from the offering were
approximately $494 million after deducting the purchase discount and expenses.
 
NS has agreed to exchange these
unregistered securities with essentially identical securities registered under
the Securities Act of 1933.

Subsequent to the January
2009 offering, NS has remaining authority from its board of directors to issue
and sell up to $500 million of additional debt or equity securities through public
or private sale.
  
The Form S-3
shelf registration statements previously filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) are no longer effective under SEC’s Rule 415(a)(5),
which provides for a three-year term.
 

NS expects to file a new Form S-3 registration statement during the
first quarter of 2009.

Credit
Agreement, Debt Covenants and Commercial Paper

NS has
in place and available a $1 billion, five-year credit agreement expiring in 2012,
which provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes covenants.
 
NS had no
amounts outstanding under this facility at December 31,
2008, and NS is in compliance with all of the covenants.

NS
has the ability to issue commercial paper supported by its $1 billion credit
agreement.
 
At December 31, 2008 and
2007, NS had no outstanding commercial paper.

8.
 
Lease Commitments

NS is committed under long-term lease agree­ments,
which expire on various dates through 2067, for equipment, lines of road and
other property.
 
The following

Pensions and Other Postretirement
Benefits

Norfolk
Southern and certain subsidiaries have both funded and unfunded defined benefit
pension plans covering principally salaried employees.
 
Norfolk Southern and certain
subsidiaries also provide specified health care and death benefits to eligible
retired employees and their dependents.
 

Under the present plans, which may be amended or terminated at NS’
option, a defined percentage of health care expenses is covered, reduced by any
deductibles, co-payments, Medicare payments and, in some cases, coverage
provided under other group insurance policies.

The estimated net loss and prior service cost for
the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other

and $3 million, respectively.
 

The estimated net loss and prior service benefit for the other defined
benefit postretirement plans that will be amortized from accumulated other
comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost over the next year are $34
million and $2 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2006, NS
adopted SFAS 158.
 
This statement
requires an employer to recognize in its statement of financial position the
overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement
plans measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the
benefit obligation.
 
Employers must
also recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the
actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs, credits, and transition
costs that arise during the period.
 

As a result of adopting this standard, NS reduced its pension asset by
$217 million and increased its pension and postretirement liabilities by
$258 million in its December 31, 2006, Consolidated Balance Sheet,
with a corresponding reduction to stockholders’ equity of $292 million
(net of tax) reflected as an increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss.
 
In addition, NS recognized a
$2 million reduction to stockholders’ equity related to its
proportionate share of Conrail’s adoption of SFAS 158.
 
The adoption of SFAS 158 has no impact
on years prior to 2006 and has no effect on the calculation of expenses for
pensions and post-retirement benefits.

Pension
and Other Postretirement Benefit Assumptions

Pension and other postretirement benefit costs are
determined based on actuarial valuations that reflect appropriate assumptions
as of the measurement date, ordinarily the beginning of each year.
 
The funded status of the plans is
determined using appropriate assumptions as of each year end.
 
A summary of the major assumptions
follows:




Funded status:

To
determine the discount rate in 2008 and 2007, NS utilized an analysis in which
the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit
plans were matched with a yield curve based on an appropriate universe of
high-quality corporate bonds.
 
NS
used the results of the yield curve to select the discount rate that matches
the payment stream of the benefits in these plans.
 
In 2006, NS referred to Moody’s
seasoned Aa corporate bond yields and the changes in such yields in establishing
the discount rate.

Health
Care Cost Trend Assumptions

For
measurement purposes at December 31, 2008, increases in the per capita cost of
covered health care benefits were assumed to be 8.5% for 2008 and 8.8% for 2009.
 
It is assumed the rate will decrease
gradually to an ultimate rate of 5% for 2014 and remain at that level
thereafter.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a
significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements.
 
To illustrate, a one-percentage-point
change in the assumed health care cost trend would have the following effects:

Asset Management

Eleven
investment firms manage NS’ defined benefit pension plan’s assets
under investment guidelines approved by the Board of Directors.
 
Investments are restricted to domestic
fixed income securities, international fixed income securities, domestic and
international equity investments, and unleveraged exchange-traded options and
financial futures.
 
Limitations
restrict investment concentration and use of certain derivative
instruments.
 
The target asset
allocation for equity is 75% of the pension plan’s assets.
 
Fixed income investments must have an
average rating of “AA” or better and all fixed income securities
must be rated “A” or better except bond index funds.
 
Equity investments must be in liquid
securities listed on national exchanges.
 

No investment is permitted in the securities of Norfolk Southern
Corporation or its subsidiaries (except through commingled pension trust
funds).
 
Investment managers’
returns are expected to meet or exceed selected market indices by prescribed
margins.

NS’
pension plan weighted-average asset allocations at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
by asset category, were as follows:

Percentage of plan

assets at December 31,

Asset Category



Domestic
  equity securities

65%

International
  equity securities

11%

10%

Debt
  securities

31%

25%

Total

100%

100%

The
postretirement benefit plan assets consist primarily of trust-owned variable
life insurance policies with an asset allocation at December 31, 2008, of 53%
in equity securities and 47% in debt securities compared with 65% in equity
securities and 35% in debt securities at December 31, 2007.
 
The target asset allocation for equity
is between 50% and 75% of the plan’s assets.

The
plans’ assumed future returns are based principally on the asset
allocation and on the historic returns for the plans’ asset classes
determined from both actual plan returns and, over longer time periods, market
returns for those asset classes.
 
In
2008, 2007, and 2006 NS
assumed a return on pension plan assets of 9%.
 
For 2009, NS assumes an 8.75% return on pension
plan assets.
 
A one percentage point
change to the rate of return assumption would result in an $18 million
change to the net pension (benefit) cost and, as a result, an equal change in “Compensation
and benefits” expense.

Contributions and Estimated Future Benefit Payments

In 2009, NS expects to
contribute approximately $9 million to its unfunded pension plans for payments
to pensioners and $50 million to its other postretirement benefit plans for
retiree health benefits.
 
NS does
not expect to contribute to its funded pension plan in 2009.

Benefit payments, which
reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid
as follows:

The
other postretirement benefit payments include an estimated average annual
reduction due to the Medicare Part D Subsidy of about $6 million.

Other Postretirement Coverage

Under collective bargaining
agreements, NS and certain subsidiaries participate in a multi-employer benefit
plan, which provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance
benefits to eligible union employees.
 

Premiums under this plan are expensed as incurred and amounted to $33 million
in 2008, $27 million in 2007, and $26 million in 2006.

Section
401(k) Plans

Norfolk
Southern and certain subsidiaries provide Section 401(k) savings plans for
employees.
 
Under the plans, NS
matches a portion of employee contributions, subject to applicable
limitations.
 
NS’ matching
contributions, recorded as an expense, under these plans were $15 million
in 2008 and $14 million in both 2007 and 2006.

11.
 
Stock-Based Compensation

Under
the stockholder-approved Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), a committee of
nonemployee directors of the Board or the chief executive officer (if delegated
such authority by the committee) may grant stock options, stock appreciation
rights (SARs), restricted stock units, restricted shares, performance shares,
and performance share units (PSUs), up to a maximum of 88,025,000 shares of
Norfolk Southern Common Stock (Common Stock).
 
Of these shares, 5,000,000 were approved
by the Board for issuance to non-officer participants; as a broad-based
issuance, stockholder approval was not required.
 
In May 2005, the stockholders approved
an amended LTIP which provided that 8,500,000 shares of stock previously
approved for issuance under LTIP could be granted as restricted stock units,
restricted shares or performance shares.
 

Under the Board-approved Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan (TSOP), the
committee may grant stock options up to a maximum of 6,000,000 shares of Common
Stock; as a broad-based stock option plan, stockholder approval of TSOP was not
required.
 
NS uses newly issued
shares to satisfy any exercises and awards under LTIP and TSOP.

The
LTIP also permits the payment – on a current or a deferred basis and in
cash or in stock – of dividend equivalents on shares of Common Stock
covered by options, PSUs or restricted stock units in an amount commensurate
with regular quarterly dividends paid on Common Stock.
 
Tax absorption payments also are
authorized for any awards under LTIP in amounts estimated to equal the federal
and state income taxes applicable to shares of Common Stock issued subject to a
share retention agreement.

During the first quarter of 2008, a committee of
nonemployee directors of NS’ Board granted stock options, restricted
stock units and PSUs pursuant to the LTIP and granted stock options pursuant to
the TSOP.
 
Receipt of an award under
LTIP was made contingent upon the awardee’s execution of a non-compete
agreement, and all awards under LTIP were made subject to forfeiture in the
event the awardee “engages in competing employment” for a period of
time following retirement.

Accounting
Method

As disclosed in Note 1, prior to the adoption of
SFAS 123(R), NS applied APB Opinion 25 and related interpretations in
accounting for awards made under the plans.
 
Accordingly, grants of PSUs, restricted stock
units, restricted shares, dividend equivalents, tax absorption payments and
SARs resulted in charges to net income, while grants of stock options had no
effect on net income.
 
Under SFAS
123(R), all awards result in charges to net income while dividend equivalents,
which are all related to equity classified awards, are charged to retained income.
 
Related compensation costs were $89 million
in 2008, $96 million in 2007 and $129 million in 2006.
 
The total tax effects recognized in
income in relation to stock-based compensation were benefits of $30 million
in 2008, $32 million in 2007 and $44 million in 2006.

“Common
stock issued – net” in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 includes tax benefits
generated from tax deductions in excess of compensation costs recognized
(excess tax benefits) for share based awards of $76 million, $57 million
and $85 million, respectively.

Stock Options

Options
may be granted for a term not to exceed 10 years and are subject to a vesting
period of at least one year.
 
Option
exercise prices are at not less than the fair market value of Common Stock on
the effective date of the grant.
 
In the first quarter of 2008,
1,162,600 options were granted under the LTIP and 250,000 options were granted
under the TSOP.
 
In each case, the
grant price was $50.74, which was the fair market value of Common Stock on the
date of grant.
 
The options have a
term of ten years but may not be exercised prior to the third anniversary of
the date of grant.
 
Holders of the
options granted under the LTIP who remain actively employed receive cash
dividend equivalent payments for five years in an amount equal to the regular
quarterly dividends paid on Common Stock.

In
the first quarter of 2007, 1,203,300 options were granted under the LTIP and
251,000 options were granted under the TSOP, each with a grant price of $49.555,
but may not be exercised prior to the third anniversary of the date of grant.
 
In the first quarter of 2006, 1,188,700
options were granted under the LTIP and 238,000 options were granted under the
TSOP, each with a grant price of $49.425, but may not be exercised prior to the
first anniversary of the date of grant.
 

For both 2007 and 2006, the grant price was the fair market value of
Common Stock on the date of grant, and the options have a term of ten years.

The
fair value of each option award in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was measured on the date
of grant using a lattice-based option valuation model.
 
Expected volatilities are based on
implied volatilities from traded options on Common Stock and historical
volatility of Common Stock.
 
NS uses
historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within
the valuation model.
 
The average
expected option life is derived from the output of the valuation model and
represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be
outstanding.
 
The average risk-free
interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time
of grant.
 
For options granted that
include dividend equivalent payments, a dividend yield of zero was used.
 
For the 2008 and 2007 TSOP grants a
dividend yield of 2.29% and 1.5%, respectively, was used because no dividend
equivalent payments are made on these options.
 
The assumptions for the 2008, 2007 and
2006 LTIP and TSOP grants are shown in the following table:

At December 31, 2008, there
was $12 million of total unrecognized compensation related to stock
options granted under the LTIP and TSOP, which is expected to be recognized
over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.6 years.

Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Shares

Restricted stock unit and
restricted share grants were 299,950 and zero, respectively, in 2008, with a
grant-date fair value of $50.47 and a five-year restriction period.
 
In 2007, restricted stock unit and
restricted share grants were 321,450 and zero, respectively, with a grant-date
fair value of $50.01 and a five-year restriction period.
 
In 2006, restricted stock unit and
restricted share grants were 332,150 and 332,150, respectively, with a grant-date
fair value of $49.60 and a three-year restriction period.
 
Restricted stock units granted in 2008 and
2007 will be settled through issuance of shares of Common Stock.
 
The restricted stock unit grants include
cash dividend equivalent payments during the restriction period commensurate
with regular quarterly dividends paid on Common Stock.

to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.5 years.
 
The total fair values of the restricted
stock units paid in cash and restricted shares vested during the twelve months
ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $1 million, $22 million,
and $40 million
, respectively.
 
The total
related excess tax benefits realized were $1 million in 2008, $3 million
in 2007, and $6 million in 2006.

Performance Share Units

PSUs provide for awards based
on achievement of certain predetermined corporate performance goals (total
shareholder return, return on average invested capital and operating ratio) at
the end of a three-year cycle.
 
PSU grants
and average grant-date fair values were 1,162,600 and $50.465 in 2008; 1,203,300
and $49.555 in 2007; and 1,163,600 and $49.425 in 2006.
 
One-half of any PSUs earned will be paid
in the form of shares of Common Stock with the other half to be paid in cash.

Stock Repurchase Program

In March 2007, NS’
Board of Directors amended NS’ share repurchase program, increasing the authorized
amount of share repurchases from 50 million to 75 million shares and
shortening the term of the program from 2015 to 2010.
 
The timing and volume of purchases is
guided by management’s assessment of market conditions and other
pertinent facts.
 
Near-term
purchases under the program are expected to be made with internally generated
cash or proceeds from borrowings.
 
NS
repurchased and retired 19.4 million shares, 23.6 million shares, and
21.7 million shares of its common stock under this program in 2008, 2007,
and 2006, respectively, at a cost of $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion, and
$964 million, respectively.
 
Since
inception of this program in 2006, NS has repurchased and retired
64.7 million shares of Common Stock at a total cost of $3.3 billion.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The
fair values of “Cash and cash equivalents,” “Accounts
receivable” and “Accounts payable” approximate carrying
values because of the short maturity of these financial instruments.
 
The fair value of corporate-owned life
insurance approximates carrying value.
 

The carrying amounts and estimated fair values for the remaining
financial instruments, excluding derivatives and investments accounted for
under the equity method in accordance with APB Opinion No. 18, consisted
of the following at December 31:

The fair values of debt were estimated
based on quoted market prices or discounted cash flows using current interest
rates for debt with similar terms, company rating and remaining maturity.

Carrying amounts of marketable securities reflect
unrealized holding gains of zero on December 31, 2008 and 2007.
 
Sales of “available-for-sale”
securities were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006;
most short-term investments were redeemed at maturity during 2007.

16.
 
Derivative Financial Instruments

All
derivatives are recognized in the financial statements as either assets or
liabilities and are measured at fair value.
 
Changes in fair value are recorded as
adjustments to the assets or liabilities being hedged in “Other
comprehensive loss,” or in current earnings, depending on whether the
derivative is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting, the type of hedge
transaction represented and the effectiveness of the hedge.

NS has used derivative
financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs
and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
 
NS does not engage in the trading of derivatives.
 
Management has determined that its
derivative financial instruments qualify as either fair-value or cash-flow
hedges, having values that highly correlate with the underlying hedged
exposures, and has designated such instruments as hedging transactions.
 
Credit risk related to the derivative
financial instruments is considered to be minimal and is managed by requiring
high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements.

Diesel Fuel Hedging

From
2001 until May 2004, NS entered into heating oil contracts that hedged a
portion of its diesel fuel consumption.
 

The intent of the program was to assist in the management of NS’
aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations, which can significantly
affect NS’ operating margins and profitability, through the use of one or
more types of derivative instruments.
 

The goal of this hedging strategy
was to reduce the variability of fuel costs over an extended period of time
while minimizing the incremental cost of hedging. The program provided that NS
would not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than
36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS’ average monthly fuel
consumption would be hedged for any month within any 36-month period.
 
After taking into account the effect of
the hedging, diesel fuel costs represented 14% of NS’ operating expenses
for the year ended December 31, 2006.
 

The last remaining contracts were settled in the second quarter of 2006,
bringing an end to this program.
 
NS’
fuel hedging activity resulted in a decrease in diesel fuel expense of $20 million
in 2006.
 
Ineffectiveness, or the
extent to which changes in the fair value of the heating oil contracts did not
offset changes in the fair values of the expected diesel fuel transactions, resulted
in a $1 million expense in 2006.

Interest
Rate Hedging

NS manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates by issuing both fixed- and floating-rate debt instruments, and
by entering into interest rate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate
mix within its debt portfolio.
 
NS
had $17 million, or less than 1%, and $59 million, or about 1%, of its
fixed rate debt portfolio hedged as of December 31, 2008, and December 31,
2007, respectively, using interest rate swaps that qualify for and are
designated as fair-value hedge transactions.
 
NS’ interest rate hedging activity
resulted in decreases in interest expense of approximately $1 million for 2008,
2007, and 2006.
 
These swaps have
been effective in hedging the changes in fair value of the related debt arising
from changes in interest rates and there has been no impact on earnings
resulting from ineffectiveness associated with these derivative transactions.

Fair
Values

Fair
values of interest rate swaps at December 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007, were
determined based upon the present value of expected future cash flows
discounted at the appropriate implied spot rate from the spot rate yield
curve.
 
Fair value adjustments are
noncash transactions and, accordingly, are excluded from the Consolidated Statements
of Cash Flows.
 
The gross and net asset
position of NS’ outstanding derivative financial instruments was approximately
$1 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007.

17.
 
Commitments and Contingencies

Lawsuits

Norfolk
Southern and/or certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and
other claims relating principally to railroad operations.
 
When management concludes that it is
probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can
be reasonably estimated, it is accrued through a charge to earnings.
 
While the ultimate amount of liability
incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future
developments, in management’s opinion, the recorded liability is adequate
to cover the future payment of such liability and claims.
 
However, the final outcome of any of
these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable
or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant
to results of operations in a particular year or quarter.
 
Any adjustments to the recorded
liability will be reflected in earnings in the periods in which such
adjustments are known.

Casualty Claims

Casualty claims include
employee personal injury and occupational claims as well as third-party claims,
all exclusive of legal costs.
 
To
aid in valuing its personal injury liability and determining the amount to
accrue with respect to such claim during the year, NS’ management
utilizes studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm.
 
Job-related accidental injury and
occupational claims are subject to the Federal Employers’ Liability Act
(FELA), which is applicable only to railroads.
 
FELA’s fault-based system produces
results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault
workers’ compensation system.
 

The variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs
being different from the liability recorded.
 
While the ultimate amount of claims
incurred is dependent on future developments, in management’s opinion,
the recorded liability is adequate to cover the future payments of claims and
is supported by the most recent actuarial study.
 
In all cases, NS records a liability
when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and estimable.

In April 2008, NS settled the
lawsuit brought by Avondale Mills for claims associated with the January 6,
2005, derailment in Graniteville, SC.  The total liability related to the
derailment represents NS’ best estimate based on current facts and
circumstances.
 
The estimate
includes amounts related to business property damage and other economic
losses, personal injury and individual property damage claims, as well as
third-party response costs.
 
NS’
commercial insurance policies are expected to cover substantially all expenses
related to this derailment above the unreimbursed portion and NS’
self-insured retention, including NS’ response costs and legal fees.
 The Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect current and long-term receivables
for estimated recoveries from NS’ insurance carriers.
 
NS is engaged in arbitration with one of
its insurance carriers that failed to respond to an insurance claim submitted
by NS.
 
NS believes these expenses
are covered by the insurance policy and that recovery of any contested amount
is probable, in that NS expects the arbitrator will determine the settlement
amounts to be reasonable and that the insurer’s refusal to consent to and
to fund the settlement was a breach of contract.
 
Accordingly, NS has recorded the full
recovery attributable to such carrier ($100 million).
 
In October 2008, another of NS’
insurance carriers provided the preliminary findings of its review of NS’
reimbursement request and reported that it may dispute a portion of that
request.
 
NS has initiated
arbitration against the carrier and believes that all expenses contained in the
reimbursement request are covered by the insurance policy and that recovery is
probable.

Employee personal injury claims

– The largest component of casualties and other
claims expense is employee personal injury costs.
 
The independent actuarial firm engaged
by NS provides quarterly studies to aid in valuing its employee personal injury
liability and estimating its employee personal injury expense.
 
The actuarial firm studies NS’
historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements, taking
into account relevant outside influences.
 

The actuary uses the results of these analyses to estimate the ultimate
amount of the liability, which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted
claims.
 
NS adjusts its liability quarterly
based upon management’s assessment and the results of the study.
 
The estimate of loss liabilities is
subject to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events
such as jury decisions, court interpretations, or legislative changes and as
such the actual loss may vary from the estimated liability recorded.

Occupational claims

– Occupational claims (including asbestosis and
other respiratory diseases, as well as conditions allegedly related to
repetitive motion) are often not caused by a specific accident or event but
rather allegedly result from a claimed exposure over time.
 
Many such claims are being asserted by
former or retired employees, some of whom have not been employed in the
rail industry for decades.
 
The
independent actuarial firm provides an estimate of the occupational claims
liability based upon NS’ history of claim filings, severity, payments,
and other pertinent facts.
 
The
liability is dependent upon management’s judgments made as to the
specific case reserves as well as judgments of the consulting independent actuarial
firm in the periodic studies.
 
The
actuarial firm’s estimate of ultimate loss includes a provision for those
claims that have been incurred but not reported.
 
This provision is derived by analyzing
industry data and projecting NS’ experience into the future as far as can
be reasonably determined.
 
NS
adjusts its liability quarterly based upon management’s assessment and
the results of the study.
 
However,
it is possible that the recorded liability may not be adequate to cover the
future payment of claims.
 

Adjustments to the recorded liability are reflected in operating
expenses in the periods in which such adjustments become known.

Third-party claims

– NS records a liability for third-party claims
including those for highway crossing accidents, trespasser and other injuries,
automobile liability, property damage, and lading damage.
 
The independent actuarial firm assists
with the calculation of potential liability for third-party claims, except
lading damage, based upon NS’ experience including number and timing of
incidents, amount of payments, settlement rates, number of open claims, and
legal defenses.
 
The actuarial
estimate includes a provision for claims that have been incurred but have not
yet been reported.
 
Each quarter NS
adjusts its liability based upon management’s assessment and the results
of the study.
 
Given the inherent
uncertainty in regard to the ultimate outcome of third-party claims, it is possible
that the actual loss may differ from the estimated liability recorded.

Environmental Matters

NS
is subject to various jurisdictions’ environmental laws and
regulations.
 
It is NS’ policy
to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount
can be estimated reasonably.
 

Claims, if any, against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs
incurred by NS are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are not netted against the associated NS
liability.
 
Environmental engineers
regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in
determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates.
 
NS also has an Environmental Policy
Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its
environmental policy.

NS’
Consolidated Balance Sheets include liabilities for environmental exposures in
the amount of $42 million at December 31, 2008, and $46 million
at December 31, 2007 (of which $12 million is classified as a current
liability at December 31, 2008 and 2007).
 
At December 31, 2008, the liability
represents NS’ estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs
based on available information at 148 known locations compared with 155
locations at December 31, 2007.
 

As of December 31, 2008, 13 sites accounted for $22 million of the
liability, and no individual site was considered to be material.
 
NS anticipates that much of this
liability will be paid out over five years; however, some costs will be paid out
over a longer period.

At 30 locations, one or more Norfolk Southern subsidiaries,
usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been identified as
potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or
similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which
often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs.

With respect to known environmental sites (whether
identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of
NS’ ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the
aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely
varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely development
of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the
nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participant’s
share of any estimated loss (and that participant’s ability to bear
it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability.

The risk of incurring environmental liability
– for acts and omissions, past, present and future - is inherent in the
railroad business.
 
Some of the
commodities in NS’ traffic mix, particularly those classified as
hazardous materials, pose special risks that NS and its subsidiaries work
diligently to minimize.
 
In
addition, several NS subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating
property, or which is leased and operated by others, or held for sale.
 
Because environmental problems may exist
on these properties that are latent or undisclosed, there can be no assurance
that NS will not incur environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one
or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated
reliably at this time.
 
Moreover,
lawsuits and claims involving these and potentially other unidentified
environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time.
 
The resulting liabilities could have a
significant effect on financial position, results of operations, or liquidity
in a particular year or quarter.

On April 24, 2008, the United States Department of
Justice (DOJ) brought an action against NS for alleged violations of federal
environmental laws resulting from the discharge of chlorine and oil that
occurred as a result of the January 6, 2005, derailment in Graniteville, SC,
including claims for civil penalties as well as injunctive relief.
 
On June 24, 2008, NS filed a motion to
dismiss DOJ’s claims, contending that insufficient facts have been
alleged to support such claims.
 
NS
does not believe that the outcome of these proceedings will have a material
effect on its financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

Based on its assessment of the facts and
circumstances now known, management believes that it has recorded the
probable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which NS is
aware.
 
Further, management believes
that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the
aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS’ financial position,
results of operations, or liquidity.

Insurance

Norfolk Southern obtains on behalf of itself and its
subsidiaries insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and
first-party property damages.
 
NS is
currently self-insured up to $25 million and above $1 billion per occurrence
for bodily injury and property damage to third parties and up to $25 million
and above $175 million per occurrence for property owned by NS or in NS’
care, custody or control.

Purchase
Commitments

At December 31, 2008, NS had outstanding purchase
commitments of approximately $119 million primarily for freight cars, RoadRailer®
trailers and track material in connection with its capital programs through 2010.

Change-In-Control
Arrangements

Norfolk
Southern has compensation agreements with officers and certain key employees
that become operative only upon a change in control of Norfolk Southern, as
defined in those agreements.
 
The
agreements provide generally for payments based on compensation at the time of
a covered individual’s involuntary or other specified termination and for
certain other benefits.

Guarantees

In a number of instances, Norfolk Southern and its
subsidiaries have agreed to indemnify lenders for additional costs they may
bear as a result of certain changes in laws or regulations applicable to their
loans.
 
Such changes may include
impositions or modifications with respect to taxes, duties, reserves, liquidity,
capital adequacy, special deposits, and similar requirements relating to
extensions of credit by, deposits with, or the assets or liabilities of such
lenders.
 
The nature and timing of
changes in laws or regulations applicable to NS’ financings are
inherently unpredictable, and therefore NS’ exposure in connection with
the foregoing indemnifications cannot be quantified.
 
No liability has been recorded related
to these indemnifications.
 
In the
case of one type of equipment financing, NSR’s Japanese leveraged leases,
NSR may terminate the leases and ancillary agreements if such a change-in-law
indemnity is triggered.
 
Such a
termination would require NSR to make early termination payments that would not
be expected to have a material effect on NS’ financial position, results
of operations, or liquidity.

NS
has indemnified parties in a number of transactions for U.S. income tax
withholding imposed as a result of changes in U.S. tax law.
 
In all cases, NS has the right to unwind
the related transaction if the withholding cannot be avoided in the
future.
 
Because these indemnities
would be triggered and are dependent upon a change in the tax law, the maximum
exposure is not quantifiable.
 

Management does not believe that it is likely that it will be required
to make any payments under these indemnities.

As
of December 31, 2008, certain Norfolk Southern subsidiaries are contingently
liable as guarantors with respect to $8 million of indebtedness, due in
2019, of an entity in which they have an ownership interest, the Terminal
Railroad Association of St. Louis.
 
Four
other railroads are also jointly and severally liable as guarantors for this
indebtedness.
 
No liability has been
recorded related to this guaranty.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

Norfolk Southern’s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the assistance of
management, evaluated the effectiveness of NS’ disclosure controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a‑15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”))
as of December 31, 2008.
 
Based on such
evaluation, such officers have concluded that, as of December 31, 2008, NS’
disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in NS’ reports under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time period specified
in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the
Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

The management of Norfolk
Southern is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting.
 
Norfolk
Southern’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that pertain to its ability to record, process,
summarize, and report reliable financial data.
 
Management recognizes that there are
inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over
financial reporting, including the possibility of human error and the
circumvention or overriding of internal control.
 
Accordingly, even effective internal
control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation.
 
Further, because of changes in
conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may
vary over time.

In order to ensure that Norfolk
Southern’s internal control over financial reporting is effective,
management regularly assesses such controls and did so most recently for its
financial reporting as of December 31, 2008.
 
This assessment was based on criteria
for effective internal control over financial reporting set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

.
 
Based on our assessment, management has
concluded that Norfolk Southern maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2008.

The Board of Directors,
acting through its Audit Committee, is responsible for the oversight of Norfolk
Southern’s accounting policies, financial reporting and internal
control.
 
The Audit Committee of the
Board of Directors is comprised entirely of outside directors who are
independent of management.
 
The
independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have
full and unlimited access to the Audit Committee, with or without management,
to discuss the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, and any
other matters which they believe should be brought to the attention of the
Audit Committee.

Norfolk Southern’s
management has issued a report of its assessment of internal control over
financial reporting, and Norfolk Southern’s independent registered public
accounting firm has issued an attestation report on Norfolk Southern’s
internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008.
 
These reports appear in Part II, Item 8
of this report on Form 10-K.

During the fourth quarter
of 2008, management has not identified any changes in internal controls over
financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, NS’ internal control over financial reporting.

Norfolk Southern
Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)

Established on June 28, 1983,
and approved by stockholders at their Annual Meeting held on May 10, 1984, LTIP
was adopted to promote the success of Norfolk Southern by providing an
opportunity for non-employee directors, officers and other key employees to
acquire a proprietary interest in the Corporation.
 
On January 23, 2001, the Board of
Directors further amended LTIP and approved the issuance of an additional
5,000,000 shares of authorized but unissued Common Stock under LTIP to
participants who are not officers of Norfolk Southern.  The issuance of
these shares was broadly-based, and stockholder approval of these shares was
not required.
 
Accordingly, this
portion of LTIP is included in the number of securities available for future
issuance for plans not approved by stockholders.  Also on January 23,
2001, the Board amended LTIP, which amendment was approved by shareholders on
May 10, 2001, that included the reservation for issuance of an additional
30,000,000 shares of authorized but unissued Norfolk Southern Common
Stock.

Pursuant
to another amendment approved by stockholders on May 12, 2005, not more than 8,500,000
of the shares remaining available for issuance under LTIP may be awarded as
restricted shares, performance shares or restricted stock unit shares.
 
Cash payments of restricted stock units,
stock appreciation rights, and performance share units will not be applied
against the maximum number of shares issuable under LTIP.
 
Any shares of Common Stock subject to
options, performance share units, restricted shares or restricted stock units
which are not issued as Common Stock will again be available for award under LTIP
after the expiration or forfeiture of an award.

Non-employee
directors, officers and other key employees residing in the United States or
Canada are eligible for selection to receive LTIP awards.
 
Under LTIP, the Compensation Committee
(Committee) may grant incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options,
stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and
performance share units.
 
In
addition, dividend equivalents may be awarded for options, restricted stock
units, and performance share units. The Committee may make awards under LTIP
subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances and may establish such other terms
and conditions for the awards as provided in LTIP.

For options, the option price
per share will not be less than 100% of the fair market value of Norfolk
Southern’s Common Stock on the effective date the option is
granted.  All options are subject to a vesting period of at least one
year, and the term of the option will not exceed ten years.  LTIP
specifically prohibits option repricing without stockholder approval, except
for capital adjustments.

Performance share units
entitle a recipient to receive performance-based compensation at the end of a
three-year performance cycle based on Norfolk Southern’s performance
during that three-year period.  For the 2008 performance share unit
awards, corporate performance will be measured using three equally weighted
standards established by the Committee: (1) three-year average return on
average capital invested, (2) three-year average operating ratio, and (3)
three-year total return to stockholders as compared with the average total
return on all stocks comprising the S&P 500 composite stock price index. 
Performance share units may be payable in either shares of Norfolk Southern
Common Stock or cash.

Restricted
stock units are payable in cash or in shares of Norfolk Southern Common Stock
at the end of a restriction period of not less than 36 months and not more than
60 months.
 
During the restriction
period, the holder of the restricted stock units has no beneficial ownership
interest in the Norfolk Southern Common Stock represented by the restricted
stock units and has no right to vote the shares represented by the units or to
receive dividends (except for dividend equivalent rights that may be awarded
with respect to the restricted stock units).
 
The Committee at its discretion may waive
the restriction period.

Norfolk
Southern Corporation Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan

The
Board adopted the Norfolk Southern Corporation Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan (“TSOP”)
on January 26, 1999, to promote the success of Norfolk Southern by
providing an opportunity for nonagreement employees to acquire a proprietary interest
in Norfolk Southern and thereby to provide an additional incentive to
nonagreement employees to devote their maximum efforts and skills to the
advancement, betterment, and prosperity of Norfolk Southern and its
stockholders.
 
Under the TSOP there were
6,000,000 shares of authorized but unissued Common Stock reserved for
issuance.
 
TSOP has not been and is
not required to have been approved by stockholders.

Active full-time nonagreement employees residing in
the United States or Canada are eligible for selection to receive TSOP
awards.
 
Under TSOP, the Committee
may grant nonqualified stock options subject to such terms and conditions as
provided in TSOP.

The
option price will not be less than 100% of the fair market value of Norfolk
Southern’s Common Stock on the effective date the options are
granted.
 
All options are subject to
a vesting period of at least one year, and the term of the option will not
exceed ten years.
 
Options awarded
in 2008 are subject to a three-year vesting period.
 
TSOP specifically prohibits option
repricing without stockholder approval, except for capital adjustments.

Norfolk
Southern Corporation Directors’ Restricted Stock Plan

The
Norfolk Southern Corporation Directors’ Restricted Stock Plan (“Plan”)
was adopted on January 1, 1994, and is designed to increase ownership of
Norfolk Southern Common Stock by its non-employee directors so as to further
align their ownership interest in Norfolk Southern with that of
stockholders.
 
The Plan has not been
and is not required to have been approved by stockholders.
 
Currently, a maximum of 66,000 shares of
Norfolk Southern Common Stock may be granted under the Plan.
 
To make grants to eligible directors,
Norfolk Southern purchases, through one or more subsidiary companies, the number
of shares required in open-market transactions at prevailing market prices, or
makes such grants from Norfolk Southern Common Stock already owned by one or
more of Norfolk Southern’s subsidiary companies.

Only
non-employee directors who are not and never have been employees of Norfolk
Southern are eligible to participate in the Plan.
 
Upon becoming a director, each eligible
director receives a one-time grant of 3,000 restricted shares of Norfolk
Southern Common Stock.
 
No
individual member of the Board exercises discretion concerning the eligibility
of any director or the number of shares granted.

The
restriction period applicable to restricted shares granted under the Plan begins
on the date of the grant and ends on the earlier of the recipient’s death
or six months after the recipient ceases to be a director by reason of
disability or retirement.
 
During
the restriction period shares may not be sold, pledged, or otherwise
encumbered.
 
Directors will forfeit
the restricted shares if they cease to serve as a director of Norfolk Southern
for reasons other than their disability, retirement, or death.
