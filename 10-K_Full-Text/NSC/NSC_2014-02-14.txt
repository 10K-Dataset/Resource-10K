RAILWAY OPERATING REVENUES

–

T

otal railway operating revenues were $

11.2

billion in


.  Following is an overview of our three major market groups.

COAL

–

Coal is our largest commodity group as measured by revenues.

Revenues from coal accounted for about

23%

of our total railway operating revenues in


.

We handled

150.1

million tons

, or

1.3

million carloads,

in


, most of which originated on our lines from major eastern coal basins

,

with the balance from major western coal basins

received

via

the

Memphis and Chicago gate

ways.

Our coal franchise supports

the electric generation market, serving approximately 100 coal generation plants, as well as the export, metallurgical and industrial markets

,

primarily through direct rail and river, lake, and coastal facilities, including various terminals on the Ohio River

,

Lambert’s

Point in Norfolk, Virginia,

the Port of Baltimore, and Lake Erie.

See the discussion o

f coal revenues and tonnage

, by type of coal, in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

GENERAL MERCHANDISE

–

Our general merchandise market group

is composed of five major commodity groupings:

•

Chemicals

includes sulfur and related chemicals, petroleum products

(including crude oil)

, chlorine and bleaching compounds, plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals,

and

chemi

cal wastes

.

•

A

griculture, consumer products, and government includes soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizer,

livestock

and poultry feed, food oils, flour, beverages, canned goods, sweeteners, consumer products, ethanol,

transportation equipment,

and items for the

U.S.

military.

•

M

etals and construction includes steel, aluminum products, machinery, scrap metals, cemen

t, aggregates,

s

and

, and minerals

.

•

A

utomotive includes finished v

ehicles for BMW, Chrysler, Ford

, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Toyota

,

and Volk

swagen, and auto parts for BMW, Chrysler, Ford

, General Motors, Honda,

Hyundai,

Mazd

a, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, Toyota, and Volkswagen.

•

P

aper

, clay and forest products

includes lumber and wood products, pulp board and paper products, wood fibers, wood pulp, scrap paper, and clay.

In


,


million tons of general merchandise freight, or approximately

62%

of total general merchandise tonnage

we handled

, originated

on our lines

.

The balance of general merchandise

freight

was received from connecting carriers at interterritorial gateways.

Our

p

rincipal interchange points for received freight

included

Chicago,

New Orleans, East St. Louis, Memphis, Detroit, Kansas City, Buffalo, Toledo, and Meridian

.

General merchandise carloads handled in


were

2.4

million, the revenues from which accounted for

56%

of

our

total railway operating revenues.

See the discussion of

general merchandise revenues

by commodity group in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

INTERMODAL

–

Our

intermodal market

group

consists of shipments moving in trailers, domestic and international containers, and RoadRailer® equipment.

These shipments are handled on behalf of intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, truckers, and other shippers.

Intermodal units handled in


were

3.6

million, the revenues from which accounted for

21%

of

our

total railway operating revenues.

See th

e discussion of intermodal revenues

in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

FREIGHT RATES

–

P

rivate contracts and exempt price quotes

are our

predominant pricing mechanisms.

Thus, a major portion of our freight business is not economically regulated by the

federal

governm

ent.

In general, market forces

are the primary determinant of rail service prices.

In


,

our

railroads were found by the

U.S. Surface Transportation Board (

STB

), the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices,

to be “revenue adequate”

on an annual basis

based on results for the year


.

The STB has not made its revenue adequacy determination for the year


.

A railroad is “revenue adequate” on an annual basis under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry’s composite cost of capital.

This determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement.

Microwave System

–

Our

microwave system, consisting of approximately

radio route miles,


core stations,


secondary stations, and five

passive repeater stations, provides communications be

tween most operating locations.  We use the microwave system

primarily for voice communications, VHF radio control circuits, data and facsimile transmissions, traffic control operations, and AEI data transmissions.

Traffic Control

–

Of the approximately

16,500

route miles

we

dispatch, about

11,025

miles are signalized, including

8,200

miles of centralized traffic control (CTC) and

2,825

miles of automatic block signals.

Of the

8,200

miles of CTC, approximately

6,836

miles are controlled by data radio originating at


base station radio sites.

Computers

–

A computer network consisting of a centralized production and backup data center

near

Atlanta, Georgia, and various distributed computers throughout the company connects the yards, terminals, transportation offices, rolling stock repair points, sales offices, and other key system locations.

Operating and traffic data are processed and stored to provide customers with information on their shipments throughout the system.

Computer systems provide current information on the location of every train and each car on line, as well as related waybill and other train and car movement data.

In addition,

our

computer systems assist

us

in the performance of a

K


variety of functions and services

,

including payroll, car and revenue accounting, billing,

sourcing, inventory

management activities and controls, and special studies.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

–

Compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is

one our

principal goal

s

.

To date, such compliance

has not had a material effect on our financial position, results of operations

, liquidity, or competitive position.

See “Legal Proceedings,” Part I, Item 3; “Personal Injury, Environmental, and Legal Liabilities” in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

–

In addition to environmental, safety, securities, and other regulations generall

y applicable to all business, our

railroads are subject to regulation by the STB.

The STB has jurisdiction over some rates, routes, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines.

The STB also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers.

The Federal Railroad Administration

(FRA)

regulates certain track and mechanical equipment standards.

The relaxation of economic regulation of railroads, following the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, included exemption from STB regulation of the rates and most service terms for intermodal business (trailer-on-flat-car, container-on-flat-car), rail boxcar shipments, lumber, manufactured steel, automobiles, and certain bulk commodities such as sand, gravel, pulpwood, and wood chips for paper manufacturing.  Further, all shipments that we have under contract are effectively removed from regulation for the duration of the contract.  About 88% of our revenues comes from either exempt shipments or shipments moving under transportation contracts; the remainder comes from shipments moving under public tariff rates.

Efforts

have been made over the past several years

to re-subject the rail industry to increased federal economic regulation

,

and such efforts are expected to continue in 201


.

The Staggers Rail Act of 1980

substantially balanced

the interests of shippers and rail carriers

,

and

encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate, invest in their infrastructure, and compete for business, thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry.

Accordingly,

we

will continue to oppose efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation.

Government regulations concerning the safety and security of our railroads are discussed within the “Security of Operations” section contained herein.

COMPETITION

–

There is continuing strong competition among rail, water, and highway carriers.

Price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company. Inventory carrying costs, service reliability, ease of handling, and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations, especially for higher-valued finished goods, machinery, and consumer products.

Even for raw materials, s

emi-finished goods, and work-in-

progress, users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages.

K


Our

primary rail competitor is CSX

Corporation

; both

railroads

operate throughout much of the same territory.

Other railroads also operate in parts of the territory.

We

also compete with motor carriers, water carriers, and with shippers who have the additional options of handling their own goods in private carriage, sourcing products from different geographic areas, and using substitute products.

Certain marketing strategies among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable

railroads

to compete more effectively in specific markets.

SECURITY OF OPERATIONS

–

We

continue to take measures

to provide enhanced s

ecurity for our rail system.

Our

comprehensive security plan is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the Association of American Railroads (AAR) post September 11, 2001.

The AAR Security Plan defines four Alert Levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry as

a

terrorist threat increases or decreases.

The Alert Level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas:

(1) operations (including transportation, engineering, and mechanical); (2) information technology and communications; and, (3) railroad police.

Although security concerns preclude public disclosure of its contents,

our

System

Security Plan outlines the protocol within

our company

for all concerned to be notified of AAR Alert Level changes.

All

of our

Operations Division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers, as appropriate, of any change in Alert Level and any additional responsibilities they may incur due to such change.

Our

plan also effectively addresses and complies with

U.S.

Department of Transportation

(DOT)

security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials.

As part of the plan, security awareness training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety, and this training is integrated into recurring hazardous material training and re-certification programs.

Toward that end,

we

, working closely with the National Transit Institute at Rutgers University, developed a four-module uniform national training program.

We

ha

ve

also

worked with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in developing other industry training programs.

More in-depth security training has been given to select employees

of ours

who have been given specific security responsibilities, and additional, location-specific security plans

are in place

for certain metropolitan areas and each of

the

six port facilities

we

serve.

With respect to the ports, each facility plan has been approved by the applicable Captain of the Port and

remains

subject to inspection by the U.S. Coast Guard.

Additionally,

we

continue to

engage in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the TSA, the Federal Bureau o

f Investigation (FBI), the FRA

, the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and various state Homeland Security offices.

As one notable example,

one of our

Police Special Agent

s

in Charge (SAC), under the auspices of the AAR,

continues to serve at

the National Joint Terrorism Task Force (NJTTF) operated by the FBI, and located at the National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC) in Arlington, V

irginia

to represent and serve as liaison to the North American rail industry.

This arrangement improves logistical flow of vital security and law enforcement information with respect to the rail industry as a whole, while

having the post filled by one of our

SAC

s also serves

to foster a strong working relationship between

us

and the FBI.

We

also

are

a member of the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) prog

ram sponsored by U.S. Customs.

C-TPAT allows

us

to work closely with U.S. Customs and

our

customers to develop measures that will help ensure the integrity of freight shipments moving on

our railroads

, particularly those moving to or from a foreign country.

Based on participation in C-TPAT,

we

ha

ve

ensured that

our

plan meets all current applicable security recommendations made by U.S. Customs.

Similarly,

we continue to be

guided in

our

operations by various supplemental security

action items issued by DHS and

DOT, U.S. Coast Guard Maritime Security requirements, as well as voluntary security action items developed in collaboration with TSA, DOT, and the freight railroads. Many of the action items are based on lessons learned from DHS and DOT security assessments of rail corridors in High Threat Urban Areas (HTUA). Particular attention is aimed at reducing risk in HTUA by:

(1) the establishment of secure storage areas for rail

K


cars carrying toxic-by-inhalation (TIH) materials; (2) the expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying TIH materials; (3) the minimization of unattended loaded tank cars carrying TIH materials; and (4) cooperation with federal, state, local and tribal governments to identify, through risk assessments, those locations where security risks are the highest.

These action items and

our

compliance initiatives are outlined in the vario

us departmental sections of our

System

Security Plan.

We

ha

ve

taken appropriate actions to be compliant with the TSA Final Security Rule addressing Rail Security Sensitive Materials (RSSM) to ensure these shipments are properly inspected and that positive chain-of-custody is maintained when required.

We are

in compliance with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) rail-routing regulations outlined in Docket HM-232E.

We

conduct ongoing route evaluations.

In 2011,

as part of the FRA’s bi-annual review,

this metho

dology and selected routes were

found to be compliant with the regulation

.  The next review by the FRA is expected mid-year 2014.

In


, through participation in the Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response (TRANSCAER) Program,

we

provided rail accident response training to approximately

4,900

emergency responders, such as local police and fire personnel

. Our other training efforts throughout


included participation in


drills for local, state, and federal agencies.

We

also ha

ve

ongoing programs to sponsor local emergency responders at the Security and Emergency Response Training Course conducted at the AAR Transportation Technology Center in Pueblo, Colorado.

Improvements in equipment design also are expected to play a role in enhancing rail security.

PHMSA, in coordination with the FRA,

has

amend

ed

the Hazardous Materials Regulations to prescribe enhanced safety for rail transportation of TIH materials,

has provided

interim design standards for railroad tank cars.

The rule mandates commodity-specific improvements in safety features and design standards for newly manufactured DOT specification tank cars and an improved top fittings performance standard.

The interim standards established in this rule will enhance the accident survivability of TIH tank cars.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

We are

subject to significant governmental legislation and regulation over commercial, operating and environmental matters.

Railroads are subject to the enactment of laws by Congress that could increase economic regulation of the industry.

Railroads presently are subject to commercial regulation by the

Surface Transportation Board (

STB

)

, which has jurisdiction over some rates

,

routes, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines.

The STB also has jurisdiction over

the

c

onsolidation, merger, or acquisition

of control of and by

rail common carriers.

Additional economic regulation of the rail industry by Congre

ss or the STB, whether under new or existing laws, could have a significant negative impact on

our

ability to determine prices for rail services and result in a material adverse effect in the future on

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

This potential material adverse effect could also result in reduced capital spending on

our

rail network or abandonment of lines.

Railroads are subject to safet

y and security regulation by

the U.S.

Department of Transportation and

the

U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which regulate most aspects of

our

operations.

Compliance with the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 will result in additional operating costs associated with the statutorily mandated implementation of positive train control by 2015.

In addition to increased capital expenditures, implementation may result in reduced operational efficiency and service levels, as well as increased compensation and benefits expenses, and increased claims and litigation costs.

Our

operations are subject to extensive federal and state environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air; discharges to waterways or groundwater supplies; handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and other materials; and the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases.

The risk of incurring environmental liability

–

for acts and omissions, past, present, and future

–

is inherent in the railroad business.

This risk includes property owned by

us

, whether currently or in the past, that is or has been subject to a variety of uses, including

our

railroad operations and other industrial activity by past owners or

our

past and present tenants.

K


Environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, and

we

could incur environmental liabilities or costs, the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time, with respect to one or more of these properties.

Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time, and the resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

A

s a common carrier by rail,

we

must offer to transport hazardous materials, regardless of risk.

T

ransportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury and property

(including environmental) damage

, and compromise critical parts of our rail network.

A catastrophic rail accident involving hazardous materials could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity to the extent not covered by insurance.  We have obtained insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and first-party property damages; however, insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or, if available, may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us.

We

may be affected by terrorism or war.

Any terrorist attack, or other similar event, any government response thereto, and war or risk of war could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

Because

we

play a critical role in the nation’s transportation system,

we

could become the target of such an attack or have a significant role in the government’s preemptive approach or response to an attack or war.

Although

we

currently maintain insurance coverage for third-party liability arising out of war and acts of terrorism,

we

maintain only limited insurance coverage for first-party property damage and damage to property in

our

care, custody, or control caused by certain acts of terrorism.

In addition, premiums for some or all of

our

current insurance programs covering these losses could increase dramatically, or insurance coverage for certain losses could be unavailable to

us

in the future.

We

may be affected by general economic conditions.

Prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions affecting the producers and consumers of the commodities

we

carr

y

may have an adverse effect on

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity

in a particular year or quarter

.

Economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more large customers could have a significant impact on

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

We

may be affected by climate change legislation or regulation.

Concern over climate change has led to significant federal, state, and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Moreover, even without such legislation or regulation, government incentives and adverse publicity relating to GHGs could affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry.

Restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on GHG emissions, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase

our

operating costs, decrease the amount of traffic handled, and decrease the value of coal reserves

we own

, and thus could have an adverse effect on

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity

in a particular year or quarter

.

Such restrictions could affect

our

customers that (1) use commodities that

we

carr

y

to produce energy, including coal, (2) use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities

we

carr

y

, or (3) manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy.

We

face competition from other transportation providers.

We are

subject to competition

from motor carriers, railroads

and

,

to a lesser extent, ships, barges, and pipelines, on the basis of tr

ansit time, pricing, and

quality and reliability of service.

While

we

ha

ve

used primarily internal resources to build or acquire and maintain

our

rail system, trucks and barges have been able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities.

Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in which

we

operate, or legislation granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations, could have a material adverse effect on

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

K


The operations of carriers with which

we

interchange may adversely affect

our

operations.

Our

ability to provide rail service to customers in the U.S. and Canad

a depends in large part upon our

ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to, among other matters, freight rates, revenue division, car supply and locomotive availability, data exchange and communications, reciprocal switching, interchange, and trackage rights. Deterioration in the operations of or service provided by connecting carriers, or in

our

relationship with those connecting carriers, could result in

our

inability to meet

our

customers’ demands or require

us

to use alternate train routes, which could result in significant additional costs and network inefficiencies.

We

rel

y

on technology and technology improvements in

our

business operations.

If

we

experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of

our

information technology systems, including computer hardware, software, and communications equipment,

we

could experience a service interruption,

a

security breach, or other operational difficulties

.

Additionally, if

we

do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or

we

are

unable to implement new technology,

we

may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service

.  Any of these factors

could have a material adverse effect on

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

The vast majority of

our

employees belong to labor unions, and labor agreements, strikes, or work stoppages could adversely affect

our operations.

More than

80% of

our

railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions.

If unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown,

we

could experience a significant disruption of

our

operations.

Additionally, future national labor agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, could significantly increase

our

costs for healthcare, wages, and other benefits.

Any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

We

may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.

The nature of

our

business exposes

us

to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, commercial disputes, freight loss and other property damage, and other matters.

Job-related personal injury and occupational claims are subject to the Federal Employer’s Liability Act (FELA), which is applicable only to railroads. FELA’s fault-based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault worker’s compensation system.

The variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded.

Any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving any or all of freight loss  property damage, personal injury, and environmental liability could have a

material adverse effect on our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity to the extent not covered by insurance.

We

ha

ve

obtained insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and first-party property damages.

Specified levels of risk are retained on a self-insurance basis (currently

up to $50 million and above $1 billion per occurrence

and/or policy year

for bodily injury and property damage to third parties and up to $25 million and above $175 million per occurrence

and/or policy year

for property owned by us or in our care, custody, or control).

Insurance is available from a

limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or, if available, may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to

us

.

Severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures.

Severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena, including hurricanes, floods, fires, and earthquakes, may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs, increased liabilities, and decreased revenues, which could have an adverse effect on

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

Unpredictability of demand for rail services resulting in the unavailability of qualified personnel could adversely affect

our

operational efficiency and ability to meet demand.

Workforce demographics, training requirements, and the availability of qualified personnel, particularly engineers and trainmen, could each have a

K


negative impact on

our

ability to meet demand for rail service.

Unpredictable increases in demand for rail services may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on

our

operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

We

may be affected by supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of some of

our

supplier markets.

We consumed 477

million gallons of diesel fuel in


.

Fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations.

A

severe fuel supply shortage

arising

from production curtailments, increased demand in existing or emerging foreign markets, disruption of oil imports, disruption of domestic refinery production, damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure, political unrest, war or other factors,

could have a material adverse effect on our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

Also, such an event

c

ould impact

us

as well as

our

customers and other transportation companies.

Due to the capital intensive nature and industry-specific requirements of the rail industry, high barriers of entry

exist

for potential new suppliers of core railroad items, such as locomotives and rolling stock

equipment.

Additionally,

we

compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of certain track materials, such as rail and ties.

Changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited-supplier markets could result in increased prices or

significant

shortages of materials that could have a material

adverse e

ffect on

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

The state of capital markets could adversely affect

our

liquidity.

F

rom time-to-time

we

rel

y

on the capital markets to provide some of

our

capital requirements, including the issuance of long-term debt instruments and commercial paper, as well as the sale of certain receivables.

Significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including the credit markets, or deterioration of

our

financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or eliminate

our

access to, and/or significantly increase the cost of, various financing sources, including bank credit facilities and issuance of corporate bonds.

Instability or disruptions of the capital markets and deterioration of

our

financial condition, alone or in combination, could also result in a reduction in

our

credit rating to below investment grade, which could prohibit or restrict

us

from accessing external sources of short- and long-term debt financing and/or significantly increase the associated costs.

Item 3. Legal

Proceedings

On November 6, 2007, various antitrust class actions filed against

us and other Class I

railroads in various Federal district courts regarding fuel surcharges were consolidated in the District of Columbia by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation.

On June

21, 2012, the court certified the case as a class action.  The defendant railroads appealed this certification, and on August 9, 2013, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia vacated the District Court’s decision and remanded the case for further consideration.  We believe the allegations in the complaints are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the cases.

We

do not believe the outcome of these proceedings will have a material effect on

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

A lawsuit containing similar allegations against

us

and four other major railroads that was filed on March 25, 2008, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff subject to a tolling agreement entered into in August 2008

, and most recently extended in August 2013

.

We received a Notice of Violation (NOV) issued by the Tennessee Department of Environmental Conservation concerning soil runoff in connection with construction of the Memphis Regional Intermodal Facility in Rossville, Tennessee.  Although we will contest liability and the imposition of any penalties, we describe this matter here consistent with SEC rules and requirements concerning governmental proceedings with respect to environmental laws and regulations.  We do not believe that the outcome of this proceeding will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Norfolk Southern Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and the Selected Financial Data.

OVERVIEW

We are one of the nation’s premier transportation companies.  Our Norfolk Southern Railway Company subsidiary operates approximately

20,000

miles of road in


states and the District of Columbia, serves every major container port in the eastern United States, and provides efficient connections to other rail carriers.  We operate the most extensive intermodal network in the East and are a major transporter of coal, automotive, and industrial products.

Our net income increased

9%

in


, compared with


, and earnings per share improved

12%

, reflecting improved operating results, a large gain from a nonoperating transaction, and share repurchases.  Higher revenues and increased network efficiencies improved our

railway operating ratio (a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed

by operating expenses) from

71.7%

in


to

71.0%

in

the current year

.

Cash provided by operating activities totaled $

3.1

billion

, which

along with proceeds from borrowings

and cash on hand,

allowed for property additions,

dividends,

share repurchases,

and debt

repayments. During


,

we repurchased

8.3

million shares of Common Stock

at

a total cost of $


m

illion. Since inception of

our

stock repurchase program in 2006,

we have

repurchased and retired

136.7

million shares of Common Stock at a total cost of $

8.1

billion. At December 31,


, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $

1.6

b

illion.

In


,

we

expect revenues to increase, reflecting higher volumes.

We

will

continue to focus on safety,

cost control, productivity, s

ervice levels

,

operational efficiency, and a

n ongoing

market-based approach to pricing.

Many of our negotiated fuel surcharges for coal and industrial products shipments are based on the monthly average price of West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil (WTI Average Price). These surcharges are reset the first day of each calendar month based on the WTI Average Price for the second preceding calendar month. This two-month lag in applying WTI Average Price decreased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately $

Two of our customers, DuPont and Sunbelt Chlor Alkai Partnership (“Sunbelt”), have rate reasonableness complaints pending before

the

Surface Transportation Board (

STB

)

alleging that

our

tariff rates for transportation of regulated

movements are unreasonable.

We dispute

th

allegation

s.

Since June 1, 2009,

in the case of DuPont, and April 1, 2011, in the case of Sunbelt, we

ha

ve

been billing and collecting amounts based on the challenged tariff rates.

We

presently expect resolution of the

to occur in 201


and believe the estimate of reasonably possible loss will not have a material effect on

our

Utility coal

tonnage

was down

4%

in


as compared to


.  Utility coal shipments in our southern region decreased due to lower demand as utility stockpiles remained high and natural gas prices remained low.  This decrease was partially offset by increased shipments in our northern region as higher coal burn necessitated stockpile replenishments to maintain targeted levels.

In


, utility coal tonnage

dropped

17%

, compared with


, reflecting competition from low natural gas prices and reduced electrical demand in NS-served regions.  Additional tonnage declines resulted from plant closures and maintenance.

For


, we expect utility coal tonnage to

de

cre

ase driven by continued weak demand as well as the loss of a contract.

Export coal

tonnage in

creased

1%

in

,

whereas volume through

Baltimore increased

0.3

Other export coal volume increased 0.8 million tons.

For


, export coal tonnage is expected to

K


Domestic metallurgical coal

tonnage

was down

omestic metallurgical coal

tonnage was down 5% compared with 2011, as declines in coke and iron ore shipments (primarily due to the plant closure) offset improved domestic steel production experienced in the first half of 2012.

in average revenue per unit that resulted from

the negative effect of the changes in mix due to increased crude oil shipments.

The volume

improvement

was primarily

the

result of

more carloads of crude oil from the Bakken and Canadian oil fields.  Additionally, there were more carloads of liquefied petroleum gas in the Utica Shale region

.

In

s

grew

7%

, compared with

increase in

average revenue per unit that resulted from higher rates and fuel surcharges.  The volume improvement was largely the result

of

more carloads of crude oil from the Bakken and Canadian oil fields.  Additionally, there were more carloads of liquefied petroleum gas, as well as higher shipments of plastics driven by greater demand for plastic bottles.  These increases were offset in part by fewer shipments of rock salt as a mild winter resulted in higher inventory levels throughout 2012

.

For


, chemicals revenues are anticipated to increase

,

largely

a result of more shipments of crude oil and asphalt.

Agriculture, consumer products, and government

revenues

in

creased

1%

in


, compared with


,

as a

2%

improvement in average revenue per unit (reflecting pricing improvements that were slightly offset by a negative change in mix related to the increase of lower-rated shorter-haul movements of corn) was partially offset by a slight decline in volume.  The volume decline was driven by reduced shipments of soybeans and related products caused by tightened supplies of domestic beans and a strong South American crop, in addition to fewer revenue movements of empty equipment.  Carload volume declines were partially offset by higher shipments of food oils as we handled new business with existing customers and more biodiesel carloads in advance of the anticipated elimination of the biodiesel tax credit.  We also hauled more shipments of fertilizer due to a strong farm economy and increased planting activity.

K


In


, agriculture, consumer products, and government revenues

were relatively flat

, compared with


,

as higher average revenue per unit was offset by lower volume.  The volume decline was driven by reduced corn shipments (due to plant closures), fewer carloads of fertilizer (led by certain network classification changes), and reduced shipments of wheat to the eastern U.S. (due to customer sourcing changes).  These volume declines were offset in part by more shipments of soybean and soybean meal due to a poor South American bean crop, as well as higher shipments of corn-based feed to Texas.

For


, agriculture, consumer products, and government revenues are expected to improve as a result of higher average revenue per unit

offset in part by a slight decrease in volume.  The projected decline in volume is based primarily on fewer shipments of

corn, as we anticipate that strong local production will prompt customer sourcing changes, as well as reduced shipments of wheat feed, with a partial offset by anticipated market share growth in perishables, beverages, and consumer products.

Metals and construction

revenues increased

5%

in


, compared with


.

The revenue improvement resulted from

6%

higher average reve

nue per unit, which reflected the positive change in mix of business as we transported higher-rated shipments of slag and fractionating sand for natural gas drilling, higher rates, and increased fuel surcharges.  Although we moved more slag and fractionating carloads, v

olume

declined modestly as we handled reduced shipments of iron and steel (driven by fewer import slabs and a steel plant closure during the third quarter of 2012) and scrap metal (a result of weakening demand).

In


, metals and construction revenues increased

8%

, compared with


.  The improvement resulted from

7%

higher average revenue per unit, which reflected higher rates and fuel surcharges.  Volume improved

1%

, the result of more coil steel shipments driven by increased automotive production.  The mild winter weather experienced in early and late 2012 led to more shipments of cement for construction projects.  There were also higher shipments of fractionating sand for natural gas drilling.  These increases were partially offset by fewer aggregates carloads, primarily driven by weak market conditions in road/highway construction, and as lower coal utility burn led to fewer shipments of scrubber stone.

For


, metals and construction revenues are expected to

increase reflecting higher shipments of fractionating sand and other materials used for natural gas drilling, as well as additional shipments of steel used by the automotive and energy sectors.  Average revenue per unit is also anticipated to improve.

Automotive revenues

rose

10%

compared to


,

reflecting

volume due to increased

vehicle production at plants we serve and new business from existing customers (including both auto parts and finished vehicles).  Average revenue per unit improved

For


, automotive revenues are expected to

Paper, clay and forest products

revenues increased

3%

in


, compared with


, reflecting

1%

gains in both volume and average revenue per unit.  Volume increases for lumber, pulp, and pulpboard were offset by reduced demand for newsprint and paper.

In


, paper, clay, and forest products revenues increased

3%

, compared with


, reflecting a

5%

improvement in average revenue per unit due to increased rates, which more than offset the effects of a

3%

The

lower

volume was

due to reduced shipments of miscellaneous wood driven by the loss of business and fewer carloads of pulp as a result of declining export market demand.

K


For


, paper, clay, and forest produ

cts revenues are anticipated to decline as we expect reduced shipments of miscellaneous wood (due to market share loss), in addition to fewer shipments of pulp and graphic paper as demand declines, partially offset by improvements in the housing market and higher average revenue per unit.

, lower expenses for casualties and other claims more than offset higher costs for materials. Casualties and other claims

expenses includ

e

the estimates of costs related to personal injury

(PI)

, property damag

e, and environmental matters.  Over the last two years, we have experienced lower PI expenses that have been offset in part by higher environmental expenses, resulting in net benefits of $52

million in 2013 and $27

million in 2012.  The lower PI expenses have been driven by improved historical trend rates, resulting in favorable reserve adjustments for prior years’ claim amounts.  Going forward, if favorable trends continue for PI costs, we could see additional favorable adjustments, however, likely not at the levels experienced in 2013.

The de

crease in


reflected the

absence of 2011’s

unfavorable arbitration ruling discussed below and

the favorable reserve developments discussed above.  These favorable items were partially offset by

higher costs associated

with property taxes.

The Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect long-term receivables for estimated recoveries from our insurance carriers for claims associated with the January 6, 2005, derailment in Graniteville, S.C.

In the first quarter of 2011,

we

received an unfavorable ruling for an arbitration

claim with an insurance carrier

and w

ere

denied recovery of the contested portion of the claim.

As a result,

we

recorded a $43 million charge

for

the receivables associated with the contested portion of the claim and a $15 million charge for other receivables affected by the ruling for which recovery

was

no longer probable.

PI c

ases involving occupational injuries comprised about

28%

of total employee injury cases resolved and about

17%

of total employee injury payments made.

With

our

long-established commitment to safety,

we

continue to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and reduce the associated costs.

With respect to occupational injuries, which are not caused by a specific accident or event but allegedly result from a claimed exposure over time, the benefits of any existing safety initiatives may not be realized immediately.

The majority of these types of claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been actively

employed in the rail industry for decades.

The rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving job-related accidental injury and occupational claims because of the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA), which is applicable only to railroads.

FELA’s fault-based system, which covers employee claims for job-related injuries, produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault workers’ compensation system.

We

maintain substantial amounts of insurance for potential third-party liability and property damage claims.

We

also retain reasonable levels of

risk through self-insurance (

Note 16).

K


Other Income – Net

Other income – net was $


million in


, $


million in


, and $


million in


(

Note 2).

The in

crease in


reflected

a $97 million land sale gain in Michigan and higher net returns from corporate-owned life insurance (COLI), which was partially offset by lower coal royalties.

The

decline

in


reflected

fewer gains on the sale of property, decreased coal royalties, and higher interest expense (net) on uncertain tax positions offset in part by higher net returns from COLI, increased equity in the earnings of Conrail, and higher rental income.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense in


was $

1.1

billion, an effective rate of

36%

, compared

with

37%

in


and

34%

in


.

The

decrease in the rate for


was

primarily

due to tax credits that became available in 2013 as a result of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (2012 Act), enacted January 2, 2013, and favorable reductions in deferred tax expense for state law changes.

The

in

crease in the rate for


primarily

reflects the absence of 2011’s favorable resolution of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination of our 2008 return and review of certain claims for refund ($40

million) and the absence of a favorable reduction in deferred tax expense for state law changes ($28

million).

The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act, enacted in 2010, allowed 100

percent bonus depreciation for 2011 and fifty-percent bonus depreciation in 2012.  Additionally, the 2012 Act as mentioned in the paragraph above, extended fifty-percent bonus depreciation for an additional year.  While bonus depreciation does not affect our total provision for income taxes or the effective rate, the absence of bonus depreciation is expected to increase current income tax expense and the related cash outflows for the payment of income taxes in 2014 by approximately $200

million.  The 2012 Act also reinstated certain business tax credits retroactively for 2012 and for 2013, but these provisions expired at the end of 2013.

IRS examinations have been completed for all years prior to 2011.  We expect the IRS will begin auditing our 2011 and 2012 consolidated income tax returns in early 2014.

remaining

additional PTC-related property additions

to total at

670 million.

We

also expect to spend $


million on infrastructure improvements

to increase mainline capacity, accommodate business growth and provide our share of funding for various public/private partnership investments such as Crescent Corridor and the Chicago

CREATE project

.

Technology investments of $


million are planned for new or upgraded systems and computers.

The Crescent Corridor consists of a program of projects for infrastructure and other facility improvements geared toward creating a seamless, high-capacity intermodal route spanning 11 states from New Jersey to Louisiana and offering truck-competitive service along several major interstate highway corridors, including I-81, I-85, I-20,

I-40, I-59, I-78, and

I-75.

Based on the public benefits that stand to be derived in the form of highway congestion relief,

we

plan to implement certain elements of the Crescent Corridor through a series of public-private partnerships.

Currently, the Crescent Corridor has received or expects to receive a total of $


million in public capital funding commitments from the Commonwealths of Pennsylv

ania and Virginia, the S

tate of Tennessee, the federal TIGER Stimulus Program and other federal funding sources related to projects in Alabama, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and North Carolina.

With respect to the private funding component, we

currently

anticipate

spending up to $

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S.

G

enerally

A

ccepted

A

ccounting

P

rinciples

(GAAP)

requires

us

to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.

These estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, and future events are likely to occur that may require

us

to make changes to these estimates and assumptions.

Accordingly,

we

regularly review these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in the business environment, and other factors

we

believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.

We

regularly discuss the development, selection, and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of

the

Board of Directors.

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires

us

to make several

estimates and assumptions (Note

11).

These include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans’ assets, projected increases in medical costs, and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality.

In addition, the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value.

We

make these estimates based on

our

historical experience and other information that

we

deem pertinent under the circumstances (for example,

expectations of future stock marke

t performance).

We

utilize an independent actuarial consulting firm’s studies to assist

us

in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing related liabilities.

Net pension expense, which is included in “Compensation and benefits” in

the

Consolidated Statements of Income, was $


million for


.

In recording this amount,

we

assumed a long-term investment rate of return of

8.25%

, which was supported by the long-term total rate of return on plan assets since inception

, as well as our expectation of future returns

.

A one

-

percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a $


million change in pension expense.

Changes that are reasonably likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age, projected earnings, and mortality would not be expected to have a material effect on

our

net pension expense or net pension liability in the future.

The net pension liability is recorded at net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments.

We

utilize analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans are matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of high-quality

K


corporate bonds.

We

use the results of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans.

Net cost for other postretirement benefits, which is also included in “Compensation and benefits,” was $


million for


.

In recording this expense and valuing the net liability for other postretirement benefits,

we

estimated future increases in healthcare costs.

These assumptions,

along with the effect of a one-

percentage point change in them, are described in Note

11.

Properties and Depreciation

Most of

our

total assets are long-lived railway properties (Note 6).

As disclosed in Note 1, properties are depreciated using group depreciation.

The primary depreciation method for

our

asset base is group life.

Units of production is the principal method of depreciation for rail in high density corridors and for depletion of natural resources.

Remaining properties are depreciated generally using the straight-line method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives.

D

epreciation expense is based on assumptions concerning expected service lives of properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be received upon their retirement.

In developing these assumptions,

we

utilize periodic depreciation studies that are performed by an independent outside firm of consulting engineers and

approved by the

STB

.

D

epreciation studies are conducted about every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets and other roadway property.

The frequency of these studies correlates with guidelines established by the STB.

Key factors which are considered in developing average service life and salvage estimates include:

•

statistical analyses of historical retirement data and surviving asset records;

•

review of historical salvage received and current market rates;

•

review of

our

operations including expected changes in technology, customer demand, maintenance practices and asset management strategies;

•

review of accounting policies and assumptions; and

•

industry review and analysis.

The units of production depreciation rate for rail in high density corridors is derived based on consideration of annual gross ton miles as compared to the total or ultimate capacity of rail in these corridors.

Our

experience has shown that traffic density is a leading factor in determination of the expected service life of rail in high density corridors.

In developing the respective depreciation rate, consideration is also given to several rail characteristics including age, weight, condition (new or second hand) and type (curve or straight).

As a result, a composite depreciation rate is developed which is applied to the depreciable base.

We adjust our rates based on the results of these studies and implement the changes prospectively

.

These studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by the study.

Any such deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the affected class of property, a

s determined by the study.  D

epreciation expense for


totaled

$


million.

Our

composite depreciation rates for


are disclosed in Note 6; a one-tenth percentage point increase (or decrease) in these rates would have resulted in a $


million increase (or decrease) to depreciation expense.

For


, roadway depreciation rates ranged from

0.83%

to

33.3%

and equipment depreciation rates ranged from

1.40%

to

33.33%

.

When properties other than land and nonrail assets are sold or retired in the ordinary course of business, the cost of the assets, net of sale proceeds or salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized in earnings.

Actual historical cost values are retired when available, such as with equipment assets.

The use of estimates in recording the retirement of certain roadway assets is necessary based on the impracticality of tracking individual asset costs.

When retiring rail, ties, and ballast,

we

use statistical curves that indicate the relative distribution of the age of the assets retired.

The historical cost of other roadway assets is

K


estimated using a combination of inflation indices specific to the rail industry and those published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The indices are applied to the replacement value based on the age of the retired assets.

These indices are used because they closely correlate with the costs of roadway assets. Gains and losses on disposal of land and nonrail assets are included in “Other income – net” (Note 2) since such income is not a product of

our

railroad operations.

A retirement is considered abnormal if it does not occur in the normal course of business, if it relates to disposition of a large segment of an asset class and if the retirement varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies, which inherently consider the impact of normal retirements on expected service lives and depreciation rates.

Gains or losses from abnormal retirements

would be recognized in earnings;

however, there were no such gains or losses in


,


, or


.

We

review

the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flow.

Assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review

would be

recorded at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value

; however, there were no such impairments in


,


, or


.

Personal Injury, Environmental, and Legal Liabilities

C

asualties and other claims

expense

, included in “Materials and other,”

total

ed $


million in


, $


million in


, and $


million in


.

Historically,

most of this expense relates to

our

accrual for personal injury liabilities

; however, over the last few years our personal injury expense has decreased due to improved historical trend rates for prior years’ claims.  Environmental expenses, which are also included in this category, have increased over the last few years as a result of unfavorable developments and more aggressive remediation strategies

.

Job-related personal injury and occupa

tional claims are subject to FELA, which is applicable only to railroads.

FELA’s fault-based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault worker’s compensation system.

The variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded.

In all cases,

we

record a liability when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and estimable.

To aid in valuing

personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue

during each period, we utilize

studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm.

For employee personal injury cases, the actu

arial firm studies our

historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements, taking into account relevant outside influences

.  We

estimate the ultimate amount of the liability, which includes amounts for inc

urred but unasserted claims,

based on the results of this analysis.

For occupational injury claims

, the actuarial firm studies our

history of claim filings, severity, payments and other relevant facts.

Additionally,

our

estimate of the ultimate loss for occupational injuries includes a provision for those claims that have been incurred but not reported by projecting

our

experience into the future as far as can be reasonably determined.

We have

recorded this actuarially determined liability. The liability is dependent upon many individual judgments made as to the specific case reserves

,

as well as

our and

the

actuarial firm’s

judgments in the periodic studies. Accordingly, there could be significant changes in the liability, which

we

would recognize wh

en such a change became known.  W

hile the liability recorded is supported by the most recent study, it is possible that the ultimate liability could be higher or lower.

We are

subject to various jurisdictions’ environmental

laws and regulations.

We

record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably (Note 16).

Claims, if any, against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs

we’ve

incurred, are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are not n

etted against the associated l

iability.

Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates.

We

ha

ve

an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret

our

environmental policy.

K


Operating expenses for environmental matters totaled $


million in


, $


million in


, and

$


million in


, and property additions for environmental matters totaled

$


million in


,

$


million in


, and $


million in


.

Property additions for environmental matters in


are expected to be about $


million.

Our

Cons

olidated Balance Sheets include

liabilities for environmental exposures

of $


million at December 31,


, and $


million at December 31,


(of which $


million is classifi

ed as a current liability at December

31,


and $12 million at

December 31,


).

At December 31,


, the liability represents

our

estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at


known locations and projects.

As of that date,

ten

sites accounted for $


million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material.

We

anticipate that much of this liability will be paid out over

five

years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period.

At


locations, one or more

of our

subsidiaries in conjunction

with a number of other parties

have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes that impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs.

We

calculate

our

estimated liability for these sites based on facts and legal defenses applicable to each site and not solely on the basis of the potential for joint liability.

With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by

us

or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of

our

ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques,

unpredictable contaminant recovery and reduction rates associated with available cleanup technologies, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participant’s share of any estimated loss (and that participant’s ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability.

We

estimate

our

environmental remediation liability on a site-by-site basis,

using assumptions and judgments we

dee

m

appropriate for each site.

As a result, it is not practical to quantitatively describe the effects of changes in these ma

ny assumptions and judgments.

We

ha

ve

consistently applied

our

methodology of estimating

our

environmental liabilities.

Based on

the

assessment of facts and circumstances now known,

we

believe

we have

recorded the probable and reasonably estimable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which

we are

aware.

Further,

we

believe that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

We

and/or certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations.

When

we

conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, it is accrued through a charge to e

arnings

.

While the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on futu

re developments, in our

opinion,

the

recorded liability is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims.

However, the final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter.

Any adjustments to the recorded liability will be reflected in earnings in the periods in which such adjustments are known.

K


Income Taxes

Our

net long-term deferred tax liability totaled $

8.5

billion at December 31,


(

Note 3).

This liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements.

After application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in

our

income tax returns.

For state income and other taxes, judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions. A valuation all

owance is recorded if we

expect that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized.

We

had a $


million valuation allowance on $


m

illion of deferred tax assets as of December 3

1,


, r

eflecting the expectation that almost all of these assets will be realized.

In addition,

we

ha

ve

a recorded liability for

our

estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.

Judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and, if so, judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing

authority.

We believe

this liability for uncertain tax positions to be adequate.

Income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded.

For every one half percent change in the


effective tax rate, net income would have changed by $


million.

OTHER MATTERS

Labor Agreements

More than

80%

of

our

railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions.

These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act.  We

largely bargain nationally in concert with other major railroads, represented by the National Carriers Conference Committee (NCCC). Moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and unions may propose changes

to the agreements

.

We and t

he

NCCC have concluded the round of bargaining that began in November 2009 and reached agreements that extend through December

31, 2014 with all applicable labor unions.  With regard to the Wheelersburg (Ohio) Terminal workers who are represented by the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division (BMWED), negotiations are ongoing and mediation under the auspices of the National Mediation Board is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2014.

M

arket Risks

We manage

overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed- and floating-rate debt instruments. At December 31,


, debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled $


million. A

one-percentage

point increase in interest rates would increase total annual interest expense related to all variable debt by approximately $


million.

We

consider it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

Inflation

In preparing financial statements,

GAAP

require

s

the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property.

As

a capital-intensive company,

we have

most of

our

capital invested in such property.

The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Norfolk Southern Corporation:

We have audited Norfolk Southern Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,


, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated

Framework

(1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Norfolk Southern Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Norfolk Southern Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,


, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

(1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Norfolk Southern Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31,

Norfolk Southern Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The following Notes are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

Norfolk Southern Corporation is a Virginia-based holding company engaged principally in the rail transportation business

, operating approximately

20,000

miles of road

primarily in the East and Midwest.

These consolidated financial statements include Norfolk Southern Corporation (Norfolk Southern) and its majority-owned and controlled subsidia

ries (collectively, NS

, we, us, and our).

Norfolk Southern’s

major subsidiary is Norfolk Southern Railway Company (NSR).

All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

NSR and its railroad subsidiaries transport raw materials, intermediate products and finished goods classified in the following

commodity

groups (percent of total railway operating revenues in


):

coal (

23%

); intermodal (

21%

); chemicals (

15%

); agriculture/consumer products/government (

13%

); metals/construction (

12%

); automotive (

9%

); and, paper/clay/forest products (

7%

).

Although most of

our

customers are domestic, ultimate points of origination or destination for some of the products transported (particularly coal bound for export and some intermodal containers) may be outside the U.S.

More than

80%

of

our

railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor

union

s.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with

U

.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)

requires

us

to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

We

periodically

review our

estimates, including those related to the recoverability and useful lives of assets, as well as liabilities for litigation, environmental remediation, casualty claims, income taxes and pension and other postretirement benefits.

Changes

in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Transportation revenue is recognized proportionally as a shipment moves from origin to destination

,

and related expenses are recognized as incurred.

Refunds (which are primarily volume-based incentives) are recorded as a reduction to revenues on the basis of management’s best estimate of projected liability, which is based on hist

orical activity, current shipment

counts and the expectation of future activity.

We regularly monitor

our

contract refund liability and, historically, the estimates have not differed significantly from the amounts ultimately refunded.

Switching, demurrage and other incidental service revenues are recognized when the services are performed.

Cash Equivalents

“Cash equivalents” are highly liquid investments purchased three months or less from maturity.

K


Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Our

allowance for doubtful accounts was

$


million at

both

December 31,


and


.

To determine

our

allowance for doubtful accounts,

we evaluate

historical loss experience (which has not been significant), the characteristics of current accounts, and general economic conditions and trends.

Materials and Supplies

“Materials and supplies,” consisting mainly of fuel oil and items for maintenance of property and equipment, are stated at the lower of average cost or market.

The cost of materials and supplies expected to be used in property additions or improvements is included in “Properties.”

Investments

Debt securities classified as “held-to-maturity” are reported at amortized cost.

Investments where

we have

the ability to exercise sig

nificant influence over but do

not control the entity are accounted for using the equity method, whereby the investment is carried at the cost of the acquisition plus

our

equity in undistributed earnings or losses since acquisition.

Properties

“Properties” are stated principally at cost and are dep

reciated using the group method

whereby assets with similar characteristics, use, and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes and depreciated using a composite depreciation rate.

This methodology treats each asset class as a pool of resources, not as singular items.

We use

more than 60 depreciable asset classes.

The p

rimary depreciation method for our

asset base is group life.

Units of production is the principal method of depreciation for rail in high density corridors and for depletion of natural resources (Note 2).

Remaining properties are depreciated generally using the straight-line method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives.

Depreciation in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows includes both depreciation and depletion.

D

epreciation expense is based on

our

assumptions concerning expected service lives of

our

properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be received upon their retirement.

In developing these assumptions,

we utilize

periodic depreciation studies that are performed by an independent outside firm of consulting engineers and approved by the Surface Transportation Board (S

TB)

.

Our

depreciation studies are conducted about every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets and other roadway property.

The frequency of these studies is consistent with guidelines established by the STB.

Key factors which are considered in developing average service life and salvage estimates include:

•

statistical analysis of historical retirement data and surviving asset records;

•

review of historical salvage received and current market rates;

•

review of

our

operations including expected changes in technology, customer demand, maintenance practices and asset management strategies;

•

review of accounting policies and assumptions; and

•

industry review and analysis.

The units of production depreciation rate for rail in high density corridors is derived based on consideration of annual gross ton miles as compared to the total or ultimate capacity of rail in these corridors.

Our

experience has shown that traffic density is a leading factor in determination of the expected service life of rail in high density corridors.

In developing the respective depreciation rate, consideration is also given to several rail characteristics

K


including age, weight, condition (new or second hand) and type (curve or straight).

As a result, a composite depreciation rate is developed which is applied to the depreciable base.

We adjust our rates based on the results of these studies and implement the changes prospectively.

The studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by the study.

Any such deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the affected class of property, as determined by the study.

For


, roadway depreciation rates ranged from

0.83%

to

33.3%

and equipment depreciation rates ranged from

1.40%

to

33.33%

.

We capitalize

interest on major

projects during the period of their construction.

Expenditures, including

those on leased assets,

that extend an asset

’

s useful life or increase its utility, are capitalized.

Expenditures capitalized include those that are directly related to a capital project and may include materials, labor and equipment, in addition to an allocable portion of indirect costs that clearly relate to a particular project. Due to the capital intensive nature of the railroad industry, a significant portion of annual capital spending relates to the replacement of self-constructed assets. Because removal activities occur in conjunction with replacement, removal costs are estimated based on an average percentage of time employees replacing assets spend on removal functions.

Costs related to repairs and maintenance activities that do not extend an asset’s useful life or increase its utility are expensed when such repairs are performed.

When properties other than land and nonrail assets are sold or retired in the ordinary course of business, the cost of the assets, net of sale proceeds or salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized in earnings.

Actual historical cost values are retired when available, such as with equipment assets.

The use of estimates in recording the retirement of certain roadway assets is necessary based on the impracticality of tracking individual asset costs.

When r

etiring rail, ties and ballast, we use

statistical curves that indicate the relative distribution of the age of the assets retired.

The historical cost of other roadway assets is estimated using a combination of inflation indices specific to the rail industry and those published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The indices are applied to the replacement value based on the age of the retired assets.

These indices are used because they closely correlate with the costs of roadway assets.

Gains and losses on disposal of land and nonrail assets are included in “Other income – net”

(Note 2) since such income is not a product of

our

railroad operations.

A retirement is considered abnormal if it does not occur in the normal course of business, if it relates to disposition of a large segment of an asset class and if the retirement varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies, which inherently consider the impact of normal retirements on expected servi

ce lives and depreciation rates.

Gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recognized in earnings.

We

review the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flows.

Assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value.

Required Accounting Changes

In the first quarter of 2013, we prospectively adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2013-02,

“

Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.”

This update requires the disclosure of the effects of reclassifications out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss on the respective line items in our Consolidated Statements of Income if the amount being reclassified is required under GAAP to be reclassified in its entirety to net income.  We don’t have any such items.  For other amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period, we are required to cross-reference other required GAAP disclosures to provide additional detail about those amounts.  We include these disclosures in our “Stockholders’ Equity” (Note 13) footnote.  This update does not change the requirement to present the components of net income and other

K


comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or two separate consecutive statements, nor does it change the items currently reported in other comprehensive income.

Except for amounts for which a valuation allowance has been provided,

we believe

that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets.

The valuation allowance at the end of each year primarily relates to subsidiary state income tax net operating losses that may not be utilized prior to their expiration.

The valuation allowance for 2013 also includes state investment tax credits that may not be utilized prior to their expiration.

The total valuation allowance

increased by $13

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31,


, are potential benefits of $


million that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.

Unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amount recorded.

IRS examinations have been completed for all years prior to 2011.  We expect the IRS to begin auditing our 2011 and 2012 consolidated income tax returns in early 2014.

State income tax returns generally are subject to examination for a period of three to four years after filing of the return.

In addition,

we are

generally obligated to report changes in taxable income arising from federal income tax examinations to the states within a period of up to two years from the date the federal examination is final.

We have

various state income tax returns either under examination, administrative appeals, or litigation.

We expect

that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31,


, will decrease by approximately

$


million in 201


due to tax positions for which there was an uncertainty about the timing of deductibility in earlier years

,

but deductib

ility may become certain by

the close of 201

Fair Value

Fair Value Measurements

ASC 820-10,

“Fair Value Measurements,”

established a framework for measuring fair value and a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels, as follows:

The asset’s or liability’s fair value measurement level within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Other than those assets and liabilities described below that approximate fair value, there were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December

31, 2013 or

2012.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

We have

evaluated the fair values of financial instruments and methods used to determine those fair values.

The fair values of “Cash and cash equivalents,” “Short-term investments,” “Accounts receivable,” “Accounts payable,” and “Short-term debt” approximate carrying values because of the short maturity of these financial instruments.

The carrying value of corporate-owned life insurance is recorded at cash surrender value and, accordingly, approximates fair value. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values for the

remaining financial instruments, excluding investments

accounted for under the equity method, consisted of the following at December 31:

Underlying net assets were used to estimate the fair value of investments with the exception of notes receivable, which are based on future discounted cash flows.

Investment in Conrail

Through a limited liability company,

we

and CSX Corporation (CSX) jointly own Conrail Inc. (Conrail), whose primary subsidiary is Consolidated Rail Corporation (CRC).

We have

a

58%

economic and

50%

voting interest in the jointly owned entity, and CSX has the remainder of the economic and voting interests.

We are

amortizing the excess of the purchase price over Conrail’s net equity using the principles of purchase accounting, based primarily on the estimated useful lives of Conrail’s depreciable property and equipment, including the related deferred tax effect of the differences in

book and

tax accounting bases for such assets, as all of the purchase price at acquisition was allocable to Conrail’s tangible assets and liabilities.

At December 31,


, based on the funded stat

us of Conrail’s pension plans, we

increased

our

proportional investment in Conrail by $


million.

This resulted in

income

of $


million recorded to “Other comprehensive loss” and a combined federal and state deferred tax

liability

of $


million.

At December 31,


, based on the funded status of Conrail’s pension plans,

we

decreased

our

proportional investment in Conrail by $


million.

This resulted in

a loss

of $


million recorded to “Other comprehensive loss” and a combined federal and state deferred tax

asset

of $


million.

At December 31,


, the difference between

our investment in Conrail and our

share of Conrail’s underlying net equity was $


million.

Our

equity in the earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, included in “Other

income – net” was $


million, $


million, and $


million in


,


, and


, respectively.

CRC owns and operates certain properties (the Shared Assets Areas) for the joint and exclusive benefit of NSR and CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT).

The costs of operating the Shared Assets Areas are borne by NSR and CSXT based on usage.

In addition, NSR and CSXT pay CRC a fee for access to the Shared Assets Areas.

“Purchased services and rents” and “Fuel” include expenses for amounts due to CRC for operation of the Shared Assets Areas totaling

$


million in


, $


million in


, and $


million in


. Future minimum lease payments due to CRC under the Shared Assets Areas agreements are as follows:

$

35 million in each of 2014

through 201


and $


million thereafter.

We provide

certain general and administrative support functions to Conrail, the fees for which are billed in accordance with several service-provider arrangements and approximate $


million annually.

“Accounts payable” includes $


million at December 31,


, and $


million at December 31,


, due to Conrail for the operation of the Shared Assets Areas.

In addition, “Other liabilities” includes $


million

at

both

December 31,

, that bear interest at an average rate of

It is assumed the rate will decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of

.

Investments are restricted to domestic and international equity

securitie

s,

domestic and international fixed income securities,

and unleveraged exchange-traded options and financial futures.

Limitations restrict investment concentration and use of certain derivative investments.

The target asset allocation for equity is

75%

of the pension plan

s’

assets.

The fixed income portfolio is invested in the Barclays Government/Credit Bond Index Fund, except that the Canadian earmarked portion of the

portfolio is maintained in U.S. Treasury

Bonds.

Equity investments must be in liquid securities listed on national exchanges.

N

o investment is permitted in

our

securities (except through commingled pension trust funds).

Investment managers’ returns are expected to meet or exceed selected market indices by prescribed margins.

58%

in equity securities and

42%

in debt securities at December 31,

The target asset allocation for equity is between

50%

and

75%

of the plan’s assets.

The plans’ assumed future returns are based principally on the asset allocations and historic returns for the plans’ asset classes determined from both actual plan returns and, over longer time periods, market returns for those asset classes. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets that recognizes changes in fair v

alue over a three-year period. We

assumed a rate of return on pension plan assets of

8.25%

for

both

Fair Value of Plan Assets

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for pension plan assets measured at fair value.

Common stock:

Shares held by the plan at year end are valued at the official closing price as defined by the exchange or at the most recent trade price of a security at the close of the active market.

Common collective trusts:

Valued at the net asset value (NAV) of shares held by the plan at year end, based on the quoted market prices of the underlying assets of the trusts.

The investments are valued using NAV as a practical expedient for fair value.

The common collective trusts hold equity securities, fixed income securities and cash and cash equivalents.

Corporate bonds and other fixed income instruments:

When available, valued at an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a similar security at year end using observable market inputs.

Otherwise, valued at an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a similar security at year end using unobservable market inputs.

Municipal bonds:

Valued at an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security at year end using observable market

-

based inputs.

Commingled funds:

Valued at the NAV of shares held by the plan at year end, based on the quoted market prices of the underlying assets of the funds.

The investments are valued using NAV as a practical expedient for fair value.

The commingled funds hold equity securities.

Interest bearing cash:

Short-term bills or notes are valued at an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for the security at year end using observable market

-

based inputs; money market funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the funds are traded.

United States Government and agencies securities:

Valued at an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security at year end using observable

as well as unobservable market-

based inputs.

Inflation adjusted instruments utilize the appropriate index factor.

Preferred stock:

Shares held by the plan at year end are valued at the most recent trade price of a security at the close of the active market or at an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a similar security at year end using

primarily

observable as well as unobservable market-based inputs.

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for other postretirement benefit plan assets measured at fair value.

Trust-owned life insurance:

V

alued at

our

share of the net assets of trust-owned life insurance issued by a major insurance company.

The underlying investments of that trust

consist of a U.S. stock account

and a U.S. bond account, valued based upon the aggregate market values of the underlying investments.

The loan asset account is valued at cash surrender value at the time of the loan, plus accrued interest.

The other postretirement benefit plan assets consisted of trust-owned life insurance with fair values of

$


million and $


million at December 31,


and


,

respectively, and are valued under level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. There were no level 1 or level 3 related assets.

The methods used to value pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.

Furthermore, while

we

believe

our

valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

Contributions and Estimated Future Benefit Payments

In

we expect

to contribute approximately $


million to

our

unfunded pension plans for payments to pensioners and approximately $

other postretirement benefit plans for retiree health

and death

benefits.

Stock-Based Compensation

Under the stockholder-approved Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP),

the Compensation C

ommittee

(Committee), made up

of nonemployee

members

of the Board

of Directors

or the

C

hief

E

xecutive

O

fficer (if delegated such authority by the

C

ommittee)

,

may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock units (RSUs), restricted shares, performance share units (PSUs), and performance shares, up to a maximum of

96,125,000

shares of

our common stock (

Common Stock

)

.

Of these shares,

5,000,000

were approved by the Board for issuance to non-officer participants; as a broad-based issuance, stockholder approval was not required.

T

he number of shares remaining for issuance under LTIP

is

reduced (i) by 1 for each award granted as a stock option or stock-settled SAR, or (ii) by 1.61 for an award made in the form other than a stock option or stock-settled SAR.

Under the Board-approved Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan (TSOP), the

C

ommittee may grant stock options up to a maximum of 6,000,000 shares of Common Stock; as a broad-based stock option plan, stockholder approval of TSOP was not required.

We use

newly issued shares to satisfy any exercises and awards under LTIP and TSOP.

Shares available for future grants are shown in the table below.

LTIP also permits the payment – on a current or a deferred basis and in cash or in stock – of dividend equivalents on shares of Common Stock covered by stock options, RSUs, or PSUs in an amount commensurate with regular quarterly dividends paid on Common Stock.

With respect to stock options, if employment of the participant is terminated for any reason, including retirement, disability, or death,

we

have no further obligation to make any dividend equivalent payments.

Regarding RSUs, if employment of the participant is terminated for any reason other than retirement, disability, or death,

we

have no further obligation to make any dividend equivalent payments.

Should an employee terminate employment, they are not required to forfeit dividend equivalent payments already received.

Outstanding PSUs do not currently receive dividend equivalent payments.

During the first quarter of


,

the Committee

granted stock options, RSUs and PSUs pursuant to LTIP and granted stock options pursuant to TSOP.

Receipt of an award under LTIP was made contingent upon the awardee’s execution of a non-compete agreement, and all awards under LTIP were made subject to forfeiture in the event the awardee “engages in competing employment” for a period of time following retirement.

Accounting Method

We account for our

“Compensation-Stock Compensation.”

Accordingly, all awards result in charges to net income while dividend equivalent

payments

, which are all related to equity classified awards, are charged to retained income. Related compensation costs were $


million in


, $


million in


, and $

LTIP and

257,000

options were granted under

TSOP, each with a grant price of $

.

For all years, options granted under

LTIP and TSOP

may not be exercised prior to the fourth and third anniversaries of

the date of grant, respectively, or if the optionee retires or dies before that anniversary date, may not be exercised before the later of one year after the grant date or the date of the optionee’s retirement or death.

Holders

of the options granted under

LTIP

who remain actively employed receive cash dividend equivalent payments for four years in an amount equal to the regular quarterly dividends paid on Common Stock.

Dividend equivalent payments are not made on TSOP options.

The fair value of each option awarded in


,


, and


was measured on the date of grant using a lattice-based option valuation model.

Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities fro

m traded options on,

and historical volatility of

,

Common Stock.

H

istorical data

is used

to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model.

The average expected option life is derived from the output of the valuation model and represents the period of time that

all

options granted are expected to be outstanding

, including branches of the model that result in options expiring unexercised

.

The average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

For options granted that include dividend equivalent payments, a dividend yield of zero was used.

For


,


, and


, a dividend yield of

2.86%

,

2.30%

Commitments and Contingencies

Lawsuits

We

and/or certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations.

When

we conclude

that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, it is accrued through a charge to earnings.

While the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future developments, in

our

opinion, the recorded liability is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims.

However, the final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter.

Any adjustments to the recorded liability will be reflected in earnings in the periods in which such adjustments

become

known.

Two

of

our

customers

, DuPont and Sunbelt Chlor Alkai Partnership (“Sunbelt”), have rate reasonableness

complaint

s

pending before the STB

alleging that

our

tariff rates for transportation of regulated movements are unreasonable.

We

dispute th

ese

allegation

s.  S

ince June 1, 2009,

in the case of DuPont, and since April 1, 2011, in the case of Sunbelt, we

ha

ve

been billing and collecting amounts based on the challenged tariff rates.

We presently expect

resolution of the

se cases

to occur in 2

014 and believe

the estimate of reasonably possible loss will not have a material effect on

our

financial position, result

s of operations, or liquidity.

With regard to rate cases,

we

record adjustments to revenues in the periods, if and when, such adjustments are probable and estimable.

K


On November 6, 2007, various antitrust class actions filed against

us

and other C

lass I

railroads in various Federal district courts regarding fuel surcharges were consolidated in the District of Columbia by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation.

The defendant railroads appealed this certification, and on August 9, 2013, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia vacated the District Court’s decision and remanded the case for further consideration.  We believe

the allegations in the complaints are with

out merit and intend

to vigorously defend the cases.

We do

not believe that the outcome of these proceedings

will have a material effect on our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

A lawsuit filed on March 25, 2008, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota containing similar allegations against

us

and four

other major railroads

was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff subject to a tolling agreement entered into in August 2008.

Casualty Claims

Casualty claims include employee personal injury and occupational claims as well as third-party claims, all exclusive of legal costs.

To aid in valuing

our

personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue with respect to such claims during the year,

we utilize

studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm.

Job-related accidental injury and occupational claims are subject to the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA), which is applicable only to railroads.

FELA’s fault-based system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault workers’ compensation system.

The variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being different from the liability recorded.

While the ultimate amount of claims incurred is dependent on future developments, in

our

opinion, the recorded liability is adequate to cover the future payments of claims and is supported by the most recent actuarial study.

In all cases,

we record

a liability when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and estimable.

The Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect long-term receivables

for estimated recoveries from our

insurance carriers for claims associated with the January 6, 2005, derailment in Graniteville, S.C.

In the first quarter of 2011,

we

received an unfavorable ruling for an arbitration claim with an insurance carrier, and

were

denied recovery of the contested portion of the claim.

As a result,

we

recorded a $43 million charge for the receivables associated with the contested portion of the claim and a $15 million charge for other receivables affected by the ruling for which recovery is no longer probable.

Employee personal injury claims

– The largest component of casualties and other claims expense is employee personal injury costs.

The independent actuarial firm engaged by

us

provides quarterly studies to aid in valuing

our

employee personal injury liability and estimating personal injury expens

e.

The actuarial firm studies our

historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements, taking into account relevant outside influences.

The actuar

ial firm

uses the results of these analyses to estimate the ultimate amount of liability, which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted claims.

We adjust the

liability quarterly based upon

our

assessment and the results of the study.

Our

estimate of loss liabilities is subject to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events such as jury decisions, court interpretations, or legislative changes and as such the actual loss may vary from the estimated liability recorded.

Occupational claims

– Occupational claims (including asbestosis and other respiratory diseases, as well as conditions allegedly related to repetitive motion) are often not caused by a specific accident or event but rather allegedly result from a claimed exposure over time.

Many such claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been employed in the rail industry for decades.

The independent actuarial firm provides an estimate of the occupational claims liability based upon

our

history of claim filings, severity, payments, and other pertinent facts.

The liability is dependent upon judgments

we make

as to the specific case reserves as well as judgments of the actuarial firm in the

quarterly

studies.

The actuarial firm’s estimate of ultimate loss includes a provision for those claims that have been incurred but not reported.

This provision is derived by analyzing industry data and projecting

our

experience into the future as far as can be reasonably determined.

We adjust

the

liability quarterly based upon

our

assessment and the results of the study.

However, it is possible that the recorded liability may not be adequate to cover the future payment of claims.

Adjustments to the recorded liability are reflected in operating expenses in the periods in which such adjustments become known.

K


Third-party claims

–

We record

a liability for third-party claims including those for highway crossing accidents, trespasser and other injuries, automobile liability, property damage, and lading damage.

The actuarial firm assists

us

with the calculation of potential liability for third-party claims, ex

cept lading damage, based upon our

experience including

the

number and timing of incidents, amount of payments, settlement rates, number of open claims, and legal defenses. The actuarial estimate includes a provision for claims that have been incurred but not reported.

We adjust the

liability

quarterly

based upon

our

assessment and the results of the study.

Given the inherent uncertainty in regard to the ultimate outcome of third-party claims, it is possible that the actual loss may differ from the estimated liability recorded.

Environmental Matters

We are

subject to various jurisdictions’ environmental laws and regulations.

We

record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably.

Claims, if any, against third parties, for recovery of cleanup costs

we have

incurred are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are not netted against the associated liability.

Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates.

We

have

an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret

our

environmental policy.

Our

Consolidated Balance Sheets include liabilities for environmental exposures of $


million at December 31,


, and $


million at December 31,


(of which $


million is classified as a current liability at December

31,


and

$


million at December 31,


).

At December 31,


, the liability represents our

estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at


known locations and projects compared with


locations and projects at December 31,


.

At

December 31,


,

ten

sites accounted for $


million of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material.

We anticipate

that much of this liability will be paid out over

five

years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period.

At


locations, one or more

of our

subsidiaries in conjunction with a number of other parties have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 or comparable state statutes that impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs.

We calculate

our

estimated liability for these sites based on facts and legal defenses applicable to each site and not solely on the basis of the potential for joint liability.

With respect to known environmenta

l sites (whether identified by us

or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of

our

ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, unpredictable contaminant recovery and reduction rates associated with available cleanup technologies, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participant’s share of any estimated loss (and that participant’s ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability.

The risk of incurring environmental liability – for acts and omissions, past, present, and future – is inherent in the railroad business.

Some of the commodities in

our

traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, pose special risks that

we

work diligently to minimize.

In addition, several

of our s

ubsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased and operated by others, or held for sale.

Because environmental problems

that are latent or undisclosed

may exist on these properties, there can be no assurance that

we

will not incur environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time.

Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and potentially other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time.

The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

K


Based on

our

assessment of the facts and circumstances now known,

we believe

we have

recorded the probable and reasonably estimable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which

we are

aware.

F

urther,

we believe

that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on

our

financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

Insurance

We obtain

on behalf of

ourself

and

our

subsidiaries insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and first-party property damages.

We

are

currently self-insured up to $


million and above $


.0

billion per occurrence

and/or policy year

for bodily injury and property damage to third parties and up to $


million and above $


million per occurrence

and/or policy year

for property owned by

us

or i

n

our

care, custody, or control.

Purchase Commitments

At December 31,


,

we

had outstanding purchase commitments totaling approximately $


million for long-term service contracts through 2019 as well as

locomotives,

track material, and freight cars, in connection with

our capital programs through 2018

.

Change-In-Control Arrangements

We have

compensation agreements with certain officers and key employees that become operative only upon a change in control of

Norfolk Southern

, as defined in those agreements.

The agreements provide generally for payments based on compensation at the time of a covered individual’s involuntary or other specified termination and for certain other benefits.

Guarantees

In a number of instances,

we

have agreed to indemnify lenders for additional costs they may bear as a result of certain changes in laws or regulations applicable to their loans.

Such changes may include impositions or modifications with respect to taxes, duties, reserves, liquidity, capital adequacy, special deposits, and similar requirements relating to extensions of credit by, deposits with, or the assets or liabilities of such lenders.

The nature and timing of changes in laws or regulations applicable to

our

financings are inherently unpredictable, and therefore

our

exposure in connection with the foregoing indemnifications cannot be quantified.

No liability has been recorded related to these indemnifications.

We have

agreed to indemnify parties in a number of transactions for U.S. income tax withholding imposed as a result of changes in U.S. tax law.

In all cases,

we

ha

ve

the right to unwind the related transaction if the withholding cannot be avoided in the future.

Because these indemnities would be triggered and are dependent upon a change in the tax law, the maximum exposure is not quantifiable.

We do not believe it is likely that we

will be required to make any payments under these indemnities.

At

December 31,


, certain Norfolk Southern subsidiaries are contingently liable as guarantors with respect to

$


million of indebtedness, due in 2019, of an entity in which they have an ownership interest, the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis.

Four other railroads are also jointly and severally liable as guarantors for this indebtedness.

No liability has been recorded related to this guaranty.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our

Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the assistance of management, eva

luated the effectiveness of our

disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act))

at

December 31,


.

Based on such evaluation,

our

officers have concluded that,

at

December 31,


,

our

disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in

our

reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We are

responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.

Our

internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain

to our

ability to record, process, summarize, and report reliable financial data.

We recognize

that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control.

Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation.

Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.

In order to ensure that

our

internal control over financial reporting is effective,

we

regularly assess such controls and did so most recently for

our

financial reporting

at

December 31,


.

This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

(1992)

.

Based on our assessment,

we have

concluded that

we

maintained effective internal control over financial reporting

at

December 31,


.

Our

Board of Directors, acting through

its

Audit Committee, is responsible for the oversight of

our

accounting policies, financial reporting, and internal control.

The Audit Committee of

our

Board of Directors is comprised entirely of outside directors who are independent of management.

The independent registere

d public accounting firm and our

internal auditors have full and unlimited access to the Audit Committee, with or without management, to discuss the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, and any other matters which

they

believe should be brought to the attention of the Audit Committee.

We have

issued a report of

our

assessment of internal control over financial reporting, and

our

independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on

our internal control

over financial reporting

at

December 31,


.

These reports appear in Part II, Item 8 of this report on Form 10-K.

During the fourth quarter of


,

we have

not identified any changes in internal control

over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially effect,

our

internal control over financial reporting.

Norfolk Southern Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)

Established on June 28, 1983, and approved by

our

stockholders at their Annual Meeting held on May 10, 1984, LTIP was adopted to promote the success of

our company

by providing an opportunity for non-employee

D

irectors, officers, and other key employees to acquire a proprietary interest in the Corpor

ation.

On January 23, 2001, our

Board of Directors further amended LTIP and approved the issuance of an additional 5,000,000 shares of authorized but unissued Common Stock to participants who are not officers of

our company

.

The issuance of these shares was broadly-based, and stockholder approval of these shares was

not required.

Accordingly, this portion of LTIP is included in the number of securities available for future issuance for plans not approved by stockholders.

Also on

January 23, 2001,

our

Board

of Directors

amended LTIP, which amendment was approved by shareholders on May 10, 2001, that included the reservation for issuance of an additional 30,000,000 shares of authorized but unissued Common Stock.

In May 2010,

our

shareholders approved an amended LTIP that adopted a fungible share reserve ratio so that, for awards granted after May 13, 2010, the number of shares remaining for issuance under the amended LTIP will be reduced (i) by 1 for each award granted as an option or stock-settled stock appreciation right, or (ii) by 1.61 for an award made in the form other than an option or stock-settled stock appreciation right.

Any shares of Common Stock subject to options,

PSUs

, restricted shares, or

RSUs

which are not issued as Common Stock will again be available for award under LTIP after the expiration or forfeiture of an award.

Non-employee D

irectors, officers, and other key employees residing in the United States or Canada are eligible for selection to receive LTIP awards.

Under LTIP, the Compensation Committee (Committee)

, or the Corporation’s chief executive officer to the Committee delegates award-making authority pursuant to LTIP,

may grant incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights,

RSUs

, restricted shares,

PSUs, and performance shares.

I

n addition, dividend equivalent payments

may be awarded for options,

RSUs

, and

PSUs.  A

wards under LTIP

may be made

subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances and may establish such other terms and conditions for the awards as provided in LTIP.

For options granted after May 13, 2010, the option price will be at least the higher of (i) the average of the high and low prices at which Common Stock is traded on the date of grant, or (ii) the closing price of Common Stock on the date of the grant.

All options are subject to a vesting period of at least one year, and the term of the option will not exceed ten years.

LTIP specifically prohibits option repricing without stockholder approval, except

that adjustments may be made in the event of changes in our capital structure or Common Stock

.

PSUs

entitle a recipient to receive performance-based compensation at the end of a three-year cycle based on

our

pe

rformance during that

period.

For the 201


PSU

awards, corporate performance will be measured using three equally weighted standards established by the Committee:

(1) three-year average return on average capital invested, (2) three-year average operating ratio, and (3

) total return to stockholders measured at the end of the three-year period

.

For the 2013 PSU awards, PSUs

will be settled

in shares of Common Stock.

RSUs

are payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock at the end of a restriction period of not less than 36 months and not more than 60 months.

During the restriction period, the holder of the

RSUs

has no beneficial ownership interest in the Common Stock represented by the

RSUs

and has no right to vote the shares represented by the units or to receive dividends (except for dividend equivalent

payment

rights that may be awarded with respect to the

RSUs

).

The Committee at its discretion may waive the restriction period, but settlement of any

RSUs

will occur on the same settlement date as would have applied absent a waiver of restrictions, if no performance goals were imposed.

K


Norfolk Southern Corporation Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan (TSOP)

Our Board of Directors adopted

TSOP on January 26, 1999, to promote the success of

our company

by providing an opportunity for nonagreement employees to acquire a proprietary interest in

our company

and thereby to provide an additional incentive to nonagreement employees to devote their maximum efforts and skills to the advancement, betterment, and prosperity of

our company

and

our stockholders.

Under

TSOP there were 6,000,000 shares of authorized but unissued Common Stock reserved for issuance.

TSOP has not been and is not required to have been approved by

our

stockholders.

Active full-time nonagreement employees residing in the United States or Canada are eligible for selection to receive TSOP awards.

Under TSOP, the Committee

, or the Corporation’s chief executive officer to the extent the Committee delegates award-making authority pursuant to TSOP,

may grant nonqualified stock options subject to such terms and conditions as provided in TSOP.

The option price

may not be less than

the average of the high and low prices at which Common Stock is traded on the date of the grant.

All options are subject to a vesting period of at least one year, and the term of the opt

ion will not exceed ten years.

TSOP specifically prohibits repricing without stockholder approval, except for capital adjustments.

Norfolk Southern Corporation Directors’ Restricted Stock Plan (Plan)

The Plan was adopted on January 1, 1994, and is designed to increase ownership of Common Stock by

our

non-employee

D

irectors so as to further align their ownership interest in

our company

with that of

our stockholders.

The Plan has not been and is not required to have been approved by

our

stockholders.

Currently, a maximum of

66,000

shares of Common Stock may be granted under the Plan.

To make grants eligible to

D

irectors,

we

purchase, through one or more subsidiary companies, the number of shares required in open-market transactions at pr

evailing market prices, or make

such grants from Common Stock already owned by one or more of

our

subsidiary companies.

Only non-employee

D

irectors who are not and never have been employees of

our company

are eligible to participate in the Plan.

Upon becoming a

D

irector, each eligible

D

irector receives a one-time grant of 3,000 restricted shares of Common Stock.

No individual member of the Board exercises discretion concerning the eligibility of any

D

irector or the number of shares granted.

The restriction period applicable to restricted shares granted under the Plan begins on the date of the grant and ends on the earlier of the recipient’s death or

the day

afte

r the recipient ceases to be a D

irector by reason of disability or retirement.

During the restriction period, shares may not be sold, pledged, or otherwise encumbered.

Directors will forfeit the restricted shar

es if they cease to serve as a D

irector of

our company

for reasons other than their disability, retirement, or death.
