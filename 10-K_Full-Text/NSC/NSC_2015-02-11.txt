RAILROAD OPERATIONS

–

At

December 31,


, our railroads operated approximately

20,000

miles of road

in


states and the District of Columbia.

Our

system reaches

many individual industries, electric generating facilities, mines (in western Virginia, eastern Kentucky, southern

and northern West Virginia,

western Pennsylvania, and southern Illinois and Indiana), distribution centers, transload facilities, and other businesses located

in

our

service area.

Corridors with heaviest freight volume:

•

New York City area to Chicago (via Allentown and Pittsburgh)

•

Chicago to Macon (via Cincinnati, Chattanooga, and Atlanta)

•

Appalachian coal fields of Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky to Norfolk, Virginia and Sandusky, Ohio

•

Cleveland to Kansas City

•

Birmingham to Meridian

•

Memphis to Chattanooga

K


The miles operated, which include major leased lines between Cincinnati, Ohio, and Chattanooga, Tennessee, and an exclusive operating agreement for

trackage rights over property owned by North Carolina Railroad Company, were as follows:

Triple Crown Operations

–

Triple Crown Services Company (Triple Crown),

one of our

subsidiaries, provides bimodal truckload transportation service

primarily

utilizing RoadRailer® trailers, a hybrid technology that facilitates both over-the-road and on-the-rail transportation utilizing enclosed trailers that are pulled over the highways in tractor-trailer configuration and over the rails by locomotives.  In addition, Triple Crown utilizes conventional trailers that are also moved on rail flatcars.

Triple Crown provides service in the eastern United States,

as well as Ontario and Quebec,

through a network of terminals strategically located in 13 cities.

The following table sets forth certain statistics relating to

our

railroads’ operations for the past 5 years:

K


RAILWAY OPERATING REVENUES

–

Total railway operating revenues were

$11.6 billion

in


.  Following is an overview of our three major market groups.

COAL

–

Revenues from coal accounted for about 21% of our total railway operating revenues in


.  We handled

141.8 million

tons, or

1.3 million

carloads, in


, most of which originated on our lines from major eastern coal basins, with the balance from major western coal basins received via the Memphis and Chicago gateways.  Our coal franchise supports the electric generation market, serving approximately 84 coal generation plants, as well as the export, metallurgical and industrial markets,

primarily through direct rail and river, lake, and coastal facilities, including various terminals on the Ohio River,

Lambert’s

Point in Norfolk, Virginia,

the Port of Baltimore, and Lake Erie.

See the discussion of coal revenues and tonnage, by type of coal, in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

GENERAL MERCHANDISE

–

Our general merchandise market group is composed of five major commodity groupings:

•

Chemicals includes sulfur and related chemicals, petroleum products (including crude oil), chlorine and bleaching compounds, plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals, and chemical wastes.

•

Metals and construction includes steel, aluminum products, machinery, scrap metals, cement, aggregates, sand, and minerals.

•

Agriculture, consumer products, and government includes soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizer, livestock and poultry feed, food oils, flour, beverages, canned goods, sweeteners, consumer products, ethanol, transportation equipment, and items for the U.S. military.

•

Automotive includes finished vehicles for BMW, Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Toyota, and Volkswagen, and auto parts for BMW, Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Mazda, Nissan, Subaru, Toyota, and Volkswagen.

•

Paper, clay and forest products includes lumber and wood products, pulp board and paper products, wood fibers, wood pulp, scrap paper, and clay.

In


, 124 million tons of general merchandise freight, or approximately 61% of total general merchandise tonnage we handled, originated on our lines.  The balance of general merchandise freight was received from connecting carriers at interterritorial gateways.  Our principal interchange points for received freight included Chicago, New Orleans, East St. Louis, Memphis, Detroit, Toledo, Kansas City, Meridian, and Buffalo.  General merchandise carloads handled in


were

2.5 million

, the revenues from which accounted for 57% of our total railway operating revenues.

See the discussion of general merchandise revenues by commodity group in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

INTERMODAL

–

Our intermodal market group consists of shipments moving in trailers, domestic and international containers, and RoadRailer® equipment.  These shipments are handled on behalf of intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, truckers, and other shippers.  Intermodal units handled in


were 3.8 million, the revenues from which accounted for 22% of our total railway operating revenues.

See the discussion of intermodal revenues in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

FREIGHT RATES

–

Private contracts and exempt price quotes

are our

predominant pricing mechanisms.  Thus, a major portion of our freight business is not economically regulated by the

federal

government.  In general, market forces

are the primary determinant of rail service prices.

In


, our railroads were found by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB), the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices, to be “revenue adequate” on an annual basis based on results for the year

K



.  The STB has not made its revenue adequacy determination for the year


.

A railroad is “revenue adequate” on an annual basis under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry’s composite cost of capital.  This determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement.

PASSENGER OPERATIONS

–

Amtrak operates regularly scheduled passenger trains on our lines between the following locations:

•

Alexandria and

Lynchburg, Virginia

•

Alexandria, Virginia and New Orleans, Louisiana

•

Alexandria and

Orange, Virginia

•

Petersburg

and Norfolk, Virginia

•

Raleigh and Charlotte, North Carolina

•

Selma and Charlotte, North Carolina

•

Chicago, Illinois, and Porter, Indiana

•

Chicago, Illinois, and Cleveland, Ohio

•

Chicago, Illinois, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

•

Pittsburgh and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania

A consortium of two transportation commissions of the Commonwealth of Virginia operate commuter trains on our

line between Manassas and Alexandria.

We

lease the Chicago to Manhattan, Illinois, line to the Commuter Rail Division of the Regional Transportation Authority of Northeast Illinois (METRA).

We

operate freight service over lines with significant ongoing Amtrak and commuter passenger operations, and conduct

freight operations over trackage owned or leased by:

•

Amtrak

•

New Jersey Transit

•

Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority

•

Metro-North Commuter Railroad Company

•

Maryland Department of Transportation

•

Michigan Department of Transportation

Amtrak

and various

commuter agencies conduct passenger operations over trackage owned by Conrail in the Shared Assets Areas (Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

NONCARRIER OPERATIONS

–

Our

noncarrier subsidiaries engage principally in the acquisition, leasing, and management of coal, oil, gas and minerals; the development of commercial real estate; telecommunications; and the leasing or sale of rail property and equipment.  In


, no such noncarrier subsidiary or industry segment grouping of noncarrier subsidiaries met the requirements for a reportable business segment under relevant authoritative accounting guidance.

K


RAILWAY PROPERTY

Our

railroad system extends across


states and the District of Columbia.  The railroad infrastructure makes

us

capital intensive with net property of approximately $28 billion on a historical cost basis.

Property Additions

–

Property additions for the past five years were as follows (including capitalized leases):

Our capital spending and replacement programs are and have been designed to assure the ability to provide safe, efficient, and reliable rail transportation services.  For


, we

have

budgeted $2.4

billion of property additions.  See further discussion of our planned capital spending and replacement programs in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," under the subheading "Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources."

We have

invested and will continue to invest in various projects and corridor initiatives to expand our

rail network to increase capacity and improve transit times, while returning value to shareholders.  Initiatives include the following:

•

The Crescent Corridor consists of a

program of projects for infrastructure and other facility improvements geared toward creating seamless, high-capacity intermodal routes

spanning 11 states from New Jersey to Louisiana and offering truck-competitive service along several major interstate highway corridors, including I-81, I-85, I-20,

I-40, I-59, I-78, and I-75.

•

The Heartland Corridor

is

a seamless,

high-capacity intermodal route across Virginia and West Virginia to Midwest markets.

•

Meridian Speedway LLC, a joint venture

with Kansas City Southern, owns and operates a

320-mile rail line between Meridian, Mississippi and Shreveport, Louisiana designed to increase capacity and improve service.

•

Pan Am Southern LLC, a joint venture

with

Pan Am Railways, Inc.,

owns and operates a

155-mile main line track that runs between Mechanicville, New York and Ayer, Massachusetts, along with 281 miles of secondary and branch lines, including trackage rights in New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont designed to increase intermodal and automotive capacity.

•

The CREATE project is a public-private partnership to reduce rail and highway congestion and add freight and passenger capacity in the metropolitan Chicago area.  We

and other railroads have agreed to participate in CREATE.

K


Equipment

–

At

December 31,


, we

owned or leased the following units of equipment:

(1)

Includes equipment leased to outside parties and equipment subject to equipment trusts, conditional sale agreements, and capitalized leases.

(2)

Includes short-term and long-term operating leases.

K


The following table indicates the number and year built for locomotives and freight cars owned at December 31,


:

The following table shows the average age of our owned locomotive and freight car fleets at December 31,


, and

information regarding


retirements:

Our ongoing locomotive and freight car maintenance programs are intended to ensure the highest standards of safety, reliability, customer satisfaction, and equipment availability.  The locomotive bad order ratio includes all units (owned and leased) out of service for required periodic inspections, unscheduled maintenance and program work which includes such activity as overhauls.

Encumbrances

– Certain railroad equipment is subject to the prior lien of equipment financing obligations totaling $1 million at December 31,


.

Track Maintenance

–

Of the 35,900 total miles of track we operate, we are responsible for maintaining 28,750 miles, with the remainder being operated under trackage rights from other parties responsible for maintenance.

Over 82% of the main line trackage (including first, second, third, and branch main tracks, all excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights) has rail ranging from 131 to 155 pounds per yard with the standard installation currently at 136 pounds per yard.  Approximately 45% of our lines, excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights, carried 20 million or more gross tons per track mile during


.

K


The following table summarizes several measurements regarding

our

track roadway additions and replacements during the past five years:

Microwave System

–

Our microwave system, consisting of approximately 6,983 radio route miles, 423 core stations, 30 secondary stations, and 5 passive repeater stations, provides communications between most operating locations.  We use the microwave system primarily for voice communications, VHF radio control circuits, data and facsimile transmissions, traffic control operations, and AEI data transmissions.

Traffic Control

–

Of the approximately 16,500 route miles we dispatch, about 11,025 miles are signalized, including 8,250 miles of centralized traffic control (CTC) and 2,775 miles of automatic block signals.  Of the 8,250 miles of CTC, approximately 7,447 miles are controlled by data radio originating at 345 base station radio sites.

Computers

–

A computer network consisting of a centralized production and backup data center and various distributed computers throughout the company connects the yards, terminals, transportation offices, rolling stock repair points, sales offices, and other key system locations.  Operating and traffic data are processed and stored to provide customers with information on their shipments throughout the system.  Computer systems provide current information on the location of every train and each car on line, as well as related waybill and other train and car movement data.  In addition,

our

computer systems assist

us

in the performance of a variety of functions and services,

including payroll, car and revenue accounting, billing,

sourcing, inventory

management activities and controls, and special studies.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

–

Compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is

one our

principal goals.  To date, such compliance

has not had a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity, or competitive position.  See “Legal Proceedings,” Part I, Item 3; “Personal Injury, Environmental, and Legal Liabilities” in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

EMPLOYEES

–

The following table shows the average number of employees and the average cost per employee for wages and benefits:

More than

80%

of our

railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. See the discussion of “Labor Agreements” in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

–

In addition to environmental, safety, securities, and other regulations generally applicable to all business, our

railroads are subject to regulation by the STB.  The STB has jurisdiction over some rates, routes, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines.  The STB also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers.  The Federal Railroad Administration

(FRA)

regulates certain track and mechanical equipment standards.

K


The relaxation of economic regulation of railroads, following the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, included exemption from STB regulation of the rates and most service terms for intermodal business (trailer-on-flat-car, container-on-flat-car), rail boxcar shipments, lumber, manufactured steel, automobiles, and certain bulk commodities such as sand, gravel, pulpwood, and wood chips for paper manufacturing.  Further, all shipments that we have under contract are effectively removed from regulation for the duration of the contract.  About 90% of our revenues comes from either exempt shipments or shipments moving under transportation contracts; the remainder comes from shipments moving under public tariff rates.

Efforts

have been made over the past several years

to re-subject the rail industry to increased federal economic regulation,

and such efforts are expected to continue in


.  The Staggers Rail Act of 1980

substantially balanced

the interests of shippers and rail carriers,

and

encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate, invest in their infrastructure, and compete for business, thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry.  Accordingly,

we

will continue to oppose efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation.

Government regulations concerning the safety and security of our railroads are discussed within the “Security of Operations” section contained herein.

COMPETITION

–

There is continuing strong competition among rail, water, and highway carriers.  Price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company. Inventory carrying costs, service reliability, ease of handling, and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations, especially for higher-valued finished goods, machinery, and consumer products.  Even for raw materials, semi-finished goods, and work-in-progress, users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages.

Our

primary rail competitor is CSX

Corporation; both

railroads

operate throughout much of the same territory.  Other railroads also operate in parts of the territory.  We

also compete with motor carriers, water carriers, and with shippers who have the additional options of handling their own goods in private carriage, sourcing products from different geographic areas, and using substitute products.

Certain marketing strategies among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable

railroads

to compete more effectively in specific markets.

SECURITY OF OPERATIONS

-

We continue to take measures to enhance the security of our rail system. Our comprehensive security plan is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the Association of American Railroads (AAR) post September 11, 2001.  The AAR Security Plan defines four Alert Levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry as a terrorist threat increases or decreases.  The Alert Level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas:  (1) operations (including transportation, engineering, and mechanical); (2) information technology and communications; and, (3) railroad police.  All of our Operations Division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers, as appropriate, of any change in Alert Level and any additional responsibilities they may incur due to such change.

Our plan also complies with U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials.  As part of the plan, security awareness training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety, and is integrated into hazardous material training programs.  Additionally, location-specific security plans are in place for certain metropolitan areas and each of the six port facilities we serve.  With respect to the ports, each facility plan has been approved by the applicable Captain of the Port and remains subject to inspection by the U.S. Coast Guard.

Additionally, we continue to engage in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the TSA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the FRA, the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and various state Homeland Security offices.

K


Similarly, we follow guidance from DHS and DOT regarding rail corridors in High Threat Urban Areas (HTUA). Particular attention is aimed at reducing risk in HTUA by:  (1) the establishment of secure storage areas for rail cars carrying toxic-by-inhalation (TIH) materials; (2) the expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying TIH materials; (3) substantially reducing the number of unattended loaded tank cars carrying TIH materials; and (4) cooperation with federal, state, local, and tribal governments to identify those locations where security risks are the highest.

In 2014, through participation in the Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response (TRANSCAER) Program, we provided rail accident response training to approximately 5,442 emergency responders, such as local police and fire personnel. Our other training efforts throughout 2014 included participation in drills for local, state, and federal agencies.  We also have ongoing programs to sponsor local emergency responders at the Security and Emergency Response Training Course conducted at the AAR Transportation Technology Center in Pueblo, Colorado.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

We are

subject to significant governmental legislation and regulation over commercial, operating and environmental matters.

Railroads are subject to the enactment of laws by Congress that could increase economic regulation of the industry.  Railroads presently are subject to commercial regulation by the Surface Transportation Board (STB), which has jurisdiction over some rates, routes, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines.  The STB also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers.  Additional economic regulation of the rail industry by Congress or the STB, whether under new or existing laws, could have a significant negative impact on our ability to determine prices for rail services and result in a material adverse effect in the future on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.  This potential material adverse effect could also result in reduced capital spending on our rail network or abandonment of lines.

Railroads are subject to safety and security regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which regulate most aspects of our operations.  Compliance with the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 will result in additional operating costs associated with the statutorily mandated implementation of positive train control by 2015.  In addition to increased capital expenditures, implementation may result in reduced operational efficiency and service levels, as well as increased compensation and benefits expenses, and increased claims and litigation costs.

Our operations are subject to extensive federal and state environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air; discharges to waterways or groundwater supplies; handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and other materials; and the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases.  The risk of incurring environmental liability

–

for acts and omissions, past, present, and future

–

is inherent in the railroad business.  This risk includes property owned by us, whether currently or in the past, that is or has been subject to a variety of uses, including our railroad operations and other industrial activity by past owners or our past and present tenants.

Environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, and we could incur environmental liabilities or costs, the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time, with respect to one or more of these properties.  Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time, and the resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

As a common carrier by rail,

we

must offer to transport hazardous materials, regardless of risk.

Transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury and property (including environmental) damage, and compromise critical parts of our rail network.  A catastrophic rail accident involving hazardous materials could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of

K


operations, or liquidity to the extent not covered by insurance.  We have obtained insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and first-party property damages; however, insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or, if available, may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us.

We

may be affected by terrorism or war.

Any terrorist attack, or other similar event, any government response thereto, and war or risk of war could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.  Because we play a critical role in the nation’s transportation system, we could become the target of such an attack or have a significant role in the government’s preemptive approach or response to an attack or war.

Although we currently maintain insurance coverage for third-party liability arising out of war and acts of terrorism, we maintain only limited insurance coverage for first-party property damage and damage to property in our care, custody, or control caused by certain acts of terrorism.  In addition, premiums for some or all of our current insurance programs covering these losses could increase dramatically, or insurance coverage for certain losses could be unavailable to us in the future.

We may be affected by general economic conditions.

Prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions affecting the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.  Economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more large customers could have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter,

We may be affected by energy prices.

Volatility in energy prices could have an effect on a variety of items including, but not limited to: the economy; demand for transportation services; business related to the energy sector, including crude and natural gas; fuel prices; and fuel surcharges.  Any of these items could have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

We

may be affected by climate change legislation or regulation.

Concern over climate change has led to significant federal, state, and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  Moreover, even without such legislation or regulation, government incentives and adverse publicity relating to GHGs could affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry.  Restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on GHG emissions, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs, decrease the amount of traffic handled, and decrease the value of coal reserves we own, and thus could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.  Such restrictions could affect our customers that (1) use commodities that we carry to produce energy, including coal, (2) use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry, or (3) manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy.

We

face competition from other transportation providers.

We are subject to competition from motor carriers, railroads and, to a lesser extent, ships, barges, and pipelines, on the basis of transit time, pricing, and quality and reliability of service.  While we have used primarily internal resources to build or acquire and maintain our rail system, trucks and barges have been able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities.  Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in which we operate, or legislation granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

The operations of carriers with which

we

interchange may adversely affect

our

operations.

Our ability to provide rail service to customers in the U.S. and Canada depends in large part upon our ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to, among other matters, freight rates, revenue division, car supply and locomotive availability, data exchange and communications, reciprocal switching, interchange, and trackage rights. Deterioration in the operations of or service provided by connecting carriers, or in

K


our relationship with those connecting carriers, could result in our inability to meet our customers’ demands or require us to use alternate train routes, which could result in significant additional costs and network inefficiencies.

We

rely

on technology and technology improvements in

our

business operations.

If we experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems, including computer hardware, software, and communications equipment, we could experience a service interruption, a security breach, or other operational difficulties.  Additionally, if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or we are unable to implement new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service.  Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

The vast majority of

our

employees belong to labor unions, and labor agreements, strikes, or work stoppages could adversely affect

our operations.

More than 80% of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions.  If unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations.  Additionally, future national labor agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, could significantly increase our costs for healthcare, wages, and other benefits.  Any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

We

may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.

The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, commercial disputes, freight loss and other property damage, and other matters.  Job-related personal injury and occupational claims are subject to the Federal Employer’s Liability Act (FELA), which is applicable only to railroads. FELA’s fault-based tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault worker’s compensation system.  The variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded.

Any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving any or all of freight loss  property damage, personal injury, and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity to the extent not covered by insurance.  We have obtained insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and first-party property damages.  Specified levels of risk are retained on a self-insurance basis (currently up to

$50 million

Severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures.

Severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena, including hurricanes, floods, fires, and earthquakes, may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs, increased liabilities, and decreased revenues, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

Unpredictability of demand for rail services resulting in the unavailability of qualified personnel could adversely affect

our

operational efficiency and ability to meet demand.

Workforce demographics, training requirements, and the availability of qualified personnel, particularly engineers and trainmen, could each have a negative impact on our ability to meet demand for rail service.  Unpredictable increases in demand for rail services may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

We may be affected by supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of some of our supplier markets.

We consumed 494 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2014. Fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations. A severe fuel supply shortage arising from production curtailments, increased demand in existing or emerging

K


foreign markets, disruption of oil imports, disruption of domestic refinery production, damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure, political unrest, war or other factors, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter. Also, such an event could impact us as well as our customers and other transportation companies.

Due to the capital intensive nature, as well as the industry-specific requirements of the rail industry, high barriers of entry exist for potential new suppliers of core railroad items, such as locomotives and rolling stock equipment. Additionally, we compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of locomotives and certain track and rolling stock materials. Changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited-supplier markets could result in increased prices or significant shortages of materials that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

The state of capital markets could adversely affect

our

liquidity.

From time-to-time we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements, including the issuance of long-term debt instruments and commercial paper, as well as the sale of certain receivables.  Significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including the credit markets, or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or eliminate our access to, and/or significantly increase the cost of, various financing sources, including bank credit facilities and issuance of corporate bonds.  Instability or disruptions of the capital markets and deterioration of our financial condition, alone or in combination, could also result in a reduction in our credit rating to below investment grade, which could prohibit or restrict us from accessing external sources of short- and long-term debt financing and/or significantly increase the associated costs.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

On November 6, 2007, various antitrust class actions filed against us and other Class I railroads in various Federal district courts regarding fuel surcharges were consolidated in the District of Columbia by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. On June 21, 2012, the court certified the case as a class action. The defendant railroads appealed this certification, and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia vacated the District Court’s decision and remanded the case for further consideration. We believe the allegations in the complaints are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the cases. We do not believe the outcome of these proceedings will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. A lawsuit containing similar allegations against us and four other major railroads that was filed on March 25, 2008, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota, was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff subject to a tolling agreement entered into in August 2008, and most recently extended in August 2013.

In 2012, we received a Notice of Violation (NOV) issued by the Tennessee Department of Environmental Conservation concerning soil runoff in connection with construction of the Memphis Regional Intermodal Facility in Rossville, Tennessee. Although we will contest liability and the imposition of any penalties, this matter is described here consistent with SEC rules and requirements concerning governmental proceedings with respect to environmental laws and regulations. We do not believe that the outcome of this proceeding will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

In or around 2012, a building located on non-operating property formerly leased to various tenants in Williamson, West Virginia, was demolished and the related debris and waste disposed of at a local landfill. Upon further investigation in March 2014, it became uncertain as to whether asbestos abatement was properly conducted on the building prior to demolition. Although the matter is under further investigation, we have self-reported it to the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection, and it is described here consistent with SEC rules and requirements concerning governmental proceedings with respect to environmental laws and regulations. We do not believe that the outcome of this proceeding will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Norfolk Southern Corporation and Subsidiaries

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and the Selected Financial Data.

OVERVIEW

We are one of the nation’s premier transportation companies.  Our Norfolk Southern Railway Company subsidiary operates approximately 20,000 miles of road in 22 states and the District of Columbia, serves every major container port in the eastern United States, and provides efficient connections to other rail carriers.  We operate the most extensive intermodal network in the East and are a major transporter of coal, automotive, and industrial products.

Strong volume growth in our intermodal and merchandise businesses driven by higher demand for rail services offset declines in our coal business, resulting in a $379 million, or 3%, improvement in our operating revenues.  Our continued focus on cost control helped stem growth in operating expenses (up $61 million, or 1%) despite higher volumes and led to an all-time low operating ratio (a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses) of 69.2% for 2014.

The unexpected volume growth and severe winter weather led to resource shortages and network delays during the year.  We are committed to improving our service and have added resources to meet the needs of our network.  As a result of these efforts, in the latter part of the year we saw improvement in operational metrics and expect this to continue in 2015.

Looking forward to


, we expect the impact of lower oil prices on our fuel surcharge revenue programs to be offset by increased volumes and higher rates.  We will continue to focus on safety, service levels, cost control, productivity, operational efficiency, and a market-based approach to pricing.

$11.0 billion

in


.  The following table presents a three-year comparison of revenues, volumes, and average revenue per unit by market group.

Revenues

increase

resulted from

higher

volumes, partially offset by

lower

average revenue per unit as the effects of lower rates and changes in the mix of business more than offset higher fuel surcharges.  The

increase

in


resulted from

higher

volumes, partially offset by

lower

average revenue per unit as lower market-based export coal rates, the effects of changes in the mix of business, and slightly lower fuel surcharges more than offset rate increases.

Over 85% of our revenue base is covered by negotiated fuel surcharges, and revenues in 2014 included $1,329 million of such surcharges.  This amount was divided about evenly between surcharges tied to the monthly average price of West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil (WTI) and surcharges tied to the weekly average price of On-Highway Diesel (OHD).  More than two-thirds of the 2014 WTI-based surcharges were attributable to contracts with trigger prices above current WTI levels of about $50 per barrel (a predominant trigger price is $64 per barrel); therefore, if WTI prices remain below these triggers, traffic moving under these contracts will not be assessed any fuel surcharge.  Almost all of the remaining WTI-based surcharges have trigger prices well below current WTI levels, and almost all of the OHD-based surcharges have trigger prices substantially below current OHD levels (of about $3 per gallon).  As a result, if WTI and OHD prices remain at their current levels, traffic moving under these

K


contracts will continue to be assessed fuel surcharges; however, they will be substantially lower than those generated in 2014.  Thus, total fuel surcharges for 2015 could be less than half of the amount in 2014.  The WTI-related surcharges are reset the first day of each calendar month based on the WTI average price for the second preceding calendar month. This two-month lag in applying the WTI average price increased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately

$84 million

in


, decreased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately

$29 million

in


, and increased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately

$39 million

in


.  Fuel surcharge revenue totaled

$1,254 million

.

Two of our customers, DuPont and Sunbelt Chlor Alkai Partnership (Sunbelt), filed rate reasonableness complaints before the Surface Transportation Board (STB) alleging that our tariff rates for transportation of regulated movements are unreasonable. Since June 1, 2009, in the case of DuPont, and April 1, 2011, in the case of Sunbelt, we have been billing and collecting amounts based on the challenged tariff rates. On March 14, 2014, the STB resolved DuPont’s rate reasonableness complaint in our favor, and on June 20, 2014, the STB resolved Sunbelt’s rate case in our favor. The STB’s findings in both cases remain subject to technical corrections, requests for reconsideration, and appeal. We believe the estimate of any reasonably possible loss will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. With regard to rate cases, we record adjustments to revenues in the periods if and when such adjustments are probable and estimable.

, the result of lower pricing (mainly market-based export coal) and decreased fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by the positive effect of changes in mix.

For


, coal revenues are expected to decrease due to lower average revenue per unit (largely a result of lower fuel surcharge revenue) and decreased volumes.

Coal represented

21%

of our revenues in


, and

79%

of shipments handled originated on our lines.  As shown in the following table, tonnage decreased in our export, utility, and domestic metallurgical markets but increased in our industrial markets.

Utility coal

tonnage was

down

3%

in


, compared with


.  Lower utility coal shipments to our northern region due to market share loss and competition from lower priced natural gas were offset in part by gains in our southern region, resulting from strong demand for electric generation and stockpile rebuilding after a harsh winter.

Utility coal tonnage was

down

4%

in


as compared to


. Utility coal shipments in our southern region decreased due to lower demand as utility stockpiles remained high and natural gas prices remained low. This

K


decrease was partially offset by increased shipments in our northern region as higher coal burn necessitated stockpile replenishments to maintain targeted levels.

For


, we expect utility coal tonnage to decrease as we expect lower demand resulting from a decline in natural gas prices and reduced coal burn at southern utilities we serve.

Export coal

tonnage

decrease

d

19%

in


, compared with


.  Strong competition in the global metallurgical and thermal coal markets resulting from excess coal supply, weakening economies in the global market, and a strong Australian currency advantage significantly reduced demand for U.S. export coal.  Volume through Norfolk was down

4.3 million

tons, or

20%

, and volume through Baltimore was down

0.5 million

tons, or

8%

.  Other export volume decreased

0.6 million

tons, or

85%

.

In


, export coal tonnage

increase

d

1%

, compared with 2012. Despite strong global competition, we handled higher export thermal and metallurgical coal shipments as an increase in steel production in developing markets offset weakness in the European market. Volume through Norfolk was up

2.1 million

tons, or

11%

, whereas Baltimore volume decreased

1.4 million

tons, or

17%

. Other export volume decreased

0.4 million

tons, or

36%

.

For


, export coal tonnage is expected to decrease as a result of strong competition in the overseas metallurgical coal market, in addition to soft demand for and an oversupply of thermal coal.

Domestic metallurgical coal

tonnage was

down

5% in


, compared with


, as lower metallurgical coal shipments resulting from plant curtailments and customer sourcing shifts were offset in part by higher shipments of coke.

In


, domestic metallurgical coal tonnage was

down

10%, compared with


, due to weaker domestic steel production, sourcing shifts away from coal origins we serve, and the permanent closure of a steel plant in mid-2012 that impacted the year-over-year comparison for the first half of 2013.

For


, domestic metallurgical coal tonnage is expected to decline due to closure of a mine that we currently serve.

Industrial coal

tonnage increased 16% in


, compared with


, as new business opportunities with existing customers was partially offset by declines in anthracite and petcoke shipments.

In


, industrial coal tonnage increased slightly compared with


, as increased shipments to existing customers were partially offset by weaker industrial demand in the print paper and cement sectors.

For


, industrial coal tonnage is expected to decrease, primarily due to conversions to natural gas.

Chemicals

revenues in


increase

d

12%

, compared with


, reflecting volume growth (

up

12%

) largely driven by higher shipments of crude oil originated from the Bakken and Canadian oil fields and growth in shipments of liquefied petroleum gas in the Utica Shale region.

K


In


, chemicals revenues

increase

d

14%

, compared with


, reflecting

16%

growth

in volume partially offset by a

2%

decline

in average revenue per unit that resulted from the negative effect of the changes in mix due to increased crude oil shipments.  The volume

improvement

was primarily the result of more carloads of crude oil from the Bakken and Canadian oil fields.  Additionally, there were more carloads of liquefied petroleum gas in the Utica Shale region.

For


, chemicals revenues are anticipated to increase, as we expect more shipments of crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas.  However, a prolonged period of low oil prices could put pressure on demand for crude by rail.  Average revenue per unit is expected to be lower, largely a result of the anticipated reduction in fuel surcharge revenue and the negative mix effect of the volume increase in lower-rated shipments.

Metals and construction

revenues

grew

8%

in


, compared with


.  The revenue

improvement

resulted from a 9% increase in carloads, as we moved more shipments of fractionating sand for natural gas drilling, in addition to higher coil shipments to support growing demand in the automotive and energy sectors, and increased shipments of iron and steel as a result of higher import activity.

In


, metals and construction revenues

increase

d

5%

compared with


.  The

improvement

resulted from

6%

higher

average revenue per unit, which reflected the positive change in mix of business as we transported higher-rated shipments of slag and fractionating sand for natural gas drilling, higher rates, and increased fuel surcharges.  Although we moved more slag and fractionating carloads, volume

decline

d modestly as we handled reduced shipments of iron and steel (driven by fewer import slabs and a steel plant closure during the third quarter of 2012) and scrap metal (a result of weakening demand).

For


, metals and construction revenues are expected to decline, reflecting lower average revenue per unit as a result of the anticipated decline in fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by improved volumes.  We currently anticipate higher shipments of fractionating sand and other materials used for natural gas drilling, as well as additional shipments of aggregates due to growth in road construction activity and steel used by the automotive and energy sectors.

Agriculture, consumer products, and government

revenues

increase

d

2%

in


, compared with


, as a result of a 2% improvement in volume and a

1%

improvement

in average revenue per unit, due primarily to higher rates that were slightly offset by a negative change in mix.  The volume

increase

was driven by higher corn shipments due to increased demand for ethanol production, partially offset by fewer shipments of fertilizer due to production curtailments.

In 2013, agriculture, consumer products, and government revenues

increase

d

1%

compared with 2012, as a

2%

improvement

in average revenue per unit (reflecting pricing improvements that were slightly offset by a negative change in mix related to the increase of lower-rated shorter-haul movements of corn) was partially offset by a slight

decrease

in volume.  The volume

decrease

was driven by reduced shipments of soybeans and related products caused by tightened supplies of domestic beans and a strong South American crop, in addition to fewer revenue movements of empty equipment.  Carload volume declines were partially offset by higher shipments of food oils as we handled new business with existing customers and more biodiesel carloads in advance of the anticipated elimination of the biodiesel tax credit.  We also hauled more shipments of fertilizer due to a strong farm economy and increased planting activity.

For


, agriculture, consumer products, and government revenues are expected to be flat as we expect higher volumes will be offset by lower average revenue per unit reflecting lower fuel surcharges offset in part by pricing gains.  Volume growth is anticipated to come from higher shipments of soybeans as we return to a more normal crop cycle, more carloads of ethanol, and growth in feed product shipments as a result of increased export opportunities.

K


Automotive revenues

rose

2%

compared to


, reflecting

2%

growth in volume due to increased vehicle production at plants we serve that was offset in part by the diversion of shipments to other modes of transportation as a result of equipment shortages and network delays.

In


, automotive revenues

rose

10%

compared to


, reflecting

7%

growth in volume due to increased vehicle production at plants we serve and new business from existing customers (including both auto parts and finished vehicles).  Average revenue per unit improved

2%

, reflecting improved pricing and higher fuel surcharges.

For


, automotive revenues are expected to slightly decrease as a result of lower average revenue per unit as lower fuel surcharges are expected to offset improved pricing.  These average revenue per unit declines are expected to be partially offset by volume gains driven by a continued increase in domestic production at plants we serve and the return of diverted traffic.

Paper, clay and forest products

revenues were flat as a 2%

improvement

in average revenue per unit (reflecting pricing gains and positive mix) was offset by a

2%

decrease in volumes.  Volume declines were driven by reduced shipments of municipal solid waste resulting from loss of business, lower shipments of newsprint and paper due to mill and plant closures, and fewer pulp shipments due to production issues and reduced export demand.  These declines were offset in part by higher lumber shipments resulting from the continued housing recovery and new business.

In


, paper, clay and forest products revenues increased

3%

compared with


, reflecting

1%

gains in both volume and average revenue per unit.  Volume increases for lumber, pulp, and pulpboard were offset by reduced demand for newsprint and paper.

For


, paper, clay, and forest products revenues are anticipated to decline reflecting lower fuel surcharge revenue and a negative mix of business, offset in part by slightly higher volumes.  Volume growth is expected to be driven by higher woodchip, wood pellet, lumber, and pulp shipments as we anticipate the continued recovery of the housing market to increase demand, offset in part by lower municipal solid waste (loss of a customer) and newsprint and paper shipments as demand declines.

INTERMODAL

revenues increased $178 million, or 7%, compared with


, reflecting an 8% growth in volume.

Domestic volume (including truckload and intermodal marketing companies, Triple Crown Services, and Premium business) improved

6%

, a result of growth in strategic corridors, continued highway-to-rail conversions, and higher demand for rail service from existing customers.  International volume grew

10%

due to increased demand from existing customers and expanded service opportunities.

In


, intermodal revenues increased

$143 million

, or

6%

, compared with


, reflecting a

6%

growth in volume.  Average revenue per unit was flat.  Domestic volume improved

7%

, the result of continued highway-to-rail conversions and additional business associated with the opening of new intermodal terminals.  International volume grew

6%

due to growth with existing customers as well as new service lanes.

For


, we anticipate higher intermodal revenues due to increased volumes as a result of continued highway conversions and growth associated with new and existing customers.  Average revenue per unit is expected to be lower as pricing gains are offset by reduced fuel surcharge revenue.

Railway Operating Expenses

Railway operating expenses in


were

$8.0 billion

, up $61 million, or 1%, compared to


.  Expenses in


were

$8.0 billion

, up

$72 million

, or

, increases in volume-related costs were offset in part by lower postretirement and pension benefit costs as well as lower fuel prices.  For


, higher wage rates and volume-related expense increases were offset in part by lower costs resulting from network efficiencies.

K


The following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications.

Materials and other

expenses increased $112 million, or 14%, in 2014, but decreased $31 million, or 4%, in 2013, as shown in the following table.

Volume growth in 2014 and 2013 drove increases in locomotive and equipment maintenance and repair costs for both years.  Additionally, the harsh winter weather experienced in the first quarter of 2014 resulted in increased maintenance activity, which negatively impacted the year-over-year comparison.  Casualties and other claims expenses include the estimates of costs related to personal injury (PI), property damage, and environmental matters.  The increase in expense in 2014 reflected lower favorable PI reserve adjustments for prior years' claim amounts than those seen in 2013, which were driven by improved historical trend rates related to PI liabilities.

We maintain substantial amounts of insurance for potential third-party liability and property damage claims.  We also retain reasonable levels of risk through self-insurance.  For further discussion of casualty claims and insurance see Note 16.

K


Purchased services and rents

includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors, including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals.  This category of expenses increased $58 million, or 4%, in 2014, and $25 million, or 2%, in 2013.

The increase in 2014 for purchased services expense reflected the impact of higher volumes and reduced network velocity on intermodal operations and joint facilities costs.  Additionally, higher maintenance and repair costs were offset in part by reduced expenses associated with the shared asset areas (including equity in the earnings of Conrail, see Note 5).  The increase in 2013 reflected higher volume-related activities and software expenses, partially offset by lower professional and consulting fees and travel expenses.

Equipment rents, which includes our cost of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to us for the use of our equipment, increased in 2014 as a result of higher volumes and network congestion, but decreased in 2013 as a result of increased velocity and improved equipment utilization.

Depreciation

expense increased by $35 million, or 4%, in 2014, and was flat in 2013.  Both periods reflected our larger roadway and equipment capital base as we continue to invest in our infrastructure and rolling stock.  In 2013, that increase was completely offset by the favorable impact of an equipment depreciation study that was completed during the first quarter of 2013.

Fuel

expense, which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations, decreased $39 million, or 2%, in 2014 but increased $36 million, or 2%, in 2013.  The decrease in 2014 was principally the result of lower locomotive fuel prices (down 6%), offset in part by higher locomotive fuel consumption (up 4%).  The increase in 2013 reflected higher locomotive fuel consumption (up 4%), offset in part by lower locomotive fuel prices (down 2%).  We consumed approximately 494 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2014 compared with 476 million gallons in 2013.  Should fuel prices remain at current levels, we would expect to see a significant savings in fuel expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014.

Compensation and benefits

, which represents 36% of total operating expenses, decreased $105 million, or 3%, in


, reflecting changes in:

•

postretirement and pension benefit costs (down $152 million),

•

health and welfare benefit costs (down $25 million),

•

pay rates (up $57 million), and

•

payroll taxes (up $21 million).

In


, compensation and benefits increased

$42 million

, or

1%

over


, reflecting changes in:

•

pay rates (up $59 million),

•

incentive and stock-based compensation (up $39 million),

•

lower activity levels (down $48 million) that reflected improved employee productivity, and

•

payroll taxes (down $16 million).

Our employment averaged 29,482 in


, compared with 30,103 in


, and 30,943 in


.  Looking forward to 2015, we expect employment levels to be higher than 2014 as we continue to add resources to our network.

K


Other Income – Net

Other income – net was $104 million in 2014, $233 million in 2013, and $129 million in 2012 (Note 2).  Both comparisons reflect the Michigan land sale ($97 million) that occurred in 2013.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense in 2014 was $1.1 billion, an effective rate of 36.2%, compared with 35.6% in 2013 and 36.6% in 2012.  The 2014 and 2013 years benefited from favorable reductions in deferred tax expense for state law changes and certain business tax credits.

The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 (2014 Act), enacted on December 19, 2014, extended for the year 2014 fifty-percent bonus depreciation and certain business tax credits that benefit us.  While bonus depreciation does not affect our total provision for income taxes or effective rate, the absence of bonus depreciation will increase current income tax expense and the related cash outflows for the payment of income taxes.  The effect of this tax legislation will be seen as a reduction in our 2015 cash outflows for income taxes as our required year-end estimated tax payment was due and paid before the 2014 Act was enacted.

IRS examinations have been completed for all years prior to 2011. Our consolidated federal income tax returns for 2011 and 2012 are currently being audited by the IRS.  We anticipate that the IRS will complete its examination in 2015.  We do not expect that the resolution of the examination will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash provided by operating activities,

our principal source of liquidity, was

$2.9 billion

in 2014 and

$3.1 billion

in both


and


.  The decrease in 2014 reflected increased tax payments (see above), offset in part by improved operating results. We had working capital of $998 million at December 31,


, compared with $770 million at December 31,


, primarily reflecting reduced current maturities of long-term debt.  Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances totaled $973 million and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and were invested in accordance with our corporate investment policy as approved by the Board of Directors.  The portfolio contains securities that are subject to market risk.  There are no limits or restrictions on our access to these assets.  We expect cash on hand combined with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing obligations.

K


Contractual obligations at December 31,


, were comprised of interest on fixed-rate long-term debt and capital leases, long-term debt and capital leases (Note 8), operating leases (Note 9), agreements with CRC (Note 5), unconditional purchase obligations (Note 16), long-term advances from Conrail (Note 5), and unrecognized tax benefits (Note 3):

*   When the amount and timing of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits can be reasonably estimated, the amount is shown in the table under the appropriate period.  When the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated, the amount is shown in the Other column.

Off balance sheet arrangements

consist of obligations related to operating leases, which are included in the table of contractual obligations above and disclosed in Note 9.

Cash used in investing activities

was

$2.0 billion

in


, compared with

$1.9 billion

in


, and

$2.0 billion

in


.  The increase in 2014 primarily reflected increased use of cash for property additions and COLI investments, which were partially offset by higher short-term investment maturities.  The decrease in 2013 resulted from lower property additions and property sales that were partially offset by increased investment purchases, net of sales.

Property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category.  The following tables show capital spending (including capital leases) and track and equipment statistics for the past five years.

K


For


, we have budgeted $2.4 billion for property additions.  The anticipated spending includes $930 million for the normalized replacement of rail, ties and ballast and the improvement or replacement of bridges.  Planned equipment spending of $640 million includes used and rebuilt locomotives, intermodal containers and chasis, coal cars, covered and open coil cars, mill gondolas, multilevel automobile racks, and covered hoppers.  Investments in facilities and terminals are anticipated to be $240 million and include terminals and equipment to add capacity to our intermodal network (including Crescent Corridor), new or expanded bulk transfer facilities, improvements to vehicle distribution facilities, and upgrades and expansions of our mechanical service shops.  For 2015, we have budgeted $220 million for the continued implementation of positive train control (PTC) and expect post-2015 PTC-related property additions to total over $450 million.  We also expect to spend $100 million on infrastructure improvements to increase mainline capacity, accommodate business growth and provide our share of funding for various public/private partnership investments such as Crescent Corridor and the Chicago CREATE project.  Technology investments of $70 million are planned for new or upgraded systems and computers.

Additionally, in November 2014 we announced a proposed transaction under which we would acquire 282 miles of the Delaware & Hudson Railway Co. (D&H) rail line between Sunbury, Pennsylvania and Schenectady, New York for $217 million.  The acquisition of this property is subject to approval by the STB and if approved, expected to be completed in 2015.

The Crescent Corridor consists of a program of projects for infrastructure and other facility improvements geared toward creating a seamless, high-capacity intermodal route spanning 11 states from New Jersey to Louisiana and offering truck-competitive service along several major interstate highway corridors, including I-81, I-85, I-20, I-40, I-59, I-78, and I-75.  Based on the public benefits that stand to be derived in the form of highway congestion relief, we plan to implement certain elements of the Crescent Corridor through a series of public-private partnerships.  Currently, the Crescent Corridor has received or expects to receive a total of $312 million in public capital funding commitments from the Commonwealths of Pennsylvania and Virginia, the State of Tennessee, the federal TIGER Stimulus Program and other federal funding sources related to projects in Alabama, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and North Carolina.  With respect to the private funding component, we currently anticipate spending up to $344 million ($291 million of which has been spent to date) for the substantial completion of work on these projects, which is expected in 2015.  This includes planned investments for the Crescent Corridor that approximate $42 million in 2015.  If and when demand warrants, additional improvements and expansions beyond these amounts may be made to the Crescent Corridor.

Cash used in financing activities

was

$1.3 billion

in


, compared with

$394 million

in


, and

$694 million

in


.  The increase in 2014 was driven primarily by higher debt repayments and lower debt proceeds, partially

K


offset by reduced share repurchase activity (see Note 14).  The change in 2013 reflected lower share repurchases and reduced proceeds from borrowings, net of debt repayments.

Share repurchases totaled

$318 million

in


,

$627 million

in


, and

$1.3 billion

in


for the purchase and retirement of

3.1 million

,

8.3 million

, and

18.8 million

shares, respectively.  On August 1, 2012, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 50 million shares of Common Stock through December 31, 2017, and 35.2 million shares remain under this authority as of December 31,


.  The timing and volume of future share repurchases will be guided by our assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors.  Any near-term purchases under the program are expected to be made with internally generated cash, cash on hand, or proceeds from borrowings.

During the fourth quarter of 2013, we issued $400 million of 3.85% senior notes due 2024.  During the third quarter of 2013, we issued $500 million of 4.80% senior notes due 2043.  Our debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 42.1% at December 31,


, compared with 45.6% at December 31,


.

We further discuss our current securities issuance authority from our our Board of Directors, our credit agreement, and our accounts receivable securitization program in Note 8 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, all of which provide for additional access to liquidity should the need arise.

Upcoming annual debt maturities are relatively modest (Note 8).  Overall, our goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support our business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  These estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, and future events are likely to occur that may require us to make changes to these estimates and assumptions.  Accordingly, we regularly review these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in the business environment, and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  We regularly discuss the development, selection, and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires us to make several estimates and assumptions (Note 11).  These include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans’ assets, projected increases in medical costs, and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality.  In addition, the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value.  We make these estimates based on our historical experience and other information that we deem pertinent under the circumstances (for example, expectations of future stock market performance).  We utilize an independent actuarial consulting firm’s studies to assist us in selecting appropriate actuarial assumptions and valuing related liabilities.

Net pension expense, which is included in “Compensation and benefits” in the Consolidated Statements of Income, was

$31 million

for


.  In recording this amount, we assumed a long-term investment rate of return of

8.25%

, which was supported by the long-term total rate of return on plan assets since inception, as well as our expectation of future returns.  A one-percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a

$18 million

change in pension expense.  During 2014, new mortality tables were released for consideration in determining defined benefit plan obligations.  We analyzed the experience in our pension plans and updated our mortality rates accordingly, which resulted in an actuarial loss of approximately $165 million.  We review assumptions related to our defined benefit plans annually, and while changes are likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age,

K


projected earnings, and mortality, they are not expected to have a material effect on our net pension expense or net pension liability in the future.  The net pension liability is recorded at net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments.  We utilize analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans are matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds.  We use the results of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans.

Net benefit for other postretirement benefits, which is also included in “Compensation and benefits,” was $6 million for


.  Historically, medical inflation has been a significant component of the estimate for postretirement benefits, however, its effect has been reduced substantially due to the plan amendment made in 2014 (Note 11).  Since there is a fixed benefit for Medicare-eligible retirees there is no medical inflation assumed for this population.  The medical inflation factor is still applicable for pre-Medicare-eligible retirees.

Properties and Depreciation

Most of our total assets are long-lived railway properties (Note 6).  As disclosed in Note 1, properties are depreciated using group depreciation.  The primary depreciation method for our asset base is group life.  Units of production is the principal method of depreciation for rail in high density corridors and for depletion of natural resources.  Remaining properties are depreciated generally using the straight-line method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives.  See Note 1 for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates in this area.

Depreciation expense for


totaled

$951 million

.  Our composite depreciation rates for


are disclosed in Note 6; a one-tenth percentage point increase (or decrease) in these rates would have resulted in a $36 million increase (or decrease) to depreciation expense.  For


, roadway depreciation rates ranged from

0.83%

to

33.33%

and equipment depreciation rates ranged from

1.55%

to

33.33%

.

Personal Injury, Environmental, and Legal Liabilities

Casualties and other claims expense, included in “Materials and other,” consists primarily of our accrual for personal injury liabilities and environmental remediation costs.

To aid in valuing personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during each period, we utilize studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm.  The actuarial firm studies our historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements, taking into account relevant outside influences.  We adjust the liability quarterly based upon our assessment and the results of the study.  Our estimate of loss liabilities is subject to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events and as such the actual loss may vary from the estimated liability recorded.

We are subject to various jurisdictions’ environmental laws and regulations.  We record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably.  Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates.  Additionally, our Environmental Policy Council (composed of senior managers) oversees and interprets our environmental policy.  Operating expenses, included in "Materials and other" and "Purchased services and rents," for environmental matters totaled $45 million in


, $57 million in


, and $40 million in


, and property additions for environmental matters totaled $9 million in


, $8 million in


, and $6 million in


.  Property additions for environmental matters in


are expected to be about $15 million.

We and/or certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations.  When we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, it is accrued through a charge to earnings.

K


For a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates in accounting for personal injury and environmental matters see Note 16.

Income Taxes

Our net long-term deferred tax liability totaled

$8.8 billion

at December 31,


(Note 3).  This liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements.  After application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in our income tax returns.  For state income and other taxes, judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions. A valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. We had a

$33 million

valuation allowance on

$606 million

of deferred tax assets as of December 31,


, reflecting the expectation that almost all of these assets will be realized.

In addition, we have a recorded liability for our estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.  Judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and, if so, judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority.  We believe this liability for uncertain tax positions to be adequate.  Income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded.  For every one half percent change in the


effective tax rate, net income would have changed by $16 million.

OTHER MATTERS

Labor Agreements

More than 80% of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. These agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act.  We largely bargain nationally in concert with other major railroads, represented by the National Carriers Conference Committee (NCCC).  Moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and the unions may propose changes to the agreements.  The moratorium provisions of the current agreements have now expired, formal proposals to change the agreements have been made, and negotiations with the various labor unions have begun.  Separately, in January 2015 we reached an agreement covering wages and work rules through 2019 with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) which represents approximately 4,600 of our locomotive engineers.  Changes to the BLET benefit plan will be bargained nationally through the NCCC.

Market Risks

We manage overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed- and floating-rate debt instruments. At December 31,


, debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled $200 million. A one-percentage point increase in interest rates would increase total annual interest expense related to all variable debt by approximately $2 million. We consider it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

New Accounting Pronouncement

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,

"Revenue from Contracts with Customers."

This update, effective for our annual and interim reporting periods beginning January 1, 2017, will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP and requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.  Early application is not permitted, but once effective, permits the use of either the

K


retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.  We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Inflation

In preparing financial statements, GAAP requires the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property.  As a capital-intensive company, we have most of our capital invested in such property.  The replacement cost of these assets, as well as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that may be identified by the use of words like “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “consider,” “project,” and similar references to the future.  Forward-looking statements reflect our good-faith evaluation of information currently available.

However, such statements are dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external variables over which we have little or no control, including:  transportation of hazardous materials as a common carrier by rail; acts of terrorism or war; general economic conditions including, but not limited to, fluctuation and competition within the industries of our customers; competition and consolidation within the transportation industry; the operations of carriers with which we interchange; disruptions to our technology infrastructure, including computer systems; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages; commercial, operating, environmental, and climate change legislative and regulatory developments; results of litigation; natural events such as severe weather, hurricanes, and floods; unpredictable demand for rail services; fluctuation in supplies and prices of key materials, in particular diesel fuel; and changes in securities and capital markets.  For additional discussion of significant risk factors applicable to our business, see Part II, Item 1A “Risk Factors.”  Forward-looking statements are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guarantee of future performance or results, nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved.  As a result, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements.  We undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Norfolk Southern Corporation:

We have audited Norfolk Southern Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,


, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated

Framework  (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  Norfolk Southern Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Norfolk Southern Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,


, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Norfolk Southern Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31,

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The following Notes are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description of Business

Norfolk Southern Corporation (Norfolk Southern) is a Virginia-based holding company engaged principally in the rail transportation business, operating approximately

20,000

miles of road primarily in the East and Midwest.  These consolidated financial statements include Norfolk Southern and its majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries (collectively, NS, we, us, and our).  Norfolk Southern’s major subsidiary is Norfolk Southern Railway Company (NSR).  All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

NSR and its railroad subsidiaries transport raw materials, intermediate products and finished goods classified in the following commodity groups (percent of total railway operating revenues in


): intermodal (

22%

); coal (

21%

);  chemicals (

16%

); metals/construction (

13%

); agriculture/consumer products/government (

13%

); automotive (

8%

); and, paper/clay/forest products (

7%

).  Although most of our customers are domestic, ultimate points of origination or destination for some of the products transported (particularly coal bound for export and some intermodal containers) may be outside the U.S.  More than

80%

of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  We periodically review our estimates, including those related to the recoverability and useful lives of assets, as well as liabilities for litigation, environmental remediation, casualty claims, income taxes and pension and other postretirement benefits.  Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Transportation revenue is recognized proportionally as a shipment moves from origin to destination, and related expenses are recognized as incurred.  Refunds (which are primarily volume-based incentives) are recorded as a reduction to revenues on the basis of management’s best estimate of projected liability, which is based on historical activity, current shipment counts and the expectation of future activity.  We regularly monitor our contract refund liability and, historically, the estimates have not differed significantly from the amounts ultimately refunded.   Switching, demurrage and other incidental service revenues are recognized when the services are performed.

Cash Equivalents

“Cash equivalents” are highly liquid investments purchased three months or less from maturity.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Our allowance for doubtful accounts was

$6 million

at December 31,


and

$3 million

at December 31,


.  To determine our allowance for doubtful accounts, we evaluate historical loss experience (which has not been significant), the characteristics of current accounts, and general economic conditions and trends.

K


Materials and Supplies

“Materials and supplies,” consisting mainly of fuel oil and items for maintenance of property and equipment, are stated at the lower of average cost or market.  The cost of materials and supplies expected to be used in property additions or improvements is included in “Properties.”

Investments

Debt securities classified as “held-to-maturity” are reported at amortized cost.

Investments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence over but do not control the entity are accounted for using the equity method, whereby the investment is carried at the cost of the acquisition plus our equity in undistributed earnings or losses since acquisition.

Properties

“Properties” are stated principally at cost and are depreciated using the group method whereby assets with similar characteristics, use, and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes and depreciated using a composite depreciation rate.  This methodology treats each asset class as a pool of resources, not as singular items.  We use  approximately


depreciable asset classes.  The primary depreciation method for our asset base is group life.  Units of production is the principal method of depreciation for rail in high density corridors and for depletion of natural resources (Note 2).  Remaining properties are depreciated generally using the straight-line method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives.  Depreciation in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows includes both depreciation and depletion.

Depreciation expense is based on our assumptions concerning expected service lives of our properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be received upon their retirement.  In developing these assumptions, we utilize periodic depreciation studies that are performed by an independent outside firm of consulting engineers and approved by the Surface Transportation Board (STB).

Our depreciation studies are conducted about every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets and other roadway property.

The frequency of these studies is consistent with guidelines established by the STB.  Key factors that are considered in developing average service life and salvage estimates include:

•

statistical analysis of historical retirement data and surviving asset records;

•

review of historical salvage received and current market rates;

•

review of our operations including expected changes in technology, customer demand, maintenance practices and asset management strategies;

•

review of accounting policies and assumptions; and

•

industry review and analysis.

The units of production depreciation rate for rail in high density corridors is derived based on consideration of annual gross ton miles as compared to the total or ultimate capacity of rail in these corridors.  Our experience has shown that traffic density is a leading factor in determination of the expected service life of rail in high density corridors.  In developing the respective depreciation rate, consideration is also given to several rail characteristics including age, weight, condition (new or second hand) and type (curve or straight).  As a result, a composite depreciation rate is developed which is applied to the depreciable base.

We adjust our rates based on the results of these studies and implement the changes prospectively.  The studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by the study.  Any such deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the affected class of property, as determined by the study.  For


, roadway depreciation rates ranged from

0.83%

to

33.3%

and equipment depreciation rates ranged from

1.55%

to

33.33%

.

K


We capitalize interest on major projects during the period of their construction.  Expenditures, including those on leased assets, that extend an asset’s useful life or increase its utility are capitalized.  Expenditures capitalized include those that are directly related to a capital project and may include materials, labor and equipment, in addition to an allocable portion of indirect costs that clearly relate to a particular project. Due to the capital intensive nature of the railroad industry, a significant portion of annual capital spending relates to the replacement of self-constructed assets. Because removal activities occur in conjunction with replacement, removal costs are estimated based on an average percentage of time employees replacing assets spend on removal functions.  Costs related to repairs and maintenance activities that do not extend an asset’s useful life or increase its utility are expensed when such repairs are performed.

When properties other than land and nonrail assets are sold or retired in the ordinary course of business, the cost of the assets, net of sale proceeds or salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized in earnings.  Actual historical cost values are retired when available, such as with equipment assets.  The use of estimates in recording the retirement of certain roadway assets is necessary based on the impracticality of tracking individual asset costs.  When retiring rail, ties and ballast, we use statistical curves that indicate the relative distribution of the age of the assets retired.  The historical cost of other roadway assets is estimated using a combination of inflation indices specific to the rail industry and those published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.  The indices are applied to the replacement value based on the age of the retired assets.  These indices are used because they closely correlate with the costs of roadway assets.  Gains and losses on disposal of land and nonrail assets are included in “Other income – net” (Note 2) since such income is not a product of our railroad operations.

A retirement is considered abnormal if it does not occur in the normal course of business, if it relates to disposition of a large segment of an asset class and if the retirement varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies, which inherently consider the impact of normal retirements on expected service lives and depreciation rates.  Gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recognized in earnings.

We review the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flows.  Assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value.

Required Accounting Changes

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,

“Revenue from Contracts with Customers.”

This update, effective for our annual and interim reporting periods beginning January 1, 2017, will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP and requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. Early application is not permitted, but once effective, the ASU permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

2.  Other Income – Net

“Other income – net” includes income and costs not part of rail operations and the income generated by the activities of our noncarrier subsidiaries as well as the costs incurred by those subsidiaries in their operations.

3.  Income Taxes

Provisions for Income Taxes

Other current assets include prepaid income taxes of

$248 million

and

Reconciliation of Statutory Rate to Effective Rate

The “Provision for income taxes” in the Consolidated Statements of Income differs from the amounts computed by applying the statutory federal corporate tax rate as follows:

Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities

Certain items are reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax purposes.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in recognition of these differences.  The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are as follows:

Except for amounts for which a valuation allowance has been provided, we believe that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets.  The

K


valuation allowance at the end of each year primarily relates to subsidiary state income tax net operating losses that may not be utilized prior to their expiration.  The valuation allowance for 2014 also includes state investment tax credits that may not be utilized prior to their expiration.  The total valuation allowance increased by

$1 million

in


and

$13 million

in


.

Uncertain Tax Positions

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31,


, are potential benefits of

$28 million

that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.  Unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amount recorded.

IRS examinations have been completed for all years prior to 2011. Our consolidated federal income tax returns for 2011 and 2012 are currently being audited by the IRS.  We anticipate that the IRS will complete its examination in 2015.  State income tax returns generally are subject to examination for a period of three to four years after filing of the return.  In addition, we are generally obligated to report changes in taxable income arising from federal income tax examinations to the states within a period of up to two years from the date the federal examination is final.  We have various state income tax returns either under examination, administrative appeal, or litigation.  We expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31,


, will decrease by approximately

$6 million

in


due to tax positions for which there was an uncertainty about the timing of deductibility in earlier years, but deductibility may become certain by the close of


.  We do not expect that the aforementioned potential change in unrecognized tax benefits will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

Interest related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is included in “Other income – net,” totaled

$1 million

of expense in both


and 2013, and

$1 million

of income in


.  There were no penalties related to tax matters in


,


, and


.  We have recorded a liability of

$6 million

at December 31,


, and

$4 million

at December 31,


, for the payment of interest on unrecognized tax benefits.  We have no liability recorded at December 31,


and


, for the payment of penalties on unrecognized tax benefits.

4.  Fair Value

Fair Value Measurements

ASC 820-10,

“Fair Value Measurements,”

established a framework for measuring fair value and a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels, as follows:

The asset’s or liability’s fair value measurement level within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Other than those assets and liabilities described below that approximate fair value, there were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2014 or 2013.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

We have evaluated the fair values of financial instruments and methods used to determine those fair values.  The fair values of “Cash and cash equivalents,” “Short-term investments,” “Accounts receivable,” “Accounts payable,” and “Short-term debt” approximate carrying values because of the short maturity of these financial instruments.  The carrying value of corporate-owned life insurance is recorded at cash surrender value and, accordingly, approximates fair value. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values for the remaining financial instruments, excluding investments accounted for under the equity method, consisted of the following at December 31:

Underlying net assets were used to estimate the fair value of investments with the exception of notes receivable, which are based on future discounted cash flows.  The fair values of long-term debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or discounted cash flows using current interest rates for debt with similar terms, company rating, and remaining maturity.

K


The following tables set forth the fair value of long-term investment and long-term debt balances disclosed above by valuation technique level, within the fair value hierarchy (there were no level 3 valued assets or liabilities).

Investment in Conrail

Through a limited liability company, we and CSX Corporation (CSX) jointly own Conrail Inc. (Conrail), whose primary subsidiary is Consolidated Rail Corporation (CRC).  We have a

58%

economic and

50%

voting interest in the jointly owned entity, and CSX has the remainder of the economic and voting interests.  We are amortizing the excess of the purchase price over Conrail’s net equity using the principles of purchase accounting, based primarily on the estimated useful lives of Conrail’s depreciable property and equipment, including the related deferred tax effect of the differences in book and tax accounting bases for such assets, as all of the purchase price at acquisition was allocable to Conrail’s tangible assets and liabilities.

At December 31,


, based on the funded status of Conrail’s pension plans, we decreased our proportional investment in Conrail by

$12 million

.  This resulted in expense of

$11 million

recorded to “Other comprehensive loss” and a combined federal and state deferred tax asset of

$1 million

.

At December 31,


, based on the funded status of Conrail’s pension plans, we increased our proportional investment in Conrail by

$37 million

.  This resulted in income of

$34 million

recorded to “Other comprehensive income” and a combined federal and state deferred tax liability of

$3 million

.

At December 31,


, the difference between our investment in Conrail and our share of Conrail’s underlying net equity was

$529 million

.  Our equity in the earnings of Conrail, net of amortization, included in “Purchased services and rents” was

$39 million

for 2014.  For 2013 and 2012, this amounted to

$42 million

and

$34 million

and was included in “Other income – net.”

CRC owns and operates certain properties (the Shared Assets Areas) for the joint and exclusive benefit of NSR and CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT).  The costs of operating the Shared Assets Areas are borne by NSR and CSXT based on usage.  In addition, NSR and CSXT pay CRC a fee for access to the Shared Assets Areas. “Purchased services and rents” and “Fuel” include expenses for amounts due to CRC for operation of the Shared Assets Areas totaling

$144 million

in


,

$146 million

in


, and

$147 million

in


. Future minimum lease payments due to CRC under the Shared Assets Areas agreements are as follows:

$36 million

in each of 2015 through 2019 and

$160 million

thereafter. We provide certain general and administrative support functions to Conrail, the fees for which are billed in accordance with several service-provider arrangements and approximate

$8 million

annually.

In 2014, we converted approximately

$147 million

of our accounts payable into the long-term advance from Conrail included in "Other Liabilities."  “Accounts payable” includes

$56 million

at December 31,


, and

$187 million

at December 31,


, due to Conrail for the operation of the Shared Assets Areas.  “Other liabilities” includes

$280 million

and

$133 million

We have in place a

$350 million

receivables securitization facility under which NSR sells substantially all of its eligible third-party receivables to a subsidiary, which in turn may transfer beneficial interests in the receivables to various commercial paper vehicles.  Amounts received under the facility are accounted for as borrowings.  Under this facility, we received

$200 million

and repaid

$200 million

At both December 31,


and


, the amounts outstanding under the receivables securitization facility were

$200 million

at an average variable interest rate of

1.28%

and

1.23%

, respectively.  Our intent is to refinance

$100 million

of these borrowings on a long-term basis, which is supported by our

$750 million

credit agreement (see below).  Accordingly, these amounts outstanding are included in the line item “Long-term debt” and the remaining

$100 million

outstanding at both December 31,


and December 31,


, is included in the line item “Short-term debt” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The facility has a

two

year term which was renewed and amended in October


to run until October 2016.  At December 31,

10.  Other Liabilities

11.  Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

We have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans covering principally salaried employees.  We also provide specified health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retired employees; these plans can be amended or terminated at our option.  Under our self-insured retiree health care plan, for those participants who are not Medicare-eligible, a defined percentage of health care expenses is covered for retired employees and their dependents, reduced by any deductibles, coinsurance, and, in some cases, coverage provided under other group insurance policies.

In the first quarter of 2014, we amended our retiree medical plan for participants who are Medicare-eligible resulting in a remeasurement of our plan assets and obligations.  Effective July 1, 2014, participants who are Medicare-eligible are not covered under the self-insured retiree health care plan but instead are provided with an employer-funded health reimbursement account which can be used for reimbursement of health insurance premiums or eligible out-of-pocket medical expenses, and which is not subject to health care cost trends.  The Medicare Part D subsidy no longer applies as Medicare-eligible participants are no longer covered under the self-insured retiree health care plan.

K


Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations and Plan Assets

Our accumulated benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans is

$2.2 billion

and

$1.9 billion

at December 31,


and


, respectively.  Our unfunded pension plans, included above, which in all cases have no assets and therefore have an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets, had projected benefit obligations of

$274 million

at December 31,


, and

$231 million

at December 31,


, and had accumulated benefit obligations of

$244 million

at December 31,


, and

$206 million

at December 31,


.

K


Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Cost Components

Other Changes in Plan Assets and Benefit Obligations Recognized in Other Comprehensive Loss

Net actuarial losses arising during the year to our pension and other postretirement benefits were due primarily to a decrease in our discount rate and a change in our mortality rate.

The estimated net losses for the pension benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic cost over the next year are

$65 million

.  The estimated prior service benefit for the other postretirement benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit over the next year is

$24 million

.

K


Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Assumptions

Costs for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined based on actuarial valuations that reflect appropriate assumptions as of the measurement date, ordinarily the beginning of each year.  The funded status of the plans is determined using appropriate assumptions as of each year end.  A summary of the major assumptions follows:


Current year other postretirement benefits cost was based on a discount rate of

4.65%

prior to our retiree medical plan amendment in the first quarter of 2014, and

3.90%

after the plan amendment.

To determine the discount rates, we utilize analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and other postretirement benefit plans were matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds.  We use the results of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans.

Health Care Cost Trend Assumptions

For measurement purposes at December 31,


, increases in the per capita cost of pre-Medicare covered health care benefits were assumed to be

6.56%

for


.  It is assumed the rate will decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of

5.0%

for 2019 and remain at that level thereafter.

Assumed health care cost trend rates affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements.  To illustrate, a one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend would have the following effects:

K


Asset Management

Ten investment firms manage our defined benefit pension plans’ assets under investment guidelines approved by our Benefits Investment Committee that is comprised of members of our management.  Investments are restricted to domestic and international equity securities, domestic and international fixed income securities, and unleveraged exchange-traded options and financial futures.  Limitations restrict investment concentration and use of certain derivative investments.  The target asset allocation for equity is

75%

of the pension plans’ assets.  The fixed income portfolio is invested in the Barclays Government/Credit Bond Index Fund, except that the Canadian earmarked portion of the portfolio is maintained in U.S. Treasury Bonds. Equity investments must be in liquid securities listed on national exchanges.  No investment is permitted in our securities (except through commingled pension trust funds).  Investment managers’ returns are expected to meet or exceed selected market indices by prescribed margins.

Our pension plans’ weighted-average asset allocations, by asset category, were as follows:

The other postretirement benefit plan assets consist primarily of trust-owned variable life insurance policies with an asset allocation at December 31,


, of

66%

in equity securities and

34%

in debt securities compared with

65%

in equity securities and

35%

in debt securities at December 31,


.  The target asset allocation for equity is between

50%

and

75%

of the plan’s assets.

The plans’ assumed future returns are based principally on the asset allocations and historic returns for the plans’ asset classes determined from both actual plan returns and, over longer time periods, expected market returns for those asset classes. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets that recognizes changes in fair value over a

three

-year period. We assumed a rate of return on pension plan assets of

8.25%

for each


,


, and


.  A one-percentage point change to the rate of return assumption would result in an

$18 million

change to the net pension cost and, as a result, an equal change in “Compensation and benefits” expense.  For


, we assume an

8.25%

return on pension plan assets.

K


Fair Value of Plan Assets

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for pension plan assets measured at fair value.

Common stock:  Shares held by the plan at year end are valued at the official closing price as defined by the exchange or at the most recent trade price of a security at the close of the active market.

Common collective trusts:  Valued at the net asset value (NAV) of shares held by the plan at year end, based on the quoted market prices of the underlying assets of the trusts.  The investments are valued using NAV as a practical expedient for fair value.  The common collective trusts hold equity securities, fixed income securities and cash and cash equivalents.

Commingled funds:  Valued at the NAV of shares held by the plan at year end, based on the quoted market prices of the underlying assets of the funds.  The investments are valued using NAV as a practical expedient for fair value.  The commingled funds hold equity securities.

Interest bearing cash:  Short-term bills or notes are valued at an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for the security at year end using observable market-based inputs; money market funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the funds are traded.

United States Government and agencies securities:  Valued at an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security at year end using observable market-based inputs.  Inflation adjusted instruments utilize the appropriate index factor.

Preferred stock:   Shares held by the plan at year end are valued at the most recent trade price of a security at the close of the active market or at an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a similar security at year end using observable market-based inputs.

K


The following table sets forth the pension plans’ assets by valuation technique level, within the fair value hierarchy (there were no level 3 valued assets).

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for other postretirement benefit plan assets measured at fair value.

Trust-owned life insurance:  Valued at our share of the net assets of trust-owned life insurance issued by a major insurance company.  The underlying investments of that trust consist of a U.S. stock account and a U.S. bond account, and a loan asset account, but may retain cash at times as well.  The U.S. stock account and U.S. bond account are valued based upon the aggregate market values of the underlying investments, and the loan asset account is valued at cash surrender value at the time of the loan, plus accrued interest.

The other postretirement benefit plan assets consisted of trust-owned life insurance with fair values of

$262 million

and

$239 million

at December 31,


and


respectively, and are valued under level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. There were no level 1 or level 3 related assets.

The methods used to value pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.  Furthermore, while we believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

K


Contributions and Estimated Future Benefit Payments

In


, we expect to contribute approximately

$14 million

to our unfunded pension plans for payments to pensioners and approximately

$19 million

to our other postretirement benefit plans for retiree health and death benefits.  We do not expect to contribute to our funded pension plan in


.

Benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:

Other Postretirement Coverage

Under collective bargaining agreements, Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries participate in a multi-employer benefit plan, which provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to eligible union employees.  Premiums under this plan are expensed as incurred and totaled

$36 million

in


,

$41 million

in


, and

$47 million

in


.

Section 401(k) Plans

Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries provide Section 401(k) savings plans for employees.  Under the plans, we match a portion of employee contributions, subject to applicable limitations.  Our matching contributions, recorded as an expense, under these plans were

$20 million

in


,

$19 million

in


, and

$18 million

in


.

12.  Stock-Based Compensation

Under the stockholder-approved Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), the Compensation Committee (Committee), made up of nonemployee members of the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer (if delegated such authority by the Committee), may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock units (RSUs), restricted shares, performance share units (PSUs), and performance shares, up to a maximum of

96,125,000

shares of our common stock (Common Stock).

The number of shares remaining for issuance under LTIP is reduced (i) by


for each award granted as a stock option or stock-settled SAR, or (ii) by

1.61

for an award made in the form other than a stock option or stock-settled SAR.  Under the Board-approved Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan (TSOP), the Committee may grant stock options up to a maximum of

6,000,000

shares of Common Stock; as a broad-based stock option plan, stockholder approval of TSOP was not required.  We use newly issued shares to satisfy any exercises and awards under LTIP and TSOP.  Shares available for future grants are shown in the table below.

LTIP also permits the payment – on a current or a deferred basis and in cash or in stock – of dividend equivalents on shares of Common Stock covered by stock options, RSUs, or PSUs in an amount commensurate with regular quarterly dividends paid on Common Stock.  With respect to stock options, if employment of the participant is terminated for any reason, including retirement, disability, or death, we have no further obligation to make any

K


dividend equivalent payments.  Regarding RSUs, if employment of the participant is terminated for any reason other than retirement, disability, or death, we have no further obligation to make any dividend equivalent payments.  Should an employee terminate employment, they are not required to forfeit dividend equivalent payments already received.  Outstanding PSUs do not currently receive dividend equivalent payments.

During the first quarter of 2014, the Committee granted stock options, RSUs and PSUs pursuant to LTIP and granted stock options pursuant to TSOP.  Receipt of an award under LTIP was made contingent upon the awardee’s execution of a non-compete agreement, and all awards under LTIP were made subject to forfeiture in the event the awardee “engages in competing employment” for a period of time following retirement.

Accounting Method

We account for our grants of stock options, RSUs, PSUs, and dividend equivalent payments in accordance with ASC 718

“Compensation-Stock Compensation.”

Accordingly, all awards result in charges to net income while dividend equivalent payments, which are all related to equity classified awards, are charged to retained income. Related compensation costs were

$44 million

in


,

$54 million

in


, and

$45 million

in


.  The total tax effects recognized in income in relation to stock-based compensation were benefits of

$14 million

in


,

$18 million

in


, and

$14 million

in


.

“Common stock issued – net” in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended                December 31,


,


, and


includes tax benefits generated from tax deductions in excess of compensation costs recognized for share-based awards of

$37 million

,

$38 million

, and

$42 million

, respectively.

Stock Options

Option exercise prices may not be less than the average of the high and low prices at which Common Stock is traded on the grant date and, effective for LTIP options granted after May 13, 2010, will be at least the higher of (i) the average of the high and low prices at which Common Stock is traded on the grant date, or (ii) the closing price of Common Stock on the grant date.  All options are subject to a vesting period of at least one year, and the term of the option will not exceed ten years.  Holders of the options granted under LTIP who remain actively employed receive cash dividend equivalent payments for

four

years in an amount equal to the regular quarterly dividends paid on Common Stock. Dividend equivalent payments are not made on TSOP options.

In the first quarter of


,

515,240

options were granted under LTIP and

181,070

options were granted under TSOP.  In each case, the grant price was

$94.17

.  In the first quarter of


,

748,200

options were granted under LTIP and

268,500

options were granted under TSOP, each with a grant price of

$69.83

.   In the first quarter of


,

567,300

options were granted under LTIP and

210,300

options were granted under TSOP, each with a grant price of

$75.14

.   For all years, options granted under LTIP and TSOP may not be exercised prior to the fourth and third anniversaries of the date of grant, respectively, or if the optionee retires or dies before that anniversary date, may not be exercised before the later of one year after the grant date or the date of the optionee’s retirement or death.

The fair value of each option awarded in


,


, and


was measured on the date of grant using a lattice-based option valuation model.  Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from traded options on, and historical volatility of, Common Stock.  Historical data is used to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model.  The average expected option life is derived from the output of the valuation model and represents the period of time that all options granted are expected to be outstanding, including branches of the model that result in options expiring unexercised.  The average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.  For options granted that include dividend equivalent payments, a dividend yield of

zero

was used.  For


,


, and


, a dividend yield of

2.29%

,

2.86%

, and

2.30%

, respectively, was used for LTIP options for periods where no dividend equivalent payments are made, as well as for TSOP options, which do not receive dividend equivalents.

K


The assumptions for the LTIP and TSOP grants for the last three years are shown in the following table:

A summary of the status of changes in stock options is presented below:

The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding at

December 31, 2014

Performance Share Units

PSUs provide for awards based on achievement of certain predetermined corporate performance goals at the end of a three-year cycle and are settled through the issuance of shares of Common Stock.  PSU grants were

399,530

in 2014 and grant-date fair values relating to performance and market conditions were

$94.17

and

$50.31

, respectively, with the market condition fair value measured on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model.  PSU grants were

15.  Earnings Per Share

The following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share:

In each year, dividend equivalent payments were made to holders of stock options and RSUs.  For purposes of computing basic earnings per share, dividend equivalent payments made to holders of stock options and RSUs were deducted from net income to determine income available to common stockholders.  For purposes of computing diluted earnings per share, we evaluate on a grant-by-grant basis those stock options and RSUs receiving dividend equivalent payments under the two-class and treasury stock methods to determine which method is the more dilutive for each grant.  For those grants for which the two-class method was more dilutive, net income was reduced by dividend equivalent payments to determine income available to common stockholders.  The diluted calculations exclude options having exercise prices exceeding the average market price of Common Stock as follows:

16.  Commitments and Contingencies

Lawsuits

We and/or certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations.  When we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, it is accrued through a charge to earnings.  While the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future developments, in our opinion, the recorded liability is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims.  However, the final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter.  Any adjustments to the recorded liability will be reflected in earnings in the periods in which such adjustments become known.

K


Two

of our customers, DuPont and Sunbelt Chlor Alkai Partnership (Sunbelt), filed rate reasonableness complaints before the Surface Transportation Board (STB) alleging that our tariff rates for transportation of regulated movements are unreasonable. Since June 1, 2009, in the case of DuPont, and April 1, 2011, in the case of Sunbelt, we have been billing and collecting amounts based on the challenged tariff rates. On March 14, 2014, the STB resolved DuPont’s rate reasonableness complaint in our favor, and on June 20, 2014, the STB resolved Sunbelt’s rate case in our favor. The STB’s findings in both cases remain subject to technical corrections, requests for reconsideration, and appeal. We believe the estimate of any reasonably possible loss will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. With regard to rate cases, we record adjustments to revenues in the periods if and when such adjustments are probable and estimable.

On November 6, 2007, various antitrust class actions filed against us and other Class I railroads in various Federal district courts regarding fuel surcharges were consolidated in the District of Columbia by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. On June 21, 2012, the court certified the case as a class action. The defendant railroads appealed this certification, and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia vacated the District Court’s decision and remanded the case for further consideration. We believe the allegations in the complaints are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the cases. We do not believe the outcome of these proceedings will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. A lawsuit containing similar allegations against us and four other major railroads that was filed on March 25, 2008, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota, was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff subject to a tolling agreement entered into in August 2008, and most recently extended in August 2013.

Casualty Claims

Casualty claims include employee personal injury and occupational claims as well as third-party claims, all exclusive of legal costs.  To aid in valuing our personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue with respect to such claims during the year, we utilize studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm.  Job-related accidental injury and occupational claims are subject to the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA), which is applicable only to railroads.  FELA’s fault-based system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault workers’ compensation system.  The variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being different from the liability recorded.  While the ultimate amount of claims incurred is dependent on future developments, in our opinion, the recorded liability is adequate to cover the future payments of claims and is supported by the most recent actuarial study.  In all cases, we record a liability when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and estimable.

Employee personal injury claims

– The largest component of casualties and other claims expense is employee personal injury costs.  The independent actuarial firm engaged by us provides quarterly studies to aid in valuing our employee personal injury liability and estimating personal injury expense.  The actuarial firm studies our historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements, taking into account relevant outside influences.  The actuarial firm uses the results of these analyses to estimate the ultimate amount of liability, which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted claims. We adjust the liability quarterly based upon our assessment and the results of the study. Our estimate of loss liabilities is subject to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events such as jury decisions, court interpretations, or legislative changes and as such the actual loss may vary from the estimated liability recorded.

Occupational claims

– Occupational claims (including asbestosis and other respiratory diseases, as well as conditions allegedly related to repetitive motion) are often not caused by a specific accident or event but rather allegedly result from a claimed exposure over time.  Many such claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have not been employed in the rail industry for decades.  The independent actuarial firm provides an estimate of the occupational claims liability based upon our history of claim filings, severity, payments, and other pertinent facts.  The liability is dependent upon judgments we make as to the specific case reserves as well as judgments of the actuarial firm in the quarterly studies.  The actuarial firm’s estimate of ultimate loss includes a provision for those claims that have been incurred but not reported.  This provision is derived by analyzing industry data and projecting our experience into the future as far as can be reasonably determined.  We adjust the liability quarterly based upon our assessment and the results of the study.  However, it is possible that the

K


recorded liability may not be adequate to cover the future payment of claims.  Adjustments to the recorded liability are reflected in operating expenses in the periods in which such adjustments become known.

Third-party claims

– We record a liability for third-party claims including those for highway crossing accidents, trespasser and other injuries, automobile liability, property damage, and lading damage.  The actuarial firm assists us with the calculation of potential liability for third-party claims, except lading damage, based upon our experience including the number and timing of incidents, amount of payments, settlement rates, number of open claims, and legal defenses. The actuarial estimate includes a provision for claims that have been incurred but not reported. We adjust the liability quarterly based upon our assessment and the results of the study.  Given the inherent uncertainty in regard to the ultimate outcome of third-party claims, it is possible that the actual loss may differ from the estimated liability recorded.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to various jurisdictions’ environmental laws and regulations.  We record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably.  Claims, if any, against third parties, for recovery of cleanup costs we have incurred are reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are not netted against the associated liability.  Environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates.  We have an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret our environmental policy.

Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include liabilities for environmental exposures of

$66 million

at December 31,


, and

$58 million

at December 31,


(of which

$15 million

is classified as a current liability at the end of each period).  At December 31,


, the liability represents our estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at


known locations and projects compared with


locations and projects at December 31,


.  At December 31,


,


sites accounted for

$39 million

of the liability, and no individual site was considered to be material.  We anticipate that much of this liability will be paid out over

five

years; however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period.

At


locations, one or more of our subsidiaries in conjunction with a number of other parties have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 or comparable state statutes that impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs.  We calculate our estimated liability for these sites based on facts and legal defenses applicable to each site and not solely on the basis of the potential for joint liability.

With respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by us or by the EPA or comparable state authorities), estimates of our ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, unpredictable contaminant recovery and reduction rates associated with available cleanup technologies, the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participant’s share of any estimated loss (and that participant’s ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability.

The risk of incurring environmental liability – for acts and omissions, past, present, and future – is inherent in the railroad business.  Some of the commodities in our traffic mix, particularly those classified as hazardous materials, pose special risks that we work diligently to reduce.  In addition, several of our subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased and operated by others, or held for sale.  Because environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, there can be no assurance that we will not incur environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time.  Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and potentially other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time.  The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

K


Based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances now known, we believe we have recorded the probable and reasonably estimable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which we are aware.  Further, we believe that it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

Insurance

We obtain on behalf of ourself and our subsidiaries insurance for potential losses for third-party liability and first-party property damages.  We are currently self-insured up to

$50 million

and above

$1.2 billion

per occurrence and/or policy year for bodily injury and property damage to third parties and up to

$25 million

and above

$200 million

per occurrence and/or policy year for property owned by us or in our care, custody, or control.

Purchase Commitments

At December 31,


, we had outstanding purchase commitments totaling approximately

$879 million

for locomotives, freight cars and containers, track material, and track and yard expansion projects in connection with our capital programs as well as long-term service contracts through 2018.

Change-In-Control Arrangements

We have compensation agreements with certain officers and key employees that become operative only upon a change in control of Norfolk Southern, as defined in those agreements.  The agreements provide generally for payments based on compensation at the time of a covered individual’s involuntary or other specified termination and for certain other benefits.

Guarantees

In a number of instances, we have agreed to indemnify lenders for additional costs they may bear as a result of certain changes in laws or regulations applicable to their loans.  Such changes may include impositions or modifications with respect to taxes, duties, reserves, liquidity, capital adequacy, special deposits, and similar requirements relating to extensions of credit by, deposits with, or the assets or liabilities of such lenders.  The nature and timing of changes in laws or regulations applicable to our financings are inherently unpredictable, and therefore our exposure in connection with the foregoing indemnifications cannot be quantified.  No liability has been recorded related to these indemnifications.

We have agreed to indemnify parties in a number of transactions for U.S. income tax withholding imposed as a result of changes in U.S. tax law.  In all cases, we have the right to unwind the related transaction if the withholding cannot be avoided in the future.  Because these indemnities would be triggered and are dependent upon a change in the tax law, the maximum exposure is not quantifiable.  We do not believe it is likely that we will be required to make any payments under these indemnities.

At December 31, 2014, certain Norfolk Southern subsidiaries are contingently liable as guarantors with respect to

$7 million

of indebtedness, due in 2019, of an entity in which they have an ownership interest, the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis.  Four other railroads are also jointly and severally liable as guarantors for this indebtedness.  No liability has been recorded related to this guaranty.

Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the assistance of management, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) at December 31,


.  Based on such evaluation, our officers have concluded that, at December 31,


, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to our ability to record, process, summarize, and report reliable financial data.  We recognize that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control.  Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation.  Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.

In order to ensure that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, we regularly assess such controls and did so most recently for our financial reporting at December 31,


.  This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

(2013)

.  Based on our assessment, we have concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting at December 31,


.

Our Board of Directors, acting through its Audit Committee, is responsible for the oversight of our accounting policies, financial reporting, and internal control.  The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors is comprised entirely of outside directors who are independent of management.  The independent registered public accounting firm and our internal auditors have full and unlimited access to the Audit Committee, with or without management, to discuss the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, and any other matters which they believe should be brought to the attention of the Audit Committee.

We have issued a report of our assessment of internal control over financial reporting, and our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting at December 31,


.  These reports appear in Part II, Item 8 of this report on Form 10-K.

During the fourth quarter of

Norfolk Southern Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)

Established on June 28, 1983, and approved by our stockholders at their Annual Meeting held on May 10, 1984, LTIP was adopted to promote the success of our company by providing an opportunity for non-employee Directors, officers, and other key employees to acquire a proprietary interest in the Corporation.  The Board of Directors amended LTIP on January 26, 2010, which amendment was approved by shareholders on May 13, 2010, to include the reservation for issuance of an additional 8,100,000 shares of authorized but unissued Common Stock.

The amended LTIP adopted a fungible share reserve ratio so that, for awards granted after May 13, 2010, the number of shares remaining for issuance under the amended LTIP will be reduced (i) by 1 for each award granted as an option or stock-settled stock appreciation right, or (ii) by 1.61 for an award made in the form other than an option or stock-settled stock appreciation right.  Any shares of Common Stock subject to options, PSUs, restricted shares, or RSUs which are not issued as Common Stock will again be available for award under LTIP after the expiration or forfeiture of an award.

Non-employee Directors, officers, and other key employees residing in the United States or Canada are eligible for selection to receive LTIP awards.  Under LTIP, the Compensation Committee (Committee), or the Corporation’s chief executive officer to the extent the Committee delegates award-making authority pursuant to LTIP, may grant incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, restricted shares, PSUs, and performance shares.  In addition, dividend equivalent payments may be awarded for options, RSUs, and PSUs.  Awards under LTIP may be made subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances and may establish such other terms and conditions for the awards as provided in LTIP.

For options granted after May 13, 2010, the option price will be at least the higher of (i) the average of the high and low prices at which Common Stock is traded on the date of grant, or (ii) the closing price of Common Stock on the date of the grant.  All options are subject to a vesting period of at least one year, and the term of the option will not exceed ten years.  LTIP specifically prohibits option repricing without stockholder approval, except that adjustments may be made in the event of changes in our capital structure or Common Stock.

PSUs entitle a recipient to receive performance-based compensation at the end of a three-year cycle based on our performance during that period.  For the


PSU awards, corporate performance will be measured using two equally weighted standards established by the Committee:  (1) three-year average return on average capital invested and (2) total return to stockholders measured at the end of the three-year period.  For the


PSU awards, PSUs will be settled in shares of Common Stock.

RSUs are payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock at the end of a restriction period of not less than 36 months and not more than 60 months.  During the restriction period, the holder of the RSUs has no beneficial ownership interest in the Common Stock represented by the RSUs and has no right to vote the shares represented by the units or to receive dividends (except for dividend equivalent payment rights that may be awarded with respect to the RSUs).  The Committee at its discretion may waive the restriction period, but settlement of any RSUs will occur on the same settlement date as would have applied absent a waiver of restrictions, if no performance goals were imposed.

Norfolk Southern Corporation Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan (TSOP)

Our Board of Directors adopted TSOP on January 26, 1999, to promote the success of our company by providing an opportunity for nonagreement employees to acquire a proprietary interest in our company and thereby to provide an additional incentive to nonagreement employees to devote their maximum efforts and skills to the advancement, betterment, and prosperity of our company and our stockholders.  Under TSOP there were 6,000,000 shares of authorized but unissued Common Stock reserved for issuance.  TSOP has not been and is not required to have been approved by our stockholders.

Active full-time nonagreement employees residing in the United States or Canada are eligible for selection to receive TSOP awards.  Under TSOP, the Committee, or the Corporation’s chief executive officer to the extent the Committee delegates award-making authority pursuant to TSOP, may grant nonqualified stock options subject to such terms and conditions as provided in TSOP.

The option price may not be less than the average of the high and low prices at which Common Stock is traded on the date of the grant.  All options are subject to a vesting period of at least one year, and the term of the option will not exceed ten years.  TSOP specifically prohibits repricing without stockholder approval, except for capital adjustments.

Norfolk Southern Corporation Directors’ Restricted Stock Plan (Plan)

The Plan was adopted on January 1, 1994, and is designed to increase ownership of Common Stock by our non-employee Directors so as to further align their ownership interest in our company with that of our stockholders.  The Plan has not been and is not required to have been approved by our stockholders.  Currently, a maximum of 66,000 shares of Common Stock may be granted under the Plan.  To make grants eligible to Directors, we purchase, through one or more subsidiary companies, the number of shares required in open-market transactions at prevailing market prices, or make such grants from Common Stock already owned by one or more of our subsidiary companies.

Effective January 23, 2015, the board amended the Plan to provide that no additional awards will be made under the Plan after the effective date.  Prior to that amendment, only non-employee Directors who are not and never have been employees of our company were eligible to participate in the Plan.  Upon becoming a Director, each eligible Director received a one-time grant of 3,000 restricted shares of Common Stock.  No individual member of the Board exercised discretion concerning the eligibility of any Director or the number of shares granted.

The restriction period applicable to restricted shares granted under the Plan begins on the date of the grant and ends on the earlier of the recipient’s death or the day after the recipient ceases to be a Director by reason of disability or retirement.  During the restriction period, shares may not be sold, pledged, or otherwise encumbered.  Directors will forfeit the restricted shares if they cease to serve as a Director of our company for reasons other than their disability, retirement, or death.
