GENERAL -

Norfolk
Southern Corporation (Norfolk Southern) is a Norfolk, Virginia based company
that controls a major freight railroad, Norfolk Southern Railway Company.
 
Norfolk Southern Railway Company is primarily
engaged in the rail transportation of raw materials, intermediate products, and
finished goods primarily in the Southeast, East, and Midwest and, via
interchange with rail carriers, to and from the rest of the United States.
 
Norfolk Southern also transports overseas freight
through several Atlantic and Gulf Coast ports.
 

Norfolk Southern provides comprehensive logistics services and offers
the most extensive intermodal network in the eastern half of the United States.
 
The common stock of Norfolk Southern is
listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol "NSC."

Norfolk Southern was
incorporated on July 23, 1980, under the laws of the Commonwealth of
Virginia.
 
On June 1, 1982, Norfolk
Southern acquired control of two major operating railroads, Norfolk and Western
Railway Company (NW) and Southern Railway Company (Southern) in accordance with
an Agreement of Merger and Reorganization dated as of July 31, 1980, and
with the approval of the transaction by the Interstate Commerce Commission (now
the Surface Transportation Board [STB]).
 

Effective December 31, 1990, Norfolk Southern transferred all the
common stock of NW to Southern and Southern's name was changed to Norfolk
Southern Railway Company (Norfolk Southern Railway or NSR).
 
Effective September 1, 1998, NW was merged
with and into Norfolk Southern Railway.
 

As of December 31, 2009, all the common stock of Norfolk Southern
Railway was owned directly by Norfolk Southern.

Through a limited liability
company, Norfolk Southern and CSX Corporation (CSX) jointly own Conrail Inc.
(Conrail), whose primary subsidiary is Consolidated Rail Corporation
(CRC).
 
Norfolk Southern has a 58%
economic and 50% voting interest in the jointly owned entity, and CSX has the
remainder of the economic and voting interests.
 

CRC owns and operates certain properties (the Shared Assets Areas) for
the joint and exclusive benefit of NSR and CSX Transportation Inc. (CSXT) (see
Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Norfolk Southern makes
available free of charge through its website, www.nscorp.com, its annual report
on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on
Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably
practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
 

In addition, the following documents are available on the company's
website and in print to any shareholder who requests them:

Corporate Governance Guidelines


Charters of the Committees of the Board of
     Directors


The Thoroughbred Code of Ethics


Code of Ethical Conduct for Senior Financial
     Officers


Categorical Independence Standards for Directors

Unless
otherwise indicated, Norfolk Southern and its subsidiaries are referred to
collectively as NS.

RAILROAD OPERATIONS -

As of December 31, 2009, NS' railroads operated
approximately 21,000 route miles in 22 states and the District of Columbia.

The system's lines reach many
individual industries, electric generating facilities, mines (in western
Virginia, eastern Kentucky, southern and northern West Virginia, and western
Pennsylvania), distribution centers, transload facilities, and other businesses
located in smaller communities in its service area.

Corridors with heaviest
freight volume:

New York City area to Chicago (via
Allentown and Pittsburgh)

Chicago to Macon (via Cincinnati,
Chattanooga, and Atlanta)

Appalachian coal fields of Virginia,
West Virginia, and Kentucky to Norfolk and Sandusky, Ohio

Cleveland to Kansas City

Birmingham to Meridian

Triple Crown Operations -

Triple Crown Services Company (Triple Crown), an NS
subsidiary, provides bimodal, truckload transportation service utilizing
RoadRailerÂ® trailers, a hybrid technology that facilitates both over-the-road
and on-the-rail transportation utilizing enclosed trailers that are pulled over
the highways in tractor-trailer configuration and over the rails by
locomotives.
 
Triple Crown provides
service in the eastern two-thirds of the United States as well as Ontario and
Quebec through a network of terminals strategically located in 13 cities.

The following table sets
forth certain statistics relating to NS' railroads' operations for the past 5

RAILWAY OPERATING REVENUES -

NS' total railway operating revenues were $8.0 billion
in 2009.
 
See the financial information
by traffic segment in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

COAL TRAFFIC -

Coal,
coke, and iron ore - most of which is bituminous coal - is NS' railroads'
largest commodity group as measured by revenues.
 
The railroads handled a total of 157.5
million tons in 2009, most of which originated on NS' lines in West Virginia,
Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky.
 

Revenues from coal, coke, and iron ore accounted for about 29% of NS'
total railway operating revenues in 2009.

Total coal handled through
all system ports in 2009 was 29.8 million tons.
 
Of this total, 14.9 million tons
(including coastwise traffic) moved through Norfolk, Virginia, 3.8 million
tons (including coastwise traffic) moved through the Baltimore Terminal, 7.5 million
tons moved to various docks on the Ohio River, and 3.6 million tons moved
to various Lake Erie ports.
 
Other than
coal for export, virtually all coal handled by NS' railroads was terminated in
states east of the Mississippi River.

See the discussion of coal
traffic, by type of coal, in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

GENERAL MERCHANDISE TRAFFIC -

General merchandise traffic is composed of five major
commodity groupings:
 
automotive;
chemicals; metals and construction; agriculture, consumer products and
government; and paper, clay and forest products.
 
The automotive group includes finished
vehicles for BMW, Chrysler, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Honda, Isuzu,
Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, Suzuki, Toyota, and
Volkswagen, and auto parts for Ford Motor Company, General Motors, and Chrysler.
 
The chemicals group includes sulfur and
related chemicals, petroleum products, chlorine and bleaching compounds,
plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals, chemical wastes, and municipal
wastes.
 
The metals and construction
group includes steel, aluminum products, machinery, scrap metals, cement,
aggregates, bricks, and minerals.
 
The
agriculture, consumer products, and government group includes soybeans, wheat,
corn, fertilizer, animal and poultry feed, food oils, flour, beverages, canned
goods, sweeteners, consumer products, ethanol, and items for the military.
 
The paper, clay and forest products group
includes lumber and wood products, pulp board and paper products, wood fibers,
wood pulp, scrap paper, and clay.

In 2009, 105 million
tons of general merchandise freight, or approximately 65% of total general
merchandise tonnage handled by NS, originated online.
 
The balance of general merchandise traffic
was received from connecting carriers at interterritorial gateways.
 
The principal interchange points for
NS-received traffic included Chicago, Memphis, New Orleans, Cincinnati, Kansas
City, Detroit, Hagerstown, St. Louis/East St. Louis, and Louisville.
 
General merchandise carloads handled in 2009
were 2.0 million, the revenues from which accounted for 52% of NS' total
railway operating revenues in 2009.

See the discussion of general
merchandise rail traffic by commodity group in Part II, Item 7, "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

INTERMODAL TRAFFIC -

The intermodal market consists of shipments moving in
trailers, domestic and international containers, and RoadRailerÂ®
equipment.
 
These shipments are handled
on behalf of intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, truckers,
and other shippers.
 
Intermodal units
handled in 2009 were 2.5 million, the revenues from which accounted for 19%
of NS' total railway operating revenues for the year.

See the discussion of
intermodal traffic in Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Conditions and Results of Operations."

FREIGHT RATES -

In 2009, NS' railroads continued their reliance on private contracts
and exempt price quotes as their predominant pricing mechanisms.
 
Thus, a major portion of NS' freight business
is not currently economically regulated by the government.
 
In general, market forces have been
substituted for government regulation and now are the primary determinant of
rail service prices.

In 2009, NS' railroads were
found by the STB to be "revenue adequate" based on results for the year 2008.
 
The STB has not made its revenue adequacy
determination for the year 2009.
 
A
railroad is "revenue adequate" under the applicable law when its return on net
investment exceeds the rail industry's composite cost of capital.
 
This determination is made pursuant to a
statutory requirement.

- -
          
Maryland Department of Transportation

Passenger operations are conducted either by
     Amtrak or by the commuter agencies over trackage owned by Conrail in the
     Shared Assets Areas

NONCARRIER OPERATIONS -

NS' noncarrier subsidiaries engage principally in the
acquisition, leasing, and management of coal, oil, gas and minerals; the
development of commercial real estate; telecommunications; and the leasing or
sale of rail property and equipment.
 
In
2009, no such noncarrier subsidiary or industry segment grouping of noncarrier
subsidiaries met the requirements for a reportable business segment, under relevant
authoritative accounting guidance.

RAILWAY PROPERTY

The NS railroad system
extends across 22 states and the District of Columbia.
 
The railroad infrastructure makes the company
capital intensive with net property of approximately $23 billion.

Capital Expenditures -

Capital expenditures for road, equipment, and other
property for the past five years were as follows (including capitalized
leases):

Capital spending and
maintenance programs are and have been designed to assure the ability to
provide safe, efficient, and reliable rail transportation services.
 
For 2010, NS has budgeted $1.44 billion
of capital expenditures.
 
On May 1, 2006,
NS and Kansas City Southern (KCS) formed a joint venture, Meridian Speedway LLC
(MSLLC), pursuant to which NS intends to contribute $300 million in cash,
substantially all of which will be used for capital improvements over a period
of approximately three years, in exchange for a 30% interest in the joint
venture.
 
Through December 31, 2009, NS
has contributed $283 million.

2009, and $236 million as of December 31, 2008.

Track Maintenance -

Of the approximately 37,100 total miles of track operated, NS had
responsibility for maintaining about 29,600 miles of track, with the remainder
being operated under trackage rights from another party responsible for
maintenance.

Over 75% of the main line
trackage (including first, second, third, and branch main tracks, all excluding
rail operated pursuant to trackage rights) has rail ranging from 131 to 155
pounds per yard with the standard installation currently at 136 pounds per
yard.
 
Approximately 36% of NS lines,
excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights, carried 20 million or
more gross tons per track mile during 2009.

Microwave System -

The NS microwave system, consisting of approximately 7,400 radio route
miles, 429 core stations, 30 secondary stations, and 5 passive repeater
stations, provides communications between most operating locations.
 
The microwave system is used primarily for
voice communications, VHF radio control circuits, data and facsimile
transmissions, traffic control operations, and AEI data transmissions.

Traffic Control -

Of the approximately 16,600 route miles dispatched by
NS, about 11,100 miles are signalized, including 8,200 miles of centralized
traffic control (CTC) and 2,900 miles of automatic block signals.
 
Of the 8,200 miles of CTC, approximately 3,900
miles are controlled by data radio originating at 271 base station radio sites.

Computers -

A computer network consisting of a centralized data
center in Atlanta, Georgia, and various distributed computers throughout the
company connects the yards, terminals, transportation offices, rolling stock
repair points, sales offices, and other key system locations.
 
Operating and traffic data are processed and
stored to provide customers with information on their shipments throughout the
system.
 
Computer systems provide current
information on the location of every train and each car on line, as well as
related waybill and other train and car movement data.
 
In addition, the computer systems are
utilized to assist management in the performance of a variety of functions and
services including payroll, car and revenue accounting, billing, material
management activities and controls, and special studies.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS -

Compliance with federal, state, and local laws and
regulations relating to the protection of the environment is a principal NS
goal.
 
To date, such compliance has not
affected materially NS' capital additions, earnings, liquidity, or competitive
position.
 
See "Legal Proceedings," Part
I, Item 3; "Personal Injury, Environmental, and Legal Liabilities" in Part II,
Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations," and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

EMPLOYEES -

agreements with various labor unions.
 

See the discussion of "Labor Agreements" in Part II, Item 7,
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations."

GOVERNMENT REGULATION -

In addition to environmental, safety, securities, and
other regulations generally applicable to all businesses, NS' railroads are
subject to regulation by the STB.
 
The
STB has jurisdiction over some rates, routes, fuel surcharges, conditions of
service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines.
 
The STB also has jurisdiction over the
consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control of and by rail common
carriers.
 
The Federal Railroad
Administration regulates certain track and mechanical equipment standards.

The
relaxation of economic regulation of railroads, under the Staggers Rail Act of
1980, includes exemptions of intermodal business (trailer-on-flat-car,
container-on-flat-car), rail boxcar traffic, lumber, manufactured steel,
automobiles, and certain bulk commodities such as sand, gravel, pulpwood, and
wood chips for paper manufacturing.
 

Transportation contracts on these shipments and on regulated shipments
effectively remove those shipments from regulation as well for the duration of
the contract.
 
About 88% of NS' freight
revenues come from either exempt traffic or traffic moving under transportation
contracts.

Efforts
were made in 2009 to re-subject the rail industry to increased federal economic
regulation and such efforts are expected to continue in 2010.
 
The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which
substantially balanced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to
innovate and to compete for business, thereby contributing to the economic
health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry.
 
Accordingly, NS will continue to oppose
efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation.

COMPETITION -

There is continuing strong competition among rail,
water, and highway carriers.
 
Price is
usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a
transport mode and specific hauling company.
 

Inventory carrying costs, service reliability, ease of handling, and the
desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important
considerations, especially for higher-valued finished goods, machinery, and
consumer products.
 
Even for raw
materials, semifinished goods, and work-in-progress, users are increasingly sensitive
to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production
stages.

NS'
primary rail competitor is the CSX system; both operate throughout much of the
same territory.
 
Other railroads also
operate in parts of the territory.
 
NS
also competes with motor carriers, water carriers, and with shippers who have
the additional option of handling their own goods in private carriage, of
sourcing products from different geographic areas, and of using substitute
products.

Certain
marketing strategies among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers
enable carriers to compete more effectively in specific markets.

SECURITY OF OPERATIONS -

NS has taken significant steps to provide enhanced
security for the NS rail system.
 
In
particular, NS has developed and implemented a comprehensive security plan that
is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared
by the Association of American Railroads (AAR) post September 11,
2001.
 
The AAR Security Plan defines four
Alert Levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied
across the railroad industry as the terrorist threat increases or
decreases.
 
The Alert Level actions
include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas:
 
(1) operations (including transportation, engineering,
and mechanical); (2) information technology and communications; and (3)
railroad police.
 
Although security
concerns preclude public disclosure of its contents, the NS Departmental
Security Plan outlines the protocol within NS for all concerned to be notified
of AAR Alert Level changes.
 
All NS
Operations Division employees are advised by their supervisors or train
dispatchers, as appropriate, of any change in Alert Level and any additional
responsibilities they may incur due to such change.

The
NS plan also effectively addresses and complies with Department of
Transportation security regulations pertaining to training and security plans
with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials.
 
As part of the plan, security awareness
training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous
material transportation safety, and this training is integrated into recurring
hazardous material training and re-certification programs.
 
Toward that end, NS, working closely with the
National Transit Institute at Rutgers University, has developed a four-module
uniform national training program.
 
NS
also has worked with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in
developing other industry training programs.
 

More in-depth security training has been given to those select NS
employees who have been given specific security responsibilities, and
additional, location-specific security plans have been developed for certain
metropolitan areas and each of six port facilities served by NS.
 
With respect to the ports, each facility plan
has been approved by the applicable Captain of the Port and subject to
inspection by the U.S. Coast Guard.

Additionally,
NS engages in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state
agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the TSA,
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Federal Railroad Administration
(FRA), the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and various
state Homeland Security offices.
 
As one
notable example, an NS Police Special Agent, under the auspices of the AAR, has
been assigned to the National Joint Terrorism Task Force (NJTTF) operating out
of FBI Headquarters in Washington, DC to represent and serve as liaison to the
North American rail industry.
 
This
arrangement improves logistical flow of vital security and law enforcement
information with respect to the rail industry as a whole, while having the post
filled by an NS Special Agent has served to foster a strong working
relationship between NS and the FBI.
 
NS
also has become a member of the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism
(C-TPAT) program sponsored by U.S. Customs.
 

C-TPAT allows NS to work closely with U.S. Customs and its customers to
develop measures that will help ensure the integrity of freight shipments
moving on NS, particularly those moving to or from a foreign country.
 
Based on participation in C-TPAT, NS has
ensured that its plan meets all current applicable security recommendations
made by U.S. Customs.

Similarly,
NS is guided in its operations by various supplemental security action items
issued by DHS and U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), U.S. Coast Guard
Maritime Security requirements, as well as voluntary security action items
developed in 2006 in collaboration with TSA, DOT, and the freight
railroads.
 
Many of the action items are
based on lessons learned from DHS and DOT security assessments of rail
corridors in High Threat Urban Areas (HTUA) begun in 2004.
 
Particular attention is aimed at reducing
risk in HTUA by:
 
(1) the establishment
of secure storage areas for rail cars carrying toxic-by-inhalation (TIH)
materials; (2) the expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying
TIH materials; (3) the minimization of unattended loaded tank cars carrying TIH
materials; and (4) cooperation with federal, state, local and tribal
governments to identify, through risk assessments, those locations where
security risks are the highest.
 
These
action items and NS' compliance initiatives are outlined in the various
departmental sections of the NS Departmental Security Plan.
 
NS has taken appropriate actions to be
compliant with the 2008 TSA Final Security Rule addressing Rail Security
Sensitive Materials (RSSM) to ensure these shipments are properly inspected and
that positive chain-of-custody is maintained when required.
 
NS has met the September 2009 deadline to be
in compliance with the 2008 Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration (PHMSA) rail-routing regulations outlined in Docket HM-232E.

In
2009, through participation in the Transportation Community Awareness and
Emergency Response (TRANSCAER) Program, NS provided rail accident response
training to approximately 4,500 emergency responders, such as local police and
fire personnel, representing over 34,000 man-hours of emergency response
training.
 
NS also conducted railroad
operations classes for FBI agents and the railroad liaison agents from Joint
Terrorism Task Forces.
 
NS' other
training efforts throughout 2009 included participation in 10 drills for local,
state, and federal agencies.
 
NS also has
ongoing programs to sponsor local emergency responders at the Security and Emergency
Response Training Course (SERTC) conducted at the AAR Transportation Technology
Center in Pueblo, Colorado.
 
Also, the NS
annual TRANSCAER Whistle-Stop train makes stops in numerous cities, its special
training cars serving as a resource to an audience of nearly 1,000 emergency
responders annually.

Improvements
in equipment design also are expected to play a role in enhancing rail
security.
 
The Pipeline and Hazardous
Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), in coordination with the FRA, is
amending the Hazardous Materials Regulations to prescribe enhanced safety measures
for rail transportation of TIH materials, including interim design standards
for railroad tank cars.
 
The rule
mandates commodity-specific improvements in safety features and design
standards for newly manufactured DOT specification tank cars and an improved
top fittings performance standard.
 
The
interim standards established in this rule will enhance the accident
survivability of TIH tank cars.

Item
1A.
 
Risk Factors

NS is subject to significant
governmental legislation and regulation over commercial, operating and
environmental matters.

Railroads are subject to the enactment of laws by
Congress that could increase economic regulation of the industry.
 
Railroads presently are subject to commercial
regulation by the STB, which has jurisdiction over some routes, rates and fuel
surcharges, conditions of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail
lines.
 
The STB also has jurisdiction
over the consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control of and by rail common
carriers.
 
Additional economic regulation
of the rail industry by Congress or the STB, whether under new or existing
laws, could have a significant negative impact on NS' ability to determine
prices for rail services and result in a material adverse effect in the future
on NS' financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular
year or quarter.
 
This potential material
adverse effect could also result in reduced capital spending on NS' rail
network or abandonment of lines.

Railroads
are subject to safety and security regulation by the DOT and the DHS, which
regulate most aspects of NS' operations.
 

Compliance with the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 will result in
additional operating costs associated with the statutorily mandated implementation
of positive train control by 2015.
 
In
addition to increased capital expenditures, implementation may result in
reduced operational efficiency and service levels, as well as increased
compensation and benefits expenses and increased claims and litigation costs.

NS'
operations are subject to extensive federal and state environmental laws and
regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air; discharges to
waterways or ground water supplies; handling, storage, transportation, and
disposal of waste and other materials; and the cleanup of hazardous material or
petroleum releases.
 
The risk of
incurring environmental liability - for acts and omissions, past, present, and
future - is inherent in the railroad business.
 

This risk includes property owned by NS, whether currently or in the
past, that is or has been subject to a variety of uses, including NS railroad
operations and other industrial activity by past owners or past and present
tenants of NS.
 
Environmental problems
that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties, and NS could
incur environmental liabilities or costs, the amount and materiality of which
cannot be estimated reliably at this time, with respect to one or more of these
properties.
 
Moreover, lawsuits and
claims involving other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely
to arise from time to time, and the resulting liabilities could have a
significant effect on financial position, results of operations, or liquidity
in a particular year or quarter.

NS, as a common carrier by rail, must
offer to transport hazardous materials, regardless of risk.

Transportation
of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of
personal injury and property damage costs, and compromise critical parts of our
rail network.

NS may be affected by terrorism or
war.

Any terrorist attack, or other similar event, any government response
thereto, and war or risk of war could cause significant business interruption
and may adversely affect NS' results of operations, financial position, or
liquidity in a particular year or quarter.
 

Because NS plays a critical role in the nation's transportation system,
it could become the target of such an attack or have a significant role in the
government's preemptive approach or response to an attack or war.

Although NS currently
maintains insurance coverage for third-party liability arising out of war and
acts of terrorism, it maintains only limited insurance coverage for first-party
property damage and damage to property in NS' care, custody, or control caused
by certain acts of terrorism.
 
In
addition, premiums for some or all of NS' current insurance programs covering
these losses could increase dramatically, or insurance coverage for certain
losses could be unavailable to NS in the future.

NS may be affected by general economic
conditions.

Prolonged negative changes in domestic and global
economic conditions affecting the producers and consumers of the commodities NS
carries may have an adverse effect on its operating results, financial
position, or liquidity.
 
Economic conditions
resulting in bankruptcies of one or more large customers could have a
significant impact on NS' financial position, results of operations, or
liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

NS may be affected by the impact of environmental
regulation on its utility coal customers and/or the value of certain NS
assets.

A number of evolving environmental issues could affect
the U.S. utility coal market, including potential regional programs aimed at
capping and reducing power plant CO


emissions and ongoing efforts
at addressing climate change.
 
Although
certain utilities have begun adding or are planning to add emissions control
technologies to their electric generating units, allowing them to utilize their
existing coal-fired power plants, future regulatory developments in this area
could have a negative effect on NS' utility coal customers and/or the value of
coal reserves owned by NS and than an adverse effect on NS' operating results,
financial position, and liquidity.

NS faces competition from other transportation
providers.

NS is subject to competition from motor carriers,
railroads, and to a lesser extent, ships, barges, and pipelines, on the basis
of transit time, pricing, and the quality and reliability of service.
 
While NS has used primarily internal
resources to build or acquire and maintain its rail system, trucks and barges
have been able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities.
 
Any future improvements or expenditures
materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of
transportation in the regions in which NS operates, or legislation granting
materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight
limitations, could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results
of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

The operations of carriers with which NS
interchanges may adversely affect its operations.

NS'
ability to provide rail service to customers in the U.S. and Canada depends in
large part upon its ability to maintain cooperative relationships with
connecting carriers with respect to, among other matters, freight rates,
revenue division, car supply and locomotive availability, data exchange and
communications, reciprocal switching, interchange, and trackage rights.
 
Deterioration in the operations of, or
service provided by connecting carriers, or in our relationship with those
connecting carriers, could result in NS' inability to meet its customers' demands
or require NS to use alternate train routes, which could result in significant
additional costs and network inefficiencies.

NS relies on technology and technology improvements in
its business operations.

If NS experiences significant disruption or failure of
one or more of its information technology systems, including computer hardware,
software, and communications equipment, NS could experience a service
interruption, security breach, or other operational difficulties, which could
have a material adverse impact on its results of operations, financial
condition, and liquidity in a particular year or quarter.
 
Additionally, if NS does not have sufficient
capital to acquire new technology or if it is unable to implement new
technology, NS may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry
and with companies providing other modes of transportation service, which could
have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of
operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

The vast majority of NS employees belong to labor
unions, and labor agreements, strikes, or work stoppages could adversely affect
its operations.

More than 80% of NS railroad employees are
covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions.
 
If unionized workers were to engage in a
strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, NS could experience a significant
disruption of its operations.
 

Additionally, future national labor agreements, or renegotiation of
labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, could significantly increase
NS' costs for healthcare, wages, and other benefits.
 
Any of these factors could have a material
adverse impact on NS' financial position, results of operations, or liquidity
in a particular year or quarter.

NS may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that
could result in significant expenditures.

The nature of NS' business
exposes it to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor
and employment, personal injury, commercial disputes, freight loss and other
property damage, and other matters.
 

Job-related personal injury and occupational claims are subject to the
Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), which is applicable only to
railroads.
 
FELA's fault-based tort
system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared
with a no-fault worker's compensation system.
 

The variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs
being very different from the liability recorded.

Any material changes to
current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving any or all
of freight loss or property damage, personal injury, and environmental
liability could have a material adverse effect on NS' operating results,
financial condition, and liquidity to the extent not covered by insurance.
 
NS has obtained insurance for potential
losses for third-party liability and first-party property damages.
 
Specified levels of risk are retained on a
self-insurance basis (currently up to $25 million and above $1 billion
per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage to third parties and
$25 million and above $175 million per occurrence for property owned
by NS or in its care, custody, or control).
 

Insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not
continue to be available or, if available, may not be obtainable on terms
acceptable to NS.

Severe weather could result in
significant business interruptions and expenditures.

Severe
weather conditions and other natural phenomena, including hurricanes, floods,
fires, and earthquakes, may cause significant business interruptions and result
in increased costs, increased liabilities, and decreased revenues, which could
have an adverse effect on NS' financial position, results of operations, or
liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

Unpredictability of demand for rail services resulting
in the unavailability of qualified personnel could adversely affect NS'
operational efficiency and ability to meet demand.

Workforce
demographics, training requirements, and the availability of qualified personnel,
particularly engineers and trainmen, could each have a negative impact on NS'
ability to meet demand for rail service.
 

Unpredictable increases in demand for rail services may exacerbate such
risks, which could have a negative impact on NS' operational efficiency and
otherwise have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of
operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

NS may be affected by supply constraints resulting
from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of some of its supplier
markets.

NS consumed about 400 million gallons of diesel
fuel in 2009.
 
Fuel availability could be
affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory
allocation or rationing regulations.
 
If
a severe fuel supply shortage arose from production curtailments, increased
demand in existing or emerging foreign markets, disruption of oil imports,
disruption of domestic refinery production, damage to refinery or pipeline
infrastructure, political unrest, war or other factors, NS' financial position,
results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or quarter could be
materially adversely affected.
 
Also,
such an event would impact NS as well as its customers and other transportation
companies.

Due to the capital intensive
nature and industry-specific requirements of the rail industry, there are high
barriers of entry for potential new suppliers of core railroad items, such as
locomotives and rolling stock equipment.
 

Additionally, NS competes with other industries for available capacity
and raw materials used in the production of certain track materials, such as
rail and ties.
 
Changes in the
competitive landscapes of these limited-supplier markets could result in
increased prices or material shortages that could materially affect NS'
financial position, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular year or
quarter.

The state of capital markets could adversely affect
NS' liquidity.

NS from time-to-time relies on the capital markets to
provide some of its capital requirements, including the issuance of long-term
debt instruments and commercial paper, as well as the sale of certain
receivables.
 
Significant instability or
disruptions of the capital markets, including the credit markets, or deterioration
of NS' financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict
or eliminate NS' access to, and/or significantly increase the cost of, various
financing sources, including bank credit facilities and issuance of corporate
bonds.
 
Instability or disruptions of the
capital markets and deterioration of NS' financial condition, alone or in
combination, could also result in a reduction in NS' credit rating to below
investment grade, which could prohibit or restrict NS from accessing external sources
of short- and long-term debt financing and/or significantly increase the
associated costs.

Legal Proceedings

The Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency has notified Norfolk Southern that it intends to seek
penalties and require Norfolk Southern to take remedial actions in connection
with alleged violations of the Clean Air and Water Acts stemming from the
operation of NS' coal dock in Ashtabula, Ohio.
 

The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has submitted to
NS a proposed Consent Assessment of Civil Penalty with respect to several
alleged environmental releases from September 2007 to the present.
 
Although NS will contest liability and the
imposition of any penalties, because these governmental proceedings with
respect to environmental laws and regulations involve potential fines,
penalties or other monetary sanctions in excess of $100,000, they are described
here consistent with SEC rules and requirements.
 
NS does not believe that the outcome of these
proceedings will have a material effect on its financial position, results of
operations, or liquidity.

On November 6, 2007,
various antitrust class actions filed against NS and other Class I railroads in
various Federal district courts regarding fuel surcharges were consolidated in
the District of Columbia by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation.
 
NS believes the allegations
in the complaints are without merit and intends to vigorously defend the
cases.
 
NS does not believe that the
outcome of these proceedings will have a material effect on its financial
position, results of operations, or liquidity.
 

A lawsuit containing similar allegations against NS and four other major
railroads that was filed on March 25, 2008, in the U.S. District Court for
the District of Minnesota was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff subject to
a tolling agreement entered into in August 2008.

On April 24, 2008, the United
States Department of Justice (DOJ) brought an action against NS for alleged
violations of federal environmental laws resulting from the discharge of
chlorine and oil that occurred as a result of the January 6, 2005 derailment in
Graniteville, SC, including claims for civil penalties as well as injunctive
relief.
 
Although NS' June 24, 2008
motion to dismiss for failure to allege sufficient facts was granted, DOJ was
given leave to, and did, amend its complaint.
 

The litigation has been stayed by the district court as the parties work
to conclude an agreed upon consent decree, which when finalized will include
fines in excess of $100,000.
 
NS does not
believe that the resolution of these claims will have a material adverse effect
on its financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and
analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial
Statements and Notes and the Selected Financial Data.

OVERVIEW

While NS' results in 2009
reflect the decline of the domestic and global economies, they also demonstrate
NS' ability to focus on safety, service, asset management, and sustainability--all
while controlling costs.
 
Revenues
decreased $2.7 billion, or 25%, in 2009, as manufacturers reduced production
to meet sagging consumer demand and the decline in oil prices resulted in lower
fuel surcharge revenues.
 
Carloadings
were down 1.4 million units, or 19%, reflecting declines across all commodity
groups.
 
NS partially offset this 25%
decline in revenues with a $1.6 billion, or 21%, decrease in operating
expenses.
 
Notwithstanding these cost
reductions, income from railway operations fell 36%, and the operating ratio, a
measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses,
rose to 75.4%.

Despite the decline in NS'
net income for 2009, cash provided by operating activities was
$1.9 billion, which exceeded cash used for capital expenditures and
dividends.
 
Net proceeds from borrowings
minus debt repayments was $403 million resulting in an increase in cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments, which at December 31, 2009 totaled
$1.1 billion.

Looking forward to 2010, NS
expects revenues to increase, reflecting improved average revenue per unit and
higher traffic volume due to a gradual, yet steady economic recovery.
 
NS plans to continue to improve service and
maintain a market-based approach to pricing.

SUMMARIZED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2009 Compared with 2008

Net income in 2009 was
$1.0 billion, or $2.76 per diluted share, down $682 million, or 40%,
compared with $1.7 billion, or $4.52 per diluted share, in 2008.
 
The decrease in net income was primarily due
to lower income from railway operations that was offset in part by lower income
taxes (see Note 3).
 
Railway
operating revenues decreased $2.7 billion, reflecting lower traffic
volumes and lower average revenue per unit primarily a result of decreased fuel
surcharges.
 
Railway operating expenses
decreased $1.6 billion, principally due to lower volume-related expenses
and fuel prices.

Oil prices affect NS' results
of operations in a variety of ways and can have an overall favorable or
unfavorable impact in any particular period.
 

In addition to the impact of oil prices on general economic conditions
and traffic volume, oil prices directly affect NS' revenues through
market-based fuel surcharges and contract escalators (see "Railway Operating
Revenues") and also affect fuel costs (see "Railway Operating Expenses").
 
For 2009, excluding the impact of decreased
consumption, the decline in fuel surcharge revenue was greater than the decline
in fuel expense.
 
Future changes in oil
prices may cause volatility in operating results that could be material to a
particular year or quarter.

2008 Compared with 2007

Net income in 2008 was
$1.7 billion, up $252 million, or 17%, compared with 2007.
 
Diluted earnings per share were $4.52, up
84Â¢, or 23%.
 
The greater percentage
increase in per share earnings was due to fewer shares outstanding as a result
of NS' share repurchase program (see Note 14).
 

The increase in net income was primarily due to higher income from
railway operations that was offset in part by higher income taxes (see
Note 3).
 
Railway operating revenues
increased $1.2 billion, as higher average revenue per unit outweighed
lower traffic volumes.
 
Railway operating
expenses increased $730 million, principally due to higher fuel costs and
increased compensation and benefits expenses.

DETAILED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Railway Operating Revenues

Railway operating revenues
were $8.0 billion in 2009, $10.7 billion in 2008, and
$9.4 billion in 2007.

Revenues decreased
$2.7 billion in 2009, but increased $1.2 billion in 2008.
 
As reflected in the table on the following
page, the decrease in 2009 was due to decreased traffic volumes and lower
average revenue per unit, as a result of lower fuel surcharges that more than
offset rate increases.
 
The improvement
in 2008 was the result of increased average revenue per unit, including fuel
surcharge revenue, which more than offset decreased traffic volumes.
 
Fuel surcharge revenue amounted to $370 million
in 2009, compared with $1.6 billion in 2008, and $792 million in
2007.
 
If fuel prices remain at or near
year-end 2009 levels, fuel surcharge revenues will increase in 2010.

Many of NS' negotiated fuel
surcharges for coal and general merchandise traffic are based on the monthly
average price of West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil (WTI Average Price).
 
These surcharges are reset the first day of
each calendar month based on the WTI Average Price for the second preceding
calendar month.
 
This two-month lag in applying
WTI Average Price decreased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately
$50 million in 2009 and increased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately
$100 million in 2008.

For 2009, the unfavorable
volume variance accounted for 75% of the total variance, reflecting traffic
volume declines for all commodity groups.
 

Volumes declined by 1.4 million units, or 19%, reflecting the weakened
economy.
 
The unfavorable revenue per
unit/mix variance was driven by decreased fuel surcharges, offset in part by
higher rates.

In 2008, revenues increased
$1.2 billion compared to 2007, reflecting large increases in average revenue
per unit, a result of higher rates and increased fuel surcharges.
 
Traffic volumes for all commodity groups
except coal and agriculture/consumer products/government decreased compared to
2007.

On January 26, 2007, the
Surface Transportation Board (STB) issued a decision that the type of fuel
surcharge imposed by NS and most other large railroads - a fuel surcharge based
on a percentage of line haul revenue - would no longer be permitted for
regulated traffic that moves under public (tariff) rates.
 
The STB gave the railroads a 90-day
transition period to adjust their fuel surcharge programs.
 
During the second quarter of 2007, NS
discontinued assessing fuel surcharges on its published (non-intermodal) public
rates.
 
Adjustments to public prices now
reflect ongoing market conditions.
 
The
traffic moving under these tariffs and public quotes comprises about 10% of NS'
total revenue base.

COAL

revenues
decreased $847 million, or 27%, compared with 2008, reflecting a 20%
decrease in traffic volume due to lower coal consumption in the utility and
global raw steel sectors and lower average revenue per unit.
 
Coal average revenue per unit was down 9%
compared with 2008, reflecting decreased fuel surcharges and declining rate adjustment
factors that more than offset rate increases.
 

For 2010, average revenue per unit is expected to increase reflecting
the effects of higher rates comprised of pricing increases, increasing contract
escalators, higher fuel surcharges, and increased length of haul for export
coal traffic.

Coal represented 29% of NS'
revenues in 2009 and 80% of shipments handled originated on NS' lines.
 
As shown in the following table, tonnage
declined in all coal markets.

In 2008, coal revenues
increased $796 million, or 34%, compared with 2007, reflecting higher
rates, including fuel surcharges, and a 4% increase in traffic volume.
 
Coal average revenue per unit was up 29%
compared with 2007, reflecting higher rates (which were comprised of pricing
increases, contract escalators and the effect of increased longer-haul export
coal traffic) and increased fuel surcharges.

NS was recently involved in
litigation with Virginia Electric and Power Company/Old Dominion Electric
Cooperative (Virginia Power) regarding rate adjustment provisions in a
transportation contract between them.  NS was also recently involved in
litigation with a coal customer to enforce provisions of a transportation
contract related to reimbursement of certain infrastructure expenses incurred
by NS and minimum tonnage commitments and related deficit charges.  NS
settled both of these matters during the fourth quarter of 2009.  The
settlements did not have a material impact on NS' financial condition, results
of operations, or liquidity.

Utility coal

tonnage decreased 17% compared with 2008, a result of lower demand for
electricity induced by the downturn in the U.S. economy, natural gas competition,
and utility coal stockpiles that were above target levels across NS' service
area.

In 2008, utility coal tonnage
increased 1% compared with 2007, as a result of modest stockpile growth in the
Northeast.

For 2010, NS expects
electricity demand and natural gas prices to increase, which should lead to
higher coal-fired generation and demand.
 

However, utility coal tonnage may lag this recovery due to high
stockpile levels, at least through the first half of the year.

Export coal

tonnage decreased 22% compared to 2008, reflecting the global recession,
reduced demand for steel production and high inventory levels.
 
Norfolk volume decreased about 34,000
carloads, or 20%, and Baltimore volume was down about 21,000 carloads, or 38%.

In 2008, export coal tonnage
increased 48% compared to 2007, primarily due to increased global demand
coupled with weather-related supply constraints in Australia, reduced export
volume from China, and the weak U.S. dollar.
 

Norfolk volume increased about 51,000 carloads, or 39%, and Baltimore
volume was up about 28,000 carloads, or 102%.

For
2010, export coal tonnage is expected to increase, reflecting improved demand
for raw steel production.

Domestic metallurgical

coal

,
coke, and iron ore tonnage decreased 35% compared with 2008, reflecting reduced
demand for raw steel caused by the downturn in the U.S. economy which led to
blast furnace outages, reduced coke production schedules, and high inventory
levels.

In 2008, domestic
metallurgical coal, coke, and iron ore tonnage increased 2% compared with 2007,
reflecting the start up of a new coke plant.

For 2010, domestic
metallurgical coal, coke, and iron ore tonnage is expected to improve as the
economy continues to recover, resulting in increased demand for raw steel
production.

Other coal

tonnage (principally steam coal shipped to industrial plants) decreased 12%
compared to 2008, principally due to reduced production at NS-served plants
caused by the downturn in the U.S. economy.
 

In 2008, other coal tonnage decreased 13% compared to 2007, primarily
due to coal supply constraints.

For 2010, other coal tonnage
is expected to be down compared to 2009, reflecting reduced industrial coal
consumption.

GENERAL MERCHANDISE

revenues in 2009 decreased $1.3 billion, or 24%, compared with
2008, reflecting a 21% decline in traffic volume and a 3% decrease in average
revenue per unit, as higher rates were overshadowed by decreased fuel surcharge
revenues.

In 2008, general merchandise
revenues increased $296 million, or 6%, compared with 2007, as a 15%
increase in average revenue per unit, reflecting continued market-based pricing
and higher fuel surcharges, more than offset an 8% decline in traffic.

Agriculture, consumer products, and government

revenues decreased 8% in 2009, compared with
2008.
 
The revenue decline resulted from
an 8% decrease in traffic volumes as plant closures and production curtailments
led to fewer shipments of fertilizer and corn.

In 2008, agriculture,
consumer products, and government revenues increased 22%, compared with
2007.
 
The revenue improvement resulted
from higher average revenue per unit, which reflected increased rates and
higher fuel surcharge revenues.
 
Traffic
volume increased 2% as more ethanol, military, feed, soybeans, and food oils
shipments offset declines in fertilizers, corn, beverages, and consumer
products.

For 2010, agriculture revenues
are expected to increase as a result of increased volumes and higher average
revenue per unit, reflecting expected growth in the agri-fuels market,
including corn for ethanol production and finished ethanol as well as increased
fertilizer shipments.

Chemicals

revenues in 2009 decreased 15%, compared with 2008, due to a 12% decrease in
traffic volume and a 3% decline in average revenue per unit, primarily a result
of lower fuel surcharges.
  
The decline
in traffic volume was a result of continued weakness in housing construction
which drove declines in industrial intermediates, plastics and miscellaneous
chemicals.
 
Volumes associated with
petroleum-based products also declined as a result of reduced demand for
asphalt and production curtailments.

In 2008, chemicals revenue
increased 6%, compared with 2007, a result of increased rates and higher fuel
surcharge revenue.
 
Traffic volume
declined 8%, reflecting continued weakness in both industrial intermediates and
plastics (linked to housing construction declines) in addition to miscellaneous
chemicals and petroleum-based products.

For 2010, chemicals revenues are
expected to improve, principally due to higher average revenue per unit and
modestly increased traffic volumes.

Metals and construction

revenues decreased 40% in 2009, reflecting a 32%
decrease in traffic volume and a 12% decline in average revenue per unit,
primarily a result of lower fuel surcharges.
 

The decline in traffic volume was principally due to lower coil, scrap
metal, iron and steel shipments, in addition to reduced demand for construction
materials as a result of continued weakness in the housing, infrastructure, and
automotive sectors.

In 2008, metals and
construction revenues increased 9% as a 15% increase in average revenue per
unit that resulted from increased rates and higher fuel surcharge more than
offset the effects of a 5% decrease in traffic volume.
 
The decline in volume was due to reduced
demand for construction materials and lower coil, iron, and steel shipments,
reflecting the weak housing and automotive sectors.

For 2010, metals and
construction revenues are expected to increase as a result of a rise in average
revenue per unit, and higher construction-related traffic volumes due to growth
driven by increased federal and state infrastructure projects and recovery in
residential construction.

Paper, clay, and forest products

revenues decreased 26% in 2009, compared with 2008,
due to a 22% decrease in traffic volumes and a 5% decline in average revenue
per unit, primarily a result of lower fuel surcharges.
 
The volume decline reflected lower pulp
board, lumber, kaolin, printing paper, and wood chip shipments due to reduced
U. S. paper production and the slowdown in the housing market.

In 2008, paper, clay, and
forest products revenues increased 4% compared with 2007 due to a 13% increase
in average revenue per unit which more than offset an 8% decrease in traffic
volume.
 
The volume decline reflected the
continued housing slowdown and increased trucking capacity available to paper
customers.

For 2010, paper, clay, and
forest products revenues are expected to be modestly higher as slight average
revenue per unit increases will be offset in part by slightly lower volumes
driven by expectations for a gradual economic recovery during the course of the
year as the housing market rebounds from historical lows.

Automotive

revenues decreased 36% in 2009, compared to 2008, reflecting lower traffic
volumes and decreased average revenue per unit as fuel surcharges were
lower.
 
Volumes decreased 30%, primarily
as a result of a 32% decrease in North American light vehicle production as
manufacturers cut production in line with consumer demand.

In 2008, automotive revenues
decreased 16% compared to 2007 as lower traffic volumes offset higher average
revenue per unit.
 
Volumes decreased 23%,
reflecting reduced North American sales and production.
 
Automotive manufacturers, especially the
domestic producers, continued to experience significant sales declines during
the year.
 
Three assembly plants closed
during the year and six implemented shift reductions.
 
In addition, one manufacturer temporarily
closed an assembly plant to retool for a new product in 2010.

For 2010, automotive revenues
are expected to increase driven by higher average revenue per unit related to
network changes and the renegotiation of several contracts.
 
Automotive volumes are expected to remain
relatively flat.

INTERMODAL

revenues decreased $528 million, or 26%, compared with 2008, reflecting a
16% reduction in traffic volume and an 11% decrease in average revenue per
unit.
 
In 2009, all intermodal segments
experienced depressed volumes, reflecting the weak economy and lower consumer
demand.
 
International traffic volume
declined 30%; Premium business, which includes parcel and less-than-truckload
(LTL) carriers, decreased 14%; Triple Crown Services (Triple Crown), a service
with rail-to-highway trailers, experienced a 10% drop in volume; and Domestic
volume (which includes truckload and intermodal marketing companies' volumes)
decreased less than 1%.

In 2008, intermodal revenues
increased $137 million, or 7%, compared with 2007, as a 10% increase in
average revenue per unit (including fuel surcharges) offset a 3% reduction in
traffic volumes.
 
Domestic volume increased
8% compared with 2007, reflecting the relative fuel efficiency of intermodal
versus over-the-road transportation and service improvements.
 
International traffic volume declined 9%,
primarily driven by the weak economy and less inland rail movement of West
Coast port traffic that was partially offset by East Coast port volume
growth.
 
The Premium business, which
includes parcel and LTL carriers, decreased 6%, as reduced private empty
movements and soft parcel business offset LTL conversions.
 
Triple Crown, a service with rail-to-highway
trailers, experienced a 3% drop in volume primarily driven by reduced auto
parts shipments.

For 2010, intermodal revenues
are expected to experience a moderate increase due to higher average revenue
per unit and volumes as a result of a slowly strengthening economy.

Railway Operating Expenses

Railway operating expenses in
2009 were $6 billion, down $1.6 billion, or 21%, compared to
2008.
 
Expenses in 2008 were $7.6 billion,
up $730 million, or 11%, compared to 2007.
 

The decrease in 2009 was primarily due to lower volume-related expenses
and lower fuel prices.
 
The increase in
2008 was primarily due to higher fuel costs and increased compensation and
benefits expenses.
 
The railway operating
ratio, which measures the percentage of operating revenues consumed by
operating expenses, rose to 75.4% in 2009, compared with 71.1% in 2008 and
72.6% in 2007.

The

Compensation and benefits,

which represents 40% of total operating expenses,
decreased $283 million, or 11%, compared with 2008, primarily due to lower
volume-related payroll (down $217 million); reduced incentive and stock-based
compensation (down $117 million); the absence of the cost of lump-sum payments
due under the 2008 Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET)
agreement ($31 million); and, lower payroll taxes (down $26 million).
 
These decreases were partially offset by
increased wage rates (up $53 million); increased pension costs (up $42 million);
and higher medical benefits (up $25 million).

In 2008, compensation and
benefits increased $132 million, or 5%, compared with 2007, primarily due
to higher incentive compensation (up $66 million); increased wage rates
(up $54 million); costs associated with lump-sum payments due under the BLET
agreement; higher payroll taxes (up $15 million); and, the absence of the
2007 employment tax refund ($9 million).
 

These were partially offset by lower costs associated with trainees
(down $19 million); lower medical benefits resulting from higher employee
contributions (down $19 million); and, lower stock-based compensation (down
$7 million).
 
In 2008, compensation
and benefits expense also benefited from a net pension credit of $39 million.

NS employment averaged 28,593
in 2009 compared with 30,709 in 2008 and 30,806 in 2007.
 
The 2009 decrease was a direct result of
volume declines during the year.
 
NS
monitors forecasted volumes in light of current economic conditions to ensure
appropriate employment levels for service needs.
 
For 2010, NS expects agreement wages and
premiums for medical benefits, combined, will increase by approximately
$148 million compared to 2009.

Purchased services and rents

includes the costs of services purchased from outside
contractors, including the net costs of operating joint (or leased) facilities
with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals.
 
This category of expenses decreased
$196 million, or 12%, in 2009 compared to 2008, but increased
$48 million, or 3%, in 2008 compared to 2007.

Purchased services costs were
$1.087 billion in 2009, $1.242 billion in 2008, and $1.172 billion
in 2007.
 
The decrease in 2009 reflected
lower volume-related expenses such as transportation operating costs (including
automotive-related costs and crew transportation expenses), intermodal
operations costs, and mechanical and engineering expenses (largely because of
reduced maintenance activities).
 
These
declines were offset in part by increased professional and legal services.
 
The increase in 2008 reflected higher
intermodal operations costs, transportation operating costs, and professional
and legal services.

Equipment rents, which
includes the cost to NS of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other
railroads or private owners less the rent paid to NS for the use of its
equipment, amounted to $316 million, $357 million, and $379 million
for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.
 

The decrease in 2009 and 2008 was principally due to lower shipment
volumes while 2008 also reflected improved fleet utilization.

Fuel

expense, which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used
in railway operations, decreased $913 million, or 56%, in 2009 compared
with 2008, but increased $469 million, or 40%, in 2008 compared with
2007.
 
The decline in 2009 was
principally the result of lower fuel prices which had an impact of $600 million
and reduced fuel consumption which had an impact of $313 million.
 
The increase in 2008 reflected higher fuel
prices which had an impact of $511 million that was offset in part by a decline
in consumption which had an impact of $42 million.
 
Locomotive fuel prices declined 47% in 2009
compared with a 45% increase in 2008, and locomotive fuel consumption was down
19% in 2009 and 3% in 2008.

Depreciation

expense increased $33 million, or 4%, in 2009 compared to 2008, and
$29 million, or 4%, in 2008 compared to 2007, reflecting substantial
capital investments and improvements as NS continues to invest in its
infrastructure and equipment.

Materials and other

expenses (including the estimates of costs related to personal injury,
property damage, and environmental matters) decreased $211 million, or
25%, in 2009 compared with 2008, but increased $52 million, or 7%, in 2008
compared with 2007, as shown in the following table.

The
decrease in 2009 reflects lower locomotive, freight car, and roadway materials
expenses, lower loss and damage claims, favorable personal injury claims
development, reduced employee travel costs, a $21 million favorable adjustment
related to settlement of a multi-year state tax dispute, and the absence of the
2008 Avondale Mills settlement (see additional discussion below).

The
increase in 2008 was primarily due to costs associated with the Avondale Mills
settlement, as well as higher loss and damage claims and increased material
costs for equipment and roadway repairs.
 

These increases were partially offset by favorable personal injury claims
development.

In
April 2008, NS settled the lawsuit brought by Avondale Mills for claims
associated with the January 6, 2005 derailment in Graniteville, SC.
 
A portion of the settlement was not
reimbursed by insurance and was included in 2008 expenses.
 
The total liability related to the derailment
represents NS' best estimate based on current facts and circumstances.
 
The estimate includes amounts related to property
damage, personal injury and response costs.
 

NS' commercial insurance policies are expected to cover substantially
all expenses related to this derailment above the unreimbursed portion and NS'
self-insured retention, including NS' response costs and legal fees.
 
The Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect
long-term receivables for estimated recoveries from NS' insurance
carriers.
 
NS is engaged in arbitration
with two of its insurance carriers that failed to respond to insurance claims
submitted by NS.
 
NS believes these
expenses are covered by the insurance policies and recoveries of the contested
amounts are probable.
 
Accordingly, NS
has recorded the full recovery attributable to each carrier ($100 million
and $43 million).

The
largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury
costs.
 
Cases involving occupational
injuries comprised about 48% of total employee injury cases resolved and about 19%
of total payments made.
 
With its
long-established commitment to safety, NS continues to work actively to
eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs.
 
With respect to occupational injuries, which
are not caused by a specific accident or event but allegedly result from a
claimed exposure over time, the benefits of any existing safety initiatives may
not be realized immediately.
 
These types
of claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some of whom have
not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades.
 
The rail industry remains uniquely
susceptible to litigation involving job-related accidental injury and
occupational claims because of the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA),
which is applicable only to railroads.
 

FELA's fault-based system, which covers employee claims for job-related
injuries, produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared
with a no-fault workers' compensation system.

NS
maintains substantial amounts of insurance for potential third-party liability
and property damage claims.
 
It also
retains reasonable levels of risk through self-insurance (see Note 17).
 
NS expects insurance costs to be slightly
higher in 2010.

Other Income
- - Net

Other
income - net was $127 million in 2009, $110 million in 2008, and
$93 million in 2007 (see Note 2).
 

The increase in 2009 reflected higher net returns from corporate-owned
life insurance (up $32 million) offset in part by fewer gains on the sale of
property (down $11 million).

The
increase in 2008 reflected the absence of expenses related to synthetic fuel
adjustments (see "Income Taxes" below), reduced other interest expense
($27 million) largely due to adjustments to reflect the outcome of certain
tax examinations and higher coal royalties (up $12 million).
 
These benefits were offset in part by lower
returns and higher borrowing costs on corporate-owned life insurance (down
$38 million), lower interest income (down $25 million), fewer gains on
sales of property and investments (down $22 million), and lower equity in
the earnings of Conrail (down $16 million), which reflects the absence of
a tax audit settlement recorded by Conrail in 2007 ($18 million).

NS
has membership interests representing ownership in companies that owned and
operated facilities that produced synthetic fuel from coal.
 
In addition, NS purchased two facilities that
produced synthetic fuel from coal in 2007.
 

The production of synthetic fuel resulted in tax credits as well as
expenses related to the investments.
 
The
expenses are recorded as a component of "Other income - net" and the tax
credits, as well as tax benefits related to the expenses, are reflected in
"Provision for income taxes" (see further discussion below).

Income Taxes

Income
tax expense in 2009 was $588 million, for an effective rate of 36%,
compared with effective rates of 38% in 2008 and 35% in 2007.
 
The decrease in the rate for 2009 was
primarily due to improved net returns from corporate-owned life insurance and
the favorable resolution of state tax issues.
 

The increase in the rate for 2008 was primarily due to the absence of
synthetic fuel-related tax credits that expired at the end of 2007.

The
tax credits generated by NS' synthetic fuel-related investments reduced the
effective tax rate by 3% in 2007.
 
Net
income in 2007 reflected $13 million in net benefits from these credits as
shown below:

Bonus
depreciation was allowed for federal income taxes for 2008 and 2009 but expired
at the end of 2009.
 
As a result, current
taxes have been lower in recent years than might be expected in future years.

During
2009, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concluded its examination of NS' 2006
and 2007 consolidated federal income tax returns without a material effect on
income tax expense.
 
NS' consolidated
federal income tax return for 2008 is being audited by the IRS.

FINANCIAL
CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash provided by operating activities,

NS' principal source of liquidity, was
$1.9 billion in 2009 compared with $2.7 billion in 2008 and
$2.3 billion in 2007.
 
The decline
in 2009 reflects the $1.1 billion decrease in income from railway operations
offset in part by lower income tax payments.
 

The improvement in 2008 resulted from increased railway operating income
and from bonus tax depreciation which reduced current tax payments.
 
NS had working capital of $457 million
at December 31, 2009, compared with a working capital deficit of $106
million at December 31, 2008.
 
The
improvement was largely due to higher cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investment balances at year end, as well as the impact of lower income from
railway operations that resulted in decreases in current income taxes and
accounts payable, offset in part by decreases in accounts receivable and
increases in short-term debt.
 
NS expects
that cash on hand combined with cash flow provided by operating activities will
be sufficient to meet its ongoing obligations.
 

NS' cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment balances totaled $1.1
billion and $618 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Contractual obligations

at December 31, 2009, comprised of NS' long-term
debt (including capital leases) (see Note 8), operating leases (see
Note 9), agreements with CRC and long-term advances from Conrail (see
Note 5),
 
unconditional purchase
obligations (see Note 17), and unrecognized tax benefits (see

Cash used in investing activities

was $1.5 billion in 2009, compared with
$1.2 billion in 2008 and $1 billion in 2007.
 
The increase in 2009 primarily reflected
lower proceeds from investment sales and higher investment purchases, offset in
part by lower property additions.
 
The
increase in 2008 primarily reflected increased property additions.

Property
additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category.

For 2010, NS has budgeted
$1.44 billion for capital expenditures.
 

The anticipated spending includes $706 million for roadway projects,
including the normalized replacement of rail, ties and ballast, and the
improvement or replacement of bridges.
 

Planned investments in facilities and terminals of $184 million are
primarily for intermodal terminals and equipment to add capacity to the
intermodal network, including the Crescent Corridor initiative, and bulk
transfer facilities and mechanical service shops.
 
Technology investments of $140 million are
planned for new or upgraded systems and computers.
 
The majority of the anticipated spending on
technology investments is attributable to preliminary implementation of positive
train control.
 
Infrastructure
investments of $110 million are planned for various public-private partnership
investments such as the Heartland Corridor and the Chicago Regional
Environmental and Transportation Efficiency (CREATE) project, and network
improvements to increase mainline capacity and accommodate traffic growth.
 
NS also expects to spend

$81 million on equipment, primarily continued improvements to the locomotive
fleet, including the rebuild and upgrade of existing units.
 
All capital expenditures are expected to be
made with internally generated funds.
 
NS
expects implementation of positive train control to result in additional
capital expenditures of at least $700 million in the years 2011 through 2015.

The Heartland Corridor is a
package of proposed clearance improvements and other facilities that will
create a seamless high-capacity intermodal route across Virginia and West
Virginia to Midwest markets.
 
During
2006, NS, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and the states of Ohio,
West Virginia and Virginia entered into a Memoranda of Agreement with respect
to the tunnel clearance component of the Heartland Corridor that governs the
release of up to $95 million in authorized federal funding.
 
In 2006, NS also entered into agreements with
two states governing the use of up to $11 million in state funding for the
Heartland Corridor rail double-stack clearance project.
 
NS began work on the Heartland Corridor
tunnel clearances in October 2007 and the entire project is expected to be
completed in 2010.
 
NS expects to spend
about $23 million in 2010 in connection with this project.

The CREATE project is a
public-private partnership to reduce rail and highway congestion and add
freight and passenger capacity in the metropolitan Chicago area.
 
NS and other railroads have agreed to
participate in CREATE.
 
A portion of
public funding has been approved and the parties have developed a list of projects
to be included in Phase I of the project.
 

A total of $100 million in public funding has been secured for
Phase I and the railroads have contributed an additional $100 million.
 
The railroads expect to complete Phase I by
the end of 2011.
 
As currently planned,
the total project is estimated to cost $3.1 billion with city, state, and
federal support.
 
If additional public
funding is secured, the railroads are expected to contribute a total of $169 million
towards the entire project.
 
NS expects
to spend approximately $11 million in 2010 related to the CREATE projects.

The Meridian Speedway is a
320-mile rail line between Meridian, Mississippi and Shreveport,
Louisiana.
 
On May 1, 2006, NS and Kansas
City Southern (KCS) formed a joint venture, Meridian Speedway LLC (MSLLC),
pursuant to which NS will contribute $300 million in cash, substantially
all of which will be used for capital improvements in exchange for a 30%
interest in the joint venture.
 
To date,
NS has contributed $283 million.
 
At
the formation of MSLLC, KCS contributed the Meridian Speedway.
 
NS is recognizing its pro rata share of the
joint venture's earnings or loss as required under the equity method of
accounting.
 
NS' total investment in
MSLLC is supported by the fair value of the rail line as well as intangible
assets obtained through the transaction.
 

The joint venture increases capacity and is designed to improve service
over the Meridian Speedway into the Southeast.

During the second quarter of
2009, NS and Pan Am Railways, Inc. (Pan Am) formed a joint venture, Pan Am
Southern LLC (PAS), a railroad company in which each has a 50% equity
interest.
 
Pan Am contributed to PAS a
155-mile main line track that runs between Mechanicville, New York and Ayer,
Massachusetts, along with 281 miles of secondary and branch lines, including
trackage rights in New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and
Vermont (collectively, the "PAS Lines"), and as of December 31, 2009, NS has
contributed cash and other property with a combined value of approximately $69
million and committed to contribute an additional $71 million in cash over the
next three years as evidenced by the Pan Am Notes (see Note 8).
 
A significant portion of NS' contributions has
and will continue to be used for capital improvements to the PAS Lines and the
related construction of new intermodal and automotive terminals in Albany, New
York and the Ayer, Massachusetts areas.
 

PAS is jointly controlled by NS and Pan Am, accordingly, NS accounts for
its interest in PAS using the equity method of accounting.

The Crescent Corridor
consists of a program of improvements to infrastructure and other facilities
geared toward creating a seamless, high-capacity intermodal route spanning 11
states from New Jersey to Louisiana and offering truck-competitive service
along several major interstate highway corridors, including I-81, I-85, I-20,
I-40, I-59, and I-75.
 
Based on the
public benefits that stand to be derived in the form of highway congestion
relief, NS plans to implement certain elements of the Crescent Corridor program
of projects through a series of public-private partnerships.
 
Although there is not yet a single,
integrated plan for the Crescent Corridor, preliminary work has begun and is
slated to continue in 2010, including continued infrastructure improvements and
other design and engineering work along the Virginia portion of the Corridor
consistent with NS' matching obligation with respect to funds provided by the
Commonwealth of Virginia.
 
If requested
public-private partnership agreements are funded in 2010, NS' capital
expenditures in 2010 related to Crescent Corridor projects may be as high as $41 million.

The MidAmerica Corridor is a
proposed cooperative arrangement between NS and Canadian National Railway (CN)
to effectively share track between Chicago, St. Louis, Kentucky, and
Mississippi in order to establish more efficient routes for traffic moving
between the midwestern and southeastern U.S., including potential coal traffic
moving to NS-served southeastern utility plants from CN-served Illinois Basin
coal producers.
 
To implement the
MidAmerica Corridor, NS, at its option, would expend funds to upgrade the rail
line operated by West Tennessee Railway between Fulton, Kentucky, and Corinth,
Mississippi, a line over which NS would operate pursuant to recently obtained
trackage rights.
 
Full implementation of
the MidAmerica Corridor arrangement is subject to regulatory approvals.

Cash used in financing activities

was $31 million in 2009, compared with
$1.1 billion in 2008, and $1.6 billion in 2007.
 
The change in 2009 reflected the absence of
share repurchase activity during the period and higher borrowings net of debt
repayments that were offset in part by fewer exercises of employee stock
options and increased dividends.
 
Due to
current economic and market conditions, the amount of future share repurchases
is uncertain and the timing and volume of such repurchases will be guided by
management's assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors.
 
The decrease in cash used in financing
activities in 2008 reflected a net increase in debt, compared with a net
decline in 2007, which was offset in part by higher dividend payments.

During the second quarter of
2009, NS issued $500 million of unsecured notes at 5.90% due 2019 pursuant to
its automatic shelf registration statement described below (see Note 8).
 
The net proceeds from the offering were $496
million after deducting the purchase discount and expenses.
 
NS also issued a total of $75 million in
non-interest bearing notes payable with maturity dates beginning in 2010 and
ending in 2012 as part of its total investment in Pan Am Southern LLC.

During the first quarter of
2009, NS issued $500 million of unsecured notes at 5.75% due 2016 in a private
offering.
 
The net proceeds from the
offering were $494 million after deducting the purchase discount and
expenses.
 
During the fourth quarter of
2009, NS exchanged the unregistered securities with essentially identical
securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933.

NS has authority from its
Board of Directors to issue an additional $500 million of debt or equity
securities through public or private sale.
 

During the first quarter of 2009, NS filed a Form S-3 automatic shelf
registration statement for well-known seasoned issuers under which, as of
December 31, 2009, up to $500 million could be issued under this authority.

NS also has in place and
available a $1 billion, five-year credit agreement expiring in 2012, which
provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes covenants.
 
NS had no amounts outstanding under this
facility at December 31, 2009, and NS is in compliance with all of its
covenants.
 
In October 2009, NS renewed
and amended its accounts receivable securitization program with a 364-day term
to run until October 2010.
 
NS reduced
the total amount that can be borrowed from $500 million to $350 million to more
closely match its liquidity requirements and receivables profile.
 
There was $200 million outstanding under this
program at December 31, 2009 (see Note 8).

Looking forward, NS' annual
debt maturities are relatively modest and stable from year to year (see
Note 8).
 
Overall, NS' goal is to
maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support NS' business
strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial
statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts
of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
 
These estimates and assumptions may require
significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, and future
events are likely to occur that may require management to make changes to these
estimates and assumptions.
 
Accordingly,
management regularly reviews these estimates and assumptions based on
historical experience, changes in the business environment, and other factors
that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
 
Management regularly discusses the
development, selection, and disclosures concerning critical accounting
estimates with the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.

Pensions and Other Postretirement
Benefits

Accounting for pensions and
other postretirement benefit plans requires management to make several
estimates and assumptions (see Note 11).
 

These include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans'
assets, projected increases in medical costs, and the expected retirement age
of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality.
 
In addition, the amounts recorded are
affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated
liabilities are discounted to their present value.
 
Management makes these estimates based on the
company's historical experience and other information that it deems pertinent
under the circumstances (for example, expectations of future stock market
performance).
 
Management utilizes an
independent consulting actuarial firm's studies to assist it in selecting
appropriate assumptions and valuing its related liabilities.

NS' net pension expense,
which is included in "Compensation and benefits" in its Consolidated Statements
of Income, was $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
 
In recording this amount, NS assumed a
long-term investment rate of return of 8.75%, which was supported by the
long-term total rate of return on plan assets since inception.
 
A one percentage point change to this rate of
return assumption would result in a $16 million change to the pension
expense, and, as a result, an equal change in "Compensation and benefits"
expense.
 
Changes that are reasonably
likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age, projected earnings,
and mortality would not be expected to have a material effect on NS' net pension
expense or net pension liability in the future.
 

The net pension liability is recorded at its net present value using a
discount rate that is based on the current interest rate environment in light
of the timing of expected benefit payments.
 

NS utilizes an analysis in which the projected annual cash flows from
the pension and postretirement benefit plans were matched with a yield curve
based on an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds.
 
NS used the results of the yield curve to
select the discount rate that matches the payment stream of the benefits in
these plans.

NS' net cost for other
postretirement benefits, which is also included in "Compensation and benefits,"
was $91 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
 
In recording this expense and valuing the net
liability for other postretirement benefits, which is included in "Other
postretirement benefits," management estimated future increases in health-care
costs.
 
These assumptions, along with the
effect of a one percentage point change in them, are described in Note 11.

Properties and Depreciation

Most of NS' total assets are
long-lived railway properties (see Note 6).
 
As disclosed in Note 1, NS' properties
are depreciated using group depreciation.
 

Rail is depreciated primarily on the basis of use measured by gross-ton
miles.
 
Other properties are depreciated
generally using the straight-line method over the lesser of estimated service
or lease lives.
 
NS reviews the carrying
amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash
flows.
 
Assets that are deemed impaired
as a result of such review are recorded at the lesser of carrying amount or
fair value.

NS' depreciation expense is
based on management's assumptions concerning service lives of its properties as
well as the expected net salvage that will be received upon their
retirement.
 
In developing these
assumptions, NS' management utilizes periodic depreciation studies that are
performed by an outside firm of consulting engineers.
 
These studies analyze NS' historical patterns
of asset use and retirement and take into account any expected change in
operation or maintenance practices.
 
NS'
recent experience with these studies has been that while they do result in changes
in the rates used to depreciate its properties, these changes have not caused a
significant effect to its annual depreciation expense.
 
The studies may also indicate that the
recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the
amount indicated by the study.
 
Any such
deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over
the remaining service lives of the affected class of property.
 
NS' depreciation expense for the year ended
December 31, 2009, amounted to $837 million.
 
NS' weighted-average depreciation rates for
2009 are disclosed in Note 6; a one-tenth percentage point increase (or
decrease) in these rates would have resulted in a $29 million increase (or
decrease) to depreciation expense.

Personal Injury, Environmental, and
Legal Liabilities

NS' expense for casualties
and other claims, included in "Materials and other," amounted to
$102 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
 
Most of this expense was NS' accrual related
to personal injury liabilities.
 

Job-related personal injury and occupational claims are subject to FELA,
which is applicable only to railroads.
 

FELA's fault-based tort system produces results that are unpredictable
and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault worker's compensation system.
 
The variability inherent in this system could
result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded.
 
In all cases, NS records a liability when the
expected loss for the claim is both probable and estimable.

To aid in valuing its
personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during each
period, NS' management utilizes studies prepared by an independent consulting
actuarial firm.
 
For employee personal
injury cases, the actuarial firm studies NS' historical patterns of reserving
for claims and subsequent settlements, taking into account relevant outside
influences.
 
An estimate of the ultimate
amount of the liability, which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted
claims, is based on the results of this analysis.
 
For occupational injury claims, the actuarial
firm studies NS' history of claim filings, severity, payments and other
relevant facts.
 
Additionally, the
estimate of the ultimate loss for occupational injuries includes a provision
for those claims that have been incurred but not reported by projecting NS'
experience into the future as far as can be reasonably determined.
 
NS has recorded this actuarially determined
liability.
 
The liability is dependent
upon many individual judgments made as to the specific case reserves as well as
the judgments of the consulting actuary and management in the periodic
studies.
 
Accordingly, there could be
significant changes in the liability, which NS would recognize when such a
change became known.
 
Recent actuarial
studies have reflected favorable claims development and, accordingly, those
changes in estimates have reduced the annual cost related to personal injuries
to $51 million in 2009 from $78 million in 2008.
 
While the liability recorded is supported by
the most recent study, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate liability
could be higher or lower.

NS is subject to various
jurisdictions' environmental laws and regulations.
 
It is NS' policy to record a liability where
such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably
(see Note 17).
 
Claims, if any,
against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS, are
reflected as receivables (when collection is probable) in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets and are not netted against the associated NS liability.
 
Environmental engineers regularly participate
in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary
adjustments to liability estimates.
 
NS
also has established an Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior
managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy.

Operating expenses for
environmental matters totaled approximately $20 million in 2009,
$18 million in 2008, and $16 million in 2007, and capital
expenditures for environmental matters totaled approximately $11 million
in 2009 and $7 million in both 2008 and 2007.
 
Capital expenditures for environmental
matters in 2010 are expected to be about $9 million.

NS' Consolidated Balance
Sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of
$32 million at December 31, 2009, and $42 million at
December 31, 2008 (of which $12 million is classified as a current
liability at the end of each period).
 
At
December 31, 2009, the liability represents NS' estimate of the probable
cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 144 known
locations.
 
As of that date, nine sites
accounted for $15 million of the liability, and no individual site was
considered to be material.
 
NS
anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years;
however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period.

At 30 locations, one or more
NS subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have
been identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable
state statutes, which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs.

With respect to known
environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state
authorities), estimates of NS' ultimate potential financial exposure for a
given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise
because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques,
the likely development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of
determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each
potential participant's share of any estimated loss (and that participant's
ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing
liability.
 
NS estimates its
environmental remediation liability on a site-by-site basis, using assumptions
and judgments that management deems appropriate for each site.
 
As a result, it is not practical to
quantitatively describe the effects of changes in these many assumptions and
judgments.
 
NS has consistently applied
its methodology of estimating its environmental liabilities.

On April 24, 2008, the United
States Department of Justice (DOJ) brought an action against NS for alleged
violations of federal environmental laws resulting from the discharge of
chlorine and oil that occurred as a result of the January 6, 2005 derailment in
Graniteville, SC, including claims for civil penalties as well as injunctive
relief.
 
Although NS' June 24, 2008
motion to dismiss for failure to allege sufficient facts was granted, DOJ was
given leave to, and did, amend its complaint.
 

The litigation has been stayed by the district court as the parties work
to conclude an agreed upon consent decree.
 

NS does not believe that the resolution of these claims will have a
material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or
liquidity.

Based on its assessment of
the facts and circumstances now known, management believes that it has recorded
the probable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which NS is
aware.
 
Further, management believes that
it is unlikely that any known matters, either individually or in the aggregate,
will have a material adverse effect on NS' financial position, results of
operations, or liquidity.

Norfolk Southern and certain
subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating
principally to railroad operations.
 
When
management concludes that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and
the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, it is accrued through
a charge to expenses.
 
While the ultimate
amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent
on future developments, in management's opinion the recorded liability, if any,
is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims.
 
However, the final outcome of any of these
lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable or
unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be
significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter.
 
Any adjustments to recorded liabilities will
be reflected in expenses in the periods in which such adjustments are known.

Income Taxes

NS' net long-term deferred
tax liability totaled $6.7 billion at December 31, 2009 (see
Note 3).
 
This liability is
estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in
the financial statements.
 
After
application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is
required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in the
corporate income tax returns.
 
For state
income and other taxes, judgment is also required with respect to the
apportionment among the various jurisdictions.
 

A valuation allowance is recorded if management expects that it is more
likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized.
 
NS had a $14 million valuation allowance
on $871 million of deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2009,
reflecting the expectation that most of these assets will be realized.

In addition, NS has a
recorded liability for its estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return.
 

Judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state
tax laws and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position
will be sustained on examination and, if so, judgment is also required as to
the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon
settlement with the taxing authority.
 

Management believes this liability for uncertain tax positions to be
adequate.
 
Income tax expense is adjusted
in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available
or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded.
 
For every one half percent change in the 2009
effective tax rate, net income would have changed by $8 million.

OTHER MATTERS

Labor Agreements

More than 80% of NS' railroad
employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor
unions.
 
These agreements remain in
effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act (RLA).
 
NS largely bargains nationally in concert
with other major railroads.
 
Moratorium
provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and the unions may
propose changes.

NS reached national
agreements that extended through 2009 with all of the major rail unions.
 
The current agreement with the BLET extends
through 2014.
 
Because NS has reached
separate agreements with the BLET and the American Train Dispatchers
Association (ATDA), only the health and welfare provisions from the national
agreements apply to NS' locomotive engineers and ATDA-represented
dispatchers.
 
NS has also reached
agreement with Longshoremen at Ashtabula (Ohio) Docks who are represented by
the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) and do not participate in
national bargaining.
 
On or after
November 1, 2009, NS and the nation's other major carriers served new proposals
to begin the next round of negotiations.
 

The outcome of the negotiations cannot be determined at this point.

Market Risks and Hedging Activities

NS manages its overall exposure
to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed- and floating-rate debt
instruments and by entering into interest-rate hedging transactions to achieve
an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio.

At December 31, 2009,
NS' debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled $204 million.
 
A 1% point increase in interest rates would
increase NS' total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by
approximately $2 million.
 

Management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations
applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on NS'
financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

Some of NS' capital leases,
which carry an average fixed rate of 7%, were effectively converted to variable
rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements.
 
On December 31, 2009, the average pay
rate under these agreements was 1%, and the average receive rate was 6%.
 
During 2009 and 2008, the effect of the swaps
was to reduce interest expense by less than $1 million in both
periods.
 
A portion of the lease
obligations is payable in Japanese yen.
 

NS eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each
lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yen-denominated
obligation.
 
Most of these deposits are
held by foreign banks, primarily Japanese.
 

As a result, NS is exposed to financial market risk relative to
Japan.
 
Counterparties to the interest
rate swaps and Japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial
institutions believed by management to be creditworthy.

Inflation

In preparing financial
statements, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require the use of
historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement
cost of property.
 
NS, a capital-intensive
company, has most of its capital invested in such property.
 
The replacement cost of these assets, as well
as the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the
amounts reported on the basis of historical cost.

Proposed Legislation and Regulations on
Safety and Transportation of Hazardous Materials

Federal regulations were
adopted in late 2008 on safety and transportation of hazardous materials.
 
NS is in compliance with those regulations
currently effective and expects to be in compliance with those regulations to
become effective at a later date.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains
forward-looking statements that may be identified by the use of words like
"believe," "expect," "anticipate," and "project."
 
Forward-looking statements reflect
management's good-faith evaluation of information currently available.

However, such statements are
dependent on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external
variables over which management has little or no control, including:
 
domestic and international economic
conditions; interest rates; the business environment in industries that produce
and consume rail freight; competition and consolidation within the
transportation industry; the operations of carriers with which NS interchanges;
acts of terrorism or war; fluctuation in prices of key materials, in particular
diesel fuel; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages; legislative
and regulatory developments; results of litigation; changes in securities and
capital markets; disruptions to NS' technology infrastructure, including
computer systems; and natural events such as severe weather, hurricanes, and
floods.
 
For a discussion of significant
risk factors applicable to NS, see Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors."
 
Forward-looking statements are not, and
should not be relied upon as, a guarantee of future performance or results, nor
will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by
which any such performance or results will be achieved.
 
As a result, actual outcomes and results may
differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements.
 
NS undertakes no obligation to update or
revise forward-looking statements.

Norfolk Southern Corporation

Management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting.
 
In order to ensure that the
Corporation's internal control over financial reporting is effective, management
regularly assesses such controls and did so most recently for its financial
reporting as of December 31, 2009.
 
This
assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial
reporting described in

Internal
Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
 

Based on this assessment, management has concluded that the Corporation
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2009.

KPMG
LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the
Corporation's financial statements and issued an attestation report on the
Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2009.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Norfolk
Southern Corporation:

We
have audited Norfolk Southern Corporation's internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).
 
Norfolk Southern Corporation's
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of
Management.
 
Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
 

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects.
 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
 
Our audit also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
 
We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.
 

A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements.
 
Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In
our opinion, Norfolk Southern Corporation maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009,
based on criteria established in

Internal
Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of
Norfolk Southern Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and
2008, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2009, and our report dated February 17, 2010,
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Norfolk
Southern Corporation:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Norfolk Southern
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the
related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity, and
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2009.
 
In connection
with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited
the financial statement schedule as listed in Item 15(A)2.
 
These consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's
management.
 
Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
 

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.
 
An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements.
 
An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.
 
We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Norfolk Southern
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.
 

Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Norfolk Southern Corporation's
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based
on criteria established in

Internal
Control - Integrated Framework,

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated
February 17, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of
the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Norfolk Southern Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The
following Notes are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Management has evaluated subsequent events
through February 17, 2010, which is the date these consolidated financial
statements were issued.

1.
 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Description
of Business

Norfolk
Southern Corporation is a Virginia-based holding company engaged principally in
the rail transportation business, operating approximately 21,000 route miles
primarily in the East and Midwest.
 
These
consolidated financial statements include Norfolk Southern Corporation (Norfolk
Southern) and its majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries (collectively,
NS).
 
Norfolk Southern's major subsidiary
is Norfolk Southern Railway Company (NSR).
 

All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

NSR
and its railroad subsidiaries transport raw materials, intermediate products
and finished goods classified in the following market groups (percent of total
railway operating revenues in 2009):
 

coal (29%); intermodal (19%); agriculture/consumer products/government
(15%); chemicals (13%); metals/construction (9%); paper/clay/forest
products (8%); and, automotive (7%).
 

Although most of NS' customers are domestic, ultimate points of
origination or destination for some of the products transported (particularly
coal bound for export and some intermodal containers) may be outside the U.S.
 
More than 80% of NS' railroad employees are
covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions.

Use of
Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
 
Management periodically reviews its
estimates, including those related to the recoverability and useful lives of
assets, as well as liabilities for litigation, environmental remediation,
casualty claims, income taxes and pension and other postretirement
benefits.
 
Changes in facts and
circumstances may result in revised estimates.

Revenue
Recognition

Transportation
revenue is recognized proportionally as a shipment moves from origin to
destination and related expenses are recognized as incurred.
 
Refunds (which are primarily volume-based
incentives) are recorded as a reduction to revenues on the basis of
management's best estimate of projected liability, which is based on historical
activity, current traffic counts and the expectation of future activity.
 
NS regularly monitors its contract refund
liability, and historically, the estimates have not differed significantly from
the amounts ultimately refunded.
 
Switching,
demurrage and other incidental service revenues are recognized when the
services are performed.

Derivatives

NS
does not engage in the trading of derivatives.
 

NS uses derivative financial instruments in the management of its mix of
fixed- and floating-rate debt.
 

Management has determined that these derivative instruments qualify as fair-value
hedges, having values that highly correlate with the underlying hedged
exposures, and has designated such instruments as hedging transactions.
 
Income and expense related to the derivative
financial instruments are recorded in the same category as generated by the
underlying asset or liability.
 
Credit
risk related to the derivative financial instruments is considered to be
minimal and is managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties
and periodic settlements (see Note 16).

Cash
Equivalents

"Cash equivalents" are highly liquid investments
purchased three months or less from maturity.

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts

NS'
allowance for doubtful accounts was $5 million at December 31, 2009 and
2008.
 
To determine its allowance for
doubtful accounts, NS evaluates historical loss experience (which has not been
significant), the characteristics of current accounts, and general economic
conditions and trends.

Materials
and Supplies

"Materials
and supplies," consisting mainly of fuel oil and items for maintenance of
property and equipment, are stated at the lower of average cost or market.
 
The cost of materials and supplies expected
to be used in capital additions or improvements is included in "Properties."

Investments

Debt
securities classified as "held-to-maturity" are reported at amortized cost and
marketable equity and debt securities classified as "trading" or
"available-for-sale" are recorded at fair value.
 
Unrealized after-tax gains and losses for
investments designated as "available-for-sale" are recognized in "Accumulated
other comprehensive loss."

Investments
where NS has the ability to exercise significant influence over but does not
control the entity are accounted for using the equity method, whereby the
investment is carried at the cost of the acquisition plus NS' equity in
undistributed earnings or losses since acquisition.

Properties

"Properties"
are stated principally at cost and are depreciated using group
depreciation.
 
Rail is depreciated primarily
on the basis of use measured by gross ton-miles.
 
Other properties are depreciated generally
using the straight-line method over the lesser of estimated service or lease
lives.
 
Depletion of natural resources
(see Note 2) is based on units of production.
 
Depreciation in the Consolidated Statements
of Cash Flows includes depreciation and depletion.
 
NS capitalizes interest on major capital
projects during the period of their construction.
 
Expenditures, including those on leased
assets that extend an asset's useful life or increase its utility, are
capitalized.
 
Expenditures capitalized
include those that are directly related to a capital project and may include
materials, labor and equipment, in addition to an allocable portion of indirect
costs that clearly relate to a particular project.
 
Costs related to repairs and maintenance
activities that do not extend an asset's useful life or increase its utility
are expensed when such repairs are performed.
 

When properties other than land and nonrail assets are sold or retired
in the ordinary course of business, the cost of the assets, net of sale
proceeds or salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation, and no gain or
loss is recognized through income.
 
Gains
and losses on disposal of land and nonrail assets are included in "Other income
- - net" (see Note 2) since such income is not a product of NS' railroad
operations.

NS
reviews the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based
on future undiscounted cash flows.
 

Assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded
at the lower of carrying amount or fair value.

Required Accounting
Changes

In June 2009, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 168, "The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the
Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, a replacement of FASB
Statement No. 162" (Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009-01).
 
This statement, effective for interim and
annual periods ending after September 15, 2009, established the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification (Codification or ASC) as the single source of
authoritative Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
 
SFAS 168 is recognized by the FASB to be
applied by nongovernmental entities and stated that all guidance contained in
the Codification has an equal level of authority.
 
The authoritative accounting guidance
recognized that rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) under federal securities laws are also sources of
authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants.
 

NS adopted the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance for
the interim reporting period ending September 30, 2009, the adoption of which
did not have a material effect on NS' consolidated financial statements.

FASB Staff Position (FSP) No.
132 (R)-1, "Employers' Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets"
(ASC 715-20-65-2), was issued on December 30, 2008.
 
The FSP, effective for fiscal years ending
after December 15, 2009, clarifies an employer's disclosures about plan assets of
a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan.
 
The FSP prescribes expanded disclosures
regarding investment allocation decisions, categories of plan assets, inputs,
and valuation techniques used to measure fair value, the effect of Level 3 inputs
on changes in plan assets and significant concentrations of risk.
 
NS adopted the FSP at the end of 2009 and it
did not have a material effect on NS' consolidated financial statements.

Effective
January 1, 2008, NS adopted SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" (ASC 820),
related to financial instrument assets and liabilities.
 
NS adopted the provisions of this standard
relative to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not
remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis in the first quarter of 2009.
 
This statement, effective for interim or
annual reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2007, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value in U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
 
Adoption did not have a material effect on
NS' consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 160 (SFAS 160), "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
Financial Statements" (ASC 810-10), which requires that noncontrolling
(minority) interests be reported as a component of equity.
 
NS adopted the statement in the first quarter
of 2009 with no material effect on NS' consolidated financial statements.

In
June 2008, the FASB issued FSP Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 03-6-1,
"Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions
are Participating Securities" (ASC 260-10).
 

This FSP addresses whether instruments granted in share-based payment
transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, need
to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under
the two-class method as described in SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share" (ASC
260-10).
 
NS adopted the FSP, which
affects the calculation of earnings per share, in the first quarter of
2009.
 
The provisions of the FSP were
applied retrospectively, but did not have a material effect on NS' consolidated
financial statements.

Effective
January 1, 2007, NS adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48),
"Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" (ASC 740-10), which clarifies
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's
financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes" (ASC 740-10).
 
FIN 48 prescribes a
recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return.
 

Under the guidelines of FIN 48, an entity should recognize the financial
statement benefit of a tax position if it determines that it is more likely
than not that the position will be sustained on examination (see Note 3).

NS had a 40.5% interest in a limited
liability company that owned and operated facilities that produced synthetic
fuel from coal.
 
In addition, in 2007 NS
purchased two facilities that produced synthetic fuel from coal.
 
The production of synthetic fuel resulted in
tax credits as well as expenses related to the investments.
 
The expenses are included in "Expenses
related to synthetic fuel investments" above.
 

The tax credits related to the synthetic fuel investments expired at the
end of 2007 and are no longer available.

Illinois
enacted tax legislation in August 2007, revised in January 2008, which modified
the way transportation companies apportion their taxable income to the
state.
 
The change resulted in an
increase in NS' income tax liability as shown above.

Deferred Tax
Assets and Liabilities

Certain
items are reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax
purposes.
 
Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recorded in recognition of these differences.

Except
for amounts for which a valuation allowance has been provided, management
believes that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations
will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets.
 
The valuation allowance at the end of each
year relates to subsidiary state income tax net operating losses that may not
be utilized prior to their expiration.
 

The total valuation allowance increased $3 million in 2009, and
$1 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively.

$


Included
in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009, are potential
benefits of $48 million that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.
 
As a result of the implementation of FIN 48
(ASC 740-10) on January 1, 2007 (see Note 1), NS recognized a $10 million
increase to stockholders equity, $2 million of which related to investments
accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
 
Unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted in the
period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the
final outcome differs from the amount recorded.

NS
expects that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31,
2009, will decrease by approximately $17 million in 2010 due to tax positions
for which there was an uncertainty about the timing of deductibility in earlier
years but deductibility may become certain by the close of 2010.
 
NS' consolidated federal income tax return
for 2008 is being audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
 
State income tax returns generally are
subject to examination for a period of three to four years after filing of the
return.
 
In addition, NS is generally
obligated to report changes in taxable income arising from federal income tax
examinations to the states within a period of up to two years from the date the
federal examination is final.
 
NS has
various state income tax returns either under examination, administrative
appeals, or litigation.
 
It is reasonably
possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in 2010 as
a result of the lapse of state statutes of limitations, but the amount is not
expected to be significant.
 
NS does not
expect that any of the above potential changes in unrecognized tax benefits
will have a material effect on NS' financial position, results of operations,
or liquidity.

Interest
related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is included in "Other income -
net," amounted to $6 million of income in 2009, $15 million of income
in 2008, and $12 million of expense in 2007.
 
Penalties related to tax matters are included
in "Provision for income taxes" and totaled zero in each of 2009, 2008, and
2007.
 
NS has recorded a liability of $12 million
at December 31, 2009, and $20 million at December 31, 2008, for the
payment of interest on unrecognized tax benefits.
 
NS has no liability recorded at
December 31, 2009 and 2008, for the payment of penalties on unrecognized
tax benefits.

4.
 

Fair Value

Fair
Value Measurements

ASC 820-10, "Fair Value Measurements," established a
framework for measuring fair value and a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes
the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad
levels, as follows:

Level 1

Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted
  quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that NS
  has the ability to access.

Level 2

Inputs to the valuation methodology include:

Quoted
       prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;


Quoted
       prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive
       markets;


Inputs
       other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability;


Inputs
       that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market
       data by correlation or other means.

If the asset or liability has a specified
  (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially
  the full term of the asset or liability.

Level 3

Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable
  and significant to the fair value measurement.

The asset's or liability's fair value measurement
level within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is
significant to the fair value measurement.
 

At December 31, 2009 for assets measured at fair value on a recurring
basis, there were $90 million of available-for-sale securities as valued under level
2 of the fair value hierarchy.
 
There
were no such assets valued under level 1 or level 3 valuation techniques.

Fair Values
of Financial Instruments

In
accordance with ASC 825, "Financial Instruments," NS has evaluated the fair
values of financial instruments and methods used to determine those fair
values.
 
The fair values of "Cash and
cash equivalents," "Short-term investments," "Accounts receivable," "Accounts
payable," and "Short-term debt" approximate carrying values because of the
short maturity of these financial instruments.
 

The carrying value of corporate-owned life insurance is recorded at cash
surrender value and, accordingly, approximates fair value.
 
The carrying amounts and estimated fair
values for the remaining financial instruments, excluding derivatives and
investments accounted for under the equity method, consisted of the following
at December 31:

$

(7,053)

$

(8,048)

$

(6,667)

$

(6,885)

Underlying
net assets were used to estimate the fair value of investments.
 
The fair value of notes receivable are based
on future discounted cash flows.
 
The
fair values of debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or discounted
cash flows using current interest rates for debt with similar terms, company
rating, and remaining maturity.

Carrying
amounts of available-for-sale securities reflect unrealized holding losses of
less than $1 million on December 31, 2009, and zero on December 31,
2008.
 
Sales of "available-for-sale"
securities were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008,
and 2007.

Meridian Speedway LLC, a joint venture formed with Kansas City Southern.
 
Also included is NS' investment in Pan Am
Southern LLC, a joint venture formed with Pan Am Railways, Inc. in 2009, which
was $140 million at December 31, 2009.

Investment
in Conrail

Through
a limited liability company, Norfolk Southern and CSX Corporation (CSX) jointly
own Conrail Inc. (Conrail), whose primary subsidiary is Consolidated Rail
Corporation (CRC).
 
NS has a 58% economic
and 50% voting interest in the jointly owned entity, and CSX has the remainder
of the economic and voting interests.
 
NS
is applying the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail.
 
NS is amortizing the excess of the purchase
price over Conrail's net equity using the principles of purchase accounting,
based primarily on the estimated useful lives of Conrail's depreciable property
and equipment, including the related deferred tax effect of the differences in
tax accounting bases for such assets, as all of the purchase price at
acquisition was allocable to Conrail's tangible assets and liabilities.

At
December 31, 2009, based on the funded status of Conrail's pension plans, NS increased
its proportional investment in Conrail by $24 million.
 
This resulted in income of $22 million
recorded to "other comprehensive income (loss)" and a combined federal and
state deferred tax liability of $2 million.
 
At December 31, 2008, NS' year-end adjustment
reduced its proportional investment in Conrail by $60 million.
 
This resulted in a $55 million loss
recorded to "other comprehensive income (loss)" and a combined federal and
state deferred tax asset of $5 million.
 

At December 31, 2009, the difference between NS' investment in
Conrail and its share of Conrail's underlying net equity was $548 million.
 
NS' equity in the earnings of Conrail, net of
amortization, included in "Other income - net" was $32 million,
$29 million, and $45 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

CRC
owns and operates certain properties (the Shared Assets Areas) for the joint
and exclusive benefit of NSR and CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT).
 
The costs of operating the Shared Assets
Areas are borne by NSR and CSXT based on usage.
 

In addition, NSR and CSXT pay CRC a fee for access to the Shared Assets
Areas.
 
"Purchased services and rents"
and "Fuel" include expenses for amounts due to CRC for operation of the Shared
Assets Areas totaling $123 million in 2009, $131 million in 2008 and
$126 million in 2007.
 
Future
minimum lease payments due to CRC under the Shared Assets Areas agreements are
as follows:
 
$29 million in each of
2010 through 2014 and $279 million thereafter.
 
NS provides certain general and
administrative support functions to Conrail, the fees for which are billed in
accordance with several service-provider arrangements and approximate $7 million
annually.

"Accounts
payable" includes $104 million at December 31, 2009, and
$82 million at December 31, 2008, due to Conrail for the operation of
the Shared Assets Areas.
 
In addition,
"Other liabilities" includes $133 million at December 31, 2009 and
2008, for long-term advances from Conrail, maturing 2035, that bear interest at
an average rate of 4.4%.

Investment
in Pan Am Southern LLC

During the second quarter of
2009, NS and Pan Am Railways, Inc. (Pan Am) formed a joint venture, Pan Am
Southern LLC (PAS), a railroad company in which each has a 50% equity
interest.
 
Pan Am contributed to PAS a
155-mile main line track that runs between Mechanicville, New York and Ayer,
Massachusetts, along with 281 miles of secondary and branch lines, including
trackage rights in New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and
Vermont (collectively, the "PAS Lines").
 

As of December 31, 2009, NS has contributed cash and other property with
a combined value of approximately $69 million and committed to contribute an
additional $71 million in cash over the next three years as evidenced by the
Pan Am Notes (see Note 8).
 
A significant
portion of NS' contributions will be used for capital improvements to the PAS
Lines and the related construction of new intermodal and automotive terminals
in Albany, New York and the Ayer, Massachusetts areas.
 
PAS is jointly controlled by NS and Pan Am,
accordingly NS accounts for its interest in PAS using the equity method of
accounting.

During the second quarter of
2009, NS issued $500 million of unsecured notes at 5.90% due 2019 pursuant to
its automatic shelf registration statement described below.
 
The net proceeds from the offering were
approximately $496 million after deducting the purchase discount and expenses.

During the first quarter of
2009, NS issued $500 million of unsecured notes at 5.75% due 2016 in a private
offering.
 
The net proceeds from the
offering were approximately $494 million after deducting the purchase discount
and expenses.
 
During the fourth quarter
of 2009, NS exchanged the unregistered securities with essentially identical
securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933.

During the second quarter of
2008, $200 million of commercial paper matured and was refinanced as part
of a private offering under which NS issued and sold $600 million of
unsecured notes at 5.75% due 2018.
 
NS
subsequently exchanged substantially all of these unregistered securities with
essentially identical securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933.

In November 2007, NS entered into a $500 million
receivables securitization facility under which NSR sells substantially all of
its eligible third-party receivables to an NS subsidiary, which in turn may
transfer beneficial interests in the receivables to various commercial paper
vehicles.
 
Amounts received under the
facility are accounted for as borrowings.
 

Under this facility, NS received $100 million and repaid $200 million
in 2009.
 
At December 31, 2009 and 2008,
the amounts outstanding under the facility were $200 million at an average
variable interest rate of 2.22% and $300 million at an average variable
interest rate of 3.01%, respectively.
 
NS'
intent is to refinance $100 million and $300 million, respectively, of these
borrowings by issuing long-term debt, which is supported by its $1 billion
credit agreement (see below).
 

Accordingly, these amounts outstanding are included in the line item "Long-term
debt" and the remaining $100 million outstanding at December 31, 2009 is
included in the line item "Short-term debt" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 
The facility has a 364-day term which was
renewed and amended in October 2009 to run until October 2010.
 
NS reduced the total amount that can be
borrowed from $500 million to $350 million to more closely match its liquidity
requirements and receivables profile.
 
At
December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, the amounts of receivables
included in "Accounts receivable - net" serving as collateral for these
borrowings were $571 million and $719 million, respectively.

The railroad equipment
obligations and the capitalized leases are secured by liens on the underlying
equipment.
 
Certain lease obligations
require the maintenance of yen-denominated deposits, which are pledged to the
lessor to satisfy yen-denominated lease payments.
 
These deposits are included in "Other assets"
in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $47 million at
December 31, 2009, and $85 million at December 31, 2008.

Issuance of Debt or Equity Securities

NS has authority from its
board of directors to issue an additional $500 million of debt or equity
securities through public or private sale.
 

During the first quarter of 2009, NS filed a Form S-3 automatic shelf
registration statement for well-known seasoned issuers under which, as of
December 31, 2009, up to $500 million can be issued under this authority.

Credit Agreement, Debt Covenants, and
Commercial Paper

NS has in place and available
a $1 billion, five-year credit agreement expiring in 2012, which provides
for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes covenants.
 
NS had no amounts outstanding under this
facility at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and NS is in compliance with all
of the covenants.

NS has the ability to issue
commercial paper supported by its $1 billion credit agreement.
 
At December 31, 2009 and 2008, NS had no
outstanding commercial paper.

Pensions
and Other Postretirement Benefits

Norfolk
Southern and certain subsidiaries have both funded and unfunded defined benefit
pension plans covering principally salaried employees.
 
Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries
also provide specified health care and death benefits to eligible retired
employees and their dependents.
 
Under
the present plans, which may be amended or terminated at NS' option, a defined
percentage of health care expenses is covered, reduced by any deductibles,
co-payments, Medicare payments, and in some cases, coverage provided under
other group insurance policies.

Pension and
Other Postretirement Benefit Assumptions

Pension
and other postretirement benefit costs are determined based on actuarial
valuations that reflect appropriate assumptions as of the measurement date,
ordinarily the beginning of each year.
 

The funded status of the plans is determined using appropriate
assumptions as of each year end.
 
A
summary of the major assumptions follows:

To
determine the discount rate, NS utilized an analysis in which the projected
annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans were
matched with a yield curve based on an appropriate universe of high-quality
corporate bonds.
 
NS used the results of
the yield curve to select the discount rate that matches the payment stream of
the benefits in these plans.

Health Care
Cost Trend Assumptions

For
measurement purposes at December 31, 2009, increases in the per capita
cost of covered health care benefits were assumed to be 8.8% for 2009 and 8.5%
for 2010.
 
It is assumed the rate will decrease
gradually to an ultimate rate of 5% for 2019 and remain at that level
thereafter.

Assumed
health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported
in the financial statements.
 
To
illustrate, a one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost trend
would have the following effects:

Asset
Management

Eleven
investment firms manage NS' defined benefit pension plan's assets under
investment guidelines approved by the Board of Directors.
 
Investments are restricted to domestic fixed
income securities, international fixed income securities, domestic and
international equity investments, and unleveraged exchange-traded options and
financial futures.
 
Limitations restrict
investment concentration and use of certain derivative investments.
 
The target asset allocation for equity is 75%
of the pension plan's assets.
 
Fixed
income investments must have an average rate of "AA" or better and all fixed
income securities must be rates "A" or better except bond index funds.
 
Equity investments must be in liquid
securities listed on national exchanges.
 

No investment is permitted in the securities of Norfolk Southern or its
subsidiaries (except through commingled pension trust funds).
 
Investment managers' returns are expected to
meet or exceed selected market indices by prescribed margins.

NS'
pension plan weighted-average asset allocations at December 31, 2009 and
2008, by asset category, were as follows:

Percentage
  of plan

assets at
  December 31,

Asset Category



Domestic equity securities

65%

58%

International equity
  securities

12%

11%

Debt securities

23%

31%

Total

100%

100%

The
postretirement benefit plan assets consist primarily of trust-owned variable
life insurance policies with an asset allocation at December 31, 2009, of 57%
in equity securities and 43% in debt securities compared with 53% in equity
securities and 47% in debt securities at December 31, 2008.
 
The target asset allocation for equity is
between 50% and 75% of the plan's assets.

The
plans' assumed future returns are based principally on the asset allocation and
on the historic returns for the plans' asset classes determined from both
actual plan returns and, over longer time periods, market returns for those
asset classes.
 
NS assumed a rate of
return on pension plan assets of 8.75% for 2009 and 9% for both 2008 and
2007.
 
For 2010, NS assumes an 8.75%
return on pension plan assets.
 
A one
percentage point change to the rate of return assumption would result in a $16 million
change to the net pension (benefit) cost and, as a result, an equal change in
"Compensation and benefits" expense.

Fair Value
of Plan Assets

Following is a description of the valuation
methodologies used for pension plan assets measured at fair value.

Interest
bearing cash:
 
Short-term bills or notes
are valued at an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for the security
at year end using observable market based inputs; money market funds are valued
at the closing price reported on the active market on which the funds are
traded.

United
States Government and agencies securities:
 

Valued at an estimated price at which a dealer would pay for a security
at year end using observable as well as unobservable market based inputs.
 
Inflation adjusted instruments utilize the
appropriate index factor.

Municipal
bonds:
 
Valued at an estimated price at
which a dealer would pay for a security at year end using observable market
based inputs.

Corporate
bonds and other fixed income instruments:
 

When available, valued at an estimated price at which a dealer would pay
for a similar security at year end using observable market inputs.
 
Otherwise, valued at an estimated price at
which a dealer would pay for a similar security at year end using unobservable
market inputs.

Common
stock:
 
Shares held by the plan at year
end are valued at the official closing price as defined by the exchange or at
the most recent trade price of a security at the close of the active market.

Commingled
funds:
 
Valued at the net asset value
(NAV) of shares held by the plan at year end, based on the quoted market prices
of the underlying assets of the funds.
 

The investments are valued using NAV as a practical expedient for fair
value.
 
The commingled funds hold equity
securities.

Common
collective trusts:
 
Valued at the NAV of
shares held by the plan at year end, based on the quoted market prices of the
underlying assets of the trusts.
 
The
investments are valued using NAV as a practical expedient for fair value.
 
The common collective trusts hold equity
securities, fixed income securities and cash and cash equivalents.

The
following table sets forth the pension plan assets at December 31, 2009, by
valuation technique level, within the fair value hierarchy (there were no level
3 valued assets).

Following
is a description of the valuation methodologies used for postretirement benefit
plan assets measured at fair value.

Trust-owned
life insurance:
 
valued at NS' share of
the net assets of trust-owned life insurance issued by a major insurance
company.
 
The underlying investments of
that trust consist of a U.S. stock account, and a U.S. bond account, valued
based upon the aggregate market values of the underlying investments.
 
The loan asset account is valued at cash
surrender value at the time of the loan, plus accrued interest.

At
December 31, 2009, the postretirement benefit plan assets consisted of
trust-owned life insurance with a fair value of $161 million as valued under
level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
 

There were no level 1 or level 3 related assets.

The
methods used to value pension and postretirement benefit plan assets may
produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable
value or reflective of future fair values.
 

Furthermore, while NS believes its valuation methods are appropriate and
consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies
or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments
could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

Contributions
and Estimated Future Benefit Payments

In
2010, NS expects to contribute approximately $11 million to its unfunded
pension plans for payments to pensioners and $54 million to its other
postretirement benefit plans for retiree health benefits.
 
NS does not expect to contribute to its
funded pension plan in 2010.

Benefit
payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected
to be paid as follows:

The
other postretirement benefits payments include an estimated average annual
reduction due to the Medicare Part D subsidy of about $7 million.

Other
Postretirement Coverage

Under
collective bargaining agreements, NS and certain subsidiaries participate in a
multi-employer benefit plan, which provides certain postretirement health care
and life insurance benefits to eligible union employees.
 
Premiums under this plan are expensed as
incurred and amounted to $33 million in both 2009 and 2008, and
$27 million in 2007.

Section
401(k) Plans

Norfolk
Southern and certain subsidiaries provide Section 401(k) savings plans for
employees.
 
Under the plans, NS matches a
portion of employee contributions, subject to applicable limitations.
 
NS' matching contributions, recorded as an
expense, under these plans were $16 million in 2009, $15 million in
2008, and $14 million in 2007.

Stock-Based Compensation

Under
the stockholder-approved Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), a committee of
nonemployee directors of the Board or the chief executive officer (if delegated
such authority by the committee) may grant stock options, stock appreciation
rights (SARs), restricted stock units, restricted shares, performance shares,
and performance share units (PSUs), up to a maximum of 88,025,000 shares of
Norfolk Southern Common Stock (Common Stock).
 

Of these shares, 5,000,000 were approved by the Board for issuance to
non-officer participants; as a broad-based issuance, stockholder approval was
not required.
 
In May 2005, the
stockholders approved an amended LTIP which provided that 8,500,000 shares of
stock previously approved for issuance under LTIP could be granted as
restricted stock units, restricted shares, or performance shares.
 
Under the Board-approved Thoroughbred Stock
Option Plan (TSOP), the committee may grant stock options up to a maximum of
6,000,000 shares of Common Stock; as a broad-based stock option plan,
stockholder approval of TSOP was not required.
 

NS uses newly issued shares to satisfy any exercises and awards under
LTIP and TSOP.

The
LTIP also permits the payment - on a current or a deferred basis and in cash or
in stock - of dividend equivalents on shares of Common Stock covered by
options, PSUs, or restricted stock units in an amount commensurate with regular
quarterly dividends paid on Common Stock.
 

Tax absorption payments also are authorized for any awards under LTIP in
amounts estimated to equal the federal and state income taxes applicable to shares
of Common Stock issued subject to a share retention agreement.

During
the first quarter of 2009, a committee of nonemployee directors of NS' Board
granted stock options, restricted stock units and PSUs pursuant to LTIP and
granted stock options pursuant to TSOP.
 

Receipt of an award under LTIP was made contingent upon the awardee's
execution of a non-compete agreement, and all awards under LTIP were made
subject to forfeiture in the event the awardee "engages in competing
employment" for a period of time following retirement.

Accounting
Method

NS
accounts for its grants of PSUs, restricted stock units, restricted shares,
dividend equivalents, tax absorption payments, and SARs in accordance with ASC
718 "Share-Based Payment."
 
Accordingly,
all awards result in charges to net income while dividend equivalents, which
are all related to equity classified awards, are charged to retained
income.
 
Related compensation costs were
$60 million in 2009, $89 million in 2008, and $96 million in
2007.
 
The total tax effects recognized
in income in relation to stock-based compensation were benefits of $18 million
in 2009, $30 million in 2008, and $32 million in 2007.

"Common
stock issued - net" in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 includes tax benefits generated
from tax deductions in excess of compensation costs recognized (excess tax
benefits) for share-based awards of $15 million, $76 million, and
$57 million, respectively.

Stock
Options

Options
may be granted for a term not to exceed 10 years and are subject to a vesting
period of at least one year.
 
Option
exercise prices are at not less than the fair market value of Common Stock on
the effective date of the grant.
 
In the
first quarter of 2009, 1,209,700 options were granted under the LTIP and 251,200 options
were granted under the TSOP.
 
In each
case, the grant price was $38.71, which was the higher of (i) the fair market
value of Common Stock on the date of grant or (ii) the closing price of Common Stock
on the date of the grant.
 
The options
granted under the LTIP and TSOP in 2009 may not be exercised prior to the
fourth and third anniversaries of the date of grant, respectively.
 
Holders of the options granted under the LTIP
who remain actively employed receive cash dividend equivalent payments for four
years in an amount equal to the regular quarterly dividends paid on Common
Stock.

In
the first quarter of 2008, 1,162,600 options were granted under the LTIP and
250,000 options were granted under the TSOP, each with a grant price of $50.74,
but may not be exercised prior to the third anniversary of the date of
grant.
 
In the first quarter of 2007,
1,203,300 options were granted under the LTIP and 251,000 options were granted
under the TSOP, each with a grant price of $49.555, but may not be exercised
prior to the third anniversary of the date of grant.
 
For both 2008 and 2007, the grant price was
the higher of (i) the fair market value of Common Stock on the date of grant or
(ii) the closing price of Common Stock on the date of the grant, and the
options have a term of ten years.

The
fair value of each option awarded in 2009, 2008, and 2007 was measured on the
date of grant using a lattice-based option valuation model.
 
Expected volatilities are based on implied
volatilities from traded options on Common Stock and historical volatility of
Common Stock.
 
NS uses historical data to
estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model.
 
The average expected option life is derived
from the output of the valuation model and represents the period of time that
options granted are expected to be outstanding.
 

The average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield
curve in effect at the time of grant.
 

For options granted that include dividend equivalent payments, a
dividend yield of zero was used.
 
For the
2009 and 2008 TSOP grants a dividend yield of 2.4% and 2.29%, respectively, was
used because no dividend equivalent payments are made on these options.
 
The assumptions for the 2009, 2008, and 2007
LTIP and TSOP grants are shown in the following table:

Restricted
Stock Units and Restricted Shares

Restricted
stock unit grants were 320,550 in 2009, with a grant-date fair value of $38.72
and a five-year restriction period.
 
In
2008, restricted stock unit grants were 299,950 with a grant-date fair value of
$50.47 and a five-year restriction period.
 

In 2007, restricted stock unit grants were 321,450 with a grant-date
fair value of $50.01 and a five-year restriction period.
 
Restricted stock units granted in 2009, 2008,
and 2007 will be settled through issuance of shares of Common Stock.
 
The restricted stock unit grants include cash
dividend equivalent payments during the restriction period commensurate with

Stock Repurchase Program

In
March 2007, NS' Board of Directors amended NS' share repurchase program,
increasing the authorized amount of share repurchases from 50 million to 75
million shares and shortening the term of the program from 2015 to 2010.
 
The timing and volume of purchases is guided
by management's assessment of market conditions and other pertinent facts.
 
Any near-term purchases under the program are
expected to be made with internally generated cash or proceeds from borrowings.
 
There were no shares repurchased under this
program in 2009.
 
NS repurchased and
retired 19.4 million shares and 23.6 million shares of its common
stock under this program in 2008 and 2007, respectively, at a cost of
$1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.
 
Since inception of this program in 2006, NS
has repurchased and retired 64.7 million shares of Common Stock at a total
cost of $3.3 billion.

In
the first quarter of 2009, NS adopted the provisions of the FASB FSP EITF No.
03-6-1, "Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions
are Participating Securities" (ASC 260-10), which requires the treatment of
unvested stock options receiving dividend equivalents as participating
securities in computing earnings per share under the two-class method.
 
NS has retrospectively applied the provisions
of this FSP and accordingly, income available to common stockholders for 2009,
reflects an $8 million reduction, and 2008 and 2007 both reflect a $9
million reduction from net income for the effect of dividend equivalent
payments made to holders of stock options, which had the effect of reducing the
previously reported basic earnings per share for 2008, from $4.60 to $4.58 and
for 2007, from $3.74 to $3.73.

As required under the
provisions of FSP EITF No. 03-6-1 (ASC 260-10), diluted earnings per share for
2009 was calculated under the more dilutive two-class method (as compared to
the treasury stock method) and accordingly, income available to common
stockholders for 2009 reflects an $8 million reduction from net income for
dividend equivalent payments.
 
The diluted
calculations exclude options having exercise prices exceeding the average
market price of Common Stock as follows:
 

in 2009, 1.4 million, and none in 2008 and 2007.

Derivative Financial Instruments

All
derivatives are recognized in the financial statements as either assets or
liabilities and are measured at fair value.
 

Changes in fair value are recorded as adjustments to the assets or
liabilities being hedged in "Other comprehensive loss," or in current earnings,
depending on whether the derivative is designated and qualifies for hedge
accounting, the type of hedge transaction represented, and the effectiveness of
the hedge.

NS
has used derivative financial instruments to manage its overall exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates.
 
NS does
not engage in the trading of derivatives.
 

Management has determined that its derivative financial instruments
qualify as fair-value hedges, having values that highly correlate with the
underlying hedged exposures, and has designated such instruments as hedging
transactions.
 
Credit risk related to the
derivative financial instruments is considered to be minimal and is managed by
requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements.

Interest
Rate Hedging

NS
manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both
fixed- and floating-rate debt instruments, and by entering into interest rate
hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt
portfolio.
 
NS had $4 million, or less
than 1%, and $17 million, or less than 1%, of its fixed-rate debt
portfolio hedged as of December 31, 2009, and 2008, respectively, using
interest rate swaps that qualify for and are designated as fair-value hedge
transactions.
 
NS' interest rate hedging
activity resulted in decreases in interest expense of approximately $1 million
for 2009, 2008 and 2007.
 
These swaps
have been effective in hedging the changes in fair value of the related debt
arising from changes in interest rates and there has been no impact on earnings
resulting from ineffectiveness associated with these derivative transactions.

Fair Values

Fair
values of interest rate swaps at December 31, 2009, and 2008, were determined
based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the
appropriate implied spot rate from the spot rate yield curve.
 
Fair value adjustments are noncash
transactions and, accordingly, are excluded from the Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows.
 
The gross and net asset
position of NS' outstanding derivative financial instruments was less than $1 million
at December 31, 2009, and approximately $1 million at
December 31, 2008.

Commitments and Contingencies

Lawsuits

Norfolk
Southern and/or certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and
other claims relating principally to railroad operations.
 
When management concludes that it is probable
that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be
reasonably estimated, it is accrued through a charge to earnings.
 
While the ultimate amount of liability
incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future
developments, in management's opinion, the recorded liability is adequate to
cover the future payment of such liability and claims.
 
However, the final outcome of any of these
lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable or
unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be
significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter.
 
Any adjustments to the recorded liability
will be reflected in earnings in the periods in which such adjustments are
known.

Casualty
Claims

Casualty
claims include employee personal injury and occupational claims as well as
third-party claims, all exclusive of legal costs.
 
To aid in valuing its personal injury
liability and determining the amount to accrue with respect to such claim
during the year, NS' management utilizes studies prepared by an independent
consulting actuarial firm.
 
Job-related accidental
injury and occupational claims are subject to the Federal Employers' Liability
Act (FELA), which is applicable only to railroads.
 
FELA's fault-based system produces results
that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault workers'
compensation system.
 
The variability
inherent in this system could result in actual costs being different from the
liability recorded.
 
While the ultimate
amount of claims incurred is dependent on future developments, in management's
opinion, the recorded liability is adequate to cover the future payments of
claims and is supported by the most recent actuarial study.
 
In all cases, NS records a liability when the
expected loss for the claim is both probable and estimable.

In
April 2008, NS settled the lawsuit brought by Avondale Mills for claims
associated with the January 6, 2005, derailment in Graniteville, SC.
 
A portion of the settlement was not
reimbursed by insurance and was included in first quarter 2008 expenses.
 
The total liability related to the derailment
represents NS' best estimate based on current facts and circumstances.
 
The estimate includes amounts related to property
damage, personal injury and response costs.
 

NS' commercial insurance policies are expected to cover substantially
all expenses related to this derailment above the unreimbursed portion and NS'
self-insured retention, including NS' response costs and legal fees.
 
The Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect
long-term receivables for estimated recoveries from NS' insurance carriers.
 
NS is engaged in arbitration with two of its
insurance carriers that failed to respond to insurance claims submitted by
NS.
 
NS believes these expenses are
covered by the insurance policies and that recoveries of the contested amounts are
probable.
 
Accordingly, NS has recorded
the full recovery attributable to each carrier ($100 million and $43 million).

Employee personal injury claims -

The largest component of casualties and other claims
expense is employee personal injury costs.
 

The independent actuarial firm engaged by NS provides quarterly studies
to aid in valuing its employee personal injury liability and estimating its
employee personal injury expense.
 
The
actuarial firm studies NS' historical patterns of reserving for claims and
subsequent settlements, taking into account relevant outside influences.
 
The actuary uses the results of these
analyses to estimate the ultimate amount of the liability, which includes
amounts for incurred but unasserted claims.
 

NS adjusts its liability quarterly based upon management's assessment and
the results of the study.
 
Recent
actuarial studies have reflected favorable claims development and, accordingly,
those changes in estimates have reduced the annual cost related to personal
injuries to $51 million in 2009 from $78 million in 2008.
 
The estimate of loss liabilities is subject
to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events such as
jury decisions, court interpretations, or legislative changes and as such the
actual loss may vary from the estimated liability recorded.

Occupational claims -

Occupational claims (including asbestosis and other
respiratory diseases, as well as conditions allegedly related to repetitive
motion) are often not caused by a specific accident or event but rather
allegedly result from a claimed exposure over time.
 
Many such claims are being asserted by former
or retired employees, some of whom have not been employed in the rail industry
for decades.
 
The independent actuarial
firm provides an estimate of the occupational claims liability based upon NS'
history of claim filings, severity, payments, and other pertinent facts.
 
The liability is dependent upon management's
judgments made as to the specific case reserves as well as judgments of the
consulting independent actuarial firm in the periodic studies.
 
The actuarial firm's estimate of ultimate
loss includes a provision for those claims that have been incurred but not
reported.
 
This provision is derived by
analyzing industry data and projecting NS' experience into the future as far as
can be reasonably determined.
 
NS adjusts
its liability quarterly based upon management's assessment and the results of
the study.
 
However, it is possible that
the recorded liability may not be adequate to cover the future payment of
claims.
 
Adjustments to the recorded
liability are reflected in operating expenses in the periods in which such
adjustments become known.

Third-party claims -

NS records a liability for third-party claims
including those for highway crossing accidents, trespasser and other injuries,
automobile liability, property damage, and lading damage.
 
The independent actuarial firm assists with
the calculation of potential liability for third-party claims, except lading
damage, based upon NS' experience including number and timing of incidents,
amount of payments, settlement rates, number of open claims, and legal
defenses.
 
The actuarial estimate
includes a provision for claims that have been incurred but have not yet been
reported.
 
Each quarter NS adjusts its
liability based upon management's assessment and the results of the study.
 
Given the inherent uncertainty in regard to
the ultimate outcome of third-party claims, it is possible that the actual loss
may differ from the estimated liability recorded.

Environmental
Matters

NS
is subject to various jurisdictions' environmental laws and regulations.
 
It is NS' policy to record a liability where
such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably.
 
Claims, if any, against third parties, for
recovery of cleanup costs incurred by NS are reflected as receivables (when
collection is probable) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are not netted
against the associated NS liability.

Environmental
engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and
in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates.
 
NS also has an Environmental Policy Council,
composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy.

NS'
Consolidated Balance Sheets include liabilities for environmental exposures in
the amount of $32 million at December 31, 2009, and $42 million
at December 31, 2008 (of which $12 million is classified as a current
liability at December 31, 2009 and 2008).
 

At December 31, 2009, the liability represents NS' estimate of the
probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 144
known locations compared with 148 locations at December 31, 2008.
 
As of December 31, 2009, 9 sites
accounted for $15 million of the liability, and no individual site was
considered to be material.
 
NS
anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years;
however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period.

At
30 locations, one or more Norfolk Southern subsidiaries, usually in conjunction
with a number of other parties, have been identified as potentially responsible
parties by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state
authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes, which often impose joint
and several liability for cleanup costs.

With
respect to known environmental sites (whether identified by NS or by the EPA or
comparable state authorities), estimates of NS' ultimate potential financial
exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are
necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently
available cleanup techniques, the likely development of new cleanup
technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full
extent of contamination and each potential participant's share of any estimated
loss (and that participant's ability to bear it), and evolving statutory and
regulatory standards governing liability.

The
risk of incurring environmental liability - for acts and omissions, past,
present, and future - is inherent in the railroad business.
 
Some of the commodities in NS' traffic mix,
particularly those classified as hazardous materials, pose special risks that
NS and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize.
 
In addition, several NS subsidiaries own, or
have owned, land used as operating property, or which is leased and operated by
others, or held for sale.
 
Because
environmental problems may exist on these properties that are latent or undisclosed,
there can be no assurance that NS will not incur environmental liabilities or
costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of which
cannot be estimated reliably at this time.
 

Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and potentially other
unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to
time.
 
The resulting liabilities could
have a significant effect on financial position, results of operations, or liquidity
in a particular year or quarter.

On
April 24, 2008, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) brought an action
against NS for alleged violations of federal environmental laws resulting from
the discharge of chlorine and oil that occurred as a result of the
January 6, 2005, derailment in Graniteville, SC, including claims for
civil penalties as well as injunctive relief.
 

Although NS' June 24, 2008 motion to dismiss for failure to allege
sufficient facts was granted, DOJ was given leave to, and did, amend its
complaint.
 
The litigation has been
stayed by the district court as the parties work to conclude an agreed upon
consent decree.
 
NS does not believe that
the resolution of these claims will have a material adverse effect on its
financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

Based
on its assessment of the facts and circumstances now known, management believes
that it has recorded the probable costs for dealing with those environmental
matters of which NS is aware.
 
Further,
management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either
individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS'
financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

Insurance

Norfolk
Southern obtains on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries insurance for potential
losses for third-party liability and first-party property damages.
 
NS is currently self-insured up to
$25 million and above $1 billion per occurrence for bodily injury and
property damage to third parties and up to $25 million and above
$175 million per occurrence for property owned by NS or in NS' care,
custody or control.

Purchase
Commitments

At
December 31, 2009, NS had outstanding purchase commitments totaling
approximately $228 million for long-term service contracts through 2019 as
well as track material, RoadRailerÂ® trailers, and freight cars, in connection
with its capital programs through 2011.

Change-In-Control
Arrangements

Norfolk
Southern has compensation agreements with officers and certain key employees
that become operative only upon a change in control of Norfolk Southern, as
defined in those agreements.
 
The
agreements provide generally for payments based on compensation at the time of
a covered individual's involuntary or other specified termination and for
certain other benefits.

Guarantees

In
a number of instances, Norfolk Southern and its subsidiaries have agreed to
indemnify lenders for additional costs they may bear as a result of certain
changes in laws or regulations applicable to their loans.
 
Such changes may include impositions or
modifications with respect to taxes, duties, reserves, liquidity, capital
adequacy, special deposits, and similar requirements relating to extensions of
credit by, deposits with, or the assets of liabilities of such lenders.
 
The nature and timing of changes in laws or
regulations applicable to NS' financings are inherently unpredictable, and
therefore NS' exposure in connection with the foregoing indemnifications cannot
be quantified.
 
No liability has been
recorded related to these indemnifications.
 

In the case of one type of equipment financing, NSR's Japanese leverage
leases, NSR may terminate the leases and ancillary agreements if such a
change-in-law indemnity is triggered.
 

Such a termination would require NSR to make early termination payments
that would not be expected to have a material effect on NS' financial position,
results of operations, or liquidity.

NS
has indemnified parties in a number of transactions for U.S. income tax
withholding imposed as a result of changes in U.S. tax law.
 
In all cases, NS has the right to unwind the
related transaction if the withholding cannot be avoided in the future.
 
Because these indemnities would be triggered
and are dependent upon a change in the tax law, the maximum exposure is not
quantifiable.
 
Management does not
believe that it is likely that it will be required to make any payments under
these indemnities.

As
of December 31, 2009, certain Norfolk Southern subsidiaries are
contingently liable as guarantors with respect to $7 million of indebtedness,
due in 2019, of an entity in which they have an ownership interest, the
Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis.
 

Four other railroads are also jointly and severally liable as guarantors
for this indebtedness.
 
No liability has
been recorded related to this guaranty.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Norfolk
Southern's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the
assistance of management, evaluated the effectiveness of NS' disclosure
controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
Act")) as of December 31, 2009.
 

Based on such evaluation, such officers have concluded that, as of
December 31, 2009, NS' disclosure controls and procedures were effective
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in NS' reports under the

Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting

The
management of Norfolk Southern is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting.
 
Norfolk Southern's internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to its
ability to record, process, summarize, and report reliable financial data.
 
Management recognizes that there are inherent
limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial
reporting, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or
overriding of internal control.
 

Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting
can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation.
 
Further, because of changes
in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
may vary over time.

In
order to ensure that Norfolk Southern's internal control over financial
reporting is effective, management regularly assesses such controls and did so
most recently for its financial reporting as of December 31, 2009.
 
This assessment was based on criteria for
effective internal control over financial reporting set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework.

Based on our assessment, management has
concluded that Norfolk Southern maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2009.

The
Board of Directors, acting through its Audit Committee, is responsible for the
oversight of Norfolk Southern's accounting policies, financial reporting, and
internal control.
 
The Audit Committee of
the Board of Directors is comprised entirely of outside directors who are
independent of management.
 
The
independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have
full and unlimited access to the Audit Committee, with or without management,
to discuss the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, and any
other matters which they believe should be brought to the attention of the
Audit Committee.

Norfolk
Southern's management has issued a report of its assessment of internal control
over financial reporting, and Norfolk Southern's independent registered public
accounting firm has issued an attestation report on Norfolk Southern's internal
controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009.
 
These reports appear in Part II, Item 8 of
this report on Form 10-K.

During the fourth quarter of
2009, management has not identified any changes in internal controls over
financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially effect, NS' internal control over financial reporting.

Norfolk Southern Corporation
Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP")

Established on June 28, 1983,
and approved by stockholders at their Annual Meeting held on May 10, 1984,
LTIP was adopted to promote the success of Norfolk Southern by providing an
opportunity for non-employee directors, officers, and other key employees to
acquire a proprietary interest in the Corporation.
 
On January 23, 2001, the Board of
Directors further amended LTIP and approved the issuance of an additional
5,000,000 shares of authorized but unissued Common Stock under LTIP to
participants who are not officers of Norfolk Southern.
 
The issuance of these shares was
broadly-based, and stockholder approval of these shares was not required.
 
Accordingly, this portion of LTIP is included
in the number of securities available for future issuance for plans not approved
by stockholders.
 
Also on
January 23, 2001, the Board amended LTIP, which amendment was approved by
shareholders on May 10, 2001, that included the reservation for issuance
of an additional 30,000,000 shares of authorized but unissued Norfolk Southern
Common Stock.

Pursuant
to another amendment approved by stockholders on May 12, 2005, not more
than 8,500,000 of the shares remaining available for issuance under LTIP may be
awarded as restricted shares, performance shares or restricted stock unit shares.
 
Cash payments of restricted stock units,
stock appreciation rights, and performance share units will not be applied
against the maximum number of shares issuable under LTIP.
 
Any shares of Common Stock subject to
options, performance share units, restricted shares, or restricted stock units
which are not issued as Common Stock will again be available for award under
LTIP after the expiration or forfeiture of an award.

Non-employee
directors, officers, and other key employees residing in the United States or
Canada are eligible for selection to receive LTIP awards.
 
Under LTIP, the Compensation Committee
(Committee) may grant incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options,
stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and performance
share units.
 
In addition, dividend
equivalents may be awarded for options, restricted stock units, and performance
share units.
 
The Committee may make
awards under LTIP subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances and may
establish such other terms and conditions for the awards as provided in LTIP.

For options, the option price
per share will not be less than 100% of the fair market value of Norfolk
Southern's Common Stock on the effective date the option is granted.
 
All options are subject to a vesting period
of at least one year, and the term of the option will not exceed ten
years.
 
LTIP specifically prohibits
option repricing without stockholder approval, except for capital adjustments.

Performance share units
entitle a recipient to receive performance-based compensation at the end of a
three-year performance cycle based on Norfolk Southern's performance during
that three-year period.
 
For the 2009
performance share unit awards, corporate performance will be measured using
three equally weighted standards established by the Committee:
 
(1) three-year average return on average
capital invested, (2) three-year average operating ratio, and (3) three-year
total return to stockholders as compared with the average total return on all
stocks comprising the S&P 500 composite stock price index.
 
Performance share units may be payable in
either shares of Norfolk Southern Common Stock or cash.

Restricted stock units are
payable in cash or in shares of Norfolk Southern Common Stock at the end of a restriction
period of not less than 36 months and not more than 60 months.
 
During the restriction period, the holder of
the restricted stock units has no beneficial ownership interest in the Norfolk
Southern Common Stock represented by the restricted stock units and has no
right to vote the shares represented by the units or to receive dividends
(except for dividend equivalent rights that may be awarded with respect to the
restricted stock units).
 
The Committee
at its discretion may waive the restriction period.

Norfolk
Southern Corporation Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan

The Board adopted the Norfolk
Southern Corporation Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan ("TSOP") on
January 26, 1999, to promote the success of Norfolk Southern by providing
an opportunity for nonagreement employees to acquire a proprietary interest in
Norfolk Southern and thereby to provide an additional incentive to nonagreement
employees to devote their maximum efforts and skills to the advancement,
betterment, and prosperity of Norfolk Southern and its stockholders.
 
Under the TSOP there were 6,000,000 shares of
authorized but unissued Common Stock reserved for issuance.
 
TSOP has not been and is not required to have
been approved by stockholders.

Active full-time nonagreement
employees residing in the United States or Canada are eligible for selection to
receive TSOP awards.
 
Under TSOP, the
Committee may grant nonqualified stock options subject to such terms and
conditions as provided in TSOP.

The option price will not be
less than 100% of the fair market value of Norfolk Southern's Common Stock on
the effective date the options are granted.
 

All options are subject to a vesting period of at least one year, and
the term of the option will not exceed ten years.
 
Options awarded in 2009 are subject to a
three-year vesting period.
 
TSOP
specifically prohibits repricing without stockholder approval, except for
capital adjustments.

Norfolk Southern Corporation
Directors' Restricted Stock Plan

The Norfolk Southern
Corporation Directors' Restricted Stock Plan ("Plan") was adopted on
January 1, 1994, and is designed to increase ownership of Norfolk Southern
Common Stock by its non-employee directors so as to further align their
ownership interest in Norfolk Southern with that of stockholders.
 
The Plan has not been and is not required to
have been approved by stockholders.
 

Currently, a maximum of 66,000 shares of Norfolk Southern Common Stock
may be granted under the Plan.
 
To make
grants to eligible directors, Norfolk Southern purchases, through one or more
subsidiary companies, the number of shares required in open-market transactions
at prevailing market prices, or makes such grants from Norfolk Southern Common
Stock already owned by one or more of Norfolk Southern's subsidiary companies.

Only non-employee directors
who are not and never have been employees of Norfolk Southern are eligible to
participate in the Plan.
 
Upon becoming a
director, each eligible director receives a one-time grant of 3,000 restricted
shares of Norfolk Southern Common Stock.
 

No individual member of the Board exercises discretion concerning the
eligibility of any director or the number of shares granted.

The restriction period
applicable to restricted shares granted under the Plan begins on the date of
the grant and ends on the earlier of the recipient's death or six months after
the recipient ceases to be a director by reason of disability or
retirement.
 
During the restriction
period shares may not be sold, pledged, or otherwise encumbered.
 
Directors will forfeit the restricted shares
if they cease to serve as a director of Norfolk Southern for reasons other than
their disability, retirement, or death.
