GENERAL -

Norfolk
Southern Corporation (Norfolk Southern) was incorporated on July 23, 1980,
under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia.
 
On June l, 1982, Norfolk Southern acquired control of
two major operating railroads, Norfolk and Western Railway Company (NW) and
Southern Railway Company (Southern) in accordance with an Agreement of Merger
and Reorganization dated as of July 31, 1980, and with the approval of the
transaction by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) (now the Surface
Transportation Board [STB]).

Effective Dec. 31, 1990, Norfolk Southern
transferred all the common stock of NW to Southern, and Southern's name was
changed to Norfolk Southern Railway Company (Norfolk Southern Railway or
NSR).
 
Effective Sept. 1, 1998, NW
was merged with and into Norfolk Southern Railway.
 
As of Dec. 31, 2003, all the common stock of Norfolk
Southern Railway was owned directly by Norfolk Southern.

Through a jointly owned entity, Norfolk
Southern and CSX Corporation (CSX) own the stock of Conrail Inc., which
owns the major freight railroad in the Northeast.
 
Norfolk Southern has a 58% economic and 50% voting interest
in the jointly owned entity.
 
See
also the discussion concerning operation of a portion of Conrail's rail assets,
below.

On March 28, 1998, Norfolk Southern
closed the sale of its motor carrier company, North American Van Lines,
Inc.
 
(NAVL) (see “Discontinued
Operations” and Note 17).
 

NAVL's results are presented as “Discontinued operations” in the
accompanying financial information.

Norfolk Southern makes available free of
charge through its website, www.nscorp.com, its annual report on Form 10‑K,
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments
to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is
electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC).
 
Additionally,
Norfolk Southern’s corporate governance guidelines, board committee charters,
code of ethics and code of ethical conduct for senior financial officers are
available on the company’s website and in print to any shareholder who requests
them.

Unless indicated otherwise, Norfolk Southern
and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as NS.

OPERATION
OF A PORTION OF THE CONRAIL RAIL ASSETS -

On June 1, 1999,
Norfolk Southern and CSX, through their respective railroad subsidiaries, began
operating separate portions of Conrail's rail routes and assets.
 
Substantially all such assets are owned
by two wholly owned subsidiaries of Consolidated Rail Corporation (CRC); one of
those subsidiaries, Pennsylvania Lines LLC (PRR), has entered into various
operating and leasing arrangements, more particularly described in Note 2,
with Norfolk Southern Railway.
 
The
other subsidiary, New York Central Lines LLC (NYC) has entered into similar
arrangements with CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT).
 
Certain rail assets (Shared Assets Areas) still are owned by
CRC, which operates them for joint and exclusive use by Norfolk Southern
Railway and CSXT.

Operation of the PRR routes and assets
increased the size of the system over which Norfolk Southern Railway provides
service by nearly 50% and afforded access to the New York metropolitan area, to
much of the Northeast and to most of the major East Coast ports north of
Norfolk, Virginia.
 
Also, leasing

K3

arrangements with PRR augmented Norfolk
Southern Railway's locomotive, freight car and intermodal fleet.

Conrail
Corporate Reorganization

NS, CSX and Conrail are jointly seeking to
reorganize Conrail and establish direct ownership and control by NSR and CSXT
of PRR and NYC, respectively.
 
The
proposed reorganization would replace the operating agreements described above
and allow NSR and CSXT to directly own and operate PRR and NYC,
respectively.
 
Consummation of the
reorganization requires a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the approval
of the STB and filings with the
 

SEC.
 
In addition, NS, CSX
and Conrail must obtain the consent of Conrail’s debt holders to carry out the
transaction and will obtain a valuation of PRR and of NYC.

In 2003, the IRS issued a ruling that the
reorganization would qualify as a tax-free distribution.
 
Also in 2003, the STB granted its
authorization to carry out the reorganization, subject to a condition requiring
NS, CSX and Conrail to either:
 
(i)
obtain the voluntary consent of the Conrail debt holders; or (ii) propose
further proceedings to determine whether the terms offered to the Conrail debt
holders are fair, just and reasonable.
 

In 2004, NS, CSX and Conrail intend to file registration statements on
Form S-4 with the SEC to allow a proposed exchange offer relating to Conrail’s
unsecured debt (see below).
 
In
order to implement the reorganization approved by the IRS, the companies have
engaged an investment banking firm to provide a valuation.
 
The results of the valuation could
impact NS’ carrying amount of its investment in Conrail and the recording of
the corporate reorganization.

As a part of the proposed reorganization,
Conrail would undertake a restructuring of its existing unsecured and secured
public indebtedness.
 
There are
currently two series of unsecured public debentures with an outstanding
principal amount of $800 million and 13 series of secured debt with an
outstanding principal amount of approximately $321 million.
 
It is currently contemplated that
guaranteed debt securities of two newly formed corporate subsidiaries of NSR and
CSXT would be offered in a 58%/42% ratio in exchange for Conrail’s unsecured
debentures.
 
Upon completion of the
proposed transaction, the new debt securities would become direct unsecured
obligations of NSR and CSXT, respectively, and would rank equally with all
existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations, if any, of NSR and
CSXT.
 
These new debt securities
will have maturity dates, interest rates and principal and interest payment
dates identical to those of the respective series of Conrail’s unsecured
debentures.
 
In addition, these new
debt securities will have covenants substantially similar to those of the
publicly traded debt securities of NS and CSX, respectively.

Conrail’s secured debt and lease obligations
will remain obligations of Conrail and are expected to be supported by new
leases and subleases which, upon completion of the proposed transaction, would
be the direct lease and sublease obligations of NSR or CSXT.

NS, CSX and Conrail are diligently working to
complete all steps necessary to consummate the Conrail corporate reorganization
in 2004.
 
Upon consummation of the
proposed transaction, NS’ investment in Conrail will no longer include amounts
related to PRR and NYC.
 
Instead,
the assets and liabilities of PRR will be reflected in their respective line
items in NS’ Consolidated Balance Sheet, and any amounts owed to PRR would be
extinguished.

RAILROAD
OPERATIONS -

As of Dec. 31, 2003, NS' railroads operated
approximately 21,500 miles of road in the states of Alabama, Delaware,
Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland,
Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, the District
of Columbia and in the Province of Ontario, Canada.
 
The miles operated were as follows:

K4

In addition to the lines leased from Conrail
previously discussed, NS' railroads have major leased lines between Cincinnati,
Ohio, and Chattanooga, Tennessee, and operate over trackage owned by North
Carolina Railway Company (NCRR).
 

The Cincinnati-Chattanooga lease, covering about 335 miles of road,
expires in 2026, and is subject to an option to extend the lease for an
additional 25 years, at terms to be agreed upon.
 
The trackage rights over NCRR cover approximately 315 miles
of road under an agreement through 2014 with the right to renew for two
additional 15-year periods.

NS' railroads carry raw materials,
intermediate products and finished goods primarily in the Southeast, East and
Midwest, and via interchange with other rail carriers, to and from the rest of
the United States and parts of Canada.
 

They also transport overseas freight through several Atlantic and Gulf
Coast ports.
 
Atlantic ports served
by NS include: Norfolk, Virginia; Morehead City, North Carolina; Charleston,
South Carolina; Savannah and Brunswick, Georgia; Jacksonville, Florida;
Baltimore, Maryland; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania/Camden, New Jersey; Wilmington,
Delaware; and the Ports of New York/New Jersey.
 
Gulf Coast ports served include Mobile, Alabama and New Orleans,
Louisiana.

The lines of NS' railroads reach most of the
larger industrial and trading centers of the Southeast, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic
region and Midwest.
 
Chicago,
Norfolk, Detroit, Atlanta, Metropolitan New York City, Jacksonville, Kansas
City (Missouri), Baltimore, Buffalo, Charleston, Cleveland, Columbus,
Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Toledo, Greensboro, Charlotte and Savannah are among
the leading centers originating and terminating freight traffic on the
system.
 
In addition, haulage
arrangements with connecting carriers allow NS' railroads to provide
single-line service to and from additional markets, including haulage provided
by Florida East Coast Railway Company to serve southern and eastern Florida,
including the port cities of Miami, West Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale; and
haulage provided by The Kansas City Southern Railway Company to provide
transcontinental intermodal service via a connection with the Burlington
Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company.
 

Service is provided to New England, including the Port of Boston, via
haulage, trackage rights and interline arrangements with Canadian Pacific
Railway Company and Guilford Transportation Industries.
 
The system's lines also reach many
individual industries, electric generating facilities, mines (in western
Virginia, eastern Kentucky, southern and northern West Virginia and western
Pennsylvania), distribution centers, transload facilities and other businesses
located in smaller communities in its service area.
 
The traffic corridors carrying the heaviest volumes of
freight include those from the New York City area to Chicago (via Allentown and
Pittsburgh); Chicago to Jacksonville (via Cincinnati, Chattanooga and Atlanta);
Appalachian coal fields of Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky to Norfolk,
Virginia and Sandusky, Ohio; Cleveland to Kansas City; and Knoxville to
Chattanooga.
 
Chicago, Memphis,
Sidney/Salem, New Orleans, Kansas City, Buffalo, St. Louis and Meridian are
major gateways for interterritorial system traffic.

Triple
Crown Operations

- Until April 1993, NS' intermodal subsidiary,
Triple Crown Services, Inc.
 
(TCS),
offered intermodal service using RoadRailer® equipment and domestic
containers.
 
RoadRailer® units are
enclosed vans that can be pulled over highways in tractor-trailer configuration
and over the rails by locomotives.
 

On April 1, 1993, the business, name and operations of TCS were
transferred to Triple Crown Services Company (TCSC), a partnership in which
subsidiaries of NS and Conrail are equal partners.
 
From April 1, 1993, to June 1, 1999, the revenues of TCSC
were not consolidated with the results of NS; however, effective June 1,
1999, NS gained control of TCSC and, therefore, now includes TCSC's results in
its consolidated financial statements.
 

TCSC offers door-to-door intermodal service using RoadRailer® equipment
in major traffic corridors, including those between the Midwest and the
Northeast, the Midwest and the Southeast and the Midwest and Texas/Mexico.

The following table sets forth certain
statistics relating to NS railroads' operations for the past 5 years, including
operations in the Northern Region that commenced June 1, 1999:


Includes $107
million of costs for a voluntary separation program, which added 1.6 percentage
points to the ratio.


Includes $165
million of costs for early retirement and separation programs, which added 2.7
percentage points to the ratio.

RAILWAY
OPERATING REVENUES -

NS' total railway operating revenues
were $6.5 billion in 2003.
 

Revenue, shipments and revenue yield by principal railway operating
revenue sources for the past five years are set forth in the following table

COAL
TRAFFIC -

Coal, coke and iron ore -- most of which is
bituminous coal -- is NS' railroads' largest commodity group as measured
by revenues.
 
The railroads handled
a total of 172 million tons in 2003, most of which originated on NS' lines
in West Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Kentucky.
 
Revenues from coal, coke and iron ore
accounted for about 23% of NS' total railway operating revenues in 2003.

Coal, coke and iron ore tonnage by market for
the past five years are set forth in the following table.

Total coal handled through all system ports
in 2003 was 35 million tons.
 

Of this total, 11 million tons (including coastwise traffic) moved
through Norfolk, Virginia, 2 million tons moved through the Baltimore Terminal,
13 million tons moved to various docks on the Ohio River, and 9 million
tons moved to various Lake Erie ports.
 

Other than coal for export, virtually all coal handled by NS' railroads
was terminated in states east of the Mississippi River.

See the discussion of coal traffic, by type
of coal, in Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

GENERAL
MERCHANDISE TRAFFIC -

General merchandise
traffic is composed of five major commodity groupings:  automotive;
chemicals; metals and construction; agriculture, consumer products and
government; and paper, clay and forest products.
 
The automotive group includes finished vehicles for BMW,
DaimlerChrysler, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Honda, Isuzu, Jaguar, Land
Rover, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Saab, Subaru, Suzuki, Toyota
and Volkswagen, and auto parts for Ford Motor Company, General Motors,
Mercedes-Benz and Toyota.
 
The
chemicals group includes sulfur and related chemicals, petroleum products,
chlorine and bleaching compounds, plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals,
chemical wastes and municipal wastes.
 

The metals and construction group includes steel, aluminum products,
machinery, scrap metals, cement, aggregates, bricks and minerals.
 
The agriculture, consumer products and
government group includes soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizer, animal and poultry
feed, food oils, flour, beverages, canned goods, sweeteners, consumer products,
ethanol and items for the military.
 

The paper, clay and forest products group includes lumber and wood products,
pulpboard and paper products, woodfibers, woodpulp, scrap paper and clay.
 
General merchandise carloads handled in
2003 were 2.78 million, compared with 2.76 million handled in 2002,
an increase of 1%.

In 2003, 134 million tons of general
merchandise freight, or approximately 66% of total general merchandise tonnage
handled by NS, originated online.
 

The balance of general merchandise traffic was received from connecting
carriers at interterritorial gateways.
 

The principal interchange points for NS-received traffic included
Chicago, Memphis, New Orleans, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Detroit, Hagerstown,
St. Louis/East St. Louis and Louisville.

K8

See the discussion of general merchandise
rail traffic by commodity group in Part II, Item 7, “Management's
Discussion and Analysis.”

INTERMODAL
TRAFFIC -

The intermodal market consists of shipments moving
in trailers, domestic and international containers, and Roadrailer®
equipment.
 
These shipments are
handled on behalf of intermodal marketing companies, international steamship
lines, truckers and other shippers.
 

Intermodal units handled in 2003 were 2.47 million, compared with
2.35 million handled in 2002, an increase of 5%.

See the discussion of intermodal traffic in
Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and
Results of Operations.”

FREIGHT
RATES -

In 2003, NS' railroads continued their
reliance on private contracts and exempt price quotes as their predominant
pricing mechanisms.
 
Thus, a major
portion of NS' railroads' freight business is not currently economically
regulated by the government.
 
In
general, market forces have been substituted for government regulation and now
are the primary determinant of rail service prices.
 
However, in 2003 there were significant coal movements
moving under common carrier (tariff) rates that had previously moved under
rates contained in transportation contracts.
 
Beginning Jan. 1, 2002, coal moving to Duke Energy's (Duke)
Belew's Creek, Allen, Buck and Dan River generating stations moved under common
carrier rates and beginning April 1, 2002, coal moving to Carolina Power and
Light's (CP&L) Hyco and Mayo plants moved under common carrier rates.
 
In 2002, Duke and CP&L filed rate
reasonableness complaints at the STB alleging that NS’ tariff rates for the
transportation of coal were unreasonable.
 

In the Duke proceeding the STB initially found NS’ rates to be
reasonable in November 2003, but subsequently issued technical corrections in
February 2004 finding that in certain years some portion of the rates was
unreasonable.
 
The case is
currently stayed because both parties have indicated that they intend to file
petitions for reconsideration, and the STB has not yet ordered any rate
relief.
 
In the CP&L proceeding
the STB found NS’ rates to be unreasonable in December 2003, but upheld a
significant portion of NS’ tariff increase.
 
Both of the STB’s rate decisions remain subject to petitions
for rehearing and appeals.
 
Future
developments in the two cases could result in additional adjustments, and could
have a significant impact on results of operations in a particular quarter.

In 2003, NS' railroads were found by the STB
not to be “revenue adequate” based on results for the year 2002.
 
A railroad is “revenue adequate” under
the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail
industry's composite cost of capital.
 

This determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement and does
not adversely impact NS' liquidity or capital resources.

PASSENGER
OPERATIONS -

Regularly scheduled passenger trains are operated
by Amtrak on NS' lines between Alexandria and New Orleans, and between
Greensboro and Selma, North Carolina.
 

Commuter trains are operated on the NS line between Manassas and
Alexandria in accordance with contracts with two transportation commissions of
the Commonwealth of Virginia.
 
NS
also leases the Chicago to Manhattan, Illinois, line to the Commuter Rail
Division of the Regional Transportation Authority of Northeast Illinois.
 
Since June 1, 1999, Norfolk
Southern Railway has operated former Conrail lines on which Amtrak conducts
regularly scheduled passenger operations between Chicago, Illinois, and
Detroit, Michigan, and between Chicago and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

Also since June 1, 1999, through its
operation of PRR's routes, Norfolk Southern Railway has been providing freight
service over former Conrail lines with significant ongoing Amtrak and commuter
passenger operations, and is conducting freight operations over some trackage
owned by Amtrak or by New Jersey Transit, the Southeastern Pennsylvania
Transportation Authority, Metro-North Commuter Railroad Company and Maryland
DOT.
 
Finally, passenger operations
are conducted either by Amtrak or by the commuter agencies over trackage owned
by Pennsylvania Lines LLC, or by Conrail in the Shared Assets Areas.

K9

NONCARRIER
OPERATIONS -

NS' noncarrier subsidiaries engage principally
in the acquisition, leasing and management of coal, oil, gas and minerals; the
development of commercial real estate; telecommunications; and the leasing or
sale of rail property and equipment.
 

In 2003, no such noncarrier subsidiary or industry segment grouping of
noncarrier subsidiaries met the requirements for a reportable business segment
set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131.

RAILWAY
PROPERTY

The NS railroad system extends across 22
states, the District of Columbia and portions of Canada.
 
The railroad infrastructure makes the
company very capital intensive with total property of approximately $12 billion
and investment in Conrail of approximately $6 billion.

Capital
Expenditures -

Capital expenditures for road, equipment and other
property for the past five years were as follows (including capitalized
leases):

Capital spending and maintenance programs are
and have been designed to assure the ability to provide safe, efficient and
reliable transportation services.
 

For 2004, NS has budgeted $810 million of capital spending.
 
See the discussion following “Cash used
for investing activities,” in Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

K10

Equipment -

As of Dec. 31, 2003, NS owned or leased the
following units of equipment:

The following table indicates the number and
year built for locomotives and freight cars owned at Dec. 31, 2003.

*

Fifty of the
locomotives built in 2001 were purchased in 2002.

K11

As of Dec. 31, 2003, the average age of the
locomotive fleet was 15.3 years.
 

During 2003, 91 locomotives, the average age of which was
28.7 years, were retired.
 
The
average age of the freight car fleet at Dec. 31, 2003, was
26.6 years.
 
During 2003,
4,855 freight cars were retired.

Since 1988, about 29,000 coal cars have
been rebodied.
 
As a result, the
remaining serviceability of the freight car fleet is greater than may be
inferred from the high percentage of freight cars built in earlier years.

Ongoing freight car and locomotive
maintenance programs are intended to ensure the highest standards of safety,
reliability, customer satisfaction and equipment marketability.
 
In past years, the freight car bad
order ratio reflected the storage of certain types of cars that were not in
high demand.
 
The ratio rose in
2000, 2001 and 2002 as a result of decreased maintenance activity.
 
The decline in 2003 reflected an
increase in maintenance activity as well as the retirement of unserviceable
units.
 
The locomotive bad order
ratio includes units out of service for required inspections every 92 days and
program work such as overhauls.
 

The ratio rose slightly in 2000 as maintenance activities were curtailed
in response to a slowing economy.
 

The elevated ratio through 2003 reflected units out of service related
to the resumption of maintenance and modification activities.

Track
Maintenance -

Of the approximately 38,500 total miles of track
operated, NS had responsibility for maintaining about 31,000 miles of track
with the remainder being operated under trackage rights.
 
Over 75% of the main line trackage
(including first, second, third and branch main tracks, all excluding trackage
rights) has rail ranging from 131 to 155 pounds per yard with the standard
installation currently at 141 pounds per yard.
 
Approximately 40% of NS lines carried 20 million or more
gross tons per track mile.

The following table summarizes several
measurements regarding NS' track roadway additions and replacements during the
past five years:

Microwave System -

The
NS microwave system, consisting of approximately 7,400 radio route miles, 424 core
stations, 14 secondary stations and 5 passive repeater stations, provides
communications between most operating locations.
 
The microwave system is used primarily for voice
communications, VHF radio control circuits, data and facsimile transmissions,
traffic control operations and AEI data transmissions.

Traffic
Control -

Of a total of 21,500 route miles operated by NS,
excluding trackage rights over foreign lines, 10,978 miles are signalized,
including 8,091 miles of centralized traffic control (CTC) and 2,887

K12

miles of automatic block signals.
 
Of the 8,091 miles of CTC, 2,487 miles
are controlled by data radio originating at 183 base station radio sites.

Computers -

A
computer network consisting of a centralized data center in Atlanta, Georgia,
and various distributed computers throughout the company connects the yards,
terminals, transportation offices, rolling stock repair points, sales offices
and other key system locations.
 

Operating and traffic data are processed and stored to provide customers
with information on their shipments throughout the system.
 
Computer systems provide current
information on the location of every train and each car on line, as well as
related waybill and other train and car movement data.
 
In addition, the computer systems are
utilized to assist management in the performance of a variety of functions and
services including payroll, car and revenue accounting, billing, material
management activities and controls, and special studies.

Other -

The railroads
have extensive facilities for support of operations, including freight depots,
car construction shops, maintenance shops, office buildings, and signals and
communications facilities.

Encumbrances
- -

Certain railroad equipment is subject to the prior lien of equipment
financing obligations amounting to approximately $910 million as of Dec.
31, 2003, and $864 million at Dec. 31, 2002.

Environmental
Matters -

Compliance with federal, state and local laws and
regulations relating to the protection of the environment is a principal NS
goal.
 
To date, such compliance has
not affected materially NS' capital additions, earnings, liquidity or
competitive position.
 
See the discussion
of “Environmental Matters” in Part II, Item 7, “Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and
in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

EMPLOYEES -

NS
employed an average of 28,753 employees in 2003, compared with an average of
28,970 in 2002.
 
The approximate
average cost per employee during 2003 was $58,000 in wages and $28,000 in
employee benefits.

Approximately 85% of NS' railroad employees
are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 14 different labor
unions.
 
See the discussion of
“Labor Agreements” in Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

GOVERNMENT
REGULATION -

In addition to environmental, safety,
securities and other regulations generally applicable to all businesses, NS'
railroads are subject to regulation by the STB.
 
The STB has jurisdiction over some rates, routes, conditions
of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines.
 
The STB also has jurisdiction over the
consolidation, merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common
carriers.
 
The Department of
Transportation regulates certain track and mechanical equipment standards.

The relaxation of economic regulation of
railroads, begun over two decades ago under the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, has
continued.
 
Significant exemptions
are TOFC/COFC (i.e., “piggyback”) business, rail boxcar traffic, lumber,
manufactured steel, automobiles and certain bulk commodities such as sand,
gravel, pulpwood and wood chips for paper manufacturing.
 
Transportation contracts on regulated
shipments effectively remove those shipments from regulation as well.
 
About 80% of NS' freight revenues come
from either exempt traffic or traffic moving under transportation contracts.

Efforts may be made in 2004 to re-subject the
rail industry to unwarranted federal economic regulation.
 
The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which
substantially reduced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to
innovate and to compete for business, thereby contributing to the economic
health of the nation

K13

and to the revitalization of the
industry.
 
Accordingly, NS will
oppose efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation.

COMPETITION -

There is
continuing strong competition among rail, water and highway carriers.
 
Price is usually only one factor of
importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific
hauling company.
 
Inventory
carrying costs, service reliability, ease of handling and the desire to avoid
loss and damage during transit are also important considerations, especially
for higher-valued finished goods, machinery and consumer products.
 
Even for raw materials, semifinished
goods and work-in-process, users are increasingly sensitive to transport
arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages.

NS' primary rail competitor is the CSX
system; both operate throughout much of the same territory.
 
Other railroads also operate in parts
of the territory.
 
NS also competes
with motor carriers, water carriers and with shippers who have the additional
option of handling their own goods in private carriage.

Certain marketing strategies among railroads
and between railroads and motor carriers enable carriers to compete more
effectively in specific markets.

NORFOLK SOUTHERN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis should
be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes and
the Five-Year Financial Review.

SUMMARIZED
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Compared with 2002

Net income was $535 million, or $1.37 per
diluted share, in 2003, up $75 million, or 16%.
 
Results in 2003 included a $10 million, or 3 cents per
share, gain from discontinued operations (see Note 17) and a $114 million, or
29 cents per share, benefit related to the cumulative effect of changes in
accounting principles (see Note 1).
 

Income from continuing operations before accounting changes, which
excludes these items, was $411 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, down $49
million, or 11%, compared with 2002, reflecting higher compensation and
benefits costs, which included the costs of a voluntary separation program (see
Note 11), and lower nonoperating income that reflected the impairment of
certain telecommunications assets (see Note 6).
 
The costs of the voluntary separation program and the asset
impairment combined to reduce income by $119 million, or 30 cents per share.

Compared with 2001

Net income was $460 million, or $1.18 per
diluted share, in 2002, up $85 million, or 23%.
 
Net income in 2001 was $375 million and included a $13
million, or 3 cents per share, gain from discontinued operations (see Note 17);
accordingly, income from continuing operations was $362 million, or 94 cents
per diluted share.
 
Results in 2002
were $98 million, or 27%, above 2001’s income from continuing operations.
 
The improvement was primarily the
result of a $151 million, or 15%, increase in income from railway operations.

DETAILED
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Railway
Operating Revenues

Railway operating revenues were $6.5 billion
in 2003, $6.3 billion in 2002 and $6.2 billion in 2001.
 
The following table presents a
three-year comparison of revenues by market group (prior year amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current market groupings).

K19

In 2003, revenues increased 3%, reflecting a
2% rise in general merchandise revenues, a 4% improvement in coal revenues, and
a 5% increase in intermodal revenues.
 

All but automotive within the general merchandise market group posted
increases over 2002.
 
As shown in
the following table, most of the revenue improvement was the result of higher
traffic volumes.
 
The favorable
revenue per unit/mix variance was driven by higher average revenue per unit,
offset in part by the effects of unfavorable changes in the mix of traffic,
particularly a 5% increase in lower-priced intermodal traffic volume.

In 2002, revenues increased 2%, as a 3% rise
in general merchandise revenues coupled with a 5% improvement in intermodal
revenues offset a 5% decline in coal revenues. All but one of the general
merchandise market groups (paper, clay and forest products) posted increases
over 2001.

Beginning March 1, 2004, NS will modify its
fuel surcharge program for its merchandise and coal traffic.
 
The fuel surcharge program in effect
until that time applies a 2% fuel surcharge to line haul freight charges when
the WTI crude oil price, as published in the Wall Street Journal, exceeds
$28.00 per barrel for 30 consecutive business days.
 
For each $5.00 per barrel increase, an additional 2% fuel
surcharge applies.
 
The revised
fuel surcharge will be based on the monthly average price of West Texas
Intermediate (WTI) crude oil.
 
Line
haul freight charges will be adjusted by 0.4% for every dollar the average
price exceeds $23 per barrel in the second calendar month prior to the month in
which the fuel surcharge is applied.
 

The modification in the fuel surcharge program will cause the amount
charged to more closely reflect fuel price fluctuations in today’s volatile
market.

COAL

tonnage
increased 1% in 2003 and revenues increased 4% versus 2002.
 
Revenue per unit increased 4%,
reflecting favorable developments in the coal rate reasonableness proceedings
before the STB, as discussed below, as well as increases resulting from more
longer haul business and loading

K20

productivity improvements that led to more
tons per car.
 
Coal, coke and iron
ore revenues represented 23% of total railway operating revenues in 2003, and
86% of NS' coal shipments originated on lines it operates.

In 2002, two of NS’ utility customers, Duke
Energy (Duke) and Carolina Power & Light (CP&L), filed rate
reasonableness complaints at the STB alleging that NS’ tariff rates for the
transportation of coal were unreasonable.
 

In the Duke proceeding the STB initially found NS’ rates to be
reasonable in November 2003, but subsequently issued technical corrections in
February 2004 finding that in certain years some portion of the rates was
unreasonable.
 
The case is
currently stayed because both parties have indicated that they intend to file
petitions for reconsideration, and the STB has not yet ordered any rate
relief.
 
In the CP&L proceeding
the STB found NS’ rates to be unreasonable in December 2003, but upheld a
significant portion of NS’ tariff increase.
 
Both of the STB’s rate decisions remain subject to petitions
for rehearing and appeals.
 
Future
developments in the two cases could result in additional adjustments and could
have a significant impact on results of operations in a particular
quarter.
 
Over the long term,
Management believes the STB decisions in the Duke and CP&L proceedings will
help support improved pricing for coal transportation services.

In 2002, coal tonnage decreased 4% and
revenues declined 5%.
 
Revenue per
unit declined slightly, reflecting unfavorable changes in the mix of traffic
(more shorter-haul business) that offset the effects of rate increases and
gains in tonnage per car.

Utility
coal

tonnage increased 2%, compared to 2002, primarily due to a 6% gain in
tonnage moving to the Northeast.
 

These gains were led by a full year’s operation of two projects
completed in 2002 that captured traffic from truck and barge.

In the first quarter of 2003, higher natural
gas prices and colder temperatures caused coal-fired generating stations to run
at near capacity in the Northeast, reducing the high stockpiles that were
carried forward from 2002.
 

However, the mild temperatures through the remainder of the year
diminished seasonal demand for coal.
 

Volumes to utilities in the South decreased 4% due to milder weather and
extended power plant outages for the installation of environmental
emission-control technology.

In 2002, utility coal tonnage decreased 3%, a
result of lower demand that reflected the weak economy, high coal stockpile
levels entering the year, mild temperatures in the first quarter, reduced
stockpile targets set by utility companies and increased generation from new
natural gas-fired plants.
 

Licensing requirements for these new plants resulted in additional
generation that temporarily displaced coal-fired generation.

The outlook for utility coal remains
positive.
 
Coal-fired generation
continues to be the lowest-cost source for electric generation that has
additional growth capacity above current levels.
 
Management expects

K21

utilities to use coal-fired plants to meet
increased electricity demand because of coal’s low generating cost and the
strengthening economy.
 
As always,
demand will be influenced by the weather.

There remain a number of evolving
environmental issues that have the potential to increase or ease cost pressures
on the utility coal market, depending upon their outcome.
 
These include a new national energy
policy, proposed multi-emissions legislation, mercury emissions standard, new
source review and the fate of the United States participation in the Kyoto
Protocol.
 
Although developments
with these environmental issues could potentially increase cost pressures on
coal-fired generation, the outlook remains positive for maintaining coal’s
position in the power generation mix for regions served by NS.
 
Favorable developments with these
issues could actually ease cost pressures on coal-fired generation, further
strengthening coal’s position.

Export coal

tonnage
increased 9% in 2003, compared to 2002.
 

Export coal through Norfolk, primarily metallurgical coal, increased by
24% in 2003, benefiting from a decline in exports from China.
 
Strong steel production in China
increased demand for metallurgical coal and coke and shifted Chinese exports of
these commodities to domestic consumption.
 
Also, ocean freight rates are at an all time high.
 
Spot vessel rates from Australia to
Europe have more than tripled, while transatlantic rates have increased less
dramatically.
 
The combination of
the resulting gap in ocean freight rates and the shorter sailing times has
given the United States a competitive advantage in European markets.
 
Last, the decline in the value of the
dollar against the Euro and Australian Dollar also increased demand for United
States metallurgical coal abroad.
 

Coal exported through Baltimore, primarily steam coal, declined 41% due
to strong domestic demand for utility coal, as discussed above.

In 2002, export coal tonnage declined 18%
compared to 2001.
 
Steam coal
exports through Baltimore declined 4%, and export metallurgical coals through
Norfolk declined 22%.
 
During the
first half of 2002, demand for U.S. coal was soft as international buyers
focused their purchases toward other, lower-priced sources.
 
Market uncertainty resulted in late
contract settlements and delayed shipments.
 
Late in 2002, demand for U.S. coking coals increased,
reflecting a shift in the market as exports from China, Australia and Poland
declined.
 
As a result, shipments
through Norfolk increased in the fourth quarter of 2002.

Strong domestic steam coal prices and reduced
metallurgical coal production have limited export growth in the United
States.
 
The stage is set for
further recovery in export volumes in 2004.
 
Export growth will depend, however, upon the availability of
coal supply from key metallurgical mines on NS.
 
Pricing is also expected to strengthen.

Domestic
metallurgical

coal, coke and iron ore volumes decreased 5% in
2003, when compared to 2002, due to the temporary closing of a large mine that
produced low-volatile coal, the continuing consolidation of the steel industry,
and fewer blast furnaces operating than in the past.

In 2002, domestic metallurgical coal, coke
and iron ore tonnage increased 5%, reflecting higher U.S. steel production,
aided by the imported steel tariff program implemented in 2002.
 
In addition, continued strong vehicle
production resulted in demand for steel.

Future demand for domestic metallurgical
coal, coke and iron ore is uncertain but may increase in 2004 due to the
shortage that exists in the world market.
 

Continuation of the anticipated rationalization of the steel industry is
expected, resulting in fewer blast furnaces in operation; however, the furnaces
that remain are expected to run near capacity.
 
Growth may be limited by the availability of coal supply
from a key metallurgical mine on NS that was idled in 2003 but is expected to
reopen sometime in the second half of 2004.
 
In addition, the end of the steel tariff in December 2003
could mean lower steel prices worldwide and may lead to further consolidations
in the industry.

K22

Other coal

volumes,
principally steam coal shipped to manufacturing plants, finished the year down
1%, when compared to 2002.
 
In
2002, other coal traffic decreased 14%, a result of the weak economy.

GENERAL
MERCHANDISE

traffic volume (carloads) increased 1% in 2003, and
revenues increased 2%, principally due to higher average revenues in most
business groups and higher agriculture traffic volume.
 
In 2002, traffic volume increased 2%,
and revenues increased 3%, reflecting a 9% improvement in automotive revenues.

Automotive

traffic volume
and revenues decreased 3% in 2003, principally due to reduced vehicle
production.

In 2002, automotive traffic volume increased
7%, and revenues increased 9%, principally due to a rise in vehicle production
and new business.
 
Revenue per unit
increased 2%, reflecting some pricing improvements, extended length of haul,
special ancillary services and the settlement of a disputed charge.

Automotive revenues in 2004 are expected to
be somewhat higher than those of 2003, due to several factors:
 
light vehicle production is predicted
to be slightly above the 2003 level, NS has increased rail service to a major
customer with a second plant opening towards the end of 2004, and the addition
of several new products.

Chemicals

traffic volume
increased 1% and revenue increased 2% compared to 2002.
 
Traffic volume benefited from higher
shipments of industrial intermediates, petroleum and environmental products,
and plastics.
 
Also contributing to
2003 growth, approximately 2,000 annual carloads of new traffic were diverted
from the waterways and highways.
 

Revenue per unit reflected improved pricing to meet market conditions,
as well as favorable changes in mix.

In 2002, chemicals traffic volume increased
slightly and revenues increased 2%.
 

Higher traffic volume for plastics and a small increase for miscellaneous
chemicals offset a decline for petroleum products.
 
Demand for plastics was supported by increases in light
vehicle production and housing starts.
 

Traffic volume also benefited from increased shipments through NS'
Thoroughbred Bulk Transfer (TBT) facilities that handle chemicals and bulk
commodities for customers not located on NS-served lines.
 
Revenue per unit increased as a result
of a favorable change in the mix of traffic (more higher-rated business) and
market-driven rate increases.

Chemical volume is expected to improve in
2004, primarily due to expectations for a stronger economy and growth from new
or expanded plastics plants.
 

However, volume could be adversely affected by the price of energy in North
America, particularly that of natural gas and crude oil.
 
Both of these commodities account for
more than 50% of the cost of most chemical products, and high North American
prices are causing chemical producers increasingly to look off shore for production.

Metals and
construction

traffic volume decreased 1%, but revenues increased
1% in 2003 compared with 2002.
 
The
decline in volume resulted from reduced metals volume (mostly iron and steel),
offset in part by higher construction traffic.
 
Revenue per unit improved 2%, reflecting favorable pricing
and traffic mix changes.

In 2002, metals and construction traffic
volume increased 2%, and revenues improved 3%, reflecting improvement in the
steel industry, aided by the two-year imported steel tariff program.
 
Metals volume benefited from resumption
of production at some mills that closed in 2001 and increased volume from new
mills.
 
Construction traffic
declined, primarily as a result of reductions in highway projects due to state
government budget pressures.

K23

Metals and construction revenues in 2004 are
expected to benefit from an improved economic environment and converting motor
carrier traffic to rail, although further consolidation in the steel industry
is expected.
 
New stone terminals
on NS lines in Florida, Georgia and Tennessee will generate additional
aggregate business, and new access to existing cement facilities will increase
traffic.

Agriculture,
consumer products and government

traffic volume increased 7%
and revenues increased 8% compared with 2002.
 
Commodities contributing most to these increases were corn,
fertilizer, military, sweeteners and wheat.
 
Only feed, food products and beverages showed a slight
decrease.
 
Corn shipments increased
4% in 2003 and revenue was up 8%.
 

Due to the drought of 2002, which caused a depletion of inventories,
there was a significant increase in demand for corn to Southeast feed mill
customers and poultry producers in eastern Pennsylvania, Maryland, and
Delaware, resulting in long haul rail movements from Midwest suppliers to these
areas.
 
Higher fertilizer traffic
resulted from the re-opening of a large phosphate fertilizer plant.
 
Shipments of military vehicles and
military equipment increased 36% over 2002 levels due to the war in Iraq.

In 2002, agriculture, consumer products and
government traffic volume decreased slightly compared to 2001, but revenues
increased 3%.
 
Traffic volume
increases for corn, food products and beverages largely offset declines for
soybeans and feed.
 
Corn volume
benefited from increased shipments from the Midwest to drought-stricken areas
in the East.
 
The increase for food
products was primarily the result of new business.
 
Soybean and feed volumes were adversely affected by lower
domestic and export demand.
 

Revenue per unit increased because of higher rates, increased length of
haul and favorable changes in the mix of traffic.

Agriculture, consumer products and government
revenues in 2004 are expected to remain steady, reflecting a more normalized
2003 crop, and the overall strong performance of the other commodities.
 
Traffic levels should benefit from new
southeastern feed mills that are expected to come on line by late 2004, as well
as more shipments of corn, ethanol and transcontinental shipments of fresh and
frozen foods.

Paper, clay
and forest products

traffic increased 1% and revenues increased 5%
compared to 2002, principally due to improved domestic demand for paper
products.
 
Paper traffic benefited
from increased domestic orders for consumer products packaging and from the
advertising sector, as well as new business.
 
Newsprint shipments continued to remain soft, largely due to
a prolonged decline in demand.
 

Woodchip volume increased significantly as NS-served paper mills
experienced shortages and were forced to source wood fiber from more distant suppliers
due to wet weather in the Southeast.
 

NS clay revenue was up compared to 2002 due to a strong increase in
revenue per carload and a more positive mix as NS handled more long-haul
domestic traffic.
 
Lumber business
was soft in early 2003 despite strong demand due in part to wet weather and
several mill closures.
 
Lumber
business was up in the fourth quarter as weather in the Southeast and commodity
prices improved.

In 2002, paper, clay and forest products
traffic volume declined 3%, and revenues decreased 1%, primarily due to
continued weakness in the paper market, especially in the first half of the
year.
 
Traffic volume improved
later in the year as the paper market strengthened.
 
In addition, NS gained business from conversion of truck
shipments to rail and from continued strength in housing starts.
 
Revenue per unit benefited from rate
increases and a decline in shorter-haul business.

In 2004, paper, clay and forest product
revenues are expected to experience modest growth consistent with the general
outlook for the domestic economy.
 

NS revenue growth initiatives will focus on converting motor carrier
traffic to rail and offering more transload or rail/truck bundled services to
non-rail served customers.

K24

INTERMODAL

volume
increased 5% and revenues increased 5% compared to 2002.
 
Volume growth was driven by improved
service performance that enabled the conversion of truck business to rail.
 
Shipments for asset-based truckload
carriers increased 14% as these trucking companies used intermodal to reduce
their exposure to driver shortages and the need for larger fleets.
 
International volume, which represents
45% of intermodal’s volume, grew 9%, primarily a result of strong import trade
and new business driven by enhanced service.
 
Triple Crown Services Company (TCS) grew 1% in 2003,
hampered by a fleet at full capacity.
 

NS is expanding this fleet in 2004.

In 2002, intermodal traffic volume increased
6%, and revenues increased 5%, compared to 2001.
 
Volume growth was principally the result of new and improved
services that resulted in new business, including the conversion of truck
business to rail.
 
International
traffic, which accounts for about half of intermodal volume, increased 10%,
supported by growth in trade activity and new business.
 
Domestic shipments grew 6%, primarily
because of new business gained from the conversion of truck shipments.
 
TCS volume increased 4%.
 
Revenue per unit declined as a result
of an increase in shorter-haul business and the absence of fuel surcharges that
were in place in 2001, which were partially offset by some rate increases.

In 2004, intermodal revenues are expected to
benefit from unfavorable forces affecting trucking companies, including changes
to the highway hours of service laws, driver shortages, new truck emission
standards and, accordingly, higher truck prices.
 
These forces are expected to accelerate truck to rail
conversion in addition to creating an environment conducive to rail price
increases.

Railway
Operating Expenses

Railway operating expenses increased 6% in
2003, while carloads increased 2%.
 

Expenses in 2003 included $107 million of costs related to a
voluntary separation program to reduce the size of the work force, which
resulted in 2% of the 6% expense increase.
 
In 2002, railway operating expenses declined 1%, while
carloads increased 1%.

The railway operating ratio, which measures
the percentage of railway operating revenues consumed by railway operating
expenses, was 83.5% in 2003, compared with 81.5% in 2002 and 83.7% in 2001.
 
The voluntary separation costs added 1.6
percentage points to the 2003 ratio.

The following table shows the changes in
railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications.

* Includes $107 million of voluntary
separation costs in 2003.

K25

Compensation
and benefits

represented 42% of total railway operating expenses
and increased 13% in 2003.
 
Almost
half of the increase was the result of the $107 million voluntary separation
program.
 
The remaining increase
was principally due to higher wage rates (including the BLE bonus in lieu of
wage increases), which added $45 million, increased health and welfare benefits
costs, which were up $44 million, and reduced pension income down
$34 million (see Note 11).
 

Approximately $25 million of the increase in health and welfare benefit
costs was attributable to retirees, reflecting a higher estimated medical
inflation rate.
 
NS expects these
costs to be down slightly in 2004, a result of a recent plan amendment and
changes in Medicare coverage (see Note 11).
 
However, NS anticipates that this reduction will largely be
offset by lower pension income.
 

Therefore, total pension and postretirement expenses in 2004 are
expected to be comparable to 2003.

In 2002, compensation and benefits increased
slightly and represented 40% of total railway operating expenses.
 
Higher wage rates, reduced pension
income (see Note 11) and increased health and welfare benefits costs more than
offset savings from reduced employment levels and lower payroll taxes (see the
discussion of the Railroad Retirement and Survivors' Improvement Act, below).

The Railroad Retirement and Survivors'
Improvement Act, which took effect on Jan. 1, 2002, provides for a phased
reduction of the employers' portions of Tier II Railroad Retirement payroll
taxes.
 
The phase-in calls for a
reduction from 14.2% in 2003 to 13.1% in 2004 and thereafter.
 
In addition, the supplemental annuity
tax was eliminated.
 
These changes
resulted in an estimated $21 million reduction in payroll taxes in 2003 and are
expected to result in savings of $16 million in 2004, compared with 2003.
 
However, these savings are expected to
continue to be offset by an increase in the railroad unemployment tax rate,
higher payroll taxes on increased wages and a higher wage base.
 
The new law allows for investment of
Tier II assets in a diversified portfolio through the newly established
National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust.
 
The law also provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment
of future Tier II payroll taxes should the trust assets fall below a four-year
reserve or exceed a six-year reserve.

Materials,
services and rents

includes items used for the maintenance of the
railroad's lines, structures and equipment; the costs of services purchased
from outside contractors, including the net costs of operating joint (or
leased) facilities with other railroads; and the net cost of equipment rentals.
 
This category of expenses decreased 2%
in 2003 and increased 1% in 2002.

The 2003 decline reflected lower equipment
rents costs, down $26 million, and reduced purchased services, down
$20 million, including lower expenses for intermodal, automotive and bulk
transfer services, and professional and legal fees.

The increase in 2002 was the result of higher
volume-related expenses for automotive and intermodal traffic, increased
material costs for locomotives, higher expenses for roadway and bridge repairs
and increased derailment costs.
 

These higher costs were largely offset by a significant reduction in
equipment rents.

Equipment rents, which includes the cost to
NS of using equipment (mostly freight cars) owned by other railroads or private
owners, less the rent paid to NS for the use of its equipment, decreased 7% in
2003 and 14% in 2002.
 
The decline
in 2003 was principally the result of lower automotive traffic volume in
addition to adjustments relating to periodic studies of equipment rents and
favorable settlements of recent bills.
 

In addition, the change in accounting related to certain leased
locomotives (see Notes 1 and 6) also reduced equipment rents.
 
The decline in 2002 was principally the
result of continued improvement in cycle times, reflecting efficiency gains
and, for intermodal equipment, service design and process changes implemented
during the year.

K26

Locomotive repair costs increased in 2003 and
2002, due to more maintenance activity.
 

Locomotive and freight car maintenance costs are expected to increase
further in 2004.

Conrail
rents and services

increased 2% in 2003 and decreased 2% in 2002.
 
This item includes amounts due to PRR
and CRC for use of their operating properties and equipment and CRC's operation
of the Shared Assets Areas.
 
Also
included is NS' equity in Conrail's net earnings, plus the additional
amortization related to the difference between NS' investment in Conrail and
its underlying equity (see Note 2).
 

The increase in 2003 reflects lower Conrail earnings and higher expenses
in the Shared Assets Areas, whereas the decline in 2002 reflected higher
Conrail earnings and lower expenses in the Shared Assets Areas (see “Conrail's
Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity,” below).

Depreciation

expense was
down slightly in 2003 and up slightly in 2002.
 
Substantial levels of capital spending affected both years;
however, expense in 2003 benefited from a change in accounting for the cost to
remove crossties (see Note 1), and expenses in 2002 benefited from lower rates
implemented early in the year following completion of a periodic study (see
Note 1, “Properties,” for NS' depreciation policy).

Diesel fuel

expenses
increased 11% in 2003 and decreased 17% in 2002.
 
The increase in 2003 reflects an 11% rise in the average
price per gallon and essentially flat consumption.
 
The decline in 2002 reflected a 16% drop in the average
price per gallon and slightly lower consumption.
 
Expenses in 2003 and 2002 included benefits of $59 million
and $10 million, respectively, from the diesel fuel hedging program (see
“Market Risks and Hedging Activities,” below and Note 16).
   
NS has hedged approximately
63% of expected 2004 diesel fuel requirements as of December 31, 2003, at an
average price of 78 cents per gallon.
 

Accordingly, if diesel fuel prices are volatile during 2004 it is
unlikely that NS will experience the same degree of volatility in its diesel
fuel expense.

Casualties
and other claims

expenses (including the estimates of costs related
to personal injury, property damage and environmental matters) increased 6% in
2003 and 20% in 2002.
 
The higher
expense in 2003 was due to adverse personal injury claims development and
derailments earlier in the year as well as higher insurance costs.
 
The increase in 2002 reflected adverse
personal injury claims development and higher expenses for loss and damage to
lading, as well as higher insurance and environmental remediation costs.

The largest component of casualties and other
claims expense is personal injury costs.
 

In 2003, cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 40% of
the total employee injury cases settled and 31% of the total settlement
payments made.
 
Injuries of this
type are often not caused by a specific accident or event, but rather, result
from a claimed exposure over time.
 

Many such claims are being asserted by former or retired employees, some
of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades.
 
NS continues to work actively to
eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs.

The rail industry remains uniquely
susceptible to litigation involving job-related accidental injury and
occupational claims because of the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA),
which is applicable only to railroads.
 

FELA, which covers employee claims for job-related injuries, produces
results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a no-fault
workers' compensation system.

NS, like many other businesses in the U.S.,
has experienced difficulty obtaining property and casualty insurance on
reasonable terms after the September 11 terrorist attacks.
 
NS has been successful in maintaining a
substantial amount of commercial insurance for third-party personal injury,
property damage and FELA claims, although both the cost of this insurance and
the amount of risk that NS retains

K27

through self-insurance have more than doubled
since the attacks.
 
The magnitude
of the premium increases that NS experienced in 2002 began to subside in 2003,
however.

Other
expenses

increased 8% in 2003 but decreased 10% in
2002.
 
The increase in 2003 was
primarily attributable to higher state franchise and sales and use taxes, the
absence of a favorable bad debt settlement that benefited 2002 and higher union
employee travel expenses.
 
The decline
in 2002 reflected lower expenses for property and sales and use taxes.

Other
Income – Net

Other income – net was $19 million in 2003,
$66 million in 2002 and $99 million in 2001 (see Note 3).
 
The decline in 2003 was primarily due
to the $84 million telecommunications assets impairment charge that offset
increased gains from the sale of properties, higher corporate-owned life
insurance returns and lower interest accruals related to tax liabilities.
 
The decline in 2002 was primarily the
result of higher interest accruals on federal income tax liabilities, lower
gains from the sale of properties and investments, and the absence of a $13
million gain from a nonrecurring settlement that benefited 2001.
 
These reductions were partially offset
by reduced discount from the sales of receivables (due to a lower amount of
receivables sold and a lower interest rate environment, which favorably affects
the amount of discount).

Income
Taxes

Income tax expense in 2003 was $175 million
for an effective rate of 30%, compared with effective rates of 35% in 2002 and
2001.
 
Excluding NS’ equity in
Conrail's after-tax earnings, the effective rate was 33% in 2003, and 38% in
2002 and 2001.

In 2003, the effective rate was reduced by
the favorable resolution of prior years’ tax audits.
 
The effective rates in all three years benefited from
favorable adjustments upon filing the prior year tax returns and favorable
adjustments to state tax liabilities (see Note 4).

In May 2003, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief
Reconciliation Act of 2003 was signed into law.
 
The law increased from 30% to 50% the additional first-year
depreciation allowance for property acquired after May 5, 2003, and before
January 1, 2005.
 
The 30%
additional first-year depreciation allowance was an element of earlier tax
legislation.
 
The acceleration of
tax depreciation deductions allowed by these laws reduces current taxes and
increases deferred tax levels by significant amounts.

Discontinued
Operations

Income from discontinued operations in 2003
consisted of a $10 million after-tax gain related to the resolution of tax
issues arising from the sale of NS' motor carrier subsidiary.
 
Income from discontinued operations in
2001 consisted of a $13 million after-tax gain resulting from the expiration of
certain indemnities contained in the sales agreement (see Note 17).

FINANCIAL
CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash
provided by operating activities,

NS' principal source of
liquidity, was $1,054 million in 2003, compared with $803 million in 2002 and
$654 million in 2001.
 
The increase
in 2003 reflected a smaller change in the amount of accounts receivables sold;
declines in receivables sold amounted to $30 million in 2003 and $270 million
in 2002 (see Note 5).
 
In 2002, the
improvement was the result of higher income

K28

from railway operations and favorable changes
in working capital, which were offset, in part, by fewer accounts receivable
sold (see Note 5).

Payments made to PRR (which are included in
“Conrail Rents and Services” and, therefore, are a use of cash in “Cash
provided by operating activities”) are largely cash neutral because a
significant portion are borrowed back from a PRR subsidiary and, therefore, are
a source of cash in “Proceeds from borrowings.”
 
NS' net cash flow from these borrowings amounted to $203
million in 2003, $212 million in 2002 and $250 million in 2001.

NS' working capital deficit was $376 million
at Dec. 31, 2003, compared with $554 million at Dec. 31, 2002.
 
The improvement resulted principally
from an increase in cash flow from operations and a reduction in federal income
taxes due within one year.
 
Debt
due in 2004 is expected to be paid using cash generated from operations
(including sales of accounts receivable) and cash on hand.

NS currently has the capability to increase
the amount of accounts receivable being sold under the revolving sale program
to meet its more immediate working capital needs.
 
During 2003, the amount of receivables NS could sell under
this program ranged from $358 million to $433 million, and the amount of
receivables NS sold ranged from zero to $150 million.
 
Moreover, NS has a $1 billion credit facility, which expires
in 2006, that it can borrow under or use to support commercial paper debt;
however, reductions in its credit rating could limit NS' ability to access the
commercial paper markets (see also the discussion of financing activities,
below).

NS expects to generate sufficient cash flow
from operations to meet its ongoing obligations.
 
This expectation is based on a view that the economy will
continue a moderate growth rate through 2004.

Contractual
obligations

at Dec. 31, 2003, related to NS' long-term debt
(including capital leases) (see Note 8), operating leases (see Note 9),
agreements with CRC (see Note 2), unconditional purchase obligations (see Note
18) and other long-term obligations (see Note 18), are as follows:

NS also has a contractual obligation related
to a lease covering 140 locomotives.
 

The lessor is a special-purpose entity formed to enter into this
transaction, but it is not related to NS and its owner has a substantive
residual equity capital investment at risk in the entity.
 
The lessor owns the locomotives and
issued debt to finance their purchase; however, NS has no obligation related to
the debt.
 
NS has the option to
purchase the locomotives, but also can return them to the lessor.
 
If NS does not purchase the locomotives
at the end of the maximum lease term, it is liable for any shortfall in the
then fair value of the locomotives and a specified residual value.
 
NS does not expect to be required to
make any payments under this provision (see Note 9).
 
As the primary beneficiary of the business of the lessor,
effective

K29

Jan. 1, 2003, NS consolidated the assets
(locomotives) and liabilities (debt) of this special-purpose entity when it
implemented Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No.
 
46 (see Note 1, “New Accounting
Pronouncements”).

In addition, NS has contractual obligations
to PRR as disclosed in Note 2.
 

However, NS has the ability to borrow back funds from PRR to the extent
they are not needed to fund contractual obligations at Conrail.
 
As an indirect owner of Conrail, NS may
need to make capital contributions, loans or advances to Conrail to fund its
contractual obligations.
 
The
following table presents 58% of Conrail's contractual obligations for long-term
debt (including capital leases) and operating leases.
 
Conrail has no unconditional purchase or other long-term
obligations.

Off balance
sheet arrangements

consist of an accounts receivable sale program (see
Note 5).
 
Under the program, NS
sells without recourse undivided ownership interests in a pool of accounts
receivable to two unrelated buyers.
 

NS has no ownership interest in the buyers.
 
The buyers issued debt to fund their initial purchase, and
NS used the proceeds it received from the initial purchase primarily to pay
down its outstanding debt.
 
NS has
no obligation related to the buyers' debt, and there is no existing obligation
to repurchase sold receivables.
 

Upon termination of the program, the buyers would cease purchasing new
receivables and would retain collections related to the previously sold
receivables (see Note 5).
 
As of
Dec. 31, 2003, there were no accounts receivable sold, however, NS has the
capability to increase the amounts sold, as discussed above.

Cash used
for investing activities

decreased 5% in 2003 and increased 12% in
2002.
 
Property additions, which
account for most of the recurring spending in this category, were up 4% in 2003
and down 8% in 2002.
 
Property
sales were higher in 2003, which resulted in the net decrease in cash used for
investing activities.
 
The
following tables show capital spending (including capital leases) and track and
equipment statistics for the past five years.

Capital expenditures increased 4% in 2003 and
decreased 7% in 2002 (which included $6 million of capitalized
leases).
 
The increase in 2003
reflects higher locomotive purchases offset, in part, by lower spending on
signal and electrical projects and computers.
 
The decline in 2002 reflected higher spending

K30

on track program work that was offset by
fewer locomotive purchases (50 in 2002 compared with 100 in 2001) and lower
spending for intermodal facilities.

NS and six other railroads (five Class I
railroads and a commuter railroad) have agreed to participate in the Chicago
Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency (CREATE) project in
Chicago.
 
The project is a proposed
public-private partnership between the railroads and city, state and federal
governments to design and implement a comprehensive plan to keep passenger and
freight trains moving on schedule through the metropolitan Chicago area, the
largest rail transportation hub in the U.S.
 
The intent is to reduce rail and highway congestion and add
freight and passenger capacity.
 

The project is estimated to cost $1.5 billion with city, state and
federal support.
 
The railroads’
financial contribution to the project is contingent upon a binding commitment
that establishes the availability, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
railroads, of all required public funding and of third-party properties
necessary to complete the entire project.
 

If public funding is secured, the railroads will contribute a total of
$232 million towards the project with NS’ share slated to be $34 million over
an estimated six-year period.

The table above excludes equipment leased
from PRR (see Note 2), which comprises 17% of the freight car fleet and 22% of
the locomotive fleet.

Through its coal car rebody program, which
was suspended in 2000, NS converted about 29,000 hopper cars into high-capacity
steel gondolas or hoppers.
 
As a
result, the remaining service life of the freight-car fleet is greater than may
be inferred from the increasing average age shown in the table above.

For 2004, NS has budgeted $810 million for
capital expenditures.
 
The
anticipated spending includes $517 million for roadway projects, of which $384
million is for track and bridge program work.
 
Also included are projects for communications, signal and
electrical systems, as well as projects for environmental and public
improvements such as grade crossing separations and signal upgrades.
 
Other roadway projects include
marketing and industrial development initiatives, including increasing track
capacity and access to coal receivers and vehicle production and distribution
facilities, and continuing investments in intermodal infrastructure.
 
Equipment spending of $220 million
includes the purchase of 100 locomotives and upgrades to existing units,
improvements to multilevel automobile racks, and projects related to computers
and information technology, including additional security and backup systems.

K31

Cash used
for financing activities

was $314 million in 2003 and $150 million in
2002.
 
Financing activities
provided cash of $151 million in 2001.
 

The comparisons reflect net reductions of debt in 2003 and 2002 and a
net increase in 2001.
 
Financing
activities include loan transactions with a subsidiary of PRR that resulted in
net borrowings of $203 million in 2003, $212 million in 2002 and $250 million
in 2001 (see Note 2).
 

Excluding these borrowings, debt was reduced $370 million in 2003,
$303 million in 2002 and $20 million in 2001.
 
NS' debt-to-total capitalization ratio (excluding notes
payable to the PRR subsidiary) at year end was 50.7% in 2003 and 53.1% in 2002.

In 2003, NS redeemed all publicly held shares
of Norfolk Southern Railway’s $2.60 Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A for a
redemption price of $50 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends, for an
aggregate redemption price of $50.2066.
 

The total use of cash was $43 million.

NS currently has in place and available a $1
billion, five-year credit agreement, which provides for borrowings at
prevailing rates and includes financial covenants (see Note 8).

NS has outstanding $717 million of its 7.05%
notes due May 1, 2037.
 
Each holder
of a 2037 note may require NS to redeem all or part of the note at face value,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, on May 1, 2004.
 
NS will not know the amount of 2037 notes that it may be
required to redeem until April 1, 2004.
 

Should it be necessary, NS has the ability and intent to refinance such
notes properly presented.

APPLICATION
OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
 
These estimates and assumptions may
require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain, and
future events are likely to occur that may require management to change
them.
 
Accordingly, management
regularly reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical
experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that
management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
 
Management discusses the development,
selection and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the
Audit Committee of its Board of Directors.

Pensions
and Other Postretirement Benefits

Accounting for pensions and other
postretirement benefit plans requires management to make several estimates and
assumptions (see Note 11).
 
These
include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans' assets,
projected increases in medical costs and the expected retirement age of
employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality.
 
In addition, the amounts recorded are
affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated
liabilities are discounted to their present value.
 
Management makes these estimates based on the company's
historical experience and other information that it deems pertinent under the
circumstances (for example, expectations of future stock market
performance).
 
Management engages
an independent consulting actuarial firm to aid it in selecting appropriate
assumptions and valuing its related liabilities.

NS' net pension benefit, which is included in
“Compensation and benefits” on its Consolidated Income Statement, was $25
million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2003, including $19 million related to the
voluntary separation program.
 
In
recording this amount, NS assumed a long-term investment rate of return of
9%.
 
Investment experience of the
pension fund over the past 10-, 15- and 20-year periods has

K32

been in excess of 10%.
 
A one percentage point change to this
rate of return assumption would result in a $17 million change to the pension
credit and, as a result, an equal change in “Compensation and benefits”
expense.
 
Changes that are
reasonably likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age, projected
earnings and mortality would not be expected to have a material effect on NS'
net pension benefit or net pension asset in the future.
 
The net pension asset is recorded at
its net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current
interest rate environment; therefore, management has little discretion in this
assumption.

NS' net cost for other postretirement
benefits, which is also included in “Compensation and benefits,” was $80
million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2003, which included $22 million related to
the voluntary separation program.
 

In recording this expense and valuing the net liability for other
postretirement benefits, which is included in “Other benefits” as disclosed in
Note 11, management estimated future increases in health-care costs.
 
These assumptions, along with the
effect of a one percentage point change in them, are described in Note 11.
 
Additionally, as discussed in Note 11,
recent changes to Medicare are expected to reduce NS’ postretirement benefit
costs.

Properties
and Depreciation

Most of NS' total assets are comprised of
long-lived railway properties (see Note 6) and its investment in Conrail (see
Note 2).
 
Most of Conrail's assets
are long-lived railway properties.
 

As disclosed in Note 1, NS' properties are depreciated using group
depreciation.
 
Rail is depreciated
primarily on the basis of use measured by gross-ton miles.
 
Other properties are depreciated
generally using the straight-line method over the lesser of estimated service
or lease lives.
 
NS reviews the
carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future
undiscounted cash flows or estimated net realizable value.
 
Assets that are deemed impaired as a
result of such review are recorded at the lesser of carrying amount or fair
value.
 
NS is amortizing the excess
of the purchase price paid for its investment in Conrail over its share of
Conrail's net equity using the principles of purchase accounting, based
primarily on the estimated remaining useful lives of Conrail's properties.

NS' depreciation expense is based on
management's assumptions concerning service lives of its properties as well as
the expected net salvage that will be received upon their retirement.
 
These assumptions are the product of
periodic depreciation studies that are performed by a firm of consulting
engineers.
 
These studies analyze
NS' historical patterns of asset use and retirement and take into account any
expected change in operation or maintenance practices.
 
NS' recent experience with these
studies has been that while they do result in changes in the rates used to
depreciate its properties, these changes have not caused a significant effect
to its annual depreciation expense.
 

The studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated
depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by the
study.
 
Any such deficiency (or
excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining
service lives of the affected class of property.
 
NS' “Depreciation expense” for the year ended Dec.
 
31, 2003, amounted to $513
million.
 
NS' weighted-average
depreciation rates for 2003 are disclosed in Note 6; a one-tenth percentage
point increase (or decrease) in these rates would result in a $18 million
increase (or decrease) to NS' depreciation expense.

Personal
Injury, Environmental and Legal Liabilities

NS' expense for “Casualties and other claims”
amounted to $181 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2003.
 
Most of this expense was composed of
NS' accrual related to personal injury liabilities (see discussion of FELA in
the discussion captioned “Casualties and other claims” on page K27).
 
NS engages an independent consulting
actuarial firm to aid in valuing its personal injury liability and determining
the amount to accrue during the year.
 

The actuarial firm studies NS' historical patterns of reserving for

K33

claims and subsequent settlements.
 
The actuary also takes into account
outside influences considered pertinent.
 

The study uses the results of these analyses to estimate the ultimate
amount of the liability, which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted
claims.
 
NS has recorded this
actuarially determined liability.
 

The liability is dependent upon many individual judgments made as to the
specific case reserves as well as the judgments of the consulting actuary and
management in the periodic studies.
 

Accordingly, there could be significant changes in the liability, which
NS would recognize when such a change became known.
 
The most recent actuarial study was performed as of Sept.
30, 2003, and resulted in a slight decrease to NS' personal injury liability
during the fourth quarter.
 
While
the liability recorded is supported by the most recent study, it is reasonably
possible that the liability could be higher or lower.

NS is subject to various jurisdictions'
environmental laws and regulations.
 

It is NS' policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is
probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably (see Note 18).
 
Environmental engineers regularly
participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any
necessary adjustments to liability estimates.
 
NS also has established an Environmental Policy Council,
composed of senior managers, to oversee and interpret its environmental policy.

Operating expenses for environmental matters
totaled approximately $9 million in 2003, $15 million in 2002 and $12 million
in 2001, and capital expenditures totaled approximately $9 million in 2003, and
$10 million in both 2002 and 2001.
 

Capital expenditures in 2004 are expected to be comparable to those in
2003.

NS' balance sheets included liabilities for
environmental exposures in the amount of $25 million at Dec. 31, 2003, and $29
million at Dec. 31, 2002, (of which $8 million was accounted for as a current
liability in each year).
 
At Dec.
31, 2003, the liability represented NS' estimate of the probable cleanup and
remediation costs based on available information at 113 identified
locations.
 
On that date, 10 sites
accounted for $12 million of the liability, and no individual site was
considered to be material.
 
NS
anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years;
however, some costs will be paid out over a longer period.

At some of the 113 locations, certain NS
subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been
identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes,
which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs.

With respect to known environmental sites
(whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities),
estimates of NS' ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in
the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the
widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely
development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in advance
the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participant's
share of any estimated loss (and that participant's ability to bear it), and
evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability.
 
NS estimates its environmental remediation
liability on a site-by-site basis, using assumptions and judgments that
management deems appropriate for each site.
 
As a result, it is not practical to quantitatively describe
the effects of changes in these many assumptions and judgments.
 
NS has consistently applied its
methodology of estimating its environmental liabilities.

The risk of incurring environmental liability
is inherent in the railroad business.
 

Some of the commodities in NS' traffic mix, particularly those
classified as hazardous materials, can pose special risks that NS and its
subsidiaries work diligently to minimize.
 

In addition, several NS subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as
operating property, or which is leased and operated by others, or held for
sale.
 
Because environmental
problems may exist on these properties that are latent or undisclosed, there
can be

K34

no assurance that NS will not incur
environmentally related liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of
them, the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this
time.
 
Moreover, lawsuits and
claims involving these and potentially other unidentified environmental sites
and matters are likely to arise from time to time.
 
The resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on
financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or
quarter.

However, based on its assessment of the facts
and circumstances now known, management believes that it has recorded the
probable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which the
Corporation is aware.
 
Further,
management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters, either
individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS'
financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries are
defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to
railroad operations.
 
When
management concludes that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and
the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, it is accrued through
a charge to expenses.
 
While the
ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is
dependent on future developments, in management's opinion the recorded
liability, if any, is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability
and claims.
 
However, the final
outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty,
and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that
could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or
quarter.
 
Any adjustments to
recorded liabilities will be reflected in expenses in the periods in which such
adjustments are known.

Income
Taxes

NS' net long-term deferred tax liability
totaled $3,223 million at Dec. 31, 2003 (see Note 4).
 
This liability is estimated based on the expected future tax
consequences of items recognized in the financial statements.
 
After application of the federal
statutory tax rate to book income, judgment is required with respect to the
timing and deductibility of expenses in the corporate income tax returns.
 
For state income and other taxes,
judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various
jurisdictions.
 
A valuation allowance
is recorded if management expects that it is more likely than not that its
deferred tax assets will not be realized.
 

NS has a $22 million valuation allowance on $628 million of
deferred tax assets as of Dec. 31, 2003, reflecting the expectation that most
of these assets will be realized.
 

For 2003, 2002 and 2001, the effective tax rates, excluding NS' equity
in Conrail's earnings, were 33%, 38% and 38%, respectively.
 
For every one half percent change in
the 2003 effective tax rate, net income would have changed by $3 million.

CONRAIL'S
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Conrail's net income was $203 million in
2003, compared with $180 million in 2002 and $174 million in 2001 (see Note
2).
 
Results in 2003 included $40
million for the cumulative effect on years prior to 2003 of a change in
accounting principles as required by Conrail’s adoption of SFAS No. 143.
 
NS excluded this amount from its
determination of equity in earnings of Conrail because an amount related to
Conrail is included in NS’ cumulative effect adjustment for SFAS No. 143.
 
Conrail’s income before the accounting
change was $163 million, $17 million below 2002, reflecting lower income from
operations.

Conrail's operating revenues were $918
million in 2003, $893 million in 2002 and $903 million in 2001.
 
The 2003 increase was primarily
attributable to higher operating fees related to PRR and NYC.
 
The decrease in 2002 resulted from the
expiration of certain equipment leases and lower operating fees, largely because
of reduced operating costs in the Shared Assets Areas.

K35

Conrail's operating expenses were $659
million in 2003, $623 million in 2002 and $639 million in 2001.
 
The increase in 2003 was primarily the
result of higher expenses for compensation and benefits, and casualties and
insurance.
 
The decrease in 2002
reflected lower expenses for materials, services and rents and compensation and
benefits, which were offset, in part, by higher costs for casualties and other
claims.

Conrail's cash provided by operations
decreased $11 million, or 3%, in 2003, and $79 million, or 16%, in 2002.
 
The decrease in 2003 reflects the
absence of an IRS refund received in 2002 that was partially offset by a
decreased use of cash for casualty payments.
 
The decline in 2002 was primarily the result of the absence
of two items that benefited 2001: a $50 million cash payment for transferring
to a third party certain rights to license, manage and market signboard
advertising on Conrail's property for 25 years and proceeds from a favorable
insurance settlement.
 
This was
offset, in part, by favorable changes in working capital.
 
Cash generated from operations is
Conrail's principal source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt
repayments and capital expenditures.
 

Debt repayments totaled $57 million in 2003 and $59 million in
2002.
 
Capital expenditures totaled
$35 million in 2003 and $23 million in 2002.

Conrail had a working capital deficit of $22
million at Dec. 31, 2003, and $29 million at Dec. 31, 2002.
 
Conrail is not an SEC registrant and,
therefore, presently cannot issue any publicly traded securities.
 
Conrail is expected to have sufficient
cash flow to meet its ongoing obligations.

NS' equity in earnings of Conrail, net of
amortization, was $58 million in 2003, $54 million in 2002 and $44 million in
2001.
 
NS' other comprehensive
income (loss) for 2003, 2002 and 2001, as shown in the Consolidated Statement
of Changes in Stockholders' Equity, included a $14 million gain, a $34 million
loss and a $41 million loss, respectively, for its portion of Conrail's other
comprehensive loss (see Note 13).

OTHER
MATTERS

Labor
Agreements

Approximately 24,000 of NS' railroad
employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 14 different
labor unions.
 
These agreements
remain in effect until changed pursuant to the Railway Labor Act.
 
Moratorium provisions in these
agreements permitted NS and the unions to propose such changes in late 1999;
negotiations at the national level commenced shortly thereafter.

Agreements have been reached with the
Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes (BMWE), which represents about 4,200
NS employees; the United Transportation Union (UTU), which represents about
6,700 NS employees; the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers and
Blacksmiths (IBB), which represents about 100 NS employees; the Transportation
Communications International Union (TCU), which represents about 4,400 NS
employees; the American Train Dispatchers Department (ATDD), which represents
about 400 NS employees; the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen (BRS), which
represents about 1,100 NS employees; and the Brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineers (BLE), which represents about 4,500 NS employees.
 
The agreement with the BLE was through
2004; NS recently reached a further contract extension with BLE through
2009.
 
A tentative agreement with
the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), which represents
about 900 NS employees, failed ratification.

Health and welfare issues have been resolved
with BMWE, TCU, BRS, BLE and UTU.
 

Health and welfare issues with the other organizations have not yet been
resolved.

K36

Market Risks and Hedging Activities

NS uses derivative financial instruments to
reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its
overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.

In 2001, NS began a program to hedge a
portion of its diesel fuel consumption.
 

The intent of the program is to assist in the management of NS'
aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations, which can significantly
affect NS' operating margins and profitability, through the use of one or more
types of derivative instruments.

Diesel fuel costs represented 7% of NS'
operating expenses for 2003.
 
The
program provides that NS will not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of
more than 36 months, and that no more than 80% of NS' average monthly fuel
consumption will be hedged for any month within any 36-month period.

As of Dec. 31, 2003, through swap
transactions, NS has hedged approximately 63% of expected 2004 diesel fuel
requirements.
 
The effect of the
hedges is to yield an average cost of 78 cents per hedged gallon,
including federal taxes and transportation.
 
A 10% decrease in diesel fuel prices would reduce NS' asset
related to the swaps by approximately $38 million as of Dec. 31, 2003.

NS manages its overall exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed- and floating-rate debt
instruments and by entering into interest-rate hedging transactions to achieve
an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio.

At Dec. 31, 2003, NS' debt subject to
interest rate fluctuations totaled $636 million (excluding debt due to the PRR
subsidiary).
 
A 1% increase in
interest rates would increase NS' total annual interest expense related to all
its variable debt by approximately $6 million.
 
Management considers it unlikely that interest rate
fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse
effect on NS' financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Some of NS' capital leases, which carry an
average fixed rate of 7%, were effectively converted to variable rate
obligations using interest rate swap agreements.
 
On Dec. 31, 2003, the average pay rate under these
agreements was 1.6%, and the average receive rate was 7%.
 
During 2003, the effect of the swaps
was to reduce interest expense by $10 million.
 
A portion of the lease obligations is payable in Japanese
yen.
 
NS eliminated the associated
exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient
to fund the yen-denominated obligation.
 

Most of these deposits are held by foreign banks, primarily
Japanese.
 
As a result, NS is
exposed to financial market risk relative to Japan.
 
Counterparties to the interest rate swaps and Japanese banks
holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to
be creditworthy.

New
Accounting Pronouncements

As discussed in Note 1, effective Jan. 1,
2003, NS adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No.
 
143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations,” (SFAS No. 143) and FASB Interpretation No.
 
46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities,” (FIN No.
 
46).

Inflation

In preparing financial statements, accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America require the use
of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement
cost of property.
 
NS, a
capital-intensive company, has most of its capital invested in such
assets.
 
The

K37

replacement cost of these assets, as well as
the related depreciation expense, would be substantially greater than the
amounts reported on the basis of historical cost.

Trends

Federal
Economic Regulation --

Efforts may be made in 2004 to reimpose
unwarranted federal economic regulation on the rail industry.
 
The Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which
substantially reduced such regulation, encouraged and enabled rail carriers to
innovate and to compete for business.
 

NS and other rail carriers will oppose any efforts to reimpose
unwarranted economic regulation.

Utility
Deregulation --

Deregulation of the electrical utility industry is
expected to increase competition among electric power generators; deregulation
over time would permit wholesalers and possibly retailers of electric power to
sell or purchase increasing quantities of power to or from distant
parties.
 
The effects of
deregulation on NS and on its customers cannot be predicted with certainty;
however, NS serves a number of efficient power producers who are expected to
remain competitive in this evolving environment.

Carbon-Based
Fuel --

There is growing concern in some quarters that emissions resulting
from burning carbon-based fuel, including coal, are contributing to global
warming and causing other environmental changes.
 
To the extent that these concerns evolve into a consensus
among policy-makers, the impact could be either a reduction in the demand for
coal or imposition of more stringent regulations on emissions, which might
result in making coal a less economical source of power generation or make
permitting of coal-fired facilities even more difficult.
 
The revenues and net income of NSR and
other railroads that move large quantities of coal could be affected adversely.

FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS

This Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking
statements that may be identified by the use of words like “believe,” “expect,”
“anticipate” and “project.” Forward-looking statements reflect management's
good-faith evaluation of information currently available.
 
However, such statements are dependent
on and, therefore, can be influenced by, a number of external variables over
which management has little or no control, including: domestic and
international economic conditions; the business environment in industries that
produce and consume rail freight; competition and consolidation within the
transportation industry; fluctuation in prices of key materials, in particular
diesel fuel; labor difficulties, including strikes and work stoppages;
legislative and regulatory developments; changes in securities and capital
markets; and natural events such as severe weather, floods and
earthquakes.
 
Forward-looking
statements are not, and should not be relied upon as, a guaranty of future
performance or results.
 
Nor will
they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which
any such performance or results will be achieved.
 
As a result, actual outcomes and results may differ materially
from those expressed in forward-looking statements.
 
The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise
forward-looking statements.

Report of Management

January 27, 2004

To the Stockholders

Norfolk Southern Corporation

Management is responsible for the preparation
and fair presentation of the financial statements included in this annual
report.
 
The financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America and reflect management's judgments and
estimates concerning effects of events and transactions that are accounted for
or disclosed.

Management is also responsible for establishing
and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.
 
The Corporation's internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the
Corporation's ability to record, process, summarize and report reliable
financial data.
 
Management
recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any
internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human
error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control.
 
Accordingly, even effective internal
control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation.
 
Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.

In order to ensure that the Corporation's
internal control over financial reporting is effective, management regularly
assesses such controls and did so most recently for its financial reporting as
of December 31, 2003.
 
This assessment
was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting
described in

Internal Control-Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.
 
Based on this
assessment, management believes the Corporation maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2003.

The Board of Directors, acting through its
Audit Committee, is responsible for the oversight of the Corporation's
accounting policies, financial reporting and internal control.
 
The Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors is comprised entirely of outside directors who are independent of
management.
 
The Audit Committee is
responsible for the appointment and compensation of the independent auditor and
approves decisions regarding the appointment or removal of the Vice
President-Internal Audit.
 
It meets
periodically with management, the independent auditors and the internal
auditors to ensure that they are carrying out their responsibilities.
 
The Audit Committee is also responsible
for performing an oversight role by reviewing and monitoring the financial,
accounting and auditing procedures of the Corporation in addition to reviewing
the Corporation's financial reports.
 

The independent auditors and the internal auditors have full and
unlimited access to the Audit Committee, with or without management, to discuss
the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, and any other
matters which they believe should be brought to the attention of the Audit
Committee.

KPMG LLP, independent auditors of the
Corporation's financial statements, has reported on management's assertion with
respect to the effectiveness of the Corporation's internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2003.

Independent
Auditors' Report

The Stockholders and Board of Directors

Norfolk Southern Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Norfolk Southern Corporation and subsidiaries as of December
31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes
in stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2003.
 
In
connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we have
also audited the financial statement schedule as listed in Item 15(A)2.
 
These consolidated financial statements
and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's
management.
 
Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.
 
Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.
 
An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.
 
An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.
 
We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Norfolk Southern Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2003 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.
 
Also, in our opinion,
the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements, effective January 1, 2003 the Company adopted Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 143,

Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations

, and Financial Accounting Standards
Board Interpretation No. 46,

INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors

Norfolk Southern Corporation:

We have examined management's assertion,
included in the accompanying Report of Management, that Norfolk Southern
Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2003 based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).
 
Norfolk Southern Corporation's
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting.
 
Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertion based on our
examination.

Our examination was conducted in accordance
with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants and, accordingly, included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, testing, and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
 
We believe that our examination
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Because of inherent limitations in any
internal control, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be
detected.
 
Also, projections of any
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are
subject to the risk that the internal control may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management's assertion that
Norfolk Southern Corporation maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2003 is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The following Notes are an integral part of
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

1.
 
Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

Description
of Business

Norfolk Southern Corporation is a Virginia-based
holding company engaged principally in the rail transportation business,
operating approximately 21,500 route miles primarily in the East and
Midwest.
 
These consolidated
financial statements include Norfolk Southern Corporation (Norfolk Southern)
and its majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries (collectively, NS).
 
Norfolk Southern's major subsidiary is
Norfolk Southern Railway Company (NSR).
 

All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

The railroad transports raw materials,
intermediate products and finished goods classified in the following market
groups (percent of total railway operating revenues in 2003): coal (23%);
intermodal (19%); automotive (14%); chemicals (12%); metals/construction (11%);
agriculture/consumer products/government (11%); and paper/clay/forest products
(10%).
 
Ultimate points of
origination or destination for some of the freight (particularly coal bound for
export and intermodal containers) are outside the United States.
 
Approximately 85% of NS' railroad
employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 14 different
labor unions.

Through a jointly owned entity, Norfolk
Southern and CSX Corpor­ation own the stock of Conrail Inc., which owns the
major Northeast freight railroad.
 

Norfolk Southern has a 58% economic and 50% voting interest in the
jointly owned entity (see Note 2).

Use of
Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
 
Management reviews its estimates,
including those related to the recoverability and useful lives of assets, as
well as liabilities for litigation, environmental remediation, casualty claims,
income taxes, and pension and postretirement benefits.
 
Changes in facts and circumstances may
result in revised estimates.

Cash
Equivalents

“Cash equivalents” are highly liquid
investments purchased three months or less from maturity.

Investments

Marketable equity and debt securities are
reported at amortized cost or fair value, depending upon their classification
as securities “held-to-maturity,” “trading” or “available-for-sale.”
 
Unrealized gains and losses for investments
designated as “available-for-sale,” net of taxes, are recognized in
“Accumulated other comprehensive loss.”

K47

Investments where NS has the ability to
exercise significant influence over but does not control the entity are
accounted for using the equity method in accordance with APB Opinion No. 18,
“The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.”

Materials
and Supplies

“Materials and supplies,” consisting mainly
of fuel oil and items for maintenance of property and equipment, are stated at
the lower of average cost or market.
 

The cost of materials and supplies expected to be used in capital
additions or improvements is included in “Properties.”

Properties

“Properties” are stated principally at cost
and are depreciated using group depreciation.
 
Rail is depreciated primarily on the basis of use measured
by gross ton-miles.
 
Other
properties are depreciated generally using the straight-line method over the
lesser of estimated service or lease lives.
 
NS capitalizes interest on major capital projects during the
period of their construction.
 

Expenditures, including those on leased assets that extend an asset's
useful life or increase its utility, are capitalized.
 
Maintenance expense is recognized when repairs are
performed.
 
When properties other
than land and nonrail assets are sold or retired in the ordinary course of
business, the cost of the assets, net of sale proceeds or salvage, is charged
to accumulated depreciation rather than recognized through income.
 
Gains and losses on disposal of land
and nonrail assets are included in “Other income - net” (see Note 3).

NS reviews the carrying amount of properties
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount
may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flows or estimated net
realizable value.
 
Assets that are
deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lower of
carrying amount or fair value (see Note 6).

Revenue
Recognition

Revenue is recognized proportionally as a
shipment moves from origin to destination.
 
Refunds are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on
management's best estimate of projected liability.

Derivatives

NS does not engage in the trading of
derivatives.
 
NS uses derivative
financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs
and in the management of its mix of fixed and floating-rate debt.
 
Management has determined that these
derivative instruments qualify as either fair-value or cash-flow hedges, having
values that highly correlate with the underlying hedged exposures and have
designated such instruments as hedging transactions.
 
Income and expense related to the derivative financial
instruments are recorded in the same category as generated by the underlying
asset or liability.
 
Credit risk
related to the derivative financial instruments is considered to be minimal and
is managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic
settlements.

Stock-Based
Compensation

NS has stock-based employee compensation
plans, which are more fully described in Note 12.
 
NS applies the intrinsic value recognition and measurement
principles of APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”
(APB Opinion No. 25), and related interpretations in accounting for these
plans.

K48

The following table illustrates the effect on
net income and earnings per share if NS had applied the fair value recognition
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation” (SFAS No. 123), to stock-based employee
compensation:

Required
Accounting Changes

NS adopted Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) Statement No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,”
(SFAS No. 143) effective Jan. 1, 2003, and recorded a $110 million net
adjustment ($182 million before taxes) for the cumulative effect of this change
in accounting on years prior to 2003.
 

Pursuant to SFAS No. 143, the cost to remove crossties must be recorded
as an expense when incurred; previously these removal costs were accrued as a
component of depreciation.
 
This
change in accounting lowered depreciation expense by about $26 million for 2003
(because the depreciation rate for crossties no longer reflects cost to remove)
and increased compensation and benefits and other expenses by about $21 million
for the year (for the costs to remove retired assets).

NS also adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” (FIN No. 46) effective
Jan. 1, 2003, and recorded a $4 million net adjustment ($6 million before
taxes) for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting on years prior to
2003.
 
Pursuant to FIN No. 46, NS
has consolidated a special-purpose entity that leases certain locomotives to NS
(see Note 9).
 
This entity’s assets
and liabilities at Jan. 1, 2003, included $169 million of locomotives and $157
million of debt related to their purchase as well as a $6 million minority
interest liability.
 
This change in
accounting increased depreciation and interest expense (to reflect the
locomotives as owned assets) and lowered lease expense.
 
The net effect to total railway
operating expenses and net income was not material.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the 2003
presentation.

2.
 
Investment in Conrail and Operations
Over Its Lines

Overview

Through
a limited liability company, Norfolk Southern and CSX Corporation (CSX) jointly
own Conrail Inc.
 
(Conrail), whose
primary subsidiary is Consolidated Rail Corporation (CRC), the major freight

K49

railroad
in the Northeast.
 
NS has a 58%
economic and 50% voting interest in the jointly owned entity, and CSX has the
remainder of the economic and voting interests.
 
From time to time, Norfolk Southern and CSX, as the indirect
owners of Conrail, may have to make capital contributions, loans or advances to
Conrail under the terms of the Transaction Agreement among NS, CSX and Conrail.

Norfolk
Southern's railroad subsidiary, NSR, operates as a part of its rail system the
routes and assets of Pennsylvania Lines LLC (PRR), a wholly owned subsidiary of
CRC, pursuant to operating and lease agreements.
 
CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT) operates the routes and
assets of another CRC subsidiary under comparable terms.

Operation of Conrail's Lines

The
June 1999 Operating Agreement between NSR and PRR governs substantially all
track assets operated by NSR and has an initial 25-year term, renewable at the
option of NSR for two five-year terms.
 

Payments under the Opera­ting Agreement are subject to adjustment every
six years to reflect changes in values.
 

NSR also has leased or subleased equipment for varying terms from
PRR.
 
Costs necessary to operate
and maintain the PRR assets, including leasehold improvements, are borne by
NSR.
 
NSR receives all freight
revenues on the PRR lines.

NSR
and CSXT also have entered into agreements with CRC governing other properties
that continue to be owned and operated by CRC (the Shared Assets Areas).
 
NSR and CSXT pay CRC a fee for joint
and exclusive access to the Shared Assets Areas.
 
In addition, NSR and CSXT pay, based on usage, the costs
incurred by CRC to operate the Shared Assets Areas.

Future
minimum lease payments due to PRR under the Operating Agreement and lease
agreements and to CRC under the Shared Assets Areas (SAA) agreements are as
follows:

Operating
lease expense related to the agreements, which is included in “Conrail rents
and services,” amounted to $478 million in 2003, $468 million in 2002 and
$467 million in 2001.

Conrail Corporate Reorganization

NS,
CSX and Conrail are jointly seeking to reorganize Conrail and establish direct
ownership and control by NSR and CSXT of PRR and NYC, respectively.
 
The proposed reorganization would
replace the operating agreements described above and allow NSR and CSXT to
directly own and operate PRR and NYC, respectively.
 
The reorganization would not involve the Shared Assets
Areas, and would have no effect on the competitive rail service provided in the
Shared Assets Areas.
 
Conrail would
continue to own, manage and operate the Shared Assets Areas as previously
approved by the Surface Transportation Board (STB).

K50

Consummation
of the reorganization requires a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS), the approval of the STB and filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
 
In addition, NS, CSX
and Conrail must obtain the consent of Conrail’s debt holders to carry out the
transaction and will obtain a valuation of PRR and of NYC.

In
2003, the IRS issued a ruling that the reorganization would qualify as a
tax-free distribution.
 
Also in
2003, the STB granted its authorization to carry out the reorganization,
subject to a condition requiring NS, CSX and Conrail to either:
 
(i) obtain the voluntary consent of the
Conrail debt holders; or (ii) propose further proceedings to determine whether
the terms offered to the Conrail debt holders are fair, just and
reasonable.
 
In 2004, NS, CSX and
Conrail intend to file registration statements on Form S-4 with the Securities
and Exchange Commission to allow a proposed exchange offer relating to
Conrail’s unsecured debt (see below).
 

In order to implement the reorganization approved by the IRS, the
companies have engaged an investment banking firm to provide a valuation.
 
The results of the valuation could
impact NS’ carrying amount of its investment in Conrail and the recording of
the corporate reorganization.

As
a part of the proposed reorganization, Conrail would undertake a restructuring
of its existing unsecured and secured public indebtedness.
 
There are currently two series of
unsecured public debentures with an outstanding principal amount of $800
million and 13 series of secured debt with an outstanding principal amount of
approximately $321 million.
 

It is currently contemplated that guaranteed debt securities of two
newly formed corporate subsidiaries of NSR and CSXT would be offered in a
58%/42% ratio in exchange for Conrail’s unsecured debentures.
 
Upon completion of the proposed
transaction, the new debt securities would become direct unsecured obligations
of NSR and CSXT, respectively, and would rank equally with all existing and
future senior unsecured debt obligations, if any, of NSR and CSXT.
 
These new debt securities will have
maturity dates, interest rates and principal and interest payment dates
identical to those of the respective series of Conrail’s unsecured debentures.
 
In addition, these new debt securities
will have covenants substantially similar to those of the publicly traded debt
securities of NS and CSX, respectively.

Conrail’s
secured debt and lease obligations will remain obligations of Conrail and are expected
to be supported by new leases and subleases which, upon completion of the
proposed transaction, would be the direct lease and sublease obligations of NSR
or CSXT.

NS,
CSX and Conrail are diligently working to complete all steps necessary to
consummate the Conrail corporate reorganization in 2004.
 
Upon consummation of the proposed
transaction, NS’ investment in Conrail will no longer include amounts related
to PRR and NYC.
 
Instead, the
assets and liabilities of PRR will be reflected in their respective line items
in NS’ Consolidated Balance Sheet, and any amounts due to PRR would be
extinguished.

Investment in Conrail

NS
is applying the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail in
accordance with APB Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for
Investments in Common Stock.”
 
NS
is amortizing the excess of the purchase price over Conrail's net equity using
the principles of purchase accounting, based primarily on the estimated remaining
useful lives of Conrail's depreciable property and equipment, including the
related deferred tax effect of the differences in tax and accounting bases for
certain assets.
 
At Dec. 31, 2003,
the difference between NS' investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail's
underlying net equity was $3.7 billion.

K51

NS'
consolidated balance sheet at Dec. 31, 2003, includes $35 million of
liabilities related to the Conrail transaction, principally for contractual
obligations to Conrail employees imposed by the Surface Transportation Board
when it approved the transaction.
 

Through Dec. 31, 2003, NS had paid $168 million of such costs.

Related-Party Transactions

NS
provides certain general and administrative support functions to Conrail, the
fees for which are billed in accordance with several service-provider
arrangements and totaled $7 million in 2003 and 2002 and $6 million in 2001.

“Conrail
rents and services” includes: (1) expenses for amounts due to PRR and CRC for
use by NSR of operating properties and equipment and operation of the Shared Assets
Areas and (2) NS' equity in the earnings of Con­rail, net of amortization.

A
significant portion of payments made to PRR is borrowed back from a subsidiary
of PRR.
 
Previously, these loans
were made under a demand note; however, in the first quarter of 2002, the
subsidiary of PRR exchanged this demand note for a new note due in 2032.
 
As a result, borrowings owed to the
subsidiary of PRR now comprise the noncurrent balance “Due to Conrail.”
 
The interest rate for these loans is
variable and was 1.7% at Dec. 31, 2003.
 

Upon consummation of the proposed reorganization, these loans would be
extinguished.
 
The current balance
“Due to Conrail” at Dec. 31, 2003, is composed of amounts related to expenses
included in “Conrail rents and services,” as discussed above.

Summary Financial Information - Conrail

The
following historical cost basis financial information should be read in
conjunction with Conrail's audited financial statements, included as Exhibit 99
to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Summarized Consolidated Statements of Income - Conrail

Note:
Conrail adopted SFAS No. 143, effective Jan. 1, 2003, and recorded a $40
million net adjustment for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting
on years prior to 2003.
 
NS
excluded this amount from its determination of equity earnings of Conrail
because an amount related to Conrail is included in NS’ cumulative effect
adjustment for SFAS No. 143.

Summarized Consolidated Balance Sheets - Conrail

Note:
Current assets include amounts due from NS and CSX totaling $136 million at
Dec. 31, 2003, and $158 million at Dec. 31, 2002.
 
Noncurrent assets include amounts due from NS and CSX
totaling $1,231 million at Dec. 31, 2003, and $892 million at Dec. 31,
2002.
 
Current liabilities include
amounts payable to NS and CSX totaling $5 million at Dec. 31, 2003, and $9
million at Dec. 31, 2002.

Other Income - Net

“Other income - net” includes the income
generated by the activities of NS' noncarrier subsidiaries as well as the costs
incurred by those subsidiaries in their operations.

“Other current assets” in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets includes prepaid interest of $50 million at Dec. 31, 2003, and
$46 million at Dec. 31, 2002, arising from corporate-owned life insurance
borrowings.

Income Taxes

Provision
for Income Taxes

Reconciliation
of Statutory Rate to Effective Rate

Total income taxes as reflected in the
Consolidated Statements of Income differ from the amounts computed by applying
the statutory federal corporate tax rate as follows:

Deferred
Tax Assets and Liabilities

Certain items are reported in different
periods for financial reporting and income tax purposes.
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recorded in recognition of these differences.

K54

The tax effects of temporary differences that
give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax
liabilities are as follows:

Except for amounts for which a valuation
allowance has been provided, management believes that it is more likely than
not that future taxable income will support the realization of the other
deferred tax assets.
 
The total
valuation allowance decreased $2 million in 2003 and increased $6 million in
both 2002 and 2001.

Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) Reviews

Consolidated federal income tax returns have
been examined and Revenue Agent Reports have been received for all years up to
and including 1999.
 
The favorable
resolution of prior years’ audits is reflected in the “Other – net” line of the
reconciliation of statutory rate to the effective rate, as shown above, and for
2003 comprised most of that line item.
 

The consolidated federal income tax returns for 2000 and 2001 are being
audited by the IRS.
 
In addition,
the 1998 through 2001 federal income tax returns of a tax credit investment
affiliate in which NS owns a minority interest are being audited by the IRS.
 
Management believes that adequate
provision has been made for any additional taxes and interest thereon that
might arise as a result of IRS examinations.

5.
 
Accounts Receivable

Since May 2000, NS has sold, through a
bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary, undivided ownership interests in
a pool of accounts receivable.
 
The
buyers have a priority collection interest in the entire pool of receivables
and, as a result, NS has retained credit risk to the extent the pool of
receivables exceeds the amount sold.
 

NS services and collects the receivables on behalf of the buyers;
however, no servicing asset or liability has been recognized because the
benefits of servicing are estimated to be just

K55

adequate to compensate NS for its
responsibilities.
 
Payments
collected from sold receivables can be reinvested in new accounts receivable on
behalf of the buyers.
 
Should NS'
credit rating drop below investment grade, the buyers have the right to
discontinue this reinvestment.

No accounts receivable have been sold under
this arrangement since the third quarter of 2003.
 
At Dec. 31, 2002, $30 million of accounts
receivable were sold, and therefore not included in “Accounts receivable, net”
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 

NS' retained interest, which is included in “Accounts receivable, net,”
is recorded at fair value using estimates of dilution based on NS' historical
experience.
 
These estimates are
adjusted regularly based on NS' actual experience with the pool, including
defaults and credit deterioration.
 

NS has historically experienced very low levels of default.
 
The fees associated with sales, which
are based on the buyers' financing costs, are included in “Other income – net”
(see Note 3).

NS' allowance for doubtful accounts was $7
million at Dec. 31, 2003, and $5 million at Dec. 31, 2002.

6.
 
Properties

Railway property includes $477 million at
Dec. 31, 2003 and $480 million at Dec. 31, 2002, of assets recorded pursuant to
capital leases.
 
Other property
includes the costs of obtaining rights to natural resources of $341 million at
Dec. 31, 2003 and 2002.

Impairment of Telecommunications Assets

In 2003, NS recorded an $84 million non-cash
reduction in the carrying value of certain telecommunications assets to
recognize their impaired value in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.
144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”
 
NS’ subsidiary, Thoroughbred Technology
and Telecommunications (T-Cubed), developed fiber optic infrastructure with
companies in the telecommunications industry.
 
This industry has been in a severe downturn and,
accordingly, T-Cubed monitored the carrying amount of these assets through
independent fair market value appraisals.
 

As a result of a deterioration in the long-term prospects for these
assets, an updated appraisal obtained in the fourth quarter indicated a
significant decline in their value.

Capitalized
Interest

Total interest cost incurred on debt in 2003,
2002 and 2001 was $509 million, $529 million and $570 million, respectively, of
which $12 million, $11 million and $17 million was capitalized.

Long-term Debt

K57

Each holder of a 2037 note may require NS to
redeem all or part of the note at face value, plus accrued and unpaid interest,
on May 1, 2004.
 
Should it be
necessary, NS has the ability and intent to refinance such notes properly presented.

The railroad equipment obligations and the
capitalized leases are secured by liens on the underlying equipment.

Certain lease obligations require the
maintenance of yen-denominated deposits, which are pledged to the lessor to
satisfy yen-denominated lease payments.
 

These deposits are included in “Other assets” on the balance sheet and
totaled $96 million at Dec. 31, 2003, and $86 million at Dec. 31, 2002.

Shelf
Registration

NS filed on Form S-3 a shelf registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Com­mission covering the issu­ance
of up to $1 billion of secur­ities.
 

As of Dec. 31, 2003, NS had issued a total of $550 million of notes
under this shelf registration.

Commercial
Paper and Credit Agreement

NS has the ability to issue commercial paper
backed by a $1 billion credit agreement that expires in 2006.
 
At Dec. 31, 2003, and Dec. 31, 2002, NS
had no commercial paper outstanding.
 

Any borrowings under the credit agreement are contingent on the
continuing effectiveness of the representations and warranties made at the
inception of the agreement.

Debt
Covenants

NS is subject to various financial covenants
with respect to its debt and under its credit agreement, including a minimum
net worth requirement, a maximum leverage ratio restriction and certain
restrictions on issuance of further debt.
 

At Dec. 31, 2003, NS was in compliance with all debt covenants.

9.
 
Lease Commitments

NS is committed under long-term lease agree­ments,
which expire on various dates through 2067, for equipment, lines of road and
other property.
 
The following
amounts do not include payments to PRR under the Operating Agreement and lease
agreements or to CRC under the SAA agreements (see Note 2).
 
Future minimum lease payments and
operating lease expense, other than to PRR and CRC, are as follows:

K58

Operating
Lease Expense

During 2000, NS entered into an operating
lease for 140 locomotives, which is renewable annually at NS' option, has a
maximum term of eight years and includes purchase options.
 
The lessor is a special-purpose entity
whose activities are limited to those incident to this particular
transaction.
 
As discussed in Note
1 under the heading “Required Accounting Changes,” NS has consolidated this
entity for reporting purposes as of Jan. 1, 2003.
 
For the periods prior to consolidation, the table above
includes operating lease expense related to this lease of $13 million in 2002
and $18 million in 2001.
 
If NS
does not renew the lease during the eight-year period or does not purchase the
locomotives at the end of the maximum lease term, it is liable for any
shortfall in the then fair value of the locomotives and a specified residual
value.
 
NS does not expect to be
required to make any payments under this provision.
 
As of Dec. 31, 2003, the maximum liability under this
provision, assuming NS chose not to renew the lease in 2004 and the then fair
value of the locomotives was zero, would be $106 million.

 Pensions and Other Postretirement
Benefits

Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries
have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans covering
principally salaried employees.
 

Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries also provide specified health
care and death benefits to eligible retired employees and their
dependents.
 
Under the present
plans, which may be amended or terminated at NS' option, a defined percentage
of health care expenses is covered, reduced by any deductibles, copayments,
Medicare payments and, in some cases, coverage provided under other group
insurance policies.

Pension Plan
Asset Management

Eleven investment firms manage the Company’s
defined benefit pension plan’s assets under investment guidelines approved by
the Board of Directors.
 

Investments are restricted to domestic fixed income securities, a
limited amount of international fixed income securities, domestic and
international equity

K59

investments and unleveraged exchange-traded
options and financial futures.
 

Limitations restrict investment concentration and use of certain
derivative instruments.
 
Fixed
income investments must have an average rating of “AA” or better and all fixed
income securities must be rated “A” or better except bond index funds.
 
Equity investments must be in liquid
securities listed on national exchanges.
 

No investment is permitted in the securities of Norfolk Southern
Corporation or its subsidiaries (except through commingled pension trust funds).
 
Investment managers’ returns are
expected to exceed selected market indices by prescribed margins.

The target asset allocation range for equity
is between 65% and 75% of the fund’s assets, with approximately 10% of the
fund’s assets allocated to international equity investments.
 
The asset allocation on Dec. 31, 2003,
was 25% in fixed income investments and 75% in equity investments, including 9%
in international equities.
 
This
compared to 33%, 67% and 9%, respectively, on Dec. 31, 2002.

The plan’s assumed future returns are based
principally on the asset allocation and on the historic returns for the plan’s
asset classes determined from both actual plan returns and, over longer time
periods, market returns for those asset classes.
 
As of Dec. 31, 2003, the plan had assets of $1.72 billion
and a current pension obligation of $1.49 billion.

Voluntary
Separation Program

Compensation and benefits expense in 2003
includes $107 million of costs related to a voluntary separation program
undertaken in the fourth quarter.
 

Through the program, 553 nonagreement employees were separated from
service, of which 314 retired under Norfolk Southern’s retirement plan.
 
The costs include $66 million for
separation payments and other benefits of the program and $41 million of costs
related to the pension and other benefit plans.

Medicare
Changes

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement,
and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed into law in December
2003.
 
The Act introduces a new
prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) as well as a federal
subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit
that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D.
 
Norfolk Southern believes that its
medical plan’s prescription drug benefit will qualify as actuarially equivalent
to Medicare Part D based on a review by the plan’s external prescription drug
administrator of the plan’s prescription drug benefit compared with the
prescription drug benefit that would be paid under Medicare Part D beginning in
2006.
 
Norfolk Southern has elected
to take into account these legislative changes in the measurement of its
postretirement benefit obligations in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Staff Position No. 106-1.
 

This resulted in a $45 million decrease in the end-of-year benefit
obligation with a corresponding decline in the unrecognized actuarial loss for
2003.
 
There was no effect on the
net benefit cost in 2003; however, the effects of the Act will be reflected in
the net benefit cost in 2004 and subsequent years.
 
Specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the
Act’s subsidy is pending, and that guidance, when issued, could require Norfolk
Southern to change information previously reported herein.

K60

Pension and
Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations and Plan Assets

Of the pension plans included above, the
unfunded pension plans were the only plans with an accumulated benefit
obligation in excess of plan assets.
 

These plans' accumulated benefit obligations were $89 million at Dec.
31, 2003, and $82 million at Dec. 31, 2002.
 
These plans' projected benefit obligations were $103 million
at Dec. 31, 2003, and $94 million at Dec. 31, 2002.
 
Because of the nature of such plans, there are no plan
assets.

Section 401(h) account transfers to NS, from
pension assets, were zero in 2003 and $18 million in 2002 as reimbursement for
medical payments for retirees.

During 2003, NS amended its retiree medical
plan to require participants retiring after Dec. 31, 2003 to share in any
increased medical costs.
 

Contributions will be determined annually and will increase at a

K61

rate similar to that of active nonagreement
employees.
 
The amendment decreased
the retiree medical benefit obligation by $51 million.

Pension and
Other Postretirement Benefit Costs Components

Pension
Assumptions

Pension and other postretirement benefit
costs are determined based on actuarial valuations that reflect appropriate
assumptions as of the measurement date, ordinarily the beginning of each
year.
 
The funded status of the
plans is determined using appropriate assumptions as of each year end.
 
A summary of the major assumptions
follows:

Health Care
Cost Trend Assumptions

For measurement purposes, increases in the
per capita cost of covered health care benefits were assumed to be 9% for 2004
and 8% for 2005.
 
It is assumed the
rate will decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of 5% for 2008 and remain at
that level thereafter.

K62

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a
significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements.
 
To illustrate, a one-percentage-point
change in the assumed health care cost trend would have the following effects:

Contributions
for Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

NS expects to contribute approximately $7
million to its pension plans and $42 million to its other postretirement
benefit plans in 2004.

Other
Postretirement Coverage

Under collective bargaining agreements, NS
and certain subsidiaries participate in a multi-employer benefit plan, which
provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to
eligible union employees.
 
Premiums
under this plan are expensed as incurred and amounted to $18 million in 2003,
$11 million in 2002 and $10 million

in 2001.

Section
401(k) Plans

Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries
provide Section 401(k) savings plans for employees.
 
Under the plans, NS matches a portion of employee
contributions, subject to applicable limitations.
 
Since 1999, NS has contributed newly issued shares of Common
Stock for its matching contributions.
 

NS' expenses under these plans were $12 million in 2003,
$12 million in 2002 and $11 million in 2001.

12.
 
Stock-Based Compensation

Under the stockholder-approved Long-Term
Incentive Plan (LTIP), a committee of nonemployee directors of the Board may
grant stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted shares and
performance share units (PSUs), up to a maximum of 88,025,000 shares of Norfolk
Southern Common Stock (Common Stock).
 

Of these shares, 5,000,000 were approved by the Board for issuance to
non-officer participants; as a broadly based issuance, stockholder approval was
not required.
 
Under the
Board-approved Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan (TSOP), the committee may grant
stock options up to a maximum of 6,000,000 shares of Common Stock.
 
Options may be granted for a term not
to exceed 10 years, but may not be exercised prior to the first anniversary of
the date of grant.
 
Options are
exercisable at the fair market value of Common Stock on the date of grant.

The LTIP also permits the payment – on a
current or a deferred basis and in cash or in stock – of dividend equivalents
on shares of Common Stock covered by options or PSUs in an amount commensurate
with dividends paid on Common Stock.
 

Tax absorption payments also are authorized in amounts estimated to
equal the federal and state income taxes applicable to shares of Common Stock issued
subject to a share retention agreement.

K63

Accounting
Method

As disclosed in Note 1, NS applies APB
Opinion 25 and related interpretations in accounting for awards made under the
plans.
 
Accordingly, grants of
PSUs, restricted shares, dividend equivalents, tax absorption payments and SARs
result in charges to net income, while grants of stock options have no effect
on net income.
 
Related
compensation costs were $29 million in 2003, $23 million in 2002 and
$20 million in 2001.
 
NS
recognized additional paid-in capital of $2 million in 2003, $6 million in 2002
and $1 million in 2001 related to the tax benefit generated by stock option
exercises.

Note 1 includes a table that illustrates the
effect on net income and earnings per share had NS applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee
compensation.
 
The pro forma
amounts include compensation costs calculated using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model, with average expected option lives of five years; average
risk-free interest rates of 2.8% in 2003, 4.6% in 2002 and 5.1% in 2001;
average stock-price volatilities of 33% in 2003, 32% in 2002 and 39% in 2001;
and dividend yields of zero in 2003, zero in 2002 and 2% in 2001.
 
These assumptions produced per-share
grant-date fair values of $6.60 in 2003, $8.26 in 2002 and

$5.48 in 2001.

Stock
Option Activity

Of the total options outstanding at Dec. 31,
2003, 36 million were vested and have a weighted-average exercise price of

There are no adjustments to “Net income” or
“Income from continuing operations” for the diluted earnings per share
computations.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The fair values of “Cash and cash
equivalents,” “Short-term investments,” “Accounts receivable” and “Accounts

financial instruments.
 
The fair
value of corporate-owned life insurance approximates carrying value.
 
The carrying amounts and estimated fair
values for the remaining financial instruments, excluding derivatives (see Note
16) and investments accounted for under the equity method in accordance with
APB Opinion No. 18, consisted of the following at Dec. 31:

K68

Quoted market prices were used to determine
the fair value of marketable securities; underlying net assets were used to
estimate the fair value of other investments.
 
The fair values of notes receivable are based on future
discounted cash flows.
 
The fair
values of debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or discounted cash
flows using current interest rates for debt with similar terms, company rating
and remaining maturity.

Carrying amounts of marketable securities
reflect unrealized holding gains of $1 million on Dec. 31, 2003 and 2002.
 
Sales of “available-for-sale”
securities were immaterial for the years ended Dec. 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.

16.
 
Derivative Financial Instruments

On Jan. 1, 2001, NS adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities” (SFAS No. 133), as amended by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative
Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities” (SFAS No. 138).
 
The Statements establish accounting and
reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities,
requiring that all derivatives be recognized in the financial statements as
either assets or liabilities and that they be measured at fair value.
 
Changes in fair value are recorded as
adjustments to the assets or liabilities being hedged in “Other comprehensive
income,” or in current earnings, depending on whether the derivative is
designated and qualifies for hedge accounting, the type of hedge transaction
represented and the effectiveness of the hedge.

NS uses derivative financial instruments to
reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its
overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
 
NS does not engage in the trading of derivatives.
 
Management has determined that its
derivative financial instruments qualify as either fair-value or cash-flow
hedges, having values that highly correlate with the underlying hedged
exposures, and has designated such instruments as hedging transactions.
 
Credit risk related to the derivative
financial instruments is considered to be minimal and is managed by requiring
high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements.

Diesel Fuel
Hedging

In the second quarter of 2001, NS began a
program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption.
 
The intent of the program is to assist
in the management of NS' aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations,
which can significantly affect NS' operating margins and profitability.
 
In order to minimize this risk, NS
instituted a continuous hedging strategy for a portion of its estimated future
fuel needs by entering into a series of swaps in order to lock in the purchase
prices of some of its diesel fuel.
 

Management has designated these derivative instruments as cash-flow hedges
of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows attributable to
fluctuations in diesel fuel prices.

Following is a summary of NS' diesel fuel
swaps:

K69

Hedges are placed each month by competitive
bid among selected counterparties.
 

The goal of this hedging strategy is to average fuel costs over an
extended period of time while minimizing the incremental cost of hedging.
 
The program provides that NS will not
enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months, and
that no more than 80% of NS' average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged
for each month within any 36-month period.
 
Diesel fuel costs represented 7%, 7% and 8% of NS' operating
expenses for the years ended Dec. 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

In 2001, NS also purchased eight monthly call
options at a strike price of 84 cents per gallon of Nymex No. 2 heating
oil.
 
The cost of the monthly
options, which expired serially through Dec. 31, 2001, was amortized as a
component of diesel fuel expense.
 

Because the price of diesel fuel did not reach the strike price at any
time during the period the options were outstanding, NS did not record any
benefit related to these transactions.

NS' fuel hedging activity resulted in a net
decrease in 2003 diesel fuel expenses of $59 million, a net decrease in 2002
diesel fuel expense of $10 million and a net increase in 2001 diesel fuel
expense of $8 million.
 
Ineffectiveness
related to the use of diesel fuel hedges in 2003, 2002 and 2001 was less than
$1 million for each year.

Interest
Rate Hedging

NS manages its overall exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floating-rate debt
instruments, and by entering into interest rate hedging transactions.
 
NS had $186 million, or 2.8%, and
$220 million, or 3.2%, of its fixed rate debt portfolio hedged at Dec. 31,
2003, and Dec. 31, 2002, respectively, using interest rate swaps that qualify
for and are designated as fair-value hedge transactions.
 
These swaps have been effective in
hedging the changes in fair value of the related debt arising from changes in
interest rates and, accordingly, there has been no impact on earnings resulting
from ineffectiveness associated with these derivative transactions.

Fair Values

The fair values of NS' diesel fuel derivative
instruments at Dec. 31, 2003 and 2002, were determined based upon current fair
market values as quoted by third party dealers.
 
Fair values of interest rate swaps were determined based
upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the
appropriate implied spot rate from the spot rate yield curve.
 
Fair value adjustments are noncash
transactions and, accordingly, are excluded from the Consolidated Statement of
Cash Flows.
 
“Accumulated other
comprehensive loss,” a component of “Stockholders' equity,” included $40
million (pretax) at Dec. 31, 2003, and $29 million (pretax) at Dec. 31, 2002,
both relating to an increase in the fair value of derivative fuel hedging
transactions that will terminate within 12 months.

The asset and liability positions of NS'
outstanding derivative financial instruments were as follows:

Discontinued Operations - Motor Carrier

On March 28, 1998, NS sold all the common
stock of North American Van Lines, Inc.
 

(NAVL), its motor carrier subsidiary.
 
Results in 2003 include an additional after-tax gain of $10
million, or 3 cents per share, that resulted from resolution of tax issues
related to the transaction.
 

Results in 2001 include an additional after-tax gain of $13 million, or

contained in the sales agreement.

Commitments and Contingencies

Lawsuits

Norfolk Southern and certain subsidiaries are
defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to
railroad operations.
 
When
management concludes that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and
the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, it is accrued through
a charge to expenses.
 
While the
ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent
on future developments, in management's opinion, the recorded liability is
adequate to cover the future payment of such liability.
 
However, the final outcome of any of
these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and unfavorable or
unexpected outcomes could result in accrual adjustments that could be
significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter.
 
Any adjustments to the recorded
liability will be reflected in expenses in the periods in which such
adjustments are known.

Casualty
Claims

NS is generally self-insured for casualty
claims.
 
Claims in excess of
self-insurance levels are insured up to excess coverage limits.
 
The casualty claims liability is
determined actuarially, based upon claims filed and an estimate of claims
incurred but not yet reported.
 

While the ultimate amount of claims incurred is dependent on future
developments, in management's opinion, the recorded liability is adequate to
cover the future payments of claims.
 

However, it is possible that the recorded liability may not be adequate
to cover the future payment of claims.
 

Adjustments to the recorded liability will be reflected in operating
expenses in the periods in which such adjustments are known.

Environmental
Matters

NS is subject to various jurisdictions'
environmental laws and regulations.
 

It is NS' policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is
probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably.
 
Claims, if any, against third parties for recovery of
cleanup costs incurred by NS are reflected as receivables in the balance sheet
and are not netted against the associated NS liability.
 
Environmental engineers regularly
participate in ongoing evaluations of all identified sites and in determining
any necessary adjustments to initial liability estimates.
 
NS also has established an
Environmental Policy Council, composed of senior managers, to oversee and
interpret its environmental policy.

NS' balance sheets included liabilities for
environmental exposures in the amount of $25 million at Dec. 31, 2003, and $29
million at Dec. 31, 2002, (of which $8 million was accounted for as a current
liability in each year).
 
At
Dec. 31, 2003, the liability represented NS' estimate of the probable
cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 113 identified
locations.
 
On that date, 10 sites
accounted for $12 million of the liability, and no individual site was
considered to be material.
 
NS
anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years; however,
some costs will be paid out over a longer period.

K71

At some of the 113 locations, certain NS
subsidiaries, usually in conjunction with a number of other parties, have been
identified as potentially responsible parties by the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) or similar state authorities under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or comparable state statutes,
which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs.

With respect to known environmental sites
(whether identified by NS or by the EPA or comparable state authorities),
estimates of NS' ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in
the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the
widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques, the likely
development of new cleanup technologies, the difficulty of determining in
advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential
participant's share of any estimated loss (and that participant's ability to
bear it), and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability.

The risk of incurring environmental liability
is inherent in the railroad business.
 

Some of the commodities in NS' traffic mix, particularly those
classified as hazardous materials, can pose special risks that NS and its
subsidiaries work diligently to minimize.
 

In addition, several NS subsidiaries own, or have owned, land used as
operating property, or which is leased and operated by others, or held for
sale.
 
Because environmental
problems may exist on these properties that are latent or undisclosed, there
can be no assurance that NS will not incur environmentally related liabilities
or costs with respect to one or more of them, the amount and materiality of
which cannot be estimated reliably at this time.
 
Moreover, lawsuits and claims involving these and
potentially other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to
arise from time to time.
 
The
resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on NS’ financial
condition, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter.

However, based on its assessment of the facts
and circumstances now known, management believes that it has recorded the
probable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which the
Corporation is aware.
 
Further,
management believes that it is unlikely that any identified matters, either
individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on NS'
financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Purchase
Commitments

NSR had outstanding purchase commitments of
approximately $166 million in connection with its 2004 capital program.
 
In addition, Norfolk Southern has
committed to purchase telecommunications services totaling $30 million
through 2006.

Change-In-Control
Arrangements

Norfolk Southern has compensation agreements
with officers and certain key employees that become operative only upon a
change in control of the Corporation, as defined in those agreements.
 
The agreements provide generally for
payments based on compensation at the time of a covered individual's
involuntary or other specified termination and for certain other benefits.

Guarantees

In a number of instances, NS and its
subsidiaries have agreed to indemnify lenders for additional costs they may
bear as a result of certain changes in laws or regulations applicable to their
loans.
 
Such changes may include
impositions or modifications with respect to taxes, duties, reserves, liquidity,
capital adequacy, special deposits, and similar requirements relating to
extensions of credit by, deposits with, or the assets or liabilities of such
lenders.
 
Similar provisions exist
in NS' accounts receivable sales program.

K72

The nature and timing of changes in laws or
regulations applicable to NS' financings are inherently unpredictable, and
therefore NS' exposure in connection with the foregoing indemnifications cannot
be quantified.
 
No liability has
been recorded related to these indemnifications.
 
In the case of one type of equipment financing, NSR's
Japanese leveraged leases, NSR may terminate the leases and ancillary
agreements if such a change-in-law indemnity is triggered.
 
Such a termination would require NSR to
make early termination payments that would not be expected to have a material
adverse effect on NS' financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

NS has indemnified parties in a number of
transactions for U.S.
 
income tax
withholding imposed as a result of changes in U.S.
 
tax law.
 
In all
cases, NS has the right to unwind the related transaction if the withholding
cannot be avoided in the future.
 

Because these indemnities would be triggered and are dependent upon a
change in the tax law, the maximum exposure is not quantifiable.
 
Management does not believe that it is
likely that it will be required to make any payments under these indemnities.

NS has outstanding warranty liabilities
primarily related to work performed at its locomotive facilities.
 
NS has recorded a reserve of $1 million
as of Dec. 31, 2003, and less than $2 million as of Dec. 31, 2002 for these
warranties.

As of Dec. 31, 2003, certain Norfolk Southern
subsidiaries are contingently liable as guarantors with respect to
$8 million of indebtedness of an entity in which they have an ownership
interest, the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis, due in 2019.
 
Six other railroads are also jointly
and severally liable as guarantors for this indebtedness.
 
No liability has been recorded related
to this guaranty.

NS is liable for any shortfall in the then
fair market value of certain leased locomotives and a specified residual value
for the locomotives if the leases are not renewed, as discussed in Note 9.

Equity Compensation Plan
Information (as of Dec. 31, 2003)

Norfolk
Southern Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)

Established on June 28, 1983, and approved by
the stockholders at their Annual Meetings on May 10, 1984, on May 11,
1995, and most recently on May 10, 2001, LTIP was adopted to promote the
success of Norfolk Southern by providing an opportunity for officers and other
key employees to acquire a proprietary interest in the Corporation.
 
On January 23, 2001, the Board of
Directors approved the issuance of an additional 5,000,000 shares of authorized
but unissued Common Stock under LTIP to participants who are not officers of
Norfolk Southern.
 
The issuance of
these shares was broadly-based, and stockholder approval of these shares was
not required.
 
Accordingly, this
portion of LTIP is included in the number of securities available for future
issuance for plans not approved by stockholders.
 
The Board also adopted an amended plan effective January 23,
2001, subject to stockholder approval, which included the reservation for
issuance of an additional 30,000,000 shares of authorized but unissued Norfolk
Southern Common Stock, with no more than 6 million of such additional shares to
be awarded as restricted shares or performance shares (including performance
share units earned as performance shares).
 
This amended plan was approved by stockholders on May 10,
2001, resulting in an aggregate of 74,878,604 shares of Common Stock authorized
for issuance under LTIP.

K76

Non-employee directors, officers and other
key employees residing in the United States or Canada are eligible for
selection to receive LTIP awards.
 

Under LTIP, the Performance-Based Compensation Committee (Committee) may
grant incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation
rights, restricted shares and performance share units (in addition, dividend
equivalents may be awarded for options and performance share units).
 
The Committee may establish such terms
and conditions for the awards as provided in the plan.

For options, the option price per share will
not be less than 100% of the fair market value of Norfolk Southern's Common
Stock on the effective date the option is granted.
 
All options are subject to a vesting period of at least one
year, and the term of the option will not exceed ten years.
 
LTIP specifically prohibits option
repricing without stockholder approval, except for capital adjustments.

Performance share units are performance-based
awards which are earned upon achievement of goals the Committee establishes at
the time of the grant for three equally weighted performance criteria approved
by the stockholders -- return on average invested capital, operating ratio, and
total return to NS stockholders as compared with the total return on all stocks
comprising the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index -- and the units may be
payable as shares of Norfolk Southern Common Stock or in cash.

Norfolk
Southern Corporation Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan

The Board adopted the Norfolk Southern
Corporation Thoroughbred Stock Option Plan (“TSOP”) on January 26, 1999, to
promote the success of Norfolk Southern by providing an opportunity for
nonagreement employees to acquire a proprietary interest in Norfolk Southern
and thereby to provide an additional incentive to nonagreement employees to
devote their maximum efforts and skills to the advancement, betterment, and
prosperity of Norfolk Southern and its stockholders.
 
The plan has not been approved by stockholders.
 
Six million shares of authorized but
unissued Common Stock were reserved for issuance under TSOP.

Active full-time nonagreement employees
residing in the United States or Canada are eligible for selection to receive
TSOP awards.
 
Under TSOP, the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors may grant nonqualified stock
options and may establish such terms and conditions as provided in the plan.

The option price per share will not be less
than 100% of the fair market value of Norfolk Southern's Common Stock on the
effective date the option is granted.
 

All options are subject to a vesting period of at least one year, and
the term of the option will not exceed ten years.
 
TSOP specifically prohibits option repricing without
stockholder approval, except for capital adjustments.

Norfolk
Southern Corporation Directors' Restricted Stock Plan

The Norfolk Southern Corporation Directors'
Restricted Stock Plan (“Plan”) was adopted on January 1, 1994, and is designed
to increase ownership of Norfolk Southern's Common Stock by its non-employee
directors so as to further align their ownership interest in Norfolk Southern
with that of stockholders.
 
The
Plan has not been approved by stockholders.
 
Currently, a maximum of 66,000 shares of Corporation Common
Stock may be granted under the Plan.
 

To make the grants to eligible directors, Norfolk Southern purchases,
through one or more subsidiary companies, the number of shares required in
open-market transactions at prevailing market prices, or makes such grants from
Common Stock already owned by one or more of Norfolk Southern's subsidiary
companies.

Only non-employee directors, who are not and
never have been employees of Norfolk Southern, are eligible to participate in
the Plan.
 
Upon becoming a
director, each eligible director receives a one-time

K77

grant of 3,000 restricted shares of Norfolk
Southern Common Stock.
 
No
individual member of the Board exercises discretion concerning the eligibility
of any director or the number of shares granted.

The restriction period begins on the date of
the grant and ends on the earlier of six months after the eligible director
ceases to be a director by reason of disability, retirement or death.
 
Directors will forfeit the right to
receive the restricted shares if they cease to serve as a director of Norfolk
Southern for reasons other than their disability, retirement or death.

Norfolk
Southern Corporation Safety Incentive Plan

The Norfolk Southern Corporation Safety
Incentive Plan (“SIP”) is designed to provide an additional incentive for
eligible agreement employees to work safely.
 
Under the plan, eligible employees who work without injury
during the year receive a safety award whose equivalent value is between five
and eight shares of Norfolk Southern Common Stock.
 
Awards for the 2003 calendar year were payable in shares of
Norfolk Southern Common Stock.
 
SIP
was amended effective Jan. 1, 2004, to provide for safety awards for calendar
years beginning on or after Jan.1, 2004, to be made in the form of stock units
payable in cash on the date of the award, so shares of Norfolk Southern Common
Stock will no longer be awarded.

SIP is broadly-based and has not been
approved by stockholders.
 
Shares
of Common Stock issued under its terms are not registered under the Securities
Act of 1933, pursuant to a no-action letter issued by the Securities and
Exchange Commission on November 20, 1992.
 

Accordingly, SIP does not define a specific amount of authorized shares
for issuance under the plan.
 
The
Board approved using up to 500,000 authorized but unissued shares for awards
under the plan, and the number of shares remaining under this authorization are
included in the number of securities available for future issuance for plans
not approved by shareholders.
