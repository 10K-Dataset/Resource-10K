General

Public Storage was organized in 1980.  Effective June 1, 2007, we reorganized Public Storage, Inc. into Public Storage (referred to herein as “the Company”, “the Trust”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), a Maryland real estate investment trust (“REIT”).

At December 31, 201


, our principal business activities are as follows:

(i)

Domestic Self-Storage

: We acquire, develop, own, and operate self-storage facilities which offer storage spaces for lease on a month-to-month basis, for personal and business use.  We are the largest owner and operator of

self-storage facilities in the United States (“U.S.”).  We have direct and indirect equity interests in 2,200 self-storage facilities (141

million net rentable square feet of space) located in 38 states within the U.S. operating under the “Public Storage” brand name.

(ii)

European Self-Storage

:  We have a 49% equity interest in Shurgard Europe, with an institutional investor owning the remaining 51% interest.  Shurgard Europe owns 18


self-storage facilities (10 million net rentable square feet of space) located in seven countries in Western Europe which operate under the “Shurgard” brand name and manages one facility we own in the United Kingdom.  We believe Shurgard Europe is the largest owner and operator of self-storage facilities in Western Europe.

(iii)

Commercial

:  We have a


% equity

interest in PS Business Parks, Inc. (“PSB”), a publicly held REIT which owns and operates 29.7 million net rentable square feet of commercial space.  We also wholly-own 1.4

million net rentable square feet of commercial space, substantially all of which is managed by PSB.

In addition, w

e

reinsure

policies against losses to goods stored by

customers

in our self-storage facilities,

sell

merchandise at o

ur self-storage facilities and manage

self-storage facilities owned by third-party owners.

For all periods presented herein, we have elected to be treated as a REIT, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.  As a REIT, we do not incur federal income tax on our REIT taxable income (generally, net rents and gains from real property, dividends, and interest) that is fully distributed each year (for this purpose, certain distributions paid in a subsequent year may be considered), and if we meet certain organizational and operational rules.  We believe we met these requirements in all periods presented herein, and we expect to continue to elect and qualify as a REIT.


We report annually to the SEC on Form 10-K, which includes financial statements certified by our independent registered public accountants.  We have also reported quarterly to the SEC on Form 10-Q, which includes unaudited financial statements with such filings.  We expect to continue such reporting.

On our website,

www.publicstorage.com

, we make available, free of charge, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K,

quarterly reports on Form 10-Q,

current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports and amendments are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.

Competition

We believe that storage customers generally store their goods within a five mile radius of their home or business

.  M

ost of our facilities compete with other nearby self-storage facilities

that use the same marketing channels and offer the same service as us.

Generally, o

ur competitors attract customers using the same marketing channels we use, including Internet advertising, signage, and banners.

A

s a result, competition is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates, rental income and operating expenses of our facilities.

While competition is significant, the self-storage industry remains fragmented in the U.S.  We believe that we own

approximately


%

of the aggregate self-sto

rage square footage in the U.S.,

and that collectively the five largest self-storage operators in the U.S. own approximately


%, with

all other self-storage space

owned by numerous private

regional and local operators.  We believe t

his market fragmentation enhances the advantage

of our brand name, as well as the

economies of scale

we enjoy with

approximately 71

% of our 2013 s

ame-store revenues in the 20 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (“MSA’s”, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) with the highest population levels.

Such

fragmentation also provides opportunities for us to acquire additional facilities; however, we compete with a wide variety of institutions and other investors who also view self-storage facilities as attractive investments.  The amount of capital available for real estate investments greatly influences the competition for ownership interests in facilities and, by extension, the yields that we can achieve on newly acquired investments.

Business Attributes

We believe that we possess several primary business attributes that permit us to compete effectively:

Centralized information networks:

Our centralized reporting and information network enables us to identify changing market conditions and operating trends a

s well as analyze customer data

and quickly change each of our individual properties’ pricing and promotion

s

on an automated basis.

Convenient shopping experience:

Customers can conveniently shop the space available at our facilities, reviewing attributes such as facility location, size, amenities such as climate-control, as well as pricing, and learn about ancillary businesses through the following marketing channels:

·

Our Website:

The online marketing channel continues to grow in prominence, with approximately


% of our move-ins in 201


sourced through our website, as compared to 36% in 2010.  In addition, we believe that many of our customers who directly call our call center, or who move-in to a facility on a walk-in basis, have already reviewed our pricing and space availability through our website.  We invest extensively in advertising on the Internet to attract potential customers, primarily through the use of search engines, and we regularly update and improve our website to enhance its productivity.

·

Our Call Center:

Our call center is staffed by skilled s

ales specialists.  Customers reach our call center by calling our advertised toll-free telephone referral number, (800) 44-


STORE

,

or

telephone numbers provided on

the Internet

.  We believe giving customers the option to interact with a call center agent, despite the higher marginal cost relative to an internet reservation, enhances our ability to close sales with potential storage customers.

·

Our Properties

:

Customers can also shop at any one of our facilities.  Property managers access the same information that is available on our website and to our call center agents, and can inform the customer of storage alternatives at that site or our other nearby storage facilities.  Property managers are extensively trained to maximize the conversion of such “walk in” shoppers into customers.

Economies of scale:

We are the largest provider of self-storage sp

ace in the U.S.  As of December

31, 201


, we

operated 2,200 self-storage

facilities

with over one

m

illion self-storage spaces

.  These facilities are generally loca

ted in major markets within 38 s

tates in the U.S.  The size and scope of our operations have enabled us to achieve high operating margins and a low level of administrative costs relative to revenues through the centralization of many functions, such as facility maintenance, employee compensation and benefits programs, revenue management, as well as the development and documentation of standardized operating procedures.  We also believe that our major market concentration provides managerial efficiencies stemming from having a large number of facilities in close proximity to each other.

We believe o

ur market share and concentration in major metropolitan centers makes various promotional and media programs more cost-beneficial for us than for our competitors.  As noted above,

approximately 71%

of our same-store revenues for 201


were in the 20 MSA’s with the highest population levels.  Our large market share and well-recognized brand name increases the likelihood that our facilities will appear prominently in unpaid search results for “self-storage”

on major online

search engines, and enhances the efficiency of our bidding for paid multiple-keyword advertising.  We can use television advertising in many markets, while most of our competitors cannot do so cost-effectively.

Brand name recognition:

We believe that the “Public Storage” brand name is the most recognized and established name in the self-storage industry in the U.S, due to our national reach in major markets in 38 states, and our highly visible facilities, with their distinct o

range colored doors and signage

.  We believe the “Public Storage” name is one of the most frequently used search terms used by customers using Internet search engines for self-storage.  We believe that the “Shurgard” brand, used by Shurgard Europe, is a similarly established and valuable brand in Europe.  We believe that the awareness of our brand name results in a high percentage of potential storage customers considering our facilities, relative to other operators.

Growth and Investment Strategies

Our growth strategies consist of: (i) improving the operating performance of our existing self-storage facilities, (ii) acquiring more facilities, (iii) developing new self-storage space, (iv) participating in the growth of commercial facilities, primarily through our investment in PSB, and (v) participating in the growth of Shurgard Europe.  While our long-term strategy includes each of these elements, in the short run the level of growth in our asset base in any period is dependent upon the cost and availability of capital, as well as the relative attractiveness of investment alternatives.

Improve the operating performance of existing facilities:

We seek to increase the net cash flow

of

our existing self-storage facilities by a) regularly analyzing our call volume, reservation activity,

Internet activity,

move-in/move-out rates and other market supply and demand factors and responding by adjusting our marketing activities and rental rates, b) attempting to maximize revenues through evaluating the appropriate balance between occupancy, rental rates, and promotional discounting and c) controlling operating costs.  We believe that our property management personnel, systems, our convenient shopping options for the customer, and our media

and Internet

advertising programs will continue to enhance our ability to meet these goals.


Acquire properties owned or operated by others in the U.S.:

We seek to capitalize on the fragmentation of the self-storage business through acquiring attractively priced, well-located existing self-storage facilities.  We believe our presence in and knowledge of substantially all of the major markets in the U.S. enhances our ability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities.  Data on the rental rates and occupancy levels of our existing facilities provide us an advantage in evaluating the potential of acquisition opportunities.

The level of third-party acquisition opportunities available depends upon many factors, such as the motivation of potential sellers to liquidate their investments

,

as well as the financing available to self-storage owners.  We decide whether to pursue acquisition opportunities based upon many factors including our opinion as to the potential for future growth, the quality of construction and location,

the cash flow we expect from the facility when operated on our platform

and our yield expectations.

During 2013, we acquired 121 facilities from third parties for approximately $1.2 billion, primarily through

large

portfolio

acquisitions.  This volume was higher than in the preceding six years combined

.

We will continue to seek to acquire properties in 201


.

While there were more sellers of self-storage facilities in 2013 due at least in part, we believe, to higher

values

and robust cash flows

of self-storage facilities

, it is uncertain as to the level of third party acquisitions we will complete in 2014.

Develop new self-storage space:

The development of new self-storage locations and the expansion of existing self-storage facilities has been

an important source of growth.

Since the beginning of 2013, we have

expanded our development efforts due in part to the significant increase in prices being paid for existing facilities, in many cases well above the cost of developi

ng new facilities.  At December

31, 201


, we had a development pipeline of projects to expand existing self-storage facilitie

s and develop new self-storage facilities, which will add approximately 1.8 million net rentable square feet of self-storage space.  The aggregate cost of these projects is estimated at $196 million, of which $52

million had been incurred at December 31, 201


, and the remaining costs will be incurred principally in 201


.  Some of these projects are subject to significant contingencies such as entitlement approval.  We expect to continue to seek additional development projects; however, due to the difficulty in finding projects that meet our risk-adjusted yield expectations, as well as the difficulty in obtaining building permits for self-storage activities in certain municipalities, it is uncertain as to how much additional development we will undertake in the future.

Participate in the growth of commercial facilities primarily through our ownership in PS Business Parks, Inc.:

Our investment in PSB provides us diversification into another asset type

.

PSB is a stand-alone public company traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

During the year ended December 31, 2013, we increased our

investment

in PSB by acquiring 1,356,748 shares of PSB common stock in open-market transactions and directly from PSB, for an aggregate cost of $105.0 million.

Over the past three years, PSB has been able to grow its portfolio through acquisitions.  In 201


and 201


, PSB acquired an aggregate total

of 6.8 million net rentable square feet of commercial space for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $605.


million

.  In

2013, PSB acquired 1.5 million net rentable square feet for an aggregate purchase price of $115.6

million.

As of December 31, 201


, PSB owned and operated approximately

29.7

million net rentable square feet of commercial space, and had an enterprise value of approximately $

3.


billion (based upon the trading price of PSB’s common stock combined with the liquidation value of its debt and preferred stock as of December 31, 201


).

Participate in the growth of European self-storage through ownership in Shurgard Europe:

We believe S

hurgard Europe is the largest self-storage

company in Western Europe.  It

owns and operates 18


facilities with approximately 10 million net rentable square feet in:  France (principally Paris), Sweden (principally Stockholm), the United Kingdom (principally London), the Netherlands, Denmark (principally Copenhagen), Belgium and Germany.  We own 49% of Shurgard Europe, with the other 51% owned by a large U.S. institutional investor.

Customer awareness and availability of self-storage is significantly lower in

Europe

than in the U.S.

However, w

ith more awareness and product supply, we believe there is potential for increased demand for storage space in Europe.  In the long run, we believe Shurgard Europe could capitalize on


potential increased demand through the development of new facilities or, to a lesser extent, acquiring existing facilities.

Financing of the Company’s Growth Strategies

Overview of financing strategy

:  In order to grow our asset base, access to capital is important.  In general, we seek to finance our investment activities with retained cash flow and the issuance of preferred and common securities when market conditions are favorable, using bank debt as bridge financing when market conditions are not favorable.

Permanent capital

:

We

have generally been able to raise capital

through the issuance of preferred securities

at an attractive cost of capital relative to the issuance of our common shares

and, as a result, issuances of common shares have been minimal over the past several years

.  During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we issued approximately $725.0 million and $1.7 billion, respectively, of preferred securities.  Currently, market conditions are much less favorable, with market coupon rates for our most recently issued series

of preferred securities trading

at approximately 6.5% (as compared to 5.2% for the preferred securities we issued in the first quarter of 2013).

We believe

that market coupon rates for a new issuance of our preferred securities would need to be in the area of 6.

5%

and the amount of capital we could raise would most likely be much lower than what we raised in the first quarter of 2013.

Bridge financing

:  We have in the past used our $300 million revolving line of credit as temporary “bridge” financing and repaid such borrowings with permanent capital.  At December 31, 2013, we had approximately $50.1 million outstanding on our line of credit (none as of February 2


, 2014).  On December 2, 2013, we borrowed $700 million from Wells Fargo pursuant to a term loan due in one year, in order to fund our acquisitions of self-storage facilities in the fourth quarter of 2013.

See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources” for more information.

Borrowing through mortgage loans or senior

debt

:  Even though preferred securities have a higher coupon rate than long-term debt, we have generally not issued conventional debt due to refinancing risk

associated with debt

and other benefits of preferred securities described in more detail in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations –

Liquidity and Capital Resources.

”

We have broad powers to borrow in furtherance of our objectives without a vote of our shareholders.  These powers are subject to a limitation on unsecured borrowings in our Bylaws described in “Limitations on Debt” below.

Our senior debt has an “A” credit rating by Standard and Poor’s.  Notwithstanding our desire to continue to meet our capital needs with permanent capital,

we believe

this high rating, combined with our low level of debt, could allow us to issue a significant amount of unsecured debt at lower interest rates than the coupon on preferred securities if we

chose to

.

Assumption of Debt:

Substantially all of our

mortgage

debt

outstanding was assumed in connection

with real estate acquisitions

.

When we have assumed debt in the past, we

did so because the

nature of the loan terms did not allow prepayment, or a prepayment penalty made it economically disadvantageous to prepay.

Issuance of securities in exchange for property

:

We have issued both our common and preferred securities in exchange for real estate and other investments in the past.  Future issuances will be dependent upon our financing needs and capital market conditions at the time, including the market prices of our equity securities.

Joint Venture financing:

We have used joint ventures with institutional investors and we may form additional joint ventures in the future.


Disposition of properties

:  Generally, we have disposed of self-storage facilities only when compelled to do so through condemnation proceedings.  We do not presently intend to sell any significant number of self-storage facilities in the future, though there can be no assurance that we will not.

Investments in Real Estate and Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities

Investment Policies and Practices with respect to our investments

: Following are our investment practices and policies which, though we do not anticipate any significant alteration, can be changed by our Board of Trustees without a shareholder vote:

·

Our investments primarily consist of direct ownership of self-storage facilities (the nature of our self-storage facilities is described in Item 2, “Properties”), as well as partial interests in entities that own self-storage facilities.

·

Our partial ownership interests primarily reflect general and limited partnership interests in entities that own self-storage facilities that are managed by us under the “Public Storage” brand name in the U.S., as well as storage facilities managed in Europe under the “Shurgard” brand name which are owned by Shurgard Europe.

·

Additional acquired interests in real estate (other than the acquisition of properties from third parties) will include common equity interests in entities in which we already have an interest.

·

To a lesser extent, we have interests in existing commercial properties (described in Item 2, “Properties”), containing commercial and industrial rental space, primarily through our investment in PSB.

Facilities Owned by Subsidiaries

In addition to our direct ownership of

2,172

self-storage facilities in the U.S. and one self-storage facility in London, England at December 31, 201


, we have controlling indirect interests in entities that own


self-storage facilities in the U.S.  Due to our controlling interest in each of these entities, we consolidate the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of these entities in our financial statements.

Facilities Owned by Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities

At December 31, 201


, we

also

had ownership interests in entities that we do not control or consolidate

.  These entities include

PSB, Shurgard Europe (discussed above), and various limited partnerships that own an aggregate of


self-storage facilities.  These entities are referred to collectively as the “Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities.”

PSB, which files financial statements with the SEC, and Shurgard Europe, have debt and other obligations that we do not consolidate in our financial statements.  None of the other Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities have significant amounts of debt or other obligations.  See Note 4 to our December 31, 201


financial statements for further disclosure regarding the assets, liabilities and operating results of the Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities.

Limitations on Debt

Without the consent of holders of the various series of Senior Preferred Shares, we may not take any action that would result in our “Debt Ratio” exceeding 50%.  “Debt Ratio”, as defined in the related governing documents, represents generally the ratio of debt to total assets before accumulated depreciation and amortization on our balance sheet, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  As of December 31, 201


, the Debt Ratio was approximately


%.


Our bank and senior unsecured debt agreements contain various customary financial covenants, including limitations on the level of indebtedness and the prohibition of the payment of dividends upon the occurrence of defined events of default.  We believe we

were in compliance with

each of

these covenants as of December

31, 201


.

Employees

We have approximately 5,


00 employees in the U.S. at December 31, 201


which are engaged

primarily in property operations.

Seasonality

We experience minor seasonal fluctuations in the

demand for

self-storage

space, with demand and rates generally

higher in the summer months than in the winter months.  We believe that these fluctuations result in part from increased moving activity during the summer months.

Insurance

We have historically carried customary property, earthquake, general liability, employee

medical insurance

and workers compensation coverage through internationally recognized insurance carriers, subject to customary levels of deductibles.  The aggregate limits on these policies of approximately $


million for property losses and $


million for general liability losses are higher than estimates of maximum probable loss

es

that could occur from individual catastrophic events determined in recent engineering and actuarial studies; however, in case of multiple catastrophic events, these limits could be exhausted.

We reinsure a program that provides insurance to our

customers

from an independent third-party insurer.  This program covers tenant claims for losses to goods stored at our facilities as a result of specific named perils (earthquakes are not covered by this program), up to a maximum limit of $

5,000

per storage unit.  We reinsure all risks in this program, but purchase insurance from an independent third party i

nsurance company for aggregate claims between $

5.0

million and $

15.0

million per occurrence.

We are subject to licensing requirements and regulations in several states.  At

December



, 2013, there were approximately

759,000

certificate

s

held by our self-storage

customers

, representing aggregate coverage of approximately $

1.7

billion.


ITEM 1A.

Risk Factors

In addition to the other information in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should consider the risks described below that we believe may be material to investors in evaluating the Company.  This section contains forward-looking statements, and in considering these statements, you should refer to the qualifications and limitations on our forward-looking statements that are described in

Forward Looking Statements

at the beginning of Item 1.

We have significant exposure to real estate risk.

Since our business consists primarily of acquiring and operating real estate, we are subject to the risks related to the ownership and operation of real estate that can adversely impact our business and financial condition.  These risks include the following:

Natural disasters or terrorist attacks could cause damage to our facilities, resulting in increased costs and reduced revenues.

Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, or terrorist attacks could cause significant damage and require significant repair costs, and make facilities temporarily uninhabitable, reducing our revenues.  Damage and business interruption losses could exceed the aggregate limits of our insurance coverage.  In addition, because we self-insure a portion of our risks, losses below a certain level may not be covered by insurance.   See Note 13 to our December 31, 201


financial statements for a description of the risks of losses that are not covered by third-party insurance contracts.  We

may not have sufficient insurance coverage for losses caused by a terrorist attack, or such insurance may not be maintained, available or cost-effective.  In addition, significant natural disasters, terrorist attacks, threats of future terrorist attacks, or resulting wider armed conflicts could have negative impacts on the U.S. economy, reducing storage demand and impairing our operating results.

Operating costs could increase

.  We could be subject to increases in insurance premiums, increased or new property tax assessments or other taxes, repair and maintenance costs, payroll, utility costs, workers compensation, and other operating expenses due to various factors such as inflation, labor shortages, commodity and energy price increases.

The acquisition of existing properties is subject to risks that may adversely affect our growth and financial results.

We have acquired material amounts of self-storage facilities from third parties in the past, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.

We face significant competition for suitable acquisition properties from other real estate investors.  As a result, we may be unable to acquire additional properties we desire or the purchase price for desirable properties may be significantly increased.

Failures or unexpected circumstances in integrating newly acquired properties into our operations or circumstances we did not detect during due diligence, such as environmental matters, needed repairs or deferred maintenance, or the effects of increased property tax following reassessment of a newly-acquired property, as well as the general risks of real estate investment, could jeopardize realization of the anticipated earnings from an acquisition.

Development of self-storage facilities can subject us to risks.

At December 31, 201


, we have a pipeline of development projects

totaling $196

million (subject to contingencies), and we expect to continue to seek additional development projects.  There are significant risks involved in developing self-storage facilities, such as delays or cost increases due to changes in or failure to meet government or regulatory requirements, weather issues, unforeseen site conditions, or personnel problems.  Self-storage space is generally not pre-leased, and rent-up of newly developed space can be delayed or ongoing cash flow yields can be reduced due to competition, reductions in storage demand, or other factors.

There is significant competition among self-storage facilities and from other storage alternatives

.  Most of our properties are self-storage facilities, which generated most of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 201


.  Competition in the local market areas in which many of our properties are located is significant and has affected our occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses.  If development of self-storage facilities by other operators were to increase, due to increases in availability of funds for investment or other reasons, competition with our facilities could intensify.


We may incur significant liabilities from

environmental contamination

or moisture infiltration

.   Existing or future laws impose or may impose liability on us to clean up environmental contamination on or around properties that we currently or previously owned

or operated, even if we were not

responsible for or aware of the environmental contamination or even if such environmental contamination occurred prior to our involvement with the property.  We have conducted preliminary environmental assessments on most of our properties, which have not identified material liabilities.  These assessments, commonly referred to as “Phase 1 Environmental Assessments,” include an investigation (excluding soil or groundwater sampling or analysis) and a review of publicly available information regarding the site and other nearby properties.

We are also subject to potential liability relating to moisture infiltration, which can result in mold or other damage to our or our

customers

’ property, as well as potential health concerns.  When we receive a complaint or otherwise become aware that an air quality concern exists, we implement corrective measures and seek to work proactively with our

customers

to resolve issues, subject to our contractual limitations on liability for such claims.

We are not aware of any

environmental contamination

or moisture infiltration related liabilities that could be material to our overall business, financial condition, or results of operation.  However, we may not have detected all material liabilities, we could acquire properties with material undetected liabilities, or new conditions could arise or develop in the future.   Settling any such liabilities could negatively impact our earnings and cash available for distribution to shareholders, and could also adversely affect our ability to sell, lease, operate, or encumber affected facilities.

We incur liability from tenant and employment-related claims.

From time to time we have to make monetary settlements or defend actions or arbitration (including class actions) to resolve tenant or employment-related claims and disputes.

Economic conditions can adversely affect our business, financial condition, growth and access to capital.

Our revenues and operating cash flow can be negatively impacted by reductions in employment and population levels, household and disposable income, and other general economic factors that lead to a reduction in demand for rental space in each of the markets in which we operate our properties.

Our ability to issue preferred shares or access other sources of capital, such as borrowing, has been in the past, and may in the future be, adversely affected by challenging market conditions.  The issuance of perpetual preferred securities historically has been a significant source of capital to grow our business.

I

f we were unable to issue preferred shares or borrow at reasonable rates, prospective earnings growth through expanding our asset base

c

ould be limited.

We have exposure to European operations through our ownership in Shurgard Europe.

As a result of our ownership of 49% of the equity in Shurgard Europe

’s equity

with a book value of

$424

.1 million

at December 31, 201


, and our loan to Shurgard Europe

totaling $428.1

million at December 31, 201


, we are exposed to additional risks related to the ownership and operation of international businesses that may adversely impact our business and financial results, including the following:

·

Currency risks:

Currency fluctuations can impact the fair value of our

equity

investment in, and loan to Shurgard Europe, as well as the related income we receive

as well as future repatriation of cash

.

·

Legislative, tax, and regulatory risks:

We are subject to complex foreign laws and regulations related to permitting and land use, the environment, labor, and other areas, as well as income, property, sales, value added and employment tax laws.  These laws can be difficult to apply or


interpret and can vary in each country or locality, and are subject to unexpected changes in their form and application due to regional, national, or local political uncertainty and other factors.  Such changes, or Shurgard’s failure to comply with these laws, could subject it to penalties or other sanctions, adverse changes in business processes, as well as potentially adverse income tax, property tax, or other tax burdens.

·

Impediments to capital repatriation could negatively impact the realization of our investment in Shurgard Europe:

Laws in Europe and the U.S. may create, impede or increase

our

cost to

repatriate capital or earnings from

Shurgard Europe.

·

Risks of collective bargaining and intellectual property:

Collective bargaining, which is prevalent in certain areas in Europe, could negatively impact Shurgard Europe’s labor costs or operations.

·

Potential operating and individual country risks:

Economic slowdowns or extraordinary political or social change in the countries in which it operates

have posed, and could continue to

pose

,

challenges or result in future reductions of Shurgard Europe’s

operating cash flows

.

·

Impediments of Shurgard Europe’s joint venture structure:

Shurgard Europe’s significant decisions, involving activities such as borrowing money, capital contributions, raising capital from third parties, as well as selling or acquiring significant assets, require the consent of our joint venture partner.  As a result, Shurgard Europe may be precluded from taking advantage of opportunities that we would find attractive.  In addition, we could be unable to separately pursue such opportunities due to certain market exclusivity provisions of the Shurgard Europe joint venture agreement, and our 49% equity investment may not be easily sold or readily accepted as collateral by potential lenders to Public Storage due to the joint venture structure.

·

Risks related to Shurgard Europe’s Debt:

Shurgard Europe has a term loan from a bank (the “Bank Loan”) with a balance of approximately €107.5 million ($148.0 million) at December 31, 2013 maturing in November 2014 and a loan due to us (the “Shareholder Loan”) totaling €311.0 million ($428.1 million) at December 31, 2013.  On January 28, 2014, our joint venture partner in Shurgard Europe acquired 51% of the Shareholder Loan at face value, using the proceeds from a bank loan (the “JV Partner Loan”), and the maturity date of the Shareholder Loan was extended to April 2019.  The JV Partner Loan matures in two years and is collateralized with our joint venture partner’s interests in the Shareholder Loan and

their interest

in Shurgard Europe.  Shurgard Europe will seek to refinance the Bank Loan.  If Shurgard Europe is not able to refinance its debt due to a constrained credit market, negative operating trends or other reasons, our equity investment in Shurgard Europe could be negatively impacted.

The Hughes Family could control us and take actions adverse to other shareholders.

At December 31, 201


, B. Wayne Hughes, our former Chairman, and his family, which includes two members of the board of trustees (the “Hughes Family”) owned

approximately 15.8%

of our aggregate outstanding common shares.  Our declaration of trust permits the Hughes Family to own up to 35.66% of our outstanding common shares while it generally restricts the ownership by other persons and entities to 3% of our outstanding common shares.  Consequently, the Hughes Family may significantly influence matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders, including electing trustees, amending our organizational documents, dissolving and approving other extraordinary transactions, such as a takeover attempt, resulting in an outcome that may not be favorable to other shareholders.

Takeover attempts or changes in control could be thwarted, even if beneficial to shareholders.


In certain circumstances, shareholders might desire a change of control or acquisition of us, in order to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our shares or for other reasons.  However, the following could prevent, deter, or delay such a transaction:

·

Provisions of Maryland law may impose limitations that may make it more difficult for a third party to negotiate or effect a business combination transaction or control share acquisition with Public Storage.  Currently, the Board has opted not to subject the Company to these provisions of Maryland law, but it could choose to do so in the future without shareholder approval.

·

To protect against the loss of our REIT status due to concentration of ownership levels, our declaration of trust generally limits the ability of a person, other than the Hughes Family or “designated investment entities” (each as defined in our declaration of trust), to own, actually or constructively, more than 3% of our outstanding common shares or 9.9% of the outstanding shares of any class or series of preferred or equity shares, in either case unless a specific exemption is granted by our board of trustees.  These limits could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company not approved by our board of trustees.

·

Similarly, current provisions of our declaration of trust and powers of our Board of Trustees could have the same effect, including (1) limitations on removal of trustees in our declaration of trust, (2) restrictions on the acquisition of our shares of beneficial interest, (3) the power to issue additional common shares, preferred shares or equity shares on terms approved by the Board without obtaining shareholder approval, (4) the advance notice provisions of our bylaws and (5) the Board’s ability under Maryland law, without obtaining shareholder approval, to implement takeover defenses that we may not yet have and to take, or refrain from taking, other actions that could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a transaction or a change in control.

If we failed to qualify as a REIT, we would have to pay substantial income taxes.

REITs are subject to a range of complex organizational and operational requirements.  A qualifying REIT does not generally incur federal income tax on its net income that is distributed to its shareholders.  Our REIT status is also dependent upon the ongoing REIT qualification of our affiliate, PSB, as a REIT, as a result of our substantial ownership interest in that company. We believe that we are organized and have operated as a REIT and we intend to continue to operate to maintain our REIT status.

There can be no assurance that we qualify or will continue to qualify as a REIT.  The highly technical nature of the REIT rules, the ongoing importance of factual determinations, the possibility of unidentified issues in prior periods or changes in our circumstances, all could adversely affect our ability to comply.  For any taxable year that we fail to qualify as a REIT and statutory relief provisions did not apply, we would be taxed at the regular federal corporate rates on all of our taxable income and we also could be subject to penalties and interest.  We would generally not be eligible to seek REIT status again until the fifth taxable year after the first year of

our

failure to qualify. Any taxes, interest and penalties incurred would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders or for reinvestment and would adversely affect our earnings, which could have a material adverse effect.

We may pay some taxes, reducing cash available for shareholders.

Even if we qualify as

a

REIT for federal income

tax

purposes, we may be subject to some federal, foreign, state and local

taxes on our

income and property.  Since January 1, 2001, certain corporate subsidiaries of the Company have elected to be treated as “taxable REIT subsidiaries” for federal income tax purposes, and are taxable as regular corporations and subject to certain limitations on intercompany transactions.  If tax authorities determine that amounts paid by our taxable REIT subsidiaries to us are greater than what would be paid under similar arrangements among unrelated parties, we could be subject


to a 100% penalty tax on the excess payments, and ongoing intercompany arrangements could have to change, resulting in higher ongoing tax payments.  To the extent the Company is required to pay federal, foreign, state or local taxes or federal penalty taxes

due to existing laws or changes thereto

, we will have less cash available for distribution to shareholders.

We are heavily dependent on computer systems, telecommunications and the Internet to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business and security breaches or a failure of such networks, systems or technology could adversely impact our business and customer relationships.

We are heavily dependent upon automated information technology and Internet commerce, with approximately half of our new

customers

coming from the telephone or over the Internet, and the nature of our business involves the receipt and retention of personal information about our customers.  We centrally manage significant components of our operations with our computer systems, including our financial information, and we also rely extensively on third-party vendors to retain data, process transactions and provide other systems services.  These systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer worms, viruses and other destructive or disruptive security breaches and catastrophic events.

As a result, our operations could be severely impacted by a natural disaster, terrorist attack or other circumstance that resulted in a significant outage at our systems or those of our third party providers, despite our use of back up and redundancy measures.  Further, viruses and other related risks could negatively impact our information technology processes.

Our or our customers’ confidential information could be compromised or misappropriated, due to a breach of our network security.  Such data security breaches as well as system disruptions and shutdowns could result in additional costs to repair or replace such networks or information systems and possible legal liability, including government enforcement actions and private litigation.

In addition, our customers could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information, which could cause them to discontinue leasi

ng our self-storage facilities.

Such events could lead to lost future

revenue

s and adversely affect our results of operations.

We have no ownership interest in Canadian self-storage facilities owned or operated by the Hughes Family.

At December 31, 201


, the Hughes Family had ownership interests in, and operated, 5


self-storage facilities in Canada (the “Canadian Self-Storage Facilities”).  These facilities are operated under the “Public Storage” tradename, which we license to the Hughes Family for use in Canada on a royalty-free, non-exclusive basis.  We have a right of first refusal, subject to limitations, to acquire the stock or assets of the corporation engaged in the operation of the Canadian Self-Storage Facilities if the Hughes Family or the corporation agrees to sell them.  However, we do not benefit from profits or potential appreciation in value of the Canadian Self-Storage Facilities because we have no ownership interest in these facilities.  We do not operate in the Canadian self-storage market, and have no plans to do so.  However, if we choose to do so without acquiring the Hughes Family interests in the Canadian Self-Storage Facilities, we may have to share the use of the “Public Storage” name in Canada with the Hughes Family, unless we are able to terminate the license agreement.

Through our subsidiaries, we reinsure risks relating to loss of goods stored by

customers

in the Canadian Self-Storage Facilities.  During

the years

ended December 31, 201

3, 2012 and 2011

, we received

$0.


million, $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively, in reinsurance premiums attributable to the

Canadian Self-Storage Facilities.  Because our right to earn these premiums may be qualified, there is no assurance that these premiums will continue.


We are subject to laws and governmental regulations and actions that require us to incur compliance costs affecting our operating results and financial condition.

Our business is subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies including those imposed by the SEC, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and New York Stock Exchange, as well as applicable labor laws. Although we have policies and procedures designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations, failure to comply with the various laws and regulations may result in civil and criminal liability, fines and penalties, increased costs of compliance, restatement of our financial statements and could also affect the marketability of our real estate facilities.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as well as other healthcare reform legislation recently passed or being considered by Congress and state legislatures (collectively, the “Healthcare Legislation”) are expected to impact our business beginning in 2014.  Based on its current form, we believe that the Healthcare Legislation will at least moderately increase our costs; however, there could be a significant further negative impact to our costs and business depending upon how the various governmental agencies design and implement the specific regulations to implement the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the nature of further legislation that may be passed at the national and local level, and other factors.

In response to current economic conditions or the current political environment or otherwise, laws and regulations could be implemented or changed in ways that adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, such as legislation that could facilitate union activity or that would otherwise increase operating costs.

All our properties must comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and with related regulations and similar state law requirements, as well as various real estate and zoning laws and regulations, which are subject to change and could become more costly to comply with in the future.  Compliance with these requirements can require us to incur significant expenditures, which would reduce cash otherwise available for distribution to shareholders.  A failure to comply with these laws could lead to fines or possible awards of damages to individuals affected by the non-compliance.  Failure to comply with these requirements could also affect the marketability of our real estate facilities.

Our tenant insurance business is subject to governmental regulation which could reduce our profitability or limit our growth.

We hold Limited Lines Self-Service Storage Insurance Agent licenses from a number of individual state Departments of Insurance and are subject to state governmental regulation and supervision.  Our continued ability to maintain these Limited Lines Self-Service Storage Insurance Agent licenses in the jurisdictions in which we are licensed depends on our compliance with related rules and regulations.  The regulatory authorities in each jurisdiction generally have broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals, to promulgate, interpret, and implement regulations, and to evaluate compliance with regulations through periodic examinations, audits and investigations of the affairs of insurance

agents.  As a result of regulatory or private action in any jurisdiction, we may be temporarily or permanently suspended from continuing

some or all of our reinsurance activities

,

or otherwise fined or penalized or suffer an adverse judgment.  For the year ended December 31, 201


, we recorded a total of

$67.8

million in net income from our

tenant reinsurance activities.

Properties

At December 31, 2013, we had direct and indirect ownership interests in 2,200 self-storage facilities located in 38 states within the U.S. and 18


storage facilities located in seven Western European

nations:


(a)

See Schedule III:  Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation in the Company’s 201


financials, for a complete list of properties consolidated by the Company.

(b)

The facilities located in Europe include one facility in the United Kingdom that we wholly own, as well as the facilities owned by Shurgard Europe.

We seek to maximize our facilities’ cash flow through the regular review and adjustment of rents charged

and promotions granted

to our existing and new incoming

customers

, and controlling expense

s.  For the year ended December

31, 201


, the weighted average occupancy level and the average realized rent per occupied square foot for our self-storage facilities were approximately

92.7

% and $

14.18

, respectively, in the U.S. and

79.6%

and

$26.90

, respectively

, in Europe.

At December 31, 201


,


of our U.S. facilities

with a net book value of $224 million

were encumbered by an aggregate of $


million in secured notes payable.

We have no specific policy as to the maximum size of any one particular self-storage facility.  However, none of our facilities involves, or is expected to involve, 1% or more of our total assets, gross revenues or net income.

Description of Self-Storage Facilities:

Self-storage facilities, which comprise the majority of our investments, offer accessible storage space for personal and business use at a relatively low cost.  A user rents a fully enclosed space, securing the space with their lock, which is for the user's exclusive use and to which only the user has access on an unrestricted basis during business hours.  On-site operation is the responsibility of property managers who are supervised by district managers.  Some self-storage facilities also include rentable uncovered parking areas for vehicle storage.

Space is rented on a month-to-month basis and r

ental rates vary according to the location of the property, the size of t

he storage space

and other characteristics that affect the relative attractiveness of each particular space, such as whether the space has “drive-up” access

,

its proximity to elevators

, or if the space is climate controlled

.  All of our self-storage facilities in the U.S. are operated under the "Public Storage" brand name, while our facilities in Europe are operated under the “Shurgard” brand name.

Users include individuals from virtually all demographic groups, as well as businesses.  Individuals usually

store

furniture, household appliances, personal belongings, motor vehicles, boats, campers, motorcycles and other household goods.  Businesses normally

store

excess inventory, business records, seasonal goods, equipment and fixtures.

Our self-storage facilities generally consist of be

tween 350 to 750 storage spaces.  M

ost

spaces

have between 25 and 400 square feet and an interior height of approximately eight to 12 feet.

We experience minor seasonal fluctuations in the occupancy levels of self-storage facilities with occupancies generally higher in the summer months than in the winter months.  We believe that these fluctuations result in part from increased moving activity during the summer months and incremental demand from college students.

Our self-storage facilities are geographically diversified and are located primarily in or near major metropolitan markets in 38 states in the U.S.  Generally our self-storage facilities are located in heavily populated areas and close to concentrations of apartment complexes, single family residences and commercial developments.

Competition from other self-storage facilities is significant and impacts the occupancy levels and rental rates for many of our properties.

We believe that self-storage facilities, upon achieving stabilized occupancy levels of approximately 90%, have attractive characteristics consisting of high profit margins, a broad tenant base and low levels of capital expenditures to maintain their condition and appearance.  Historically, upon


reaching

stabilization, our U.S. self-storage facilities have generally shown a high degree of stability in generating cash flows.

Description of Commercial Properties

: We have an interest in PSB, which, as of December 31, 201


, owns and operates

approximately 29.7 million

net rentable square feet of commercial space in eight states.  At December 31, 201


, the $

424.5

million book value and $

1.1

b

illion market value, respectively, of our investment in PSB represents approximately

4% and 11%,

respectively of our total assets.  We also directly own 1.4 million net rentable square feet of commercial

space managed primarily by PSB.

The commercial properties owned by PSB consist primarily of flex, multi-tenant office and industrial space.  Flex space is defined as buildings that are configured with a combination of office and warehouse space and can be designed to fit a wide variety of uses (including office, assembly, showroom, laboratory, light manufacturing and warehouse space).

Environmental Matters:

We accrue environmental assessments and estimated remediation cost when it is probable that such efforts will be required and the related costs can be reasonably estimated.  Our current practice is to conduct environmental investigations in connection with property acquisitions.  Although there can be no assurance, we are not aware of any environmental contamination of any of our facilities, which individually or in the aggregate would be material to our overall business, financial condition, or results of operations.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

a.

Market Information of the Registrant’s Common Equity:

Our Common Shares (NYSE: PSA) have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since October 19, 1984.   The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices of our Common Shares on the New York Stock Exchange composite tapes for the applicable periods.

As of February 1


, 201


, there were approximately

16,



holders of record of our Common Shares.  Because many of our shares of common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.

b.

Dividends

We have paid quarterly distributions to our shareholders since 1981, our first full year of operations.  During 201


we paid distributions to our common shareholders of $1.


per common share for each of the quarters ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and

$1.40 per common share for the quarter ended

December 31, representing an aggregate of $

884.2

million or $

5.15

per share.  During 2012 we paid distributions to our common shareholders of $1.10 per common share for each of the quarters ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, representing an aggregate of $751

.2 million or $4.40 per share.

Holders of common shares are entitled to receive distributions when and if declared by our Board of Trustees out of any funds legally available for that purpose.  As a REIT, we do not incur federal income tax on our REIT taxable income (generally, net rents and gains from real property, dividends, and interest) that is fully distributed each year (for this purpose, certain distributions paid in a subsequent year may be considered), and if we meet certain organizational and operational rules.  We believe we have met these requirements in all periods presented herein, and we expect to continue to elect and qualify as a REIT.

For Federal income tax purposes, distributions to shareholders are treated as ordinary income, capital gains, return of capital or a combination thereof.  For 201


, the dividends paid on common shares and preferred shares were classified as follows:


For 201


, the dividends paid on common shares ($

4.40

per share) and on all the various classes of preferred shares were classified as

ordinary income.

c.

Equity Shares

We are authorized to issue 100,000,000 equity shares from time to time in one or more series and our Board of Trustees has broad authority to fix the dividend and distribution rights, conversion and voting rights, redemption provisions and liquidation rights of each series of equity shares.

We had no equity shares outstanding for any period in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.

d.

Common Share Repurchases

Our Board of Trustees has authorized

management to repurchase

up to 35,000,000 of our common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  From the inception of the repurchase program through February 2


, 201


, we have repurchased a total of 23,721,916 common shares (all purchased prior to 2010) at an aggregate cost

of approximately $679.1 million.  Our common share repurchase program does not have an expiration date

and

there are

11,278,084 common shares

that may yet be repurchased under our repurchase program as of December 31, 2013.  We have no current plans to repurchase shares; however, f

uture levels of common share repurchases will be dependent upon our available capital, investment alternatives, and the trading price of our common shares.

Selected Financial Data


ITEM 7.

Management’s

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our MD&A discusses our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).  Our financial statements are affected by our judgments, assumptions and estimates.  The notes to our December 31, 2013 financial statements, primarily Note 2, summarize our significant accounting policies.

We believe the following are our critical accounting policies, because they have a material impact on the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and they require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.

Income Tax Expense:

We have elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”), as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.  As a REIT, we do not incur federal income tax on our REIT taxable income (generally, net rents and gains from real property, dividends, and interest) that is fully distributed each year (for this purpose, certain distributions paid in a subsequent year may be considered), and if we meet certain organizational and operational rules.  We believe we have met these REIT requirements for all periods presented herein.  Accordingly, we have recorded no federal income tax expense related to our REIT taxable income.

Our evaluation that we have met the REIT requirements could be incorrect, because compliance with the tax rules requires factual determinations, and circumstances we have not identified could result in noncompliance with the tax requirements in current or prior years.  For any taxable year that we fail to qualify as a REIT and for which applicable statutory relief provisions did not apply, we would be taxed at the regular corporate rates on all of our taxable income for at least that year and the ensuing four years, we could be subject to penalties and interest, and our net income would be materially different from the amounts estimated in our financial statements.

In addition, our taxable REIT subsidiaries are taxable as regular corporations.  To the extent that amounts paid to us by our taxable REIT subsidiaries are determined by the taxing authorities to be in excess of amounts that would be paid under similar arrangements among unrelated parties, we could be subject to a 100% penalty tax on the excess payments.  Such a penalty tax could have a material adverse impact on our net income.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:

The analysis of impairment of our long-lived assets involves identification of indicators of impairment, projections of future operating cash flows, and estimates of fair values, all of which require significant judgment and subjectivity.  Others could come to materially different conclusions.  In addition, we may not have identified all current facts and circumstances that may affect impairment.  Any unidentified impairment loss, or change in conclusions, could have a material adverse impact on our net income.

Accrual for Uncertain and Contingent Liabilities:

We accrue for certain contingent and other liabilities that have significant uncertain elements, such as property taxes, workers compensation claims, tenant reinsurance claims, as well as other legal claims and disputes involving customers, employees, governmental agencies and other third parties.  Such liabilities we are aware of are estimated based upon many factors such as assumptions of past and future trends and our evaluation of likely outcomes.  However, the estimates of known liabilities could be incorrect or we may not be aware of all such liabilities, in which case our accrued liabilities and net income could be misstated.


Recording the fair value of acquired real estate facilities:

In accounting for facilities acquired from third parties, we estimate the fair values of the land, buildings and intangible assets acquired.  Such estimates are based upon many assumptions and judgments, including i) expected rates of return and capitalization rates on real estate assets, ii) estimated costs to replace acquired buildings and equipment in their current state, iii) comparisons of the acquired underlying land parcels to recent land transactions, and iv) future cash flows from the real estate and the existing tenant base.  Others could come to materially different conclusions as to the estimated fair values, which would result in different depreciation and amortization expense, gains and losses on sale of real estate assets, and real estate and intangible assets.

MD&A Overview

Our domestic self-storage facilities

generated

93%

of

our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013, and also generated most of our net income and cash flow from operations.  A significant portion of management time is devoted to maximizing cash flows from our existing self-storage facilities, as well as seeking additional investments in self-storage facilities.

Most of our facilities compete with other well-managed and well-located competitors

and we are subject to general economic conditions, particularly those that affect the spending habits of consumers and moving trends.

We believe that our

centralized information networks, national telephone and online reservation system, the brand name “Public Storage,” and our economies of scale enable us to meet such challenges effectively.

During 2013, we acquired 121 self-storage facilities for approximately $1.2 billion, substantially more than we had acquired in total in 2010, 2011 and 2012 (an aggregate of 77 facilities for $546 million).  In 2013, we took advantage of a significant increase in properties being marketed for sale, which we believe was primarily driven by easier access to capital in the current low interest rate environment and improved property valuations.  We expect to continue to seek to acquire additional self-storage facilities from third parties.  There is significant competition to acquire existing facilities and there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire additional facilities at prices we will find attractive.

As of

December 31 2013, we ha

d

development and expansion projects which will add approximately 1.8 million net rentable square feet of storage space at

$

196 million.

We expect to continue to seek additional development projects; however, the level of future development may be limited due to various constraints such as difficulty in finding available sites that meet our risk-adjusted yield expectations, as well as challenges in obtaining building permits for self-storage activities in certain municipalities.

We also have equity investments in Shurgard Europe and PS Business Parks, Inc. (“PSB”).  During the year ended December 31, 2013, we increased our ownership interest in PSB by acquiring 1,356,748 shares of PSB common stock in open-market transactions and directly from PSB, for an aggregate cost of $105.0 million.  We may invest further in these entities in the future.

As of December 31, 2013, our capital commitments for 2014 exceed our expected capital resources.  As of December 31, 2013, our capital resources consist of (i) approximately $250 million of available borrowing capacity on our revolving line of credit, (ii) $216.2 million of cash proceeds from the sale of 51% of a loan we have provided to Shurgard Europe which we received in January 2014, and (iii) $250 million of expected 2014 retained operating cash flow.  Retained operating cash flow represents our expected 2014 cash flow provided by operating activities, after deducting estimated 2014 distributions to our common and preferred shareholders, and estimated 2014 capital expenditure requirements.

At December 31, 2013, we had estimated 2014 capital commitments of $726.2 million of debt maturities, and approximately $145 million of remaining spend on our development pipeline.  In addition, we expect that our capital commitments will continue to grow during 2014 as we continue to seek additional development and acquisition opportunities.


We believe we have a variety of possibilities to bridge the gap between our capital resources and commitments which may include raising capital through the issuance of common or preferred securities, issuing debt, expanding the borrowing capacity of our credit facility, or entering into joint venture arrangements to acquire or develop facilities.  See

Liquidity and Capital Resources

for further information regarding our 2014 capital requirements.

Results of Operations

Operating results for 2013 as compared to 2012

For the year ended December 31, 2013, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $844.7 million or $4.89 per diluted common share, compared to $669.7 million or $3.90 per diluted common share for the same period in 2012, representing an increase of $175.0 million or $0.99 per diluted common share.  This increase is due primarily to (i) a $124.6 million increase in self-storage net operating income, (ii) a $68.9 million reduction in income allocated to preferred shareholders due to redemptions, including our equity share of PSB, (iii) an $8.2 million increase from foreign currency exchange gains, offset partially by (iv) a $29.6 million increase in depreciation and amortization associated with acquired real estate facilities.

Operating results for 2012 as compared to 2011

For the year ended December 31, 2012, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $669.7 million or $3.90 per diluted common share, compared to $561.7 million or $3.29 per diluted common share for the same period in 2011, representing an increase of $108.0 million or $0.61 per diluted common share.  This increase is due to (i)

a $102.5 million

increase

in self-storage net operating income

, (ii) a $19.6 million reduction in distributions to preferred shareholders due primarily to lower average coupon rates, and (iii) a $16.2 million increase resulting from foreign currency exchange gains and losses in translating our Euro-denominated loan receivable from Shurgard Europe into U.S. Dollars, offset partially by (iv) a $36.3 million decrease due to the application of EITF D-42 to our, and our equity share of PSB’s, redemptions of preferred securities.

Funds from Operations and Core Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations (“FFO”) is a non-GAAP term defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, and generally represents net income before depreciation, gains and losses, and impairment charges with respect to real estate assets.  We present FFO and FFO per share because we consider FFO to be an important measure of the performance of real estate companies, as do many analysts in evaluating our Company.  We believe that FFO is a helpful measure of a REIT’s performance since FFO excludes depreciation, which is included in computing net income and assumes the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time.  We believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions and in response to inflation.  FFO computations do not consider scheduled principal payments on debt, capital improvements, distributions and other obligations of the Company.  FFO and FFO per share is not a substitute for our cash flow or net income per share as a measure of our liquidity or operating performance or our ability to pay dividends.  Because other REITs may not compute FFO in the same manner, FFO may not be comparable among REITs.

For the year ended December 31, 2013, FFO was

$

7.53

per

diluted common share, as compared to $6.31 for the same period in 2012, representing an increase of $1.22

per diluted common share.

For the

year

ended

December 31

, 201


, FFO was $

6.31

per diluted common share, as compared to

$5.67

for the same period in 201


, representing an increase of

$0.64

per

diluted common share.

The following table reconciles net income to FFO and FFO per diluted common share:


In addition to FFO, we often discuss “Core FFO” per share which is also a non-GAAP measure that represents FFO per share, adjusted to exclude the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses, representing gains of $17.1 million and $8.9 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively, and a loss of $7.3 million for 2011, (ii) the impact of EITF D-42, including our equity share from PSB, representing charges totaling $68.9 million and $32.6 million for 2012 and 2011, respectively, (none for 2013) and (iii) other items.  We believe Core FFO is a helpful measure in understanding our ongoing earnings and cash flow.  We also believe that the analyst community, likewise, reviews our Core FFO and Core FFO per share (or similar measures using different terminology).  Core FFO is not a substitute for net income, earnings per share or cash flow from operations.  Because other REITs may not compute Core FFO in the same manner as we do, may not use the same terminology, or may not present such a measure, Core FFO may not be comparable among REITs.

The following table reconciles FFO per share to Core FFO per share:


Real Estate Operations

Self-Storage Operations:

Our self-storage operations

represent 93%

of our revenues for the

year

ended

December 31

, 201


.  Our self-storage operations are analyzed in two groups: (i) the Same Store Facilities, representing the facilities that we have owned and operated on a stabilized basis since January 1, 2011, and (ii) all other facilities, which are newly acquired, newly developed, or recently expanded facilities (the “Non Same Store Facilities”).

(a)

See “Net Operating Income

”

below for further information regarding this non-GAAP measure.

Net income from our Self-Storage operations has increased 11.2% in 2013 as compared to 2012 and 13.8% in 2012 as compared to 2011.  These increases are due to improvements in our Same Store Facilities, as well as the acquisitions of new facilities and the fill-up of unstabilized facilities.


Same Store Facilities

The Same Store Facilities represent those facilities that have been owned and operated on a stabilized basis since January 1, 2011 and therefore provide meaningful comparisons for 2011, 2012 and 2013.  The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 1,949 facilities (122.8 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 88% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at December 31, 2013.

(a)

Revenues and cost of operations do not include ancillary revenues and expenses generated at the facilities with respect to tenant reinsurance and retail sales.

See “Net Operating Income” below for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to our operating income in our income statements for the

years

ended

December 31

, 2013

,


and 201


.

(c)

Square foot occupancies represent weighted average occupancy levels over the entire period.


(d)

Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing annualized rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period.  Realized annual rent per available square foot (“REVPAF”) is computed by dividing annualized rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the total available net rentable square feet for the period.  These measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue.  Late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency, and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins.  In addition, the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates.  These measures take into consideration promotional discounts, which reduce rental income.

(e)

Contract rent represents the applicable contractual monthly rent charged to our

customers

, excluding the impact of promotional discounts, late charges, and administrative fees.

Analysis of Same Store Revenue

Revenues generated by our Same Store Facilities increased by 5.3%

in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to a

1.5%

increase in average occupancy and a

3.8%

increase in realized rent per occupied square foot.  Revenues generated by our Same S

tore Facilities increased by 4.7%

in 2012

as compared to 2011

due to a

0.7%

increase in average occupancy and a

4.2%

increase in realized rent per occupied square foot.  The increase in realized rent per occupied square foot

in both periods

was due primarily to

annual

rent increases

given to

customers

that have been renting with us longer than one year,

and to a lesser extent,

reduced

promotional discounts given to new

customers.

Same Store average occupancy increased from 91.3% in 2011, to 91.9% in 2012, and to 93.3% in 2013, representing increases of 0.7% in 2012 and 1.5% in 2013.  The year over year increases began primarily late in the fourth quarter of 2012, as we implemented more aggressive pricing strategies in the seasonally slow first and fourth quarters.  The occupancy spread narrowed in the fourth quarter of 2013 and is expected to continue to narrow in 2014, due to more difficult comparisons.

Our future rental growth will be dependent upon many factors for each market that we operate in, including demand for self-storage space, the level of competitor supply of self-storage space, our ability to increase rental rates to new and existing customers, the level of promotional activities required, and the average length of stay of our customers.

Increasing rental rates to existing customers, generally on an annual basis, is a key component of our revenue growth.  We determine the level of rental increases based upon our expectations regarding the impact of existing tenant rate increases on incremental move-outs.  We expect to pass similar rent increases to long-term customers in 2014, as we did in 2013.

We believe that high occupancies help maximize our rental revenue.  We seek to maintain an average occupancy level of at least 90%, by regularly adjusting the rental rates and promotions offered to attract new customers as well as adjusting our marketing efforts on both television and the Internet in order to generate sufficient move-in volume to replace customers that vacate.  Demand fluctuates due to various local and regional factors, including the overall economy.  Demand is higher in the summer months than in the winter months and, as a result, rental rates charged to new customers are typically higher in the summer months than in the winter months.

During 2013, 2012 and 2011, the average annualized contractual rates per occupied square foot for customers that moved

in were $

12.97,

$12.76 and

$

12.89

, respectively, and for

customers

that vacated were

$13.76, $13.54

and $

13.24,

respectively.

Promotional discounts, generally representing a one-month reduction in contractual rents, given in the first month of tenancy, were $79.3 million, $87.9 million and $96.6 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  Promotional discounts have declined due to higher occupancies.

We believe that the current trends in move-in, move-out, in place contractual rents and occupancy levels are consistent with our expectation of continued revenue growth in 2014.  However, such trends, when viewed in the short-run, are volatile and not necessarily predictive of our revenues going forward because they are subject to many short-term factors.  Such factors include initial move-in rates, seasonal


factors, the unit size and geographical mix of the specific customers moving in or moving out, the length of stay of the customers moving in or moving out, changes in our pricing strategies, and the degree and timing of rate increases previously passed to existing customers.

Analysis of Same Store Cost of Operations

Co

st of operations (excluding depreciation an

d amortization) decreased 1.3% in 2013 as compared to 2012 and decreased 2.2% in 2012 as compared to 2011.  The decrease in 2013 was due primarily to reduced advertising and selling expense, offset partially by increased property taxes.  The decrease in 2012 was due to reduced repairs and maintenance, advertising and selling expense, and on-site property manager payroll, offset partially by increased property taxes.

Property tax expense increased 5.1% in 2013 as compared to 2012 and increased 3.0% in 2012 as compared to 2011.  The increase in 2013 was due primarily to higher assessed values and tax rates, while the increase in 2012 was due primarily to higher assessed values.

We expect property tax growth of approximately

4.5% to 5

%

in 2014.

On-site property manager payroll

expense

decreased 0.8% in 2013 as compared to 2012 and 3.1% in 2012 as compared to 2011.  These decreases were due to reductions in incentive compensation, offset partially in 2013 by higher claims expense with respect to employee health benefits.

We expect on-site property manager payroll expense

to increase modestly in 2014 due to higher health care costs.

Supervisory payroll expense, which represents compensation paid to the management personnel who directly and indirectly supervise the on-site property managers,

increased 1.4% in 2013 as compared to 2012 and increased 3.5% in 2012 as compared to 2011.  The increase in 2013 was due primarily to increases in compensation rates, while the increase in 2012 was due primarily to increased headcount.

We expect

inflationary

increases in

compensation rates

and flat headcount in 2014.

Repairs and

maintenance expense

decreased 1.7% in 2013 as compared to 2012 and decreased 11.7% in 2012 as compared to 2011.  Repair and maintenance costs include snow removal expense totaling $5.3 million, $2.7 million and $4.3 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  Excluding snow removal costs, repairs and maintenance decreased 8.7% in 2013 as compared to 2012 and 9.0% in 2012 as compared to 2011.

Repairs and maintenance expense levels are dependent upon many factors such as weather conditions, which can impact repair and maintenance needs, inflation in material and labor costs, and random events.  We expect inflationary increases in repairs and maintenance expense in 2014 excluding snow removal expense.  Snow removal expense is expected to be higher in the three months ending March 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 due to high levels of snowfall.

Our utility expenses are comprised primarily of electricity costs, which are dependent upon energy prices and

usage levels.  Changes in usage levels are driven primarily by weather and temperature.

Utility expense was flat in 2013 as compared to 2012 and down 4.0% in 2012 as compared to 2011.  The decrease in 2012 was due to reduced usage caused by milder weather.

It is difficult to estimate future utility cost levels, because weather, temperature, and energy prices are volatile and not predictable.

We do, however, expect utility expense to be higher in the first three months of 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 due to severe winter weather in many of the markets we operate in.

Advertising and selling expense is comprised principally of Internet a

dvertising, media advertising

and the operating costs of our telephone reservation center.

Advertising and selling expense varies based upon demand, occupancy levels, and other factors; media and Internet advertising, in particular, can increase or decrease significantly in the short run in response to these factors.  These costs declined 30.3% in 2013 as compared to 2012 and declined 9.3% in 2012 as compared to 2011.  The decrease in 2013 is due to the phase-out of our yellow page advertising program as of December 31, 2012, as well as reduced television advertising and Internet search costs as a result of high occupancies.  The decrease in 2012 is


due primarily to reduced media advertising.  Based upon current trends in move-ins, move-outs, and occupancies, we expect advertising and selling expense to be approximately flat in 2014.

Other direct property costs include administrative expenses incurred at the self-storage facilities, such as property insurance, business license costs, bank charges related to processing the properties’ cash receipts, credit card fees, and the cost of operating each property’s rental office including supplies and telephone data communication lines.  These

costs

decreased 2.0% in 2013 as compared to 2012 and 6.3% in 2012 as compared to 2011.  The decrease in 2013 is due to lower property insurance costs and certain administrative cost-saving efforts, offset partially by an increase in credit card fees due primarily to an increase in credit card collections.  The decrease in 2012 is due principally to lower credit card fee rates.

We expect moderate increases in other direct property costs in


.

Allocated overhead represents administrative expenses for shared general corporate functions, which are allocated to self-storage property operations to the extent their efforts are devoted to self-storage operations.  Such functions include data processing, human resources, operational accounting and finance, marketing, and costs of senior executives (other than the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, which are included in general and administrative expense).  Allocated overhead

de

creased

1.5%

in 2013 as compared to 2012, and increased 1.9% in 2012 as compared to 2011.  We expect inflationary growth in allocated overhead in 2014 as compared to the 2013.

The following table summarizes selected quarterly financial data with respect to the Same Store Facilities:



Analysis of

Market

Trends

The following table sets forth

selected market

trends in our Same Store Facilities:



We believe that our geographic diversification and scale provide some insulation from localized economic effects and add to the stability of our cash flows.  It is difficult to predict localized trends in short-term self-storage demand and operating results.  Over the long run, we believe that markets that experience population growth, high employment, and otherwise exhibit economic strength and consistency will outperform markets that do not exhibit these characteristics.

Non Same Store Facilities

The Non Same Store Facilities at

December 31

, 201


represent


facilities

that were not stabilized with respect to occupancies or rental rates since January 1, 201


, or

that we did not own as of

January 1, 201


.  As a result of the stabilization process and timing of when the facilities

were acquired

, year-over-year changes can be significant.  In the following table,

“Other

facilities” includes

all facilities that we have owned, but were not yet stabilized as of January 1, 2011, three facilities that we obtained control of and began consolidating in 2012 and a newly developed facility opened in 2013

.

The following table summarizes operating data with respect to th

e Non Same Store F

acilities:



(a)

See “Net Operating Income” below for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to our net income in our statements of income for the

years

ended

December 31

,

2013, 2012

and 20


.

During 2013, we acquired 121 operating self-storage facilities from third parties (8,036,000 net rentable square feet of storage space) for approximately

$1.16

billion.  During 2012, we acquired 24 operating self-storage facilities from third parties (1,908,000 net rentable square feet of storage space and unfinished space that was converted to 209,000 net rentable square feet of self-storage space in 2013 for $20.3 million in additional development cost) for $225.5 million in cash.  During 2011, we acquired eleven operating self-storage facilities from third parties (896,000 net rentable square feet) for an aggregate cost of $80.4 million.

For 2013, the weighted average annualized yield for the facilities acquired in 2011 and 2012 (excluding the facility that was acquired in 2012 and expanded in 2013) was 10.5% and 6.8%, respectively.  The weighted average annualized yield with respect to the 2013 acquisitions is not meaningful due to our limited ownership period.

During 2013, we completed expansions to the Other Facilities, adding 300,000 net rentable square feet of self-storage space, for an aggregate cost of $19.9 million and we opened a newly developed facility for an aggregate cost of $16.6 million with 105,000 net rentable square feet of storage space.

We expect to increase the number of Non Same Storage Facilities over at least the next twelve months through development of additional self-storage space and acquisitions of existing facilities from third parties.

As of December 31, 2013, we ha

d

development and expansion projects which will add

approximately 1.8

million net rentable square feet of storage space at a total cost of approximately

$

196 million.  A total of

$

52 million

in costs were incurred through December 31, 2013, with the remaining costs expected to be incurred in 2014.  Some of these projects are subject to significant contingencies such as entitlement approval.  We expect to continue to seek additional development projects; however, the level of future development may be limited due to various constraints such as difficulty in finding projects that meet our risk-adjusted yield expectations and challenges in obtaining building permits for self-storage activities in certain municipalities.  There is significant competition to acquire existing facilities and there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire additional facilities at prices we will find attractive.

We believe that our management and operating infrastructure will result in newly acquired facilities stabilizing at a higher level of net operating income than was achieved by the previous owners.  However, it can take 24 or more months for these newly acquired facilities to reach stabilization, and the ultimate levels of net operating income to be achieved can be affected by changes in general economic conditions.  As a result, there can be no assurance that our expectations with respect to these facilities will be achieved.  However, we expect the Non Same Store Facilities to continue to provide earnings growth during 2014 as these facilities approach stabilized occupancy levels and the earnings of the 2013 acquisitions are reflected in our operations for a longer period in 2014 as compared to 2013.

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities

At

December 31

, 201


, we have equity investments in PSB, Shurgard Europe and various limited partnerships.  We account for such investments using the equity method.

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated

real estate entities for

2013, 2012 and 2011

consists of our pro-rata share of the net income of these unconsolidated real estate entities for each period.  The following table sets forth the significant components of equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities.


Investment in PSB

:

At December 31, 2013, we have an approximate 42% common equity interest in PSB,

comprised of our ownership of

7,158,354

shares of PSB’s common stock

and

7,305,355

limited partnership units in an operating partnership controlled by PSB

(


% as of December 31, 2012, comprised of our ownership of

5,801,606

shares of PSB’s common stock and

7,305,355

limited partnership units

at December 31, 2012).

The limited partnership units are convertible at our option, subject to certain conditions, on a one-for-one basis into PSB common stock.

During 2013, we purchased

406,748

share

s

of PSB common stock in open-market transactions at an average cost of $

73.15

per share.

On November 7, 2013,

we purchased

950,000

shares of PSB common stock from PSB

at $79.25 per share, concurrent with PSB’s sale of 1,495,000 additional shares to the public

at the same price per share.

At December 31, 2013, PSB owned and operated 29.7 million rentable square feet of commercial space located in eight states.  PSB also manages commercial space that we own pursuant to property management agreements.

Equity in earnings from

PSB

in

creased to

$23.2 million

in 2013 from $10.6 million in 2012. This increase was due primarily to EITF D-42 charges from PSB’s redemptions of preferred securities recorded in 2012, combined with increases in operating income for its newly acquired and same-park facilities.  See Note 4 to our December 31, 2013 financial statements for selected financial information on PSB, as well as PSB’s filings and selected financial information that can be accessed through the SEC, and on PSB’s website, www.psbusinessparks.com.

Equity in earnings from PSB decreased to $10.6 million in 2012, as compared to $27.8 million in 2011.  This decrease was principally due to (i) the impact of PSB’s redemptions of preferred securities in 2011 and 2012, which reduced income allocated to the common equity holders in 2012, and increased income allocable to the common equity holders in 2011, (ii) increased depreciation and interest expense as a result of the properties PSB acquired in 2011 and 2012, partially offset by (iii) incremental income generated by the properties PSB acquired in 2011 and 2012.

Our investment in PSB provides us with some diversification.

Investment in Shurgard Europe:

Equity in earnings of Shurgard Europe represents our 49% equity share of Shurgard Europe’s net income.  At December 31, 2013, Shurgard Europe’s operations are comprised of


wholly-owned facilities with


million net rentable square feet.  Selected financial data for Shurgard Europe for 2013, 2012 and 2011 is included in Note 4 to our December 31, 2013 financial statements.  As described in more detail in Note 4, we receive interest income and trademark license fees from Shurgard Europe.

Equity in earnings from Shurgard Europe de

creased to

$32.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 from

$

33.2

million for the

same period in 2012

.


Equity in earnings from Shurgard Europe increased to $33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 from $29.2 million for the same period in 2011.  The increase is due to our equity share of (i) improved property operations, (ii) reduced interest expense due to a reduction in interest rates and repayment of principal on third-party debt (iii) the impact of Shurgard Europe’s March 2, 2011 acquisition of the remaining 80% interest it did not own in two joint ventures that owned 72 self-storage facilities, partially offset by (iv) a reduction in foreign currency exchange rates when converting Euros into U.S. Dollars for reporting purposes.

Shurgard Europe has no development pipeline and no expectations in the short-term of acquiring any facilities from third parties.  Accordingly, at least in the short-term, our future earnings from Shurgard Europe will be affected primarily by the operating results of its existing facilities, as well as the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and currencies in the countries Shurgard Europe conducts its business, principally the Euro.

European Same Store Facilities

:

The Shurgard Europe Same Store Pool represents the 163 facilities (8.


million net rentable square feet, representing 86% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of Shurgard Europe’s self-storage portfolio) that have been consolidated and operated by Shurgard Europe on a stabilized basis since January 1, 2011 and therefore provide meaningful comparisons for 2011, 2012 and 2013.  We evaluate the performance of these facilities because Shurgard Europe’s ability to effectively manage stabilized facilities represents an important measure of its ability to grow its earnings over the long-term.

The following table reflects 100% of the operating results of those 163 facilities.  We restate the exchange rates used in prior year’s presentation to the actual exchange rates for 2013.  However, only our pro rata share of the operating results for these facilities, based upon the actual exchange rates for each period, is included in “equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities” on our statements of income.

In Note 4 to our December 31, 2013 financial statements, we disclose Shurgard Europe’s consolidated operating results for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.  Shurgard Europe’s consolidated operating results

include 2


additional

facilities that are not Same Store Facilities, and are based upon historical exchange rates rather than constant exchange rates for each of the respective periods

.

We present Shurgard Europe’s same-store net operating income or “NOI,” which is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expense.  We believe that NOI is a meaningful measure of operating performance, because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, in determining current property values, in evaluating property performance and in comparing period-to-period and market-to-market property operating results.  In addition, we believe the investment community utilizes NOI in determining operating performance and real estate values, and does not consider depreciation expense because it is based upon historical cost. NOI is not a substitute for net income, net operating cash flow, or other related GAAP financial measures, in evaluating Shurgard Europe’s operating results.

(c)

Square foot occupancies represent weighted average occupancy levels over the entire period.

(d)

R

ealized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing annualized rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period.  Realized annual rent per available square foot (“REVPAF”) is computed by dividing annualized rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the total available net rentable square feet for the period.  These measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue.  Late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency, and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins.  In addition, the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates.  These measures take into consideration promotional discoun

ts, which reduce rental income.

Net operating income decreased 3.4% in 2013 as compared to 2012, principally due to a reduction in revenue of 1.9% and relatively flat cost of operations.  Net operating income increased 1.6% in 2012 as compared to 2011, due to decreases in expenses offset by lower revenues.  While revenue declined in 2013, the most recent trends in the fourth quarter of 2013 have improved.  Due to the limited number of facilities in this portfolio and lack of geographic diversification, as well as recent volatile economic conditions in


Western Europe, it is difficult to estimate revenue growth.  However, based upon current trends, it appears that revenue should increase modestly in at least the first quarter of 2014.

Other Investments

:

The “Other Investments” at December



, 2013 are comprised primarily of our equity in earnings from various limited partnerships that own an aggregate of


self-storage facilities (792,000 net rentable square feet).  Our future earnings with respect to the Other Investments will be dependent upon the operating results of the facilities these entities own. See Note 4 to our

December



, 201


financial statements under the “Other Investments” for

certain condensed combined financial information

of these entities.

Ancillary Operations

Ancillary revenues and expenses include amounts associated with (i) the reinsurance of policies against losses to goods stored by

customers

in our self-storage facilities in the U.S., (ii) merchandise sales, (iii) commercial property operations and (iv) management of 42 facilities

owned by third parties and the Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities.

Commercial property operations are included in our commercial segment and all other ancillary revenues and costs of operations are not allocated to any segment.  See Note 11 to our December 31, 2013 financial statements for further information regarding our segments and for a reconciliation of these ancillary revenues and cost of operations to our net income.

The following table sets forth our ancillary operations as presented on our income statements:


Tenant reinsurance operations:

We reinsure policies offered through a non-affiliated insurance company against losses to goods stored by customers in the domestic self-storage facilities we operate.  The level of tenant reinsurance revenues is largely dependent upon the level of premiums charged for such insurance and the number of customers that participate in the insurance program.  Cost of operations primarily includes claims paid that are not covered by our outside third-party insurers, as well as claims adjustment expenses.  These costs are dependent primarily upon the level of losses incurred, including the level of catastrophic events that occur and affect our properties thereby increasing tenant insurance claims.

The increase in tenant insurance revenues in 2013 and 2012 as compared to the respective prior years is due to (i) an increased number of customers due to higher occupancy levels, including the fill-up of non-Same Store facilities, (ii) an increase in the percentage of such customers having policies from 61% in 2011, to 63% in 2012 and 65% in 2013, (iii) an increase in average premium rates and (iv)  the impact of the acquisition of 145 self-storage facilities from third parties in 2012 and 2013.  Tenant insurance revenues with respect to customers in our Same Store Facilities totaled $76.5 million, $71.4 million and $66.0 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

We expect continued increases in tenant insurance revenues in 2014 as the tenant insurance revenues with respect to the facilities we acquired in 2013 are reflected for a full year and Non-Same Store facilities continue to add customers.  We expect stable participation rates and flat premium rates in 2014.

Commercial operations:

We also own and operate commercial facilities, primarily the leasing of small retail storefronts and office space located on or near our existing self-storage facilities.  We do not expect any significant changes in revenues or profitability from our commercial operations.

Merchandise sales and other:

We sell locks, boxes, and packing supplies at our self-storage facilities, and the level of sales of these items is primarily impacted by the level of move-ins and other customer traffic at our self-storage facilities.  These amounts include, to a much lesser extent, the results of our management of 42 self-storage facilities in the U.S. for third party owners and other partnerships that we account for on the equity method.  In 2012 our merchandise sales and margins improved primarily as a


result of higher retail prices for our locks.  We do not expect any significant changes in revenues our profitability from our merchandise sales and other in 2014.

Other Income and Expense Items

Interest and other income:

Interest and other income

was $

22.6

million

in 2013,

$

22.1

million

in 2012

and $32.3 million in 2011, respectively

.  Interest and other income primarily includes interest income on loans receivable from Shurgard Europe, as well as trademark license fees received from Shurgard Europe for the use of the “Shurgard” trade name.  We record 51% of the aggregate interest income and trademark license fees as interest and other income, while the remaining 49% is presented as additional equity in earnings on our

income statement

.

Aggregate i

nterest income

and trademark license fees

received from Shurgard Europe was $

20.6

million

,

$

20.0

million

and $26.7 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

The

loan receivable from Shurgard Europe

(the “Shareholder Loan”) is denominated in Euros and

has a balance of €

311.0

million

($428

.1

million) as of

December


1, 2013

.

On January 28, 2014, our joint venture partner in Shurgard Europe acquired 51% of the Shareholder Loan at face value for €158.6 million ($216.2 million) in cash and the maturity date of the Shareholder Loan was extended to April 2019.  As a result, the 51% of the interest received on the Shareholder Loan that we previously recorded as interest income will cease as of January 28, 2014.  We will continue to record interest received with respect to our remaining 49% ownership of the Shareholder Loan as additional equity in earnings on our income statement.

The terms of a loan payable by Shurgard Europe to a bank (the “Bank Loan”), with a principal amount of €107.5 million at December 31, 2013, requires significant principal repayments through the maturity date in November 2014.  As a result, in 2013 and 2012 there were no principal repayments on the Shareholder Loan.  All interest on the Shareholder Loan has been paid currently when due and we expect the interest to continue to be paid when due with Shurgard Europe’s operating cash flow.

The remainder of our interest and other income is comprised primarily of interest earned on cash balances as well as sundry other income items that are received from time to time in varying amounts.  Interest income on cash balances has been minimal, because rates have been at historic lows of 0.1% or less, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future.  Future earnings from sundry other income items are not predictable.

Depreciation and amortization:

Depreciation and amortization increased to $387.4

million for 2013 as compared to $357.8 million for 2012 and $358.0 million for 2011, due principally to newly acquired facilities.  Included in depreciation and amortization is amortization expense of tenant intangibles for facilities acquired from third parties, which is being amortized relative to the expected future benefit of the customers in place for each period.  Such amortization expense totaled $24.1 million, $10.5 million and $11.9 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  Based upon the facilities we own at December 31, 2013, amortization expense with respect to such intangibles

is estimated at $36.6 million in 2014

.  The level of future depreciation and amortization will primarily depend upon the level of acquisitions of facilities and the level of capital expenditures we incur on our facilities.

General and administrative expense:

The following table sets forth our general and administrative expense:


Share-based compensation expense includes the amortization of restricted share units (“RSUs”) and stock options granted to employees, as well as employer taxes incurred upon vesting of RSUs and upon exercise of employee stock options.  The level of share-based compensation expense varies based upon the level of grants and forfeitures.  The increase in share-based compensation costs in 2013 as compared to 2012 is due primarily to additional share-based grants.  The increase in share-based compensation costs in 2012 as compared to 2011 is due primarily to additional share-based grants, offset partially by a reduction of $5.5 million with respect to certain RSUs granted in 2011 under a performance-based plan.  We expect share-based compensation expense to remain flat in 2014 as compared to 2013.  See Note 10 to our December 31, 2013 financial statements for further information on our share-based compensation.

Costs of senior executives represent the cash compensation paid to our chief executive officer and chief financial officer.  The increases in 2013 as compared to 2012 and in 2012 as compared to 2011 are due to increases in incentive compensation.

Development and acquisition costs represent internal and external expenses related to our acquisition and development activities and varies primarily based upon the level of development and acquisition activities undertaken.  Incremental legal, transfer tax, and other related costs of approximately $5.0

million

, $1.8

million

and $0.8 million were incurred in connection with the acquisition of real estate facilities in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  The level of such costs to be incurred in 2014 will depend upon the level of acquisition activities, which is not determinable.

Tax compliance costs and taxes paid include taxes paid to various state and local authorities, the internal and external costs of filing tax returns, costs associated with complying with federal and state tax laws, and maintaining our compliance with Internal Revenue Service REIT rules.  Such costs vary primarily based upon the tax rates of the various states in which we do business.

Legal costs include internal personnel as well as fees paid to legal firms and other third parties with respect to general corporate legal matters and risk management, and varies based upon the level of litigation.

Public company costs represent the incremental costs of operating as a publicly-traded company, such as internal and external investor relations expenses, stock listing and transfer agent fees, board of directors’ costs, and costs associated with maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including the Dodd-Frank Act and Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Our future general and administrative expenses are difficult to estimate, due to their dependence upon many factors, including those noted above.

Interest expense:

Interest expense was $6.4 million, $19.8 million and $24.2 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.


The decreases in 2013 as compared to 2012, and 2012 as compared to 2011, are due primarily to repayments on our unsecured senior notes in 2013 and 2011, along with principal repayments on our secured mortgage debt.  During 2013, 2012 and 2011, we capitalized interest of $2.9 million, $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively, associated with our development activities.  See Note 6 to our December 31, 2013 financial statements for a schedule of our notes payable balances, principal repayment requirements and average interest rates.  The level of interest expense that we incur in 2014 will be dependent upon the source of funds used to refinance our term loan that matures on December 2, 2014, and when such refinance is expected to occur.

Foreign Exchange Gain (Loss):

We recorded foreign

currency translation gain

s

of $

17.1

million and $

8.9

million in

2013 and 2012

, respectively, and

a loss

$

7.3

million

in 2011

, representing primarily the change in the U.S. Dollar equivalent of our Euro-based

Shareholder Loan

due to fluctuations in exchange rates.  We have not entered into any agreements to mitigate the impact of currency exchange fluctuations between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro, therefore the amount of U.S. Dollars we will receive on repayment will depend upon the currency exchange rates at that time.  We record the exchange gains or losses into net income each period because of our continued expectation of repayment of the

Shareholder Loan

in the foreseeable future.  The U.S. Dollar exchange rate relative to the Euro was approximately

1.3


, 1

.322 and 1.295 at December 31, 2013, December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.

Future foreign exchange gains or losses will be dependent primarily upon the movement of the Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar, the amount of the Shareholder Loan and our continued expectation of collecting the principal on the loan in the foreseeable future.  As noted above, On January 28, 2014, our joint venture partner in Shurgard Europe acquired 51% of the Shareholder Loan at face value for €158.6 million ($216.2 million) in cash and the maturity date of the Shareholder Loan was extended to April 2019.

Net Income Allocable to Preferred Shareholders:

Allocations of net income to our preferred shareholders generally consists of allocations (i) based on distributions and (ii) in applying EITF D-42 when we redeem preferred shares.  During 2012 and 2011, we redeemed certain existing series of preferred shares and issued additional preferred shares at lower coupon rates.  Net income allocable to preferred shareholders in applying EITF D-42 totaled $61.7 million and $35.6 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively, (there were no redemptions of preferred securities and as a result, no EITF D-42 allocations in 2013).  Net income allocable to preferred shareholders associated with distributions decreased during 2013 as compared to 2012, and 2012 as compared to 2011, due primarily to lower average dividend rates and lower average outstanding preferred shares.  Based upon our preferred shares outstanding at December 31, 2013, our quarterly distribution to our preferred shareholders is expected to be approximately $51.9 million.

Net Operating Income

In our discussions above, we refer to net operating income or “NOI,” which is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expense.  We believe that NOI is a meaningful measure of operating performance, because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to capital allocations, in determining current property values, in evaluating property performance and in comparing period-to-period and market-to-market property operating results.  In addition, we believe the investment community utilizes NOI in determining operating performance and real estate values, and does not consider depreciation expense because it is based upon historical cost.  NOI is not a substitute for net income, net operating cash flow, or other related GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our operating results.  The following table reconciles NOI generated by our self-storage facilities to our operating income:



Liquidity and Capital Resources

Financial Strategy:

Our financial profile is characterized by a low level of debt-to-total-capitalization.  In general, we seek to finance our investment activities and debt obligations with retained operating cash flow, and when not sufficient, capital raised through the issuance of preferred and common securities.  When market conditions are not favorable to issue either preferred or common securities, we will use bank debt as bridge financing.

Unlike most REITs, we have elected to use predominantly preferred securities in our capital structure as a form of leverage despite the fact that the dividend rates of our preferred securities exceed the prevailing market interest rates on conventional debt.  We have chosen this method of financing for the following reasons: (i) under the REIT structure, a significant amount of operating cash flow needs to be distributed to our shareholders, making it difficult, relative to a traditional taxable corporation, to repay debt with operating cash flow alone, (ii) our perpetual preferred shares have no sinking fund requirement or maturity date and do not require redemption, all of which eliminate future refinancing risks, (iii) after the end of a non-call period, we have the option to redeem the preferred shares at any time, which enables us to refinance higher coupon preferred shares with new preferred shares at lower rates if appropriate, (iv) preferred shares do not contain covenants, thus allowing us to maintain significant financial flexibility, and (v) dividends on the preferred shares can be applied to satisfy our REIT distribution requirements.

We

have generally been able to raise

preferred capital

at an attractive cost relative to the

issuance of our common shares, and as a result, our issuances of common shares for cash have been minimal over the past several years.

During the years ended December 31, 201


and 201


, we issued approximately $

725.0 million

and $

1.7

b

illion, respectively, of preferred securities

.

Currently, market conditions are much less favorable, with market coupon rates for our most recently issued series of preferred securities trading at approximately 6.5% (as compared to 5.2% for the preferred securities we issued in the first quarter of 2013).  We believe that market coupon rates for a new issuance of our preferred securities would need to be in the area of 6.5% and the amount of capital we could raise would most likely be much lower than what we raised in the first quarter of 2013.  The market coupon rate on our preferred securities is influenced by long-term interest rates.

Due to poor capital market conditions for the issuance of either preferred or common securities, during the last three months of 2013, we borrowed approximately $750.1 million from banks to bridge finance our acquisition activities during that timeframe.  See discussion on this debt below.

Our credit ratings on each of our series of preferred shares are “A3” by Moody’s, “BBB+” by Standard & Poor’s and “A” by Fitch Ratings.  In recent years, we have been one of the largest and most frequent issuers of preferred equity in the U.S.

Liquidity and Capital Resource Analysis:

We believe that our net cash provided by our operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to meet our ongoing requirements for operating expenses, capital improvements and distributions to our shareholders for the foreseeable future.

As of December 31, 2013, our capital commitments for 2014 exceed our expected capital resources.  As of December 31, 2013, our capital resources consist of (i) approximately $250 million of available borrowing capacity on our revolving line of credit, (ii) $216.2 million of cash proceeds from the sale of 51% of a loan we have provided to Shurgard Europe which we received in January 2014, and (iii) $250 million of expected 2014 retained operating cash flow.  Retained operating cash flow represents our expected 2014 cash flow provided by operating activities, after deducting estimated 2014 distributions to our common and preferred shareholders, and estimated 2014 capital expenditure requirements.

At December 31, 2013, we had estimated 2014 capital commitments of $726.2 million of debt maturities, and approximately $145 million of remaining spend on our development pipeline.  In addition, we expect that our capital commitments will continue to grow during 2014 as we continue to seek additional development and acquisition opportunities.


We believe we have a variety of possibilities to bridge the gap between our capital resources and commitments which may include raising capital through the issuance of common or preferred securities, issuing debt, expanding the borrowing capacity of our credit facility, or entering into joint venture arrangements to acquire or develop facilities.

At February 25, 2014, we have no outstanding borrowings on our line of credit and outstanding borrowings of $600 million on our term loan.

Debt Service Requirements:

As of December 31, 2013, our outstanding debt totaled approximately $839.1 million.  Approximate principal maturities of our outstanding debt are as follows (amounts in thousands):

The remaining maturities on our secured debt are nominal compared to our annual cash from operations.  We intend to repay the secure debt at maturity and not seek to refinance it with additional debt.

Virtually all of the book value of our real estate facilities are unencumbered at

December



, 2013.

Capital Expenditure Requirements:

Capital expenditures include major repairs or replacements to elements of our facilities, which keep the facilities in good operating condition and maintain their visual appeal to the customer

, which totaled $71.3 million in 2013

.  Capital

expenditures

do not include costs relating to the development of new facilities or the expansion of net rentable square

footage of existing facilities.

During 2014, we expect to incur approximately $70 million for capital expenditures and fund such amounts with cash provided by operating activities

.  For the last

four

years, such capital expenditures have ranged between approximately $0.55 and $0.60 per net rentable square foot

per year.

Requirement to Pay Distributions:

For all periods presented herein, we have elected to be treated as a REIT, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.  As a REIT, we do not incur federal income tax on our REIT taxable income (generally, net rents and gains from real property, dividends, and interest) that is fully distributed each year (for this purpose, certain distributions paid in a subsequent year may be considered), and if we meet certain organizational and operational rules.  We believe we have met these requirements in all periods presented herein, and we expect to continue to elect and qualify as a REIT.

D

istributions paid during 2013 totaled $

1.1

b

illion, consisting of $

204.3

million to preferred shareholders and $

887.1

million to common shareholders and restricted share unitholders.

All of these distributions were REIT qualifying distributions.

We estimate the annual distribution requirements with respect to our Preferred Shares outstanding at December 31, 2013 to be approximately $207.6 million per year.

On February 20, 2014, our Board of Trustees declared a regular common quarterly dividend

of $1.40 per

common share.  Our consistent, long-term dividend policy has been to distribute only our taxable income.  Future quarterly distributions with respect to the common shares will continue to be determined based upon our REIT distribution requirements after taking into consideration distributions to the preferred shareholders and will be funded with cash provided by operating activities.


We are obligated to pay distributions to noncontrolling interests in our consolidated subsidiaries based upon the cash provided by operating activities of the respective subsidiary.  Such distributions are estimated at

approximately

$6.4

million

in 2014, with respect to such noncontrolling interests outstanding at December 31, 2013.

Real Estate Investment

Activities:

As of February 25, 2014, we were

under contract

to acquire a self-storage facility for approximately $10.8 million in cash.

During


, we will continue to seek to acquire self-storage facilities

from third parties; however, it is difficult to estimate the amount of third party acquisitions we will undertake.

As of December 31, 2013, we had development and expansion projects which will add

approximately

1.8

million net rentable square feet of storage space at a total cost of approximately

$196

million.  A total of

$52

million in costs were incurred through December 31, 2013, with the remaining costs

expected to be incurred primarily in 2014.

Some of these projects are subject to significant contingencies such as entitlement approval.  We expect to continue to seek additional development projects; however,

the level of future development may be limited

due

to various constraints such as

difficulty in finding

available sites for building

that meet our risk-adjusted yield expectations, as well as the

challenges

in obtaining building permits for self-storage activities in certain municipalities

.

Shurgard Europe:

Shurgard Europe has a term loan from a bank (the “Bank Loan”) with a balance of approximately €107.5 million ($148.0 million) at December 31, 2013 maturing in November 2014 and the Shareholder Loan totaling €311.0 million ($428.1 million) at December 31, 2013.  On January 28, 2014, our joint venture partner in Shurgard Europe acquired 51% of the Shareholder Loan at face value for €158.6 million ($216.2 million) in cash, and the maturity date of the Shareholder Loan was extended to April 2019.  Shurgard Europe is exploring various financing alternatives.

Redemption of Preferred Securities

: We have no series of preferred shares that are redeemable before April 2015 and none of our preferred securities are redeemable at the option of the holders.

Repurchases of Company’s Common Shares

: Our Board of Trustees has authorized management to repurchase up to 35,000,000 of our common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  During 2013, we did not repurchase any of our common shares.  From the inception of the repurchase program through February 25, 2014, we have repurchased a total of 23,721,916 common shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $679.1 million.  We have no current plans to repurchase shares; however, future levels of common share repurchases will be dependent upon our available capital, investment alternatives and the trading price of our common shares.


Contractual Obligations

Our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2013 and their impact on our cash flows and liquidity are summarized below for the years ending December 31 (amounts in thousands):

(1)

Amounts include principal and interest payments (all of which are fixed-rate) on our notes payable based on their contractual

terms.  See Note


to our

December 31

, 201


financial statements for additional information on our notes payable.

(2)

Amounts represent borrowings under our $700 million term loan, of which $100 million was repaid on January 30, 2014.  See Note 6 to our December 31, 2013 financial statements for additional information on our term loan.

(3)

Amounts represent borrowings under our $300 million revolving line of credit, which were repaid on January 8

,

2014.  See Note 6 to our December 31, 2013 financial statements for additional information on our line of credit.

(4)

We lease land, equipment and office space under various operating leases.  Certain leases are cancelable

;

however, significant penalties would be incurred upon cancellation.  Amounts reflected above consider continuance of the lease without cancellation.

(5)

Amounts exclude an additional $100.6 million in future expected development spending that was not under contract at December 31, 2013.

We estimate the

annual

distribution requirements with respect to our Preferred Shares outstanding at

December 31

, 201


, to be approximately $

207.6 million per year.  Dividends are paid when and if declared by our Board of Trustees and accumulate if not paid.

We have no series of preferred shares that are redeemable before April 2015 and none of our preferred securities are redeemable at the option of the holders.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

: At

December 31

, 201

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

To limit

our exposure to market risk, we are capitalized primarily with preferred and common equity.  Our preferred shares are redeemable at our option generally five years after issuance, but the holder has no redemption option.  Our debt is our only market-risk sensitive portion of our capital structure, which totals $839.1 million and represents 9.5% of

the book value of our equity at

December



, 2013.

We have foreign currency exposures related to our investment in Shurgard Europe, which has a book value of

$424.1

million at December 31, 2013.  We also have a loan receivable from Shurgard Europe

“the Shareholder Loan”)

, which is denominated

in Euros, totaling €311.0 million ($

428.1

million) at

December 31

, 201


.

On January

28, 2014, our joint venture partner in Shurgard Europe acquired 51% of

the Shareholder Loan

at face value for €158.6 million ($216.2 million) in cash,

and the maturity date

o

f the Shareholder Loan was extended to April 2019

.

At December 31, 2013, we had $700 million payable under a term loan which matures on December 2, 2014 and $50.1 million outstanding on our

line of credit

, which expires in March 2017.  As of December 31, 2013, these balances bear interest at a variable rate of Libor plus 0.90%.

The fair value of our fixed rate debt at December 31, 2013 is $90.5 million.  The table below summarizes

Controls and Procedures

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file and submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (“Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in accordance with SEC guidelines and that such information is communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on the definition of "disclosure controls and procedures" in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures in reaching that level of reasonable assurance.  We also have investments in certain unconsolidated real estate entities and because we do not control these entities, our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.

As of December 31, 2013, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act).  Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2013, at a reasonable assurance level.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act.  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee on Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission

(1992 Framework)

.  Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013.

The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, independent registered public accounting firm. Ernst & Young LLP’s report on our internal control over financial reporting appears below.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of 201


to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Trustees and Shareholders of

Public Storage

We have audited Public Storage’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission

(1992

f

ramework)

(the COSO criteria).  Public Storage’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and trustees of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Public Storage maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on

the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Public Storage as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 and our report dated February 2

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Public Storage

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Public Storage as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013.  Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a).  These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Public Storage at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Public Storage’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission

Description of the Business

Public Storage (referred to herein as “the Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), a Maryland real estate investment trust, was organized in 1980.  Our principal business activities include the acquisition, development, ownership and operation of self-storage facilities which offer storage spaces for lease, generally on a month-to-month basis, for personal and business use.

At

December



, 2013, we have direct and indirect equity interests in

2,200

self-storage facilities (with approximately


million net rentable square feet) located in


states in the United States (“U.S.”) operating under the “Public Storage” name.  In Europe, we own

one

self-storage facility in London, England and we have a


% interest in Shurgard Europe, which owns


self-storage facilities (with approximately


million net rentable square feet) located in

seven

Western European countries, all operating under the “Shurgard” name.  We also have direct and indirect equity interests in approximately


million net rentable square feet of commercial space located in


states in the U.S. primarily owned and operated by PS Business Parks, Inc. (“PSB”) under the “PS Business Parks” name.  At

December



, 2013, we have an approximate


%

common equity

interest in PSB.

Disclosures of the number and square footage of properties, as well as the number and coverage of tenant reinsurance policies are unaudited and outside the scope of our independent registered public accounting firm’s review of our financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (

U.S.

).

2.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The financial statements are presented on an accrual basis in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) as defined in the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (the “Codification”).  Certain amounts previously reported in our December 31, 2012 and 2011 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the December 31, 201


presentation,

(i)

to reflect credit card fees as part of cost of operations rather than as a reduction to revenues

and (ii) to reclassify construction in process from buildings.

Consolidation and Equity Method of Accounting

We consider entities to be Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”) when they have insufficient equity to finance their activities without additional subordinated financial support provided by other parties, or where the equity holders as a group do not have a controlling financial interest.  We have

no

investments or other involvement in any VIEs.

We consolidate all entities that we control (these entities, for the period in which the reference applies, are referred to collectively as the “Subsidiaries”), and we eliminate intercompany transactions and balances.  We account for our investments in entities that we have significant influence over, but do not control, using the equity method of accounting (these entities, for the periods in which the reference applies, are referred to collectively as the “Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities”).  When we obtain control of an Unconsolidated Real Estate Entity, we commence consolidating the entity and record a gain representing the differential between the book value and fair value of our preexisting equity interest.  All changes in consolidation status are reflected prospectively.

F-


PUBLIC STORAGE

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2013

When we are general partner, we control the partnership unless the third-party limited partners can dissolve the partnership or otherwise remove us as general partner without cause, or if the limited partners have the right to participate in substantive decisions of the partnership.

Collectively, at December 31, 2013, the Company and the Subsidiaries own

2,186

self-storage facilities in the U.S.,

one

self-storage facility in London, England and

six

commercial facilities in the U.S.  At December 31, 2013, the Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities are comprised of PSB, Shurgard Europe, as well as limited partnerships that own an aggregate of


self-storage facilities in the U.S. (these limited partnerships, for the periods in which the reference applies, are referred to as the “Other Investments”).

Use of Estimates

The financial statements and accompanying notes reflect our estimates and assumptions.  Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.

Income Taxes

We have elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”), as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.  As a REIT, we do not incur federal income tax if we distribute


% of our REIT taxable income (generally, net rents and gains from real property, dividends, and interest) each year, and if we meet certain organizational and operational rules.  We believe we will meet these REIT requirements in 2013, and that we have met them for all other periods presented herein.  Accordingly, we have recorded

no

federal income tax expense related to our REIT taxable income.

Our merchandise and tenant reinsurance operations are subject to corporate income tax and such taxes are included in ancillary cost of operations.  We also incur income and other taxes in certain states, which are included in general and administrative expense.

We recognize tax benefits of uncertain income tax positions that are subject to audit only if we believe it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained (including the impact of appeals, as applicable), assuming the relevant taxing authorities had full knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances of our positions.  As of December 31, 2013, we had

no

tax benefits that were not recognized.

Real Estate Facilities

Real estate facilities are recorded at cost.  We capitalize all costs incurred to develop, construct, renovate and improve properties, including interest and property taxes incurred during the construction period.  We expense internal and external transaction costs associated with acquisitions or dispositions of real estate, as well as repairs and maintenance costs, as incurred.  We depreciate buildings and improvements on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging generally between


to


years.

We allocate the net acquisition cost of acquired operating self-storage facilities to the underlying land, buildings, identified intangible assets, and remaining noncontrolling interests based upon their respective individual estimated fair values.  Any difference between the net acquisition cost and the estimated fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.

F-


PUBLIC STORAGE

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2013

Other Assets

Other assets primarily consist of prepaid expenses, accounts receivable, land held for sale and restricted cash.

In

2011, we recorded impairment charges with respect to other assets totaling $

1.9

million.

Accrued and Other Liabilities

Accrued and other liabilities consist primarily of trade payables, property tax accruals, tenant prepayments of rents, accrued interest payable, accrued payroll, accrued tenant reinsurance losses, casualty losses, and contingent loss accruals which are accrued when probable and estimable.  We disclose the nature of significant unaccrued losses that are reasonably possible of occurring and, if estimable, a range of exposure.

Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

Cash equivalents represent highly liquid financial instruments such as money market funds with daily liquidity or short-term commercial paper or treasury securities maturing within three months of acquisition.  Cash and cash equivalents which are restricted from general corporate use are included in other assets.  Commercial paper not maturing within three months of acquisition, which we intend and have the capacity to hold until maturity, are included in marketable securities and accounted for using the effective interest method.

Fair Value Accounting

As used herein, the term “fair value” is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.  We prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value based upon a three-tier hierarchy described in Codification Section 820-10-35.

We believe that, during all periods presented, the carrying values approximate the fair values of our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, other assets, and accrued and other liabilities, based upon our evaluation of the underlying characteristics, market data, and short maturity of these financial instruments, which involved considerable judgment.  The estimated fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in current market exchanges.  The characteristics of these financial instruments, market data, and other comparative metrics utilized in determining these fair values are “Level 2” inputs as the term is defined in Codification Section 820-10-35-47.

We use significant judgment to estimate fair values in recording our business combinations, to evaluate real estate, investments in unconsolidated real estate entities, goodwill, and other intangible assets for impairment, and to determine the fair values of notes payable and receivable.  In estimating fair values, we consider significant unobservable inputs such as market prices of land, market capitalization rates and earnings multiples for real estate facilities, projected levels of earnings, costs of construction, functional depreciation, and market interest rates for debt securities with a similar time to maturity and credit quality, which are “Level 3” inputs as the term is defined in Codification Section 820-10-35-52.

Currency and Credit Risk

Financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, loans receivable, and restricted cash.  Cash equivalents and marketable securities we invest in are either money market funds with a rating of at least AAA by Standard and Poor’s, commercial paper that is  rated A1 by Standard and Poor’s or deposits with highly rated commercial banks.

F-


PUBLIC STORAGE

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2013

At December 31, 2013, due primarily to our investment in and loan receivable from Shurgard Europe, our operating results and financial position are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the Euro, and to a lesser extent, other European currencies, against the U.S. Dollar.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Intangible assets are comprised of goodwill, the “Shurgard” trade name, acquired

customers

in place, and leasehold interests in land.

Goodwill totaled $

174.6

million at December 31, 2013 and 2012.  The “Shurgard” trade name, which is used by Shurgard Europe pursuant to a fee-based licensing agreement, has a book value of $

18.8

million at December 31, 2013 and 2012.  Goodwill and the “Shurgard” trade name have indefinite lives and are not amortized.

Acquired

customers

in place and leasehold interests in land are finite-lived and are amortized relative to the benefit of the

customers

in place or the land lease expense to each period.  At December 31, 2013, these intang

ibles have a net book value of $

53.4

million

($

15.9

million at December 31, 2012).  Accumulated amortization totaled

$

35.1

million at December 31, 2013

($

24.8

million at December 31, 2012), and amortization expense of

$

24.1

million, $

10.5

million and

$

11.9

million was recorded in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

The estimated future amortization expense for our finite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2013 is $

36.6

million in 2014, $

8.2

million

in 2015 and $

8.6

million thereafter.

During 2013, 2012 and 2011, intangibles were increased

$

61.5

million,

$

9.1

million and

$

1.0

million, respectively, in connection with the acquisition of self-storage facilities and leasehold interests (Note 3), and in 2012 and 2011,

$

0.9

million and

$

4.0

million, respectively, in connection with the consolidation of facilities previously accounted for under the equity method (Note 4).

Evaluation of Asset Impairment

We evaluate our real estate, finite-lived intangible assets, investments in unconsolidated real estate entities, and loan receivable from Shurgard Europe for impairment on a quarterly basis.  We evaluate indefinite-lived assets (including goodwill) for impairment on an annual basis, or more often if there are indicators of impairment.

In evaluating our real estate assets and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment, if there are indicators of impairment, and we determine that the asset is not recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for any excess of the carrying amount over the asset’s estimated fair value.  For long-lived assets that we expect to dispose of prior to the end of their estimated useful lives, we record an impairment charge for any excess of the carrying value of the asset over the expected net proceeds from disposal.

Prior to January 1, 2013, we evaluated the “Shurgard” trade name for impairment through a quantitative analysis, and we would record impairment charges to the extent quantitatively estimated fair value was less than the carrying amount.  Beginning January 1, 2013, if we determine, based upon the relevant events and circumstances and other such qualitative factors, that it is more likely than not that the asset is unimpaired, we do not record an impairment charge and no further analysis is performed.  Otherwise, we record an impairment charge for any excess of carrying amount over quantitatively assessed fair value.

In evaluating goodwill for impairment, we first evaluate, based upon the relevant events and circumstances and other such qualitative factors, whether the fair value of the reporting unit that the goodwill pertains to is greater than its aggregate carrying amount.  If based upon this evaluation it is more likely than not

F-


PUBLIC STORAGE

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2013

that the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of its aggregate carrying amount, no impairment charge is recorded and no further analysis is performed.  Otherwise, we estimate the goodwill’s implied fair value based upon what would be allocated to goodwill if the reporting unit were acquired at estimated fair value in a transaction accounted for as a business combination, and record an impairment charge for any excess of book value over the goodwill’s implied fair value.

For our investments in unconsolidated real estate entities, if we determine that a decline in the estimated fair value of the investments below carrying amount is other than temporary, we record an impairment charge for any excess of carrying amount over the estimated fair value.

For our loan receivable from Shurgard Europe, if we determine that it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due based on the terms of the loan agreement, we record an impairment charge for any excess of book value over the present value of expected future cash flows.

No

impairments were recorded in any of our evaluations for any period presented herein.

Revenue and Expense Recognition

Rental income, which is generally earned pursuant to month-to-month leases for storage space, as well as late charges and administrative fees, are recognized as earned.  Promotional discounts reduce rental income over the promotional period.  Ancillary revenues and interest and other income are recognized when earned.  Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities represents our pro-rata share of the earnings of the Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities.

We accrue for property tax expense based upon actual amounts billed and, in some circumstances, estimates and historical trends when bills or assessments have not been received from the taxing authorities or such bills and assessments are in dispute.  If these estimates are incorrect, the timing and amount of expense recognition could be incorrect.  Cost of operations, general and administrative expense, interest expense, as well as television and other advertising expenditures are expensed as incurred.

Foreign Currency Exchange Translation

The local currency (primarily the Euro) is the functional currency for our interests in foreign operations.  The related balance sheet amounts are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates at the respective financial statement date, while amounts on our statements of income are translated at the average exchange rates during the respective period.  The Euro was translated at exchange rates of approximately

1.377

U.S. Dollars per Euro at December 31, 2013 (

1.322

at December 31, 2012), and average exchange rates of

1.328

,

1.285

and

1.392

for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  Cumulative translation adjustments, to the extent not included in cumulative net income, are included in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Total comprehensive income (loss) represents net income, adjusted for changes in other comprehensive income (loss) for the applicable period.  The aggregate foreign currency exchange gains and losses reflected on our statements of comprehensive income are comprised primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our investment in, and loan receivable from, Shurgard Europe.

Discontinued Operations

Discontinued operations represent the net income of those facilities that have been disposed of as of during the three years ended December 31, 2013, or which we plan to dispose of within a year.  In addition, discontinued operations include $

12.1

million and $

2.7

million in gains on disposition of real estate facilities in 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Net Income per Common Share

Net income is allocated to (i) noncontrolling interests based upon their share of the net income of the Subsidiaries

,

(ii) preferred shareholders, to the extent redemption cost exceeds the related original net issuance proceeds (an “EITF D-42 allocation.”),

and

(iii) the remaining net income allocated to each of our equity securities based upon the dividends declared or accumulated during the period, combined with participation rights in undistributed earnings.

Basic net income per share, basic net income from discontinued operations per share, and basic net income from continuing operations per share are computed using the weighted average common shares outstanding.  Diluted net income per share, diluted net income from discontinued operations per share, and diluted net income from continuing operations per share are computed using the weighted average common shares outstanding, adjusted for the impact, if dilutive, of stock options outstanding (Note 10).

The following table reflects

net income allocations and weighted average common shares and equivalents outstanding, as used in

our calculations of basic and diluted net income per share, basic and diluted net income from discontinued operations per share, and basic and diluted net income from continuing operations per share:

Loan Receivable from Unconsolidated Real Estate Entity

As of

December

31,

2013 and

2012, we had a Euro-denominated loan receivable from Shurgard Europe

(the “Shareholder Loan”)

with a balance of €

311.0

million at both periods ($

428.1

million at

December



, 2013 and $

411.0

million at December 31, 2012), which bears interest at a fixed rate of

9.0

% per annum

and

has no required principal payments until

maturity on

February 15, 2015

,

but

can be prepaid

in part or in full

at any time without penalty.  Because we expect

ed

repayment of

the Shareholder Loan

in the foreseeable future

for all periods presented

, foreign exchange rate gains or losses due to changes in exchange rates between the Euro and the U.S. Dollar are recognized on our income statements as “foreign currency exchange

gain (loss)

.”

For 2013, 2012 and 2011, we

recorded interest income with respect to this loan (representing


% of t

he aggregate interest received,

see Note 4) of approximately

$19.3

million

,

$18.7

million and

$23.0

million, respectively

.

We believe that the interest rate on the

Shareholder Loan

approximates the market rate for loans with similar terms, conditions, subordination features, and tenor, and that the fair value of the loan approximates book value.  In our evaluation of market rates and fair value, we considered that Shurgard Europe has sufficient operating cash flow, liquidity and collateral, and we have sufficient creditor rights such that credit risk is

F-


PUBLIC STORAGE

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2013

mitigated.  We have received a total of €

80.9

million in principal repayments on this loan since its inception on March 31, 2008.

On

January 28, 2014

, our joint venture partner in Shurgard Europe acquired


% of the Shareholder Loan at face value for

€158.6

million ($

216.2

million) in cash and the maturity date of the Shareholder Loan was extended to

April 2019

.  We continue to believe that the Shareholder Loan will be repaid in the foreseeable future.

On February 9, 2011, we loaned PSB $

121.0

million.  The loan had a

six

-month term and bore interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus

0.85

% (

1.13

% per annum for the term of the loan).  For 2011, we recorded interest income of approximately $

0.7

million related to the loan.  The loan was repaid in 2011.

In March 2011, we provided bridge financing to Shurgard Europe totaling $

237.9

million, bearing interest at a fixed rate of

7.0

% per annum and denominated in U.S. Dollars, which it used to acquire its partner’s 80% interests in two joint ventures.  In June 2011, our joint venture partner in Shurgard Europe effectively purchased


% of the loan from us for $121.3 million and the entire loan balance was exchanged for an equity interest in Shurgard Europe.

In addition to interest on the bridge financing, during 2011,

w

e received $

1.5

million in other income from our joint venture partner for our interim funding of its 51% pro rata share of Shurgard Europe’s cost to acquire the interests

Credit

Facility, Term Loan

and Notes Payable

We have a $


million revolving line of credit (the “Credit Facility”) that expires on

March 21, 2017

1.500

% depending

upon the ratio of

our

Total Indebtedness to Gross Asset Value (as defined in the Credit Facility)

million unsecured term loan (the “Term Loan”) with Wells Fargo Bank, the lead arranger for our Credit Facility.  The Term Loan matures on

December 2, 2014

the Term Loan

totaled $

Stock options and RSUs are considered “granted” and “outstanding” as the terms are used herein, when i) the Company and the recipient reach a mutual understanding of the key terms of the award, ii) the award has been authorized, iii) the recipient is affected by changes in the market price of our stock, and iv) it is probable that any performance and service conditions will be met.

We amortize the grant-date fair value of awards (net of anticipated forfeitures) as compensation expense over the service period.  The service period begins on the grant date and ends on the vesting date. For awards that are earned solely upon the passage of time and continued service, the entire cost of the award is amortized on a straight-line basis over the service period. For awards with performance conditions, the individual cost of each vesting is amortized separately over each individual service period (the “accelerated attribution” method).

Stock Options

Stock options vest over a

three

to

five

-year period, expire

ten

years after the grant date, and the exercise price is equal to the closing trading price of our common shares on the grant date.  Employees cannot require the Company to settle their award in cash.  We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of our stock options.

Outstanding stock option grants are included on a one-for-one basis in our diluted weighted average shares, to the extent dilutive, after applying the treasury stock method (based upon the average common share price during the period) to assumed exercise proceeds and measured but unrecognized compensation.

The stock options outstanding at December 31, 2013 have an aggregate intrinsic value (the excess, if any, of each option’s market value over the exercise price) of approximately $

142.2

million and remaining average contractual lives of approximately

five

years.  Other than stock options granted in 2012 and 2013, all stock options outstanding at December 31, 2013 have exercise prices of $


or less.  The aggregate intrinsic value of exercisable stock options at December 31, 2013 amounted to approximately $

117.4

million.

Additional information with respect to stock options during 2013, 2012 and 2011 is as follows:

Restricted Share Units

RSUs generally vest ratably over a

three

to

eight

-year period from the grant date.  The grantee receives dividends for each outstanding RSU equal to the per-share dividends received by our common shareholders.  We expense any dividends previously paid upon forfeiture of the related RSU.  Upon vesting, the grantee receives common shares equal to the number of vested RSUs, less common shares withheld in exchange for tax deposits made by the Company to satisfy the grantee’s statutory tax liabilities arising from the vesting.

The fair value of our RSUs is determined based upon the applicable closing trading price of our common shares.

The fair value of our RSUs outstanding at December 31, 2013 was approximately $95.8 million.  Remaining compensation expense related to RSUs outstanding at December 31, 2013 totals approximately $

45.3

million (which is net of expected forfeitures) and is expected to be recognized as compensation expense over the next

two

years on average.  The following tables set forth relevant information with respect to restricted shares (dollar amounts in thousands):

Segment Information

Our reportable segments reflect the significant components of our operations that are evaluated separately by our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and have discrete financial information available.  We organize our segments based primarily upon the nature of the underlying products and services, and whether the operation is located in the U.S. or outside the U.S.  In making resource allocation decisions, our CODM considers the net income from continuing operations of each reportable segment included in the tables below, excluding the impact of depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on disposition of real estate facilities, and asset impairment charges.  The amounts for each reportable segment included in the tables below are in conformity with GAAP and our significant accounting policies as denoted in Note 2.  Ancillary revenues and expenses, interest and other income (other than from Shurgard Europe), interest expense, general and administrative expense and gains and losses on the early repayment of debt are not allocable to any of our reportable segments.  Our CODM does not consider the book value of assets in making resource allocation decisions.

Following is the description of and basis for presentation for each of our segments.

Domestic Self-Storage Segment

The Domestic Self-Storage Segment includes the operations of the

2,187

self-storage facilities owned by the Company and the Subsidiaries, as well as our equity share of the Other Investments.  For all periods

presented, substantially all of our real estate facilities, goodwill and other intangible assets, other assets, and accrued and other liabilities are associated with the Domestic Self-Storage Segment.

European Self-Storage Segment

The European Self-Storage segment comprises our interest in Shurgard Europe, which has a separate management team reporting directly to our CODM and our joint venture partner.  The European Self-Storage segment includes our equity share of Shurgard Europe’s operations, the interest and other income received from Shurgard Europe, and foreign currency exchange gains and losses that are attributable to Shurgard Europe.  Our balance sheet includes an investment in Shurgard Europe (Note 4) and a loan receivable from Shurgard Europe (Note 5).

Commercial Segment

The Commercial segment comprises our investment in PSB, a publicly-traded REIT with a separate management team that makes its financing, capital allocation and other significant decisions.  The Commercial segment also includes our direct interest in certain commercial facilities, substantially all of which are managed by PSB.  The Commercial segment presentation includes our equity earnings and interest income from PSB, as well as the revenues and expenses of our commercial facilities.  At

December



, 2013, the assets of the Commercial segment are comprised principally of our investment in PSB (Note 4).

“

Reporting Amounts Classified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

,” (ASU No. 2013-02”)

which requires enhanced disclosures, in one place in our notes to financial statements, about items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income.  The adoption of ASU No. 2013-02 had no impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

Commitments and Contingencies

Contingent Losses

We are a party to various legal proceedings and subject to various claims and complaints; however, we believe that the likelihood of these contingencies resulting in a material loss to the Company, either individually or in the aggregate, is remote.

Insurance and Loss Exposure

We have historically carried customary property, earthquake, general liability, employee medic

al insurance

and workers compensation coverage through internationally recognized insurance carriers, subject to customary levels of deductibles.  The aggregate limits on these policies of approximately $


million for property losses and $


million for general liability losses are higher than estimates of maximum probable loss

es

that could occur from individual catastrophic events determined in recent engineering and actuarial studies; however, in case of multiple catastrophic events, these limits could be exhausted.

We reinsure a program that provides insurance to our

customers

from an independent third-party insurer.  This program covers tenant claims for losses to goods stored at our facilities as a result of specific named perils (earthquakes are not covered by this program), up to a maximum limit of $

5,000

per storage unit.  We reinsure all risks in this program, but purchase insurance from an independent third party i

nsurance company for aggregate claims between $

5.0

million and $

15.0

million per occurrence.

We are subject to licensing requirements and regulations in several states.  At

December



, 2013, there were approximately

759,000

certificate

s

held by our self-storage

customers

, representing aggregate coverage of approximately $

1.7

billion.

10.8

million in cash.

On

January 28, 2014

, our joint venture partner in Shurgard Europe acquired


% of our

€311.0

loan receivable from Shurgard Europe

at face value for

€158.6

million ($

216.2

million) in cash, and the maturity date of the loan receivable from Shurgard Europe was extended to

April 2019

.

At February 25, 2014, we had

no

outstanding borrowings on our Credit Facility and

$600.0
