INDEX


PART I.

Item 1.  Business

Overview

Ameriprise is a diversified financial services company with a 125-year history of providing solutions to help clients confidently achieve their financial objectives. Ameriprise Financial, Inc. is a holding company incorporated in Delaware that primarily engages in business through its subsidiaries. Accordingly, references to “Ameriprise,” “Ameriprise Financial,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” may refer to Ameriprise Financial, Inc. exclusively, to our entire family of companies, or to one or more of our subsidiaries. Our headquarters is located at 55 Ameriprise Financial Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55474. We also maintain executive offices in New York City.

We are a long-standing leader in financial planning and advice with $973 billion in assets under management and administration as of December 31, 2019. We offer a broad range of products and services designed to achieve individual and institutional clients’ financial objectives. Our strategy is centered on helping our clients confidently achieve their goals by providing holistic advice and by managing and protecting their assets and income. We utilize two go-to-market approaches in carrying out this strategy: Wealth Management and Asset Management.

Wealth Management

We are an industry-leading wealth manager with a differentiated advice value proposition. Our network of approximately 10,000 advisors is the primary means through which we engage in our wealth management activities. Accordingly, our wealth management capabilities are centered on the long-term, personal relationships between our clients and our financial advisors (our “advisors”). Through our affiliated advisors, we offer financial planning and advice, as well as banking and full-service brokerage services, primarily to retail clients. These products and services are designed to be used as solutions for our clients’ cash and liquidity, asset accumulation, income, protection, and estate and wealth transfer needs. The financial product solutions we offer through our advisors include the products of other companies as well as our own products and services. Our advisor network is the primary channel through which we offer our own life and disability income insurance as well as annuity products and services. Our focus on personal relationships, as demonstrated by our exclusive

Confident Retirement

®

approach to financial planning, allows us to address our clients’ evolving financial and retirement-related needs to help them live brilliantly, now and in the future. Over the years of responding to the needs of our clients and executing on our business strategy, we moved our target upmarket. Currently, our primary target market segment is the mass affluent and affluent (which we define as households with investable assets of more than $100,000), and increasingly those with $500,000 to $5,000,000 in investable assets.

Our advisors are a valued and crucial part of our business. As such, we offer our advisors training, tools, leadership, marketing programs and other field and centralized support to assist them in serving their clients. Our nationally recognized brand combined with our practice support, local marketing and field support, integrated operating platform, practice expansion and succession opportunities and comprehensive set of products and solutions creates a compelling value proposition for financial advisors. This is evidenced by our strong advisor retention rate and our ability to attract and retain experienced and productive advisors. We continuously invest in, develop, and refine capabilities and tools designed to maximize advisor productivity and client satisfaction.

We are in a compelling position to capitalize on significant demographic and market trends driving increased demand for financial advice and solutions. In the U.S., the ongoing transition of baby boomers into retirement continues to drive demand for financial advice and solutions. In addition, the amount of investable assets held by mass affluent and affluent households (our target market) has grown and now accounts for over half of U.S. investable assets. We believe our differentiated financial planning model, broad range of products and solutions, and demonstrated financial strength throughout times of economic and market uncertainty position us to capitalize on these trends and best serve our clients in achieving their goals.

Asset Management

Our asset management capabilities, represented by the

Columbia Threadneedle Investments

®

brand, are global in scale. We offer a broad spectrum of investment advice and products to individual, institutional and high-net worth investors. These investment products are primarily provided through third parties, though we also provide our asset management products through our advisor network. Our underlying asset management philosophy is rooted in delivering consistently strong, competitive investment performance. The quality and breadth of our asset management capabilities are demonstrated by 116 of our mutual funds being rated as four- and five-star funds by Morningstar. This strong short and long-term investment performance is further supported by our client-focused approach.

We are positioned to continue to grow our assets under management in the long-term and strengthen our asset management offerings to existing and new clients. We enjoy a significant benefit from key strategic relationships and have a strong institutional presence. Our asset management capabilities are well positioned to address mature markets in the U.S. and Europe. We also continue to leverage our existing strengths in order to effectively expand into new global and emerging markets. In the past few years, we have expanded beyond our traditional strengths in the U.S. and UK to gather assets in Continental Europe, Asia, Australia, the Middle East, South America and Africa. In addition, we continue to identify and pursue opportunities to leverage the collective capabilities of our global asset management business in order to enhance our current range of investment solutions, to develop new solutions and investment management strategies that are responsive to client demand in an increasingly complex marketplace, and to maximize the distribution capabilities of our global business.


Our Integrated Model and Shift in Business Mix

Financial markets and macroeconomic conditions have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our operating and performance results. In addition, the business, political and regulatory environments in which we operate are subject to elevated uncertainty and substantial, frequent change. Accordingly, we expect to continue focusing on our key strategic objectives and obtaining operational and strategic leverage from our core capabilities. The success of these and other strategies may be affected by the factors discussed below in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K - “Risk Factors” - and other factors as discussed herein.

The financial results from the businesses underlying our go-to-market approaches are reflected in our five operating segments:

•

Advice & Wealth Management;

•

Asset Management;

•

Annuities;

•

Protection; and

•

Corporate & Other.

We believe we offer a compelling and highly differentiated value proposition through our diversified and fully integrated model - as shown by nearly doubling earnings per share in the past five years and returning nearly $11 billion to shareholders in that timeframe, while retaining significant excess capital at December 31, 2019.

As a diversified financial services firm, we believe our ability to gather assets is best measured by our aggregate assets under management and administration metric. At December 31, 2019, we had $973 billion in assets under management and administration compared to $823 billion as of December 31, 2018. For a more detailed discussion of assets under management and administration, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.


The following chart shows our current business mix represented by the contributions of each segment to our pretax adjusted operating earnings (excluding Corporate & Other segment) as well as a historical comparison. As you can see, we continue to execute on our strategy to shift our business mix toward lower capital, fee-based business including Advice & Wealth Management, which is the growth engine of Ameriprise and now represents a majority of pretax adjusted operated earnings.

Our Principal Brands

We utilize multiple and distinct brands for the products and services because we believe doing so allows us to differentiate them in the marketplace.

History and Development

Our company has a 125 year history of providing solutions to help clients confidently achieve their financial objectives. Our earliest predecessor company, Investors Syndicate, was founded in 1894 to provide face-amount certificates to consumers with a need for conservative investments. In 1983, our company was formed as a Delaware corporation in connection with American Express’ acquisition of IDS Financial Services from Alleghany Corporation in 1984. We changed our name to “American Express Financial Corporation” (“AEFC”) and began marketing our products and services under the American Express brand in 1994. To provide retail clients with a more comprehensive set of products and services, we significantly expanded our offering of non-proprietary mutual funds in the late 1990s. In addition, we acquired the business of Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings in 2003 to enhance our global asset management capabilities.

On September 30, 2005, American Express consummated a distribution of the shares of AEFC to American Express shareholders, at which time we became an independent, publicly traded company and changed our name to “Ameriprise Financial, Inc.” In 2008, we completed the acquisitions of H&R Block Financial Advisors, Inc. and J. & W. Seligman & Co. Incorporated. In 2010, we completed the acquisition of the long-term asset management business of Columbia Management from Bank of America. In 2016, we completed the acquisition of Emerging Global Advisors, LLC, a registered investment advisor and provider of strategic beta portfolios based on emerging markets. In 2017, we acquired Investment Professionals, Inc. (“IPI”), an independent broker-dealer specializing in the on-site delivery of investment programs for financial institutions, including banks and credit unions. In 2017, we also acquired Lionstone


Partners, LLC, a leading national real estate investment firm, specializing in investment strategies based upon proprietary analytics. This inorganic growth has allowed us to significantly enhance the scale, performance, and product offerings of our brokerage, financial planning, retail mutual funds and institutional asset management business in order to best serve our clients.

In 2006, we sold our large-scale retirement plan recordkeeping business to Wachovia Bank, N.A. (now Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.). We initiated the disposition of our institutional trust and custody business to J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. in 2008, and completed that restructuring in early 2009. In 2011, we completed the sale of Securities America Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries to Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services, Inc. On October 1, 2019, we completed the sale of our Ameriprise Auto and Home Insurance business to American Family Insurance Mutual Holding Company (American Family Insurance).

In 2018, we made the strategic decision to seek to expand the banking products and services we can provide directly to our clients, and commenced the process to convert our subsidiary Ameriprise National Trust Bank into a federal savings bank with the capabilities to offer FDIC insured deposits and a range of lending products. We completed that process, received regulatory approvals and converted Ameriprise National Trust Bank to Ameriprise Bank, FSB in May 2019, at which time Ameriprise Financial became a savings and loan holding company that is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Board of Governors for the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”). In connection with the conversion, Ameriprise Financial elected to be classified as a financial holding company subject to applicable regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (as amended).

Our Organization

The following is a depiction of the organizational structure for our company and the primary subsidiaries (identified by their current legal entity names) through which we operate our businesses.

The following is a brief description of the business and activities conducted by each subsidiary noted above.


Our Segments - Advice & Wealth Management

Our Advice & Wealth Management segment provides financial planning and advice, as well as full-service brokerage services, primarily to retail clients through our financial advisors. These services are centered on long-term, personal relationships between our advisors and our clients and focus on helping clients confidently achieve their financial goals. Our financial advisors provide a distinctive, holistic approach to financial planning and have access to a broad selection of both affiliated and non-affiliated products to help clients meet their financial needs and goals.

A significant portion of revenues in this segment are fee-based and driven by the level of client assets, which is impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. We also earn net investment income on owned assets from certificate and banking products. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for providing non-affiliated products and intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for providing our affiliated products and services to our retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment. All intersegment activity is eliminated in our consolidated results.

Our Financial Advisor Platform

With approximately 10,000 advisors, we are a top 5 branded platform in the U.S. market where we provide our services. Advisors can choose to affiliate with us in multiple ways, and each option offers different levels of support and compensation. The affiliation options are:

•

Employee Advisors (Ameriprise Advisor Group).

Under this option, an advisor is an employee of our company and receives a higher level of support, including leadership, training, office space and staff support. We pay compensation that is competitive with other employee advisor models, which is generally lower than that of our franchisee advisors in exchange for the higher level of support we provide our employee advisors. Some employee advisors work in the Ameriprise Advisor Center (“AAC”), our dedicated platform for remote-based sales and service to Ameriprise retail customers using a team model.

•

Franchisee Advisors (Ameriprise Franchise Group).

Under this option, an advisor is an independent contractor franchisee who affiliates with our company and has the right to use the Ameriprise brand. We pay our franchisee advisors a higher payout rate than our employee advisors as they are responsible for paying their own overhead, staff compensation and other


business expenses. In addition, our franchisee advisors pay a franchise association fee and other fees in exchange for the support we offer and the right to use our brand name. The support we offer to our franchisee advisors includes generalist and specialist leadership support, technology platforms and tools, training and marketing programs.

•

Bank Channel Advisors (Ameriprise Financial Institutions Group).

Our acquisition of IPI in 2017 added a new capability where we specialize in the on-site delivery of investment programs for financial institutions including banks and credit unions. Within this channel, we have different types of relationships with our financial institution partners and a variety of ways for advisors to affiliate with us.

We are committed to providing our advisors with the resources and support necessary to manage and grow their practices. Our platform offers advisors (and therefore clients) the flexibility of operating on a commission-based brokerage basis as well as on a fee-based advisory basis. Advisors have access to training and materials reflecting our differentiated financial planning model and

Confident Retirement

planning approach, our nationally recognized brand and

“Be Brilliant

®

”

advertising campaign, local marketing support capabilities and our full range of proprietary and non-proprietary advice and product solutions. Our advisor practices also benefit from Ameriprise’s demonstrated financial strength and our dedication to our clients. We expect to continue to invest in our advisor platform, with the goal of continuing to best serve our clients, increasing advisor productivity, and improving our ability to attract and retain advisors.

Our nationwide advisor network consisted of approximately 10,000 advisors as of December 31, 2019, which includes over 2,100 employee advisors and advisors in our bank channel as well as approximately 7,800 independent franchisees or employees or contractors of franchisees. Of these advisors, roughly 56% have been with us for more than 10 years, with an average tenure of over 20 years. Among advisors who have been with us for more than 10 years, we have a retention rate of approximately 95%. We believe our strong advisor retention rate, as well as our ability to recruit experienced advisors, speaks to the value proposition we offer our advisors and clients.

Through our advisors, we offer clients a diversified set of cash and liquidity management, asset accumulation, income, protection, and estate and wealth transfer products and services, as well as a broad selection of financial products from other unaffiliated companies (as described below).

Brokerage and Investment Advisory Services

Financial Planning and Advice Services

Our personalized financial planning approach is designed to focus on all aspects of our clients’ finances. After understanding our clients’ needs, our advisors seek to identify solutions to address those needs across four cornerstones: cash and liabilities, investments, protection, and taxes. We believe this approach helps our clients build a solid financial foundation, persevere through difficult economies and challenging markets, and ultimately achieve their financial goals. We offer a broad array of products and services in each of these categories, including those carrying the Ameriprise Financial, Columbia Management, Columbia Threadneedle Investments or RiverSource name, as well as solutions offered by unaffiliated firms.

Our advisors deliver financial solutions to our advisory clients principally by building long-term personal relationships through financial planning that is responsive to clients’ evolving needs, priorities and goals, in part through our exclusive

Confident Retirement

approach. This approach involves a comprehensive assessment of retirement income sources and assets, a client’s plans and goals for retirement, and an analysis of what is needed to fund the four principal types of expenses and liabilities encountered during retirement: covering essentials, ensuring lifestyle, preparing for the unexpected, and leaving a legacy. Once a financial planning client and their advisor align on a client’s objectives, the advisor recommends a solution set consisting of actions and offers products to address those objectives. In continued partnership with their advisor, a client then identifies what they determine to be an appropriate range and level of market risk. Our financial planning relationships with our clients are characterized by an ability to understand their specific needs, which enables us to help them meet those needs, achieve high overall client satisfaction and retention, hold more products in their accounts and increase our assets under management.

Our financial planning clients pay a fee for the receipt of financial planning services. This fee is based on the complexity of a client’s financial and life situation and their advisor’s experience. Some of our clients may elect to pay a consolidated, asset-based advisory fee for financial planning and managed account services and administration. If clients elect to implement their financial plan with our company, we and our advisors generally receive a sales commission and/or sales load in addition to other revenues for the products that they purchase from us. These commissions, sales loads and other revenues are separate from, and in addition to, the financial planning and advisory fees we and our advisors may receive.

Brokerage and Other Products and Services

We offer our retail and institutional clients a variety of brokerage and other investment products and services.

Our

Ameriprise ONE

®

Financial Account is a single integrated financial management brokerage account that enables clients to access a single cash account to fund a variety of financial transactions, including investments in mutual funds, individual securities, alternative investments, cash products, and margin and securities-based lending.

We provide securities execution and clearing services for our retail and institutional clients through our registered broker-dealer subsidiaries. Clients can use our online brokerage service to purchase and sell securities, obtain proprietary and independent research (including information about a wide variety of securities) and use self-directed asset allocation and other financial planning tools. We


offer exchange traded mutual funds, 529 plans, public non-exchange traded real estate investment trusts, structured notes, private equity and other alternative investments issued by unaffiliated companies. We also offer trading and portfolio strategy services across a number of fixed income categories, including treasuries, municipals, corporate, and mortgage- and asset-backed securities on both a proprietary and agency basis.

From time to time, Ameriprise may participate in syndicate offerings of closed-end funds and preferred securities. Syndicates are groups of investment banks and broker-dealers that jointly underwrite and distribute new security offerings to the investing public. Our clients may purchase, for their own account, the closed-end fund shares and preferred stock of such primary offerings in which we participate. In addition, qualified clients may purchase certain privately placed securities as distributed through Ameriprise.

Fee-based Investment Advisory Accounts

We offer all new fee-based investment advisory accounts to clients through a single Custom Advisory Relationship (“Relationship”). We offer several types of investment advisory accounts through the Relationship. The following programs, Ameriprise® Strategic Portfolio Service (SPS) Advantage, Ameriprise® SPS Advisor, Ameriprise® Active Portfolios®, Ameriprise® Select Separate Account, Ameriprise® Investor Unified Account, Ameriprise® Vista Separate Account and Ameriprise® Access Account are offered through the Relationship.  Clients may purchase mutual funds and other securities in connection with the Relationship in one or more fee-based investment advisory accounts. We currently offer discretionary and nondiscretionary investment advisory accounts. In a discretionary advisory account, we (or an unaffiliated investment advisor) choose the underlying investments in the portfolio on behalf of the client. In a non-discretionary advisory account, clients choose the underlying investments in the portfolio based on their financial advisor’s recommendation. Investors in discretionary and non-discretionary advisory accounts generally pay a fee (for investment advice and other services) based on the assets held in that account as well as any related fees or costs associated with the underlying securities held in that account. A significant portion of our affiliated mutual fund sales are made through advisory accounts. Client assets held in affiliated mutual funds within an advisory account generally produce higher revenues for us than client assets held in affiliated mutual funds on a stand-alone basis. This is because, as noted above, we receive an investment advisory fee based on the asset values of the assets held in an advisory account in addition to revenues we normally receive for investment management and/or distribution of the funds included in the account.

Ameriprise Strategic Portfolio Service (SPS) Advantage, is a non-discretionary investment advisory account service, Ameriprise SPS Advisor, is a discretionary investment advisory account service, Ameriprise Select Separate Accounts (a separately managed account (“SMA”) program), a discretionary investment advisory account service through which clients invest in strategies managed by affiliated and non-affiliated advisory service providers, and Ameriprise Active Portfolios® investments, a discretionary investment advisory account service that offers a number of strategic target allocations based on different risk profiles and tax sensitivities. Additionally, we offer the following discretionary investment advisory account services Ameriprise® Select Separate Account, Ameriprise® Investor Unified Account, Ameriprise® Vista Separate Account and Ameriprise® Access Account, through which clients may invest in SMAs, mutual funds and exchange traded funds. We also offer a discretionary investment advisory account as an accommodation program where client accounts are held and serviced by a third-party asset management provider and its affiliates.

Mutual Fund Offerings (Unaffiliated and Affiliated)

In addition to the

Columbia Management

family of funds (discussed below in “Our Segments - Asset Management - Product and Service Offerings - U.S. Registered Funds”), we offer mutual funds from approximately 160 unaffiliated mutual fund families representing more than 2,200 mutual funds on our brokerage platform and as part of our investment advisory accounts to provide our clients a broad choice of investment products. In 2019, retail sales of other companies’ mutual funds accounted for the substantial majority of our total retail mutual fund sales.

Mutual fund families of other companies generally pay us a portion of the revenue generated from the sales of those funds and from the ongoing management of fund assets attributable to our clients’ ownership of shares of those funds. These payments enable us to offer a broad and robust product set to our clients and provide beneficial client services, tools and infrastructure such as our website and online brokerage platform. We also receive administrative services fees from most mutual funds sold through our advisor network.

Insurance and Annuities

We offer insurance and annuities issued by the RiverSource Life companies (discussed below in “Business - Our Segments - Annuities” and in “Business - Our Segments - Protection”). The

RiverSource

insurance solutions available to our retail clients include universal life insurance, indexed universal life insurance, variable universal life insurance, traditional term life insurance and disability income insurance.

RiverSource

annuities include fixed annuities and fixed index annuities, as well as variable annuities that allow our clients to choose from a number of underlying investment options, including volatility management options, and to purchase certain guaranteed benefit riders. In addition to

RiverSource

insurance and annuity products, our advisors offer products from unaffiliated carriers on a limited basis, including variable annuities, life insurance and long term care insurance products issued by a select number of unaffiliated insurance companies. Ameriprise Financial Institutions Group currently offers certain additional fixed and variable insurance as well as annuity products available only through our bank channel.

We receive a portion of the revenue generated from the sale of life and disability insurance policies of unaffiliated insurance companies. We are paid distribution fees on annuities sales of unaffiliated insurance companies based on a portion of the revenue generated from such sales and asset levels. These insurance companies may also pay us an administrative service fee in connection with the sale of their products.


Cash Management and Banking Products

Our Advice & Wealth Management segment currently offers (in some cases through a strategic partner) a variety of products including broker sweep programs, cash management accounts, margin loans and personal loans collateralized by investments. The broker sweep programs, the

Ameriprise

Insured Money Market Account (“AIMMA”) and Ameriprise Bank Insured Sweep Account (“ABISA”), provide an automatic “sweep” of available cash balances in its clients’ brokerage accounts into FDIC-insured deposit accounts. We believe the availability of these products play a key role in our Advice and Wealth Management business because they allow us to offer our clients a FDIC-insured alternative to other cash investment products. This suite of cash management products and capabilities will allow our clients to consolidate their assets with us while providing convenient access and flexible, high-quality service.

We have expanded our banking operations and products recently (as discussed above in “Business - History and Development”) and are in the process of rolling out a suite of banking products. Ameriprise Bank currently makes available Ameriprise-branded credit cards and serves clients through its Personal Trust Services division of Ameriprise Bank. Personal Trust Services provides personal trust, custodial, agency and investment management services to help meet estate and wealth transfer needs of individual and corporate clients of our affiliated advisors. Personal Trust Services also uses some of our investment products in connection with its services. Ameriprise Bank generally receives an asset-based fee for investment advice and other services based on assets managed.

Moving forward, Ameriprise Bank plans to offer (in some cases through a strategic partner) a more robust set of banking products including checking and savings accounts, mortgage financing and home equity lines of credit. Ameriprise Bank's strategy and operations are focused on serving affiliated advisor clients. We provide our banking products primarily through our affiliated advisors and believe the availability of these products supports our financial advisors’ ability to meet the cash and liquidity needs of our clients.

Face-Amount Certificates

We issue different types of face-amount certificates through Ameriprise Certificate Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ameriprise Financial. Ameriprise Certificate Company is registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“Investment Company Act”). Owners of our certificates invest funds and, at the end of a stated term or upon demand, are entitled to receive a determinable amount of money equal to their aggregate investments in the certificate plus interest at rates we determine, less early withdrawals and related penalties, if applicable. For certain types of certificate products, the rate of interest is calculated in whole or in part based on any upward movement in a broad-based stock market index up to a maximum return, where the maximum is a fixed rate for a given term, but can be changed at our discretion for prospective terms.

As of December 31, 2019, we had $7.5 billion in total certificate reserves underlying our certificate products. Our earnings are based upon the difference, or “spread,” between the interest rates credited to certificate holders and the interest earned on the cash invested. A portion of these earnings is used to compensate the various affiliated entities that provide management, administrative and other services to our company for these products. In times of weak performance in the equity markets, certificate sales are generally stronger.

Financial Wellness Program

Through our Financial Wellness Program, we provide workplace financial planning and educational programs to employees of major corporations, small businesses and school district employees. In addition, we provide training and support to financial advisors working on-site at company locations. These advisors present educational seminars, conduct one-on-one meetings and participate in client educational events. We also provide financial advice service offerings, such as financial planning and executive financial services, which are tailored to distinct employee segments.

Strategic Alliances and Other Marketing Arrangements

We use strategic marketing alliances, local marketing programs for our advisors, and on-site workshops through our Business Alliances group to generate new clients for our financial planning and other financial services. An important aspect of our strategy is creating alliances that help us generate new financial services clients within our target market segment - the mass affluent and affluent, and increasingly those with $500,000 to $5,000,000 in investable assets. Our alliance arrangements are generally for a limited duration of one to five years with an option to renew. Additionally, these types of marketing arrangements typically provide that either party may terminate the agreements on short notice, usually about sixty days. We compensate our alliance partners for providing opportunities to market to their clients.

Our Segments - Asset Management

Through Columbia Threadneedle Investments, our Asset Management segment provides investment management, advice and products to retail, high net worth and institutional clients on a global scale.

Columbia Management primarily provides products and services in the U.S. and Threadneedle primarily provides products and services internationally. As noted above, we refer to the group of companies in Ameriprise Asset Management Holdings GmbH and Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Sarl as “Threadneedle.” “Columbia Threadneedle Investments” refers to both Columbia Management and Threadneedle and reflects the global manner in which we think about and operate our asset management business, which is in line with the

Columbia Threadneedle Investments

brand. We offer U.S. retail clients a range of products through both unaffiliated third-party financial institutions and our Advice & Wealth Management segment. We provide institutional products and services through our institutional sales force. Retail products for non-U.S. retail investors are primarily distributed through third-party


financial institutions and unaffiliated financial advisors. Retail products include U.S. mutual funds and their non-U.S. equivalents, exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) and variable product funds underlying insurance and annuity separate accounts. Institutional asset management services are designed to meet specific client objectives and may involve a range of products, including those that focus on traditional asset classes, separately managed accounts, collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), hedge fund or alternative strategies, collective funds and property funds. CLOs, hedge fund or alternative strategies and certain private funds are often classified as alternative assets. Our Asset Management segment also provides all intercompany asset management services for Ameriprise Financial subsidiaries. The fees for such services are reflected within the Asset Management segment results through intersegment transfer pricing. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management and Annuities and Protection segments. All intersegment activity is eliminated in our consolidated results.

Revenues in the Asset Management segment are primarily earned as fees based on managed asset balances, which are impacted by market movements, net asset flows, asset allocation and product mix. We may also earn performance fees from certain accounts where investment performance meets or exceeds certain pre-identified targets. At December 31, 2019, our Asset Management segment had $494.2 billion in worldwide managed assets.

Managed assets include managed external client assets and managed owned assets. Managed external client assets include client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the

Columbia Threadneedle Investments

fund families and the assets of institutional clients. Managed external client assets also include assets managed by sub-advisers we select. Our external client assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, although certain investment funds marketed to investors may be consolidated at certain times. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on consolidation principles. Managed owned assets include certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries) for which the Asset Management segment provides management services and receives management fees. For additional details regarding our assets under management and administration, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Investment Management Capabilities

The investment management activities of Columbia Threadneedle Investments are conducted through investment management teams located in multiple locations, including Boston, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, London, Minneapolis, New York, Menlo Park, Portland and Singapore. Each investment management team may focus on particular investment strategies, asset types, products and on services offered and distribution channels utilized. Within the global asset management business, we deploy our investment teams across multiple jurisdictions pursuant to sub-advisory and personnel sharing arrangements on an intercompany basis.

Our investment management capabilities span a broad range of asset classes and investment styles. The portfolios underlying our product and service offerings may focus on providing solutions to investors through one or more U.S. or non-U.S. equity, fixed income, bank loan, property, multi-asset allocation, alternative (including real estate and liquid alternatives) or other asset classes. The strategies utilized in the management of such portfolios varies depending on the needs and desired outcomes or objectives of individual and institutional investors. We continually assess these capabilities to help ensure our product and services offerings are responsive to the evolving needs of our clients.

Product and Service Offerings

We offer a broad spectrum of investment management, advice and products to individual, institutional and high-net worth investors. In an effort to address changing market conditions and the evolving needs of investors, we may from time to time develop and offer new retail and institutional investment products with new and/or innovative investment strategies, including U.S. mutual funds and their non-U.S. equivalents, ETFs, separately managed accounts, hedge or alternative funds, and other private funds, CLOs and collective funds. Below is an overview of our Asset Management offerings.

U.S. Registered Funds

We provide investment advisory, distribution, and other services to the

Columbia Management

family of funds. The

Columbia Management

family of funds includes retail mutual funds, exchange-listed ETFs and U.S. closed-end funds and variable insurance trust funds (“VIT Funds”). Retail mutual funds are available through unaffiliated third-party financial institutions and the

Ameriprise

®

financial advisor network. VIT Funds are available as underlying investment options in variable annuity and variable life insurance products, including

RiverSource

®

products. The

Columbia Management

family of funds includes domestic and international equity funds, fixed income funds, cash management funds, balanced funds, specialty funds, absolute return and other alternative funds and asset allocation funds, including fund-of-funds, with a variety of investment objectives. The

Columbia Management

family of funds also uses sub-advisers to diversify the product offerings it makes available to investors on its VIT Funds and retail mutual funds platforms. At December 31, 2019, our sponsored U.S. retail mutual funds, ETFs, and U.S. closed-end funds had total managed assets of $164.7 billion in 148 funds. The VIT Funds that we sponsor and manage had total managed assets at December 31, 2019 of $76.8 billion in 70 funds.

Columbia Management serves as investment manager for most of our U.S. mutual funds as well as our exchange-listed ETFs and U.S. closed-end funds. Columbia Wanger Asset Management, LLC (“Columbia Wanger”), a subsidiary of Columbia Management, also serves as investment manager for certain funds, which are included in the totals noted in the preceding paragraph. In addition, several of our subsidiaries perform related services for the funds, including distribution, accounting, administrative and transfer


agency services. Columbia Management and Columbia Wanger perform investment management services pursuant to contracts with the U.S. registered funds that are subject to renewal by the fund boards within two years after initial implementation, and on an annual basis thereafter. We earn management fees for managing the assets of the

Columbia Management

family of mutual funds based on the underlying asset values. We also earn fees by providing related services to the

Columbia Management

family of funds.

Non-U.S. Funds

Threadneedle offers a fund product range that includes different risk-return options across regions, markets, asset classes and product structures, which include retail funds that are similar to U.S. mutual funds. These funds are marketed to non-U.S. persons and the majority are often referred to as UCITS products (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities). UCITS and other funds offered by Threadneedle typically are structured as Open Ended Investment Companies (“OEICs”) in the UK and as Société d'investissement à Capital Variable (“SICAVs”) in Luxembourg, as well as unit trusts. Threadneedle also sponsors, manages and offers UK property funds that invest in UK real estate. Many of our non-U.S. fund offerings are registered in and distributed across multiple jurisdictions. For example, our SICAVs are offered in many jurisdictions and are now our primary offering to investors outside of the UK and U.S. At December 31, 2019, our non-U.S. retail funds had total managed assets of $45.9 billion in 156 funds.

Threadneedle Asset Management Ltd. serves as investment manager for most of our non-U.S. fund products and earns management fees based on underlying asset values for managing the assets of these funds. Certain Threadneedle affiliates also earn fees by providing ancillary services to the funds. In addition, certain non-U.S. funds or portions of the portfolios underlying such funds may receive sub-advisory services, including services provided by both Columbia Threadneedle Investments personnel and other unaffiliated advisers.

Separately Managed Accounts

We provide a range of global investment management services, including pension, profit-sharing, employee savings, sovereign wealth funds and endowment funds, accounts of large- and medium-sized businesses and governmental clients, as well as the accounts of high-net-worth individuals and smaller institutional clients, including tax-exempt and not-for-profit organizations. Our services include investment of funds on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis and related services including trading, cash management and reporting. We offer various fixed income, equity and alternative investment strategies for our institutional clients with separately managed accounts. Columbia Management and Threadneedle distribute products of the other under the

Columbia Threadneedle Investments

brand, including Threadneedle’s offering various investment strategies of Columbia Management to non-U.S. clients and Columbia Management’s offering of certain investment strategies of Threadneedle to U.S. clients.

For our investment management services, we generally receive fees based on the market value of managed assets pursuant to contracts the client can terminate on short notice. Clients may also pay us fees based on the performance of their portfolio. At December 31, 2019, within our

Columbia Threadneedle Investments

asset management business we managed a total of $116.2 billion in assets under this range of services.

Management of Owned Assets

We provide investment management services and include management fees for certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as the assets held in the general account of our RiverSource Life companies and assets held by Ameriprise Certificate Company and Ameriprise Bank. Our fixed income team manages the general account assets to produce a consolidated and targeted rate of return on investments based on a certain level of risk. Our fixed income and equity teams also manage separate account assets. The Asset Management segment’s management of owned assets for Ameriprise Financial subsidiaries is reviewed by the boards of directors and staff functions of the applicable subsidiaries consistent with regulatory investment requirements. At December 31, 2019, the Asset Management segment managed $41.9 billion of owned assets.

Management of Collateralized Loan Obligations (“CLOs”)

Columbia Threadneedle Investments has a team of investment professionals who provide collateral management services to special purpose vehicles which primarily invest in syndicated bank loans and issue multiple tranches of securities collateralized by the assets of each pool to provide investors with various maturity and credit risk characteristics. For collateral management of CLOs, we earn fees based on the par value of assets and, in certain instances, we may also receive performance-based fees. At December 31, 2019, we managed $2.4 billion of assets related to CLOs.

Private Funds

We also provide investment management and related services to private, pooled investment vehicles organized as limited partnerships, limited liability companies, or foreign (non-U.S.) entities. These funds are currently exempt from registration under the Investment Company Act under either Section 3(c)(1), Section 3(c)(5), Section 3(c)(7) or related interpretative relief and are organized as U.S. and non-U.S. funds. These funds are subject to local regulation in the jurisdictions where they are formed or marketed. For investment management services, we generally receive fees based on the market value of assets under management, and we may also receive performance-based fees. As of December 31, 2019, we managed $4.5 billion in private fund assets.

Lionstone Investments, a subsidiary of Columbia Management, also serves as investment manager for certain private funds (in addition to separate accounts), which are included in the totals noted in the preceding paragraph.


Ameriprise Trust Company - Collective Funds and Separately Managed Accounts

Collective funds are investment funds sponsored by ATC (our Minnesota-chartered trust company); these funds are exempt from registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and are offered to certain qualified institutional clients such as retirement, pension, and profit-sharing plans. Columbia Management currently serves as investment adviser to ATC with respect to a series of ATC collective funds covering a broad spectrum of investment strategies for which ATC serves as trustee. ATC receives fees for its investment management services to the collective funds, and Columbia Management receives fees from ATC pursuant to an agreement with ATC for the investment advisory services provided by Columbia Management. The fees payable to ATC and Columbia Management are generally based upon a percentage of assets under management. In addition to its collective funds, ATC serves as investment manager to separately managed accounts for qualified institutional clients.

As of December 31, 2019, we managed $6.5 billion of ATC Funds and separate accounts for ATC clients. This amount does not include the

Columbia Management

family of funds held in other retirement plans because these assets are included under assets managed for institutional and retail clients and within the “Product and Service Offerings - U.S. Registered Funds” section above.

Sub-advised Accounts

In addition, we act as sub-adviser for certain U.S. and non-U.S. funds, private banking individually managed accounts, common trust funds, and other portfolios sponsored or advised by other firms. As with our affiliated funds, we earn management fees for these sub-advisory services based on the underlying asset value of the funds and accounts we sub-advise. For these accounts, we may also receive fees based on the performance of the underlying portfolio. As of December 31, 2019, we managed $35.3 billion in assets in a sub-advisory capacity.

Distribution

We maintain distribution teams and capabilities that support the sales, marketing, and support of the products and services of our global asset management business. These distribution activities are generally organized into two major categories: retail distribution and institutional/high net worth distribution.

Retail Distribution

Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. acts as the principal underwriter and distributor of our

Columbia Management

family of funds. Pursuant to distribution agreements with the funds, we offer and sell fund shares on a continuous basis and pay certain costs associated with the marketing and selling of shares. We earn commissions for distributing the

Columbia Management

funds through sales charges (front-end or back-end loads) on certain classes of shares and distribution (12b-1) and servicing-related fees based on a percentage of fund assets and receive intersegment allocation payments. This revenue is impacted by overall asset levels and mix of the funds.

Columbia Management

fund shares are sold through both our Advice & Wealth Management segment and through unaffiliated third-party financial intermediaries, including U.S. Trust and Bank of America (from whom we acquired Columbia Management in 2010). Fees and reimbursements paid to such intermediaries may vary based on sales, redemptions, asset values, asset allocation, product mix, and marketing and support activities provided by the intermediary. Intersegment distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management Segment are eliminated in our consolidated results.

Threadneedle

funds are sold primarily through financial intermediaries and institutions, including banks, life insurance companies, independent financial advisers, wealth managers and platforms offering a variety of investment products. Threadneedle also distributes directly to certain clients. Various Threadneedle affiliates serve as the distributors of these fund offerings and are authorized to engage in such activities in numerous countries across Europe, the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific region and Africa. Certain

Threadneedle

fund offerings, such as its UCITS products, may be distributed on a cross-border basis while others are distributed exclusively in local markets.

Institutional and High Net Worth Distribution

We offer separately managed account services and certain funds to high net worth clients and to a variety of institutional clients, including pension plans, employee savings plans, foundations, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, corporations, banks, trusts, governmental entities, high-net-worth individuals and not-for-profit organizations. We provide investment management services for insurance companies, including our insurance subsidiaries. We also provide a variety of services for our institutional clients that sponsor retirement plans. We have dedicated institutional sales teams that market directly to such institutional clients. We concentrate on establishing strong relationships with both institutional clients as well as leading global and national consultancy firms across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Australia.

Our Segments - Annuities

Our Annuities segment provides

RiverSource

variable and fixed annuity products to individual clients. Our solutions in this segment and our Protection segment help us deliver on our

Confident Retirement

approach.

The RiverSource Life companies provide variable and fixed annuity products through our advisors. These products are designed to help individuals address their asset accumulation and income goals. Revenues for our variable annuity products are primarily earned as fees based on underlying account balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. Revenues for our fixed deferred annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on the RiverSource Life companies’ general account


assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. We also earn net investment income on general account assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities with a non-life contingent feature and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business. Revenues for our immediate annuities with a life contingent feature are earned as premium revenue. Intersegment revenues for this segment reflect fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of VIT Funds previously discussed (see “Business - Our Segments - Asset Management - Product and Service Offerings - U.S. Registered Funds,” above) under the variable annuity contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment. All intersegment activity is eliminated in our consolidated results.

Our annuity products include deferred variable and fixed annuities as well as immediate annuities. The relative proportion between fixed and variable annuity sales is generally driven by the relative performance of the equity and fixed income markets. Fixed sales are generally stronger when yields available in the fixed income markets are relatively high. Variable sales are generally stronger in times of superior performance in equity markets. The relative proportion between fixed and variable annuity sales is also influenced by product design and other factors. In addition to the revenues we generate on any fixed investment option available within our variable annuity products, we also receive fees charged on assets allocated to our separate accounts to cover administrative costs and a portion of the management fees from the underlying investment accounts in which assets are invested, as discussed below under “Variable Annuities.” Investment management performance is critical to the profitability of our

RiverSource

annuity business.

Variable Annuities

A variable annuity provides a contractholder with investment returns linked to underlying investment accounts of the contractholder’s choice. The underlying investment account options may include the VIT Funds previously discussed (see “Business - Our Segments - Asset Management - Product and Service Offerings - U.S. Registered Funds,” above) and variable portfolio funds offered through unaffiliated companies.

Contract purchasers can choose to add optional benefits to their contracts for an additional fee, including but not limited to, certain guaranteed minimum death benefits (individually, “GMDB”), a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (“GMWB”) and a guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit (“GMAB”). Approximately 99% of RiverSource Life's overall variable annuity assets include a GMDB and approximately 64% of RiverSource Life's overall variable annuity assets include a GMWB or GMAB. In general, these features can help protect contractholders and beneficiaries from a shortfall in death benefits, accumulation value or lifetime income due to a decline in the value of their underlying investment accounts. In January 2020 we launched a new structured annuity product that we believe will diversify our annuity offerings away from living benefit features.

The general account assets of the RiverSource Life insurance subsidiaries support the contractual obligations under the guaranteed benefit they offer (see “Business - Our Segments - Asset Management - Product and Service Offerings - Management of Owned Assets” above). As a result, we bear the risk that protracted under-performance of the financial markets could result in guaranteed benefit payments being higher than what current account values would support. Our exposure to risk from guaranteed benefits generally will increase when equity markets decline. Similarly, our guaranteed benefit reserves will generally increase when interest rates decline.

RiverSource

variable annuities generally provide us with fee-based revenue in the form of mortality and expense risk fees, marketing support and administrative fees, fees charged for optional benefits and features elected by the contractholder, and other contract charges. Our new structured annuity introduced in 2020 does not have mortality and expense fees. We receive marketing support payments from the VIT Funds underlying our variable annuity products as well as Rule 12b-1 distribution and servicing-related fees from the VIT Funds and the underlying funds of other companies. In addition, we receive marketing support payments from other companies’ funds included as investment options in our

RiverSource

variable annuity products.

Fixed Annuities

RiverSource

fixed deferred annuity products provide a contractholder with contract value that increases by a fixed or indexed interest rate. We periodically reset rates at our discretion subject to certain contract terms establishing guaranteed minimum interest crediting rates. Our earnings from fixed deferred annuities are based upon the spread between rates earned on assets purchased with fixed deferred annuity deposits and the rates at which interest is credited to our

RiverSource

fixed deferred annuity contracts. New contracts issued provide guaranteed minimum interest rates in compliance with state laws. Immediate annuity products provide a contractholder a guaranteed fixed income payment for life or the term of the contract.

Distribution

Our RiverSource Distributors subsidiary is a registered broker-dealer that serves both as the principal underwriter and distributor of

RiverSource

variable and fixed annuities through AFS. Our advisor network is the largest distributor of

RiverSource

annuity products, although advisors can offer variable annuities from selected unaffiliated insurers as well.

Liabilities and Reserves for Annuities

We maintain adequate financial reserves to cover the risks associated with guaranteed benefit provisions added to variable annuity contracts in addition to liabilities arising from fixed and variable annuity base contracts. You can find a discussion of liabilities and


reserves related to our annuity products in Part II, Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K - “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” as well as in Note 2, Note 11, Note 12 and Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Financial Strength Ratings

Our insurance company subsidiaries that issue

RiverSource

annuity products receive ratings from independent rating organizations. Ratings are important to maintain public confidence in our insurance subsidiaries and our protection and annuity products. For a discussion of the financial strength ratings of our insurance company subsidiaries, see the “Our Segments - Protection - Financial Strength Ratings” section below.

Our Segments - Protection

Our Protection segment provides a variety of products to address the protection and risk management needs of our retail clients, including life and disability income insurance. These products are designed to provide a lifetime of solutions that allow clients to protect income, grow assets and leave a legacy.

Life and disability income products are primarily provided through our advisors. We issue insurance policies through our

RiverSource

life insurance subsidiaries. The primary sources of revenues for this segment are premiums, fees and charges we receive to assume insurance-related risk. We earn net investment income on owned assets supporting insurance reserves and capital supporting the business. We also receive fees based on the level of the RiverSource Life companies’ separate account assets supporting variable universal life investment options. This segment earns intersegment revenues from fees paid by our Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of VIT Funds under the variable universal life contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by our Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by our Asset Management segment. All intersegment activity is eliminated in consolidation.

RiverSource Insurance Products

Through the RiverSource Life companies, we issue universal life insurance, indexed universal life insurance, variable universal life insurance, traditional life insurance and disability income insurance. Universal life insurance is a form of permanent life insurance characterized by flexible premiums, flexible death benefits and unbundled pricing factors (i.e., mortality, interest and expenses). Variable universal life insurance combines the premium and death benefit flexibility of universal life with underlying fund investment flexibility and the risks associated therewith. Traditional life insurance refers to whole and term life insurance policies. Traditional life insurance typically pays a specified sum to a beneficiary upon death of the insured for a fixed premium. We also offer our clients various riders and alternatives, such as an accelerated benefit rider for chronic illness on our permanent insurance products and a universal life insurance product with long term care benefits.

Our sales of

RiverSource

individual life insurance in 2019, as measured by scheduled annual premiums, lump sum and excess premiums and single premiums, consisted of approximately 71% universal life, 26% variable universal life and 3% traditional life. Our RiverSource Life companies issue only non-participating life insurance policies that do not pay dividends to policyholders from the insurer’s earnings.

Assets supporting policy values associated with fixed account life insurance products, as well as those assets associated with fixed account investment options under variable insurance products (collectively referred to as the “fixed accounts”), are part of the RiverSource Life companies’ general accounts. Under fixed accounts, the RiverSource Life companies bear the investment risk. More information regarding the RiverSource Life companies’ general accounts is found under “Business - Our Segments - Asset Management - Product and Service Offerings - Management of Owned Assets” above.

Variable Universal Life Insurance

Variable universal life insurance provides life insurance coverage along with investment returns linked to underlying investment accounts of the policyholder’s choice. Investment options may include the VIT Funds discussed above, Portfolio Navigator and Portfolio Stabilizer funds of funds, an index-linked option, as well as variable portfolio funds offered through unaffiliated companies.

Universal Life Insurance and Traditional Whole Life Insurance

Universal life and traditional whole life insurance policies do not subject the policyholder to the investment risks associated with variable universal life insurance.

RiverSource

universal life insurance products provide life insurance coverage and cash value that increases by a fixed interest rate. The rate is periodically reset at the discretion of the issuing company subject to certain policy terms relative to minimum interest crediting rates. Certain universal life policies offered by RiverSource Life provide secondary guarantee benefits. The secondary guarantee ensures that, subject to specified conditions, the policy will not terminate and will continue to provide a death benefit even if there is insufficient policy value to cover the monthly deductions and charges.

RiverSource

indexed universal life insurance (“IUL”) provides lifetime insurance protection and asset growth through index-linked interest crediting. IUL is similar to universal life insurance in that it provides life insurance coverage and cash value that increases as a result of credited interest as well as a minimum guaranteed credited rate of interest.


We previously discontinued new sales of traditional whole life insurance; however, we continue to service existing policies. Our in-force traditional whole life insurance policies combine a death benefit with a cash value that generally increases gradually over a period of years.

Term Life Insurance

Term life insurance provides a death benefit, but it does not accumulate cash value. The policyholder chooses the term of coverage with guaranteed premiums at the time of issue. During the chosen term, we cannot raise premium rates (even if claims experience deteriorates). At the end of the chosen term, coverage may continue with higher premiums until the maximum age is attained, or the policy expires with no value.

Disability Income Insurance

Disability income insurance provides monthly benefits to individuals who are unable to earn income either at their occupation at time of disability (“own occupation”) or at any suitable occupation (“any occupation”) for premium payments that are guaranteed not to change. Depending upon occupational and medical underwriting criteria, applicants for disability income insurance can choose “own occupation” and “any occupation” coverage for varying benefit periods. In some states, applicants may also choose various benefit provisions to help them integrate individual disability income insurance benefits with Social Security or similar benefit plans and to help them protect their disability income insurance benefits from the risk of inflation.

Distribution and Marketing Channels

We offer

RiverSource

life insurance products almost exclusively through our advisors. Our advisors offer insurance products issued predominantly by the RiverSource Life companies, though they may also offer insurance products of unaffiliated carriers, subject to certain qualifications.

Reinsurance

We reinsure a portion of the insurance risks associated with our annuity, life, disability income and long term care (included in our Corporate & Other segment) products through reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated reinsurance companies. We use reinsurance to limit losses, reduce exposure to large and catastrophic risks, and provide additional capacity for future growth. To manage exposure to losses from reinsurer insolvencies, we evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers prior to entering into new reinsurance treaties and on a periodic basis during the terms of the treaties. Our insurance companies remain primarily liable as the direct insurers on all risks reinsured.

See Note 7 and Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on reinsurance.

Liabilities and Reserves for Insurance

We maintain adequate reserves to cover the insurance risks associated with the insurance products we issue in addition to the liabilities arising from base contracts. You can find a discussion of liabilities and reserves related to our insurance products in Note 2, Note 11, Note 12 and Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Applicable state insurance laws generally require us to assess and submit an opinion regarding the adequacy of our statutory-based reserves on an annual basis. For a discussion of the statutory-based financial statements related to our insurance products, see Note 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Financial Strength Ratings

Independent rating organizations continually evaluate the financial soundness and claims-paying ability of insurance companies, and they base their ratings on a number of different factors, including market position in core products and market segments, risk-adjusted capitalization and the quality of the company’s investment portfolios. More specifically, the ratings assigned are developed from an evaluation of a company’s balance sheet strength, operating performance and business profile. Balance sheet strength reflects a company’s ability to meet its current and ongoing obligations to its contractholders and policyholders and includes analysis of a company’s capital adequacy. The evaluation of operating performance centers on the stability and sustainability of a company’s sources of earnings. The business profile component of the rating considers a company’s mix of business, market position and depth and experience of management.

Our insurance subsidiaries’ ratings are important to maintain public confidence in our protection and annuity products. We list our insurance subsidiaries’ financial strength ratings on our website at ir.ameriprise.com. For the most current ratings information, please see the individual rating agency’s website.


Our Segments - Corporate & Other

Our Corporate & Other segment consists of the long term care business and net investment income or loss on corporate level assets, including excess capital held in our subsidiaries and other unallocated equity and other revenues as well as unallocated corporate expenses. Prior to the sale on October 1, 2019, our Ameriprise Auto and Home Insurance business was included in this segment.

Closed Block Long Term Care Insurance

Prior to December 31, 2002, the RiverSource Life companies underwrote stand-alone long term care (“LTC”) insurance. We discontinued offering LTC insurance as of December 31, 2002. A large majority of our closed block LTC is comprised of nursing home indemnity LTC or comprehensive reimbursement LTC. Generally, our policyholders are eligible for LTC benefits if they become cognitively impaired or unable to perform certain activities of daily living.

Nursing home indemnity LTC policies provide a predefined daily benefit if the insured is confined to a nursing home, subject to various maximum benefit periods, regardless of actual expenses of the policyholder. Our older generation nursing home indemnity LTC policies were written between 1989 through 1999 and represent half of our policies.

Comprehensive reimbursement LTC policies provide a predefined maximum daily benefit if the insured is confined to a nursing home and covers a variety of LTC expenses including assisted living, home and community care, adult day care and similar placement programs, subject to various maximum total benefit payment pools, on a cost-reimbursement basis. Our second generation comprehensive reimbursement LTC policies were written from 1997 until 2002.

Our closed block LTC was sold on a guaranteed renewable basis which allows us to re-price in force policies, subject to regulatory approval. Premium rates for LTC policies vary by age, benefit period, elimination period, home care coverage and benefit increase option. Premium rates are based on assumptions concerning morbidity, mortality, persistency, administrative expenses, investment income and profit. We develop our assumptions based on our own claims and persistency experience. In line with the market, we have pursued nationwide premium rate increases for many years and expect to continue to pursue rate increases over the next several years. In general, since very little of our LTC business is subject to rate stability regulation, we have followed a policy of pursuing smaller, more frequent increases rather than single large increases in order to align policyholder and shareholder objectives. We also provide policyholders with options to reduce their coverage to lessen or eliminate the additional financial outlay that would otherwise result.

For existing LTC policies, RiverSource Life has continued ceding 50% of the risk on a coinsurance basis to subsidiaries of Genworth Financial, Inc. (“Genworth”) and retains the remaining risk. For RiverSource Life of NY, this reinsurance arrangement applies for 1996 and later issues only. Under these agreements, we have the right, but never the obligation, to recapture some, or all, of the risk ceded to Genworth.

For more information regarding LTC, see Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Corporate and Other.”

Competition

We operate in a highly competitive global industry. As a diversified financial services firm, we compete directly with a variety of financial institutions, including registered investment advisors, securities brokers, asset managers, banks and insurance companies. Our competitors may have greater financial resources, broader and deeper distribution capabilities and more robust products and services than we do. We directly compete for the provision of products and services to clients, as well as for our financial advisors and investment management personnel. Certain of our competitors offer web-based or mobile-based financial services and discount brokerage services, usually with lower levels of service, to individual clients.

Our Advice & Wealth Management segment competes with securities broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers, financial planning firms, registered investment advisors, insurance companies and other financial institutions to attract and retain financial advisors and clients. Competitive factors influencing our ability to attract and retain financial advisors include compensation structures, brand recognition and reputation, product offerings, and technology and service capabilities and support. Further, our financial advisors compete for clients with a range of other advisors, broker-dealers and direct channels. This includes wirehouses, regional broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers, insurers, banks, asset managers, registered investment advisers and direct distributors. Competitive factors influencing our ability to attract and retain clients include quality of advice provided, price, reputation, advertising and brand recognition, product offerings, technology offerings and service quality.

Our Asset Management segment competes on a global basis to acquire and retain managed and administered assets against a substantial number of firms, including those in the categories listed above. Such competitors may have achieved greater economies of scale, offer a broader array of products and services, offer products with a stronger performance record and have greater distribution capabilities. Competitive factors influencing our performance in this industry include investment performance, product offerings and innovation, product ratings, fee structures, advertising, service quality, brand recognition, reputation and the ability to attract and retain investment personnel. Furthermore, changes in investment preferences or investment management strategy (for example, “active” or “passive” investing styles), client or regulatory requirements on use of client commissions for research, and downward pressure on fees present various challenges to our business and may favor different competitors that focus more on “passive” investing styles. Regulators are increasingly mandating that mutual fund boards produce evidence of the value each fund share class delivers to investors and are also questioning the value of performance fee models, which may lead to downward pressure on fees. The ability to


create, maintain and deepen relationships with distributors and clients also plays a significant role in our ability to acquire and retain managed and administered assets. The impact of these factors on our business may vary from country to country and certain competitors may have certain competitive advantage in certain jurisdictions. As an example, the implementation of the terms of the British exit from the European Union (“EU”) (commonly known as “Brexit”) and other regulatory or political impacts may ultimately favor certain types of asset managers in the EU.

Competitors of our Annuities and Protection segments consist of both stock and mutual insurance companies. Competitive factors affecting the sale of annuity and insurance products include distribution capabilities, price, product features, hedging capability, investment performance, commission structure, perceived financial strength, claims-paying ratings, service, advertising, brand recognition and financial strength ratings from rating agencies such as A.M. Best.

Technology

We have an integrated and recently updated customer management system that serves as the hub of our technology platform. In addition, we have specialized product engines that manage various accounts, and over the years we have updated our platform to include new product lines. We also use a proprietary suite of processes, methods and tools for our financial planning services. We update our technological capabilities regularly to help maintain an adaptive platform design that aims to enhance the productivity of our advisors to allow for faster, lower-cost responses to emerging business opportunities, compliance requirements and marketplace and cybersecurity trends.

We have developed and maintain a comprehensive business continuity plan that utilizes an all-hazards approach to cover potential business disruptions to centrally controlled systems, platforms and facilities of varying severity and scope. This plan addresses, among other things, the loss of an entire geographic area, corporate buildings, staff, data systems and/or telecommunications capabilities regardless of their cause (e.g., flood, fire, terrorism or other denial or disruption of technology service). Our plan for cybersecurity incidents also provides a response framework for a breach of data protection. We periodically review, update and test our business continuity plan and data protection response manuals. We require our key technology vendors and service providers that deliver corporate-wide services and solutions to do the same. Additionally, we require our franchise advisors to create plans which cover such events for their locally controlled systems, data, staff and facilities.

Employees

At December 31, 2019, we had approximately 12,500 employees, including over 2,100 employee advisors (which does not include our franchisee advisors, who are not employees of our company, but does include advisors employed in the AAC and in our Ameriprise Financial Institutions Group). We are not subject to collective bargaining agreements, and we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory.

Intellectual Property

We rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. In the U.S. and other jurisdictions, we have established and registered, or filed applications to register, certain trademarks and service marks that we consider important to the marketing of our products and services, including but not limited to Ameriprise Financial, Threadneedle, RiverSource and Columbia Threadneedle Investments. We have in the past and will continue to establish and protect our intellectual property.

Regulation

Virtually all aspects of our business, including the activities of the parent company and our subsidiaries, are subject to various federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations provide broad regulatory, administrative and enforcement powers to supervisory agencies and other bodies, including U.S. federal and state regulatory and law enforcement agencies, foreign government agencies or regulatory bodies and U.S. and foreign securities exchanges. The costs of complying with such laws and regulations can be significant, and the consequences for the failure to comply may include civil or criminal charges, fines, censure, the suspension of individual employees, restrictions on or prohibitions from engaging in certain lines of business (or in certain states or countries), revocation of certain registrations and reputational damage. We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in our compliance and supervision processes, enhancing policies, procedures and oversight to monitor our compliance with the numerous legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business.

The regulatory environment in which we operate remains subject to change and heightened regulatory scrutiny. Regulatory developments, both in and outside of the U.S., have resulted or are expected to result in greater regulatory oversight and internal compliance obligations for firms across the financial services industry. In addition, we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding retirement investing as well as cybersecurity and privacy matters, and we will continue to closely review and monitor any legislative or regulatory proposals and changes. States, such as California with the newly effective California Consumer Privacy Act, continue to add new complexity to the patchwork of laws already in existence relating to privacy and cybersecurity and we are expecting similar new laws this year in multiple states. The same is true for retirement investing where individual states continue to propose or enact rules that create more complexity in terms of a multitude of standards in place. These legal and regulatory changes have impacted and may in the future impact how we are regulated and how we operate and govern our businesses.


The discussion and overview set forth below provides a general framework of the primary laws and regulations impacting our businesses. Certain of our subsidiaries may be subject to one or more elements of this regulatory framework depending on the nature of their business, the products and services they provide and the geographic locations in which they operate. To the extent the discussion includes references to statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to these statutory and regulatory provisions and is current only as of the date of this report.

In addition to the regulators summarized above, we are also subject to regulation by self-regulatory organizations such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), various federal and state securities, insurance and financial regulators (such as regulatory agencies and bodies like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the U.S. Department of Labor (“DOL”)) in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions (such as the European Securities and Markets Authority and the national financial regulator for each European country) where we do business.

Advice and Wealth Management Regulation

Certain of our subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and with certain states, the District of Columbia and other U.S. territories. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are also members of self-regulatory organizations, including FINRA, and are subject to the regulations of these organizations. The SEC and FINRA have stringent rules with respect to the net capital requirements and the marketing and trading activities of broker-dealers. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries, as well as our financial advisors and other personnel, must obtain all required state and FINRA licenses and registrations to engage in the securities business and take certain steps to maintain such registrations in good standing. SEC regulations also impose notice requirements and capital limitations on the payment of dividends by a broker-dealer to a parent.


Our financial advisors are representatives of a dual registrant, meaning it is registered both as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) and as a broker-dealer. Our advisors are subject to various regulations that impact how they operate their practices, including those related to supervision, sales methods, trading practices, record-keeping and financial reporting. In addition, because our independent contractor advisor platform is structured as a franchise system, we are also subject to Federal Trade Commission and state franchise requirements. As noted earlier, we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding retirement investing and financial advisors, including proposed rules, regulatory priorities or general discussions around transparency and disclosure in advisor compensation and recruiting, identifying and managing conflicts of interest and enhanced data collection.

In June 2019 the SEC adopted a package of rulemakings and interpretations related to the provision of advice by broker-dealers and investment advisers, including Regulation Best Interest and the Client Relationship Summary (Form CRS) effective June 30, 2020. Among other things, Regulation Best Interest requires a broker-dealer to act in the best interest of a retail customer when making a recommendation to that customer of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities. The regulation entails heightened standards for broker-dealers, and we anticipate incurring additional costs in order to review and modify our policies and procedures, as well as associated supervisory and compliance controls and the provision of Form CRS to clients. Furthermore, several states have either issued their own best interest or fiduciary rules or are considering doing so and those rules may be limited to certain types of products (e.g. insurance and annuities, financial planning, etc.) or may broadly cover all recommendations made by financial advisors. The DOL has included on its regulatory agenda fiduciary rulemaking regarding investment advice to clients who hold assets in IRAs and certain employer-sponsored retirement plan accounts. The Certified Financial Planner Board has updated its professional standards of conduct to include a fiduciary standard that will apply to financial advisors who hold a Certified Financial Planner designation. Currently, Ameriprise has approximately 4,100 financial advisors who hold a Certified Financial Planner designation. Considering the various fiduciary rules and regulations that have been proposed or finalized, we continue to exert significant efforts to evaluate and prepare to comply with each rule. Depending on the span and substance of any regulations and timing of their applicability, the scope of any implementation could impact the way we compensate our advisors, particularly with respect to the sale of commission-based products, the access that representatives of affiliated and unaffiliated product manufacturers could have to our advisors and clients, and the manner and degree to which we and our advisors could have selling and marketing costs reimbursed by product manufacturers. We have incurred infrastructure costs in anticipation of compliance with these new regulations, and ongoing costs will be driven by how these regulations evolve over the course of time.

Other agencies, exchanges and self-regulatory organizations of which certain of our broker-dealer subsidiaries are members, and subject to applicable rules and regulations of, include the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the National Futures Association (“NFA”). Effective in August 2014, AFS changed its registration with the CFTC from a Futures Commission Merchant to a Commodity Trading Advisor. In addition, certain subsidiaries may also be registered as insurance agencies and may be subject to the regulations described in the following sections.

Asset Management Regulation

U.S. Regulation

In the U.S., certain of our asset management subsidiaries are registered as investment advisers under the Advisers Act and are subject to regulation by the SEC. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including fiduciary duties, disclosure obligations and record-keeping, and operational and marketing restrictions. Our registered investment advisers may also be subject to certain obligations of the Investment Company Act based on their status as investment advisers to U.S. registered investment companies that we, or third parties, sponsor. As noted earlier, we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding financial services in the U.S. through rules, regulatory priorities or general discussion. This trend is especially true globally where regulators remain active, including in Europe. Any future regulation could potentially require new approaches which increase our regulatory burdens and costs.

Many aspects of the regulation that applies to our Advice & Wealth Management segment would also apply to our Asset Management segment. For example, Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. is registered as a broker-dealer for the limited purpose of acting as the principal underwriter and distributor for

Columbia Management

funds. Additionally, ERISA, the SEC’s best interest standards, state and other fiduciary or best interest rules, as well as other similar standards and any rulemaking from the DOL would be relevant to our global asset management business. We continue to review and analyze the potential impact of these regulations across each of our business lines.

In connection with rules adopted by the CFTC, certain of our subsidiaries are registered with the CFTC as a commodity trading advisor and commodity pool operator and are also members of the NFA. These rules adopted by the CFTC eliminated or limited previously available exemptions and exclusions from many CFTC requirements, and impose additional registration and reporting requirements for operators of certain registered investment companies and certain other pooled vehicles that use or trade in futures, swaps and other derivatives that are subject to CFTC regulation.


Non-U.S. Regulation

UK Regulation

Outside of the U.S., Columbia Threadneedle Investments is primarily authorized to conduct its financial services business in the UK under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Threadneedle is currently regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”). FCA and PRA rules impose certain capital, operational and compliance requirements and allow for disciplinary action in the event of noncompliance. As with the U.S. environment, we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding financial services. Key UK regulatory developments and trends include the following:

•

Brexit.

Although the UK withdrew from the EU on January 31, 2020, it did so pursuant to a transitionary withdrawal agreement with the EU that in substance maintains the pre-withdrawal, status quo until the end of 2020. As a result, the UK financial service sector continues to face uncertainty over the final relationship with the EU, which could impact cross-border marketing of financial products. We continue to monitor developments in place and have an ongoing project to ensure we can continue to service our EU clients.

•

Operational Resilience.

UK regulators have published proposals to improve the “operational resilience” of the UK financial systems and firms and these new rules will be phased in from 2021.

•

UK Asset Management Market Study.

The FCA has issued a comprehensive competition study of the UK asset management industry, focusing on the role of the asset management industry in providing financial services, and the transparency and value it offers, to clients, particularly in active asset management.

Having withdrawn from the EU, the UK and others will need to negotiate the terms of multiple new relationships, which will take some time. The full impact of Brexit and its related consequences remain uncertain, including with respect to ongoing negotiations between the UK and EU and new trade agreements with global trading partners. We continue to actively monitor the dynamic Brexit situation and political activity around Brexit. We are preparing for potential disruptions which may arise following the end of the transitional period in 2021.

We have an established fund range domiciled in Luxembourg (both UCITS and AIF) along with a UCITS Management Company, and Columbia Threadneedle Investments has expanded the regulated permissions of its Luxembourg entity to perform fund management, administration and distribution functions. Therefore, we are well placed to continue to serve investors in Europe. We have replicated, and will continue to replicate, appropriate funds from our UK-based OEIC range within our Luxembourg SICAV platform. We have a well-resourced and experienced product development team with the capacity to ensure the needs of our clients are met in an efficient and transparent manner. As a result of our expansion of regulated permissions in Luxembourg, we expect to have greater engagement with the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (“CSSF”), as the primary regulator of our Luxembourg business and funds.

Pan-European and Other Non-U.S. Regulation

In addition to the above, certain of our asset management subsidiaries, such as Columbia Threadneedle Investment’s UK and other European subsidiaries, are required to comply with both pan-European directives as issued by the European Commission and adopted by EU member states. Certain of these directives impact our global asset management business. For example, Columbia Threadneedle Investments and certain of our other asset management subsidiaries are required to comply with

the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID II”), Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (“MiFIR”)

, Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”), European Market Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”) and the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directives (“UCITS”). These requirements impact the way we manage assets and place, settle and report on trades for our clients, as well as market to clients and prospects. EMIR provides a framework for the regulation of over the counter and exchange-traded derivative markets. Similar to the developments in the U.S., we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding financial services through international markets, including in the EU where we have a substantial asset management business. These non-U.S. rules, proposed rules, regulatory priorities or general discussions may impact us directly or indirectly, including as a regulated entity or as a service provider to, or a business receiving services from or engaging in transactions with, regulated entities.

In addition to regulations noted in this section, within the EU and the UK we have been and will continue to address regulatory reforms or structural changes including but not limited to: enhanced regulatory focus on sustainable finance and environmental, social and governance (ESG); Senior Manager and Certification Regime; Solvency II; Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products; Market Abuse Regulation; Transparency Directive II; Fourth and Fifth Money Laundering Directive; EU Benchmarks Regulation; Money Market Fund Regulation; Shareholder Rights Directive; Securitisation Regulation; and Criminal Finance Act.

MiFID II came into effect in January 2018 and is the most significant regulatory change EU investment firms have recently faced. MiFID II strengthened the requirement for investment firms to act in the client’s best interest, in many areas including conflicts of interest (specifically, inducements and a prohibition on free research), strengthening of best execution requirements and increased costs and charges disclosure, in relation to all services provided to clients. Firms are also subject to an increase in the scope of transactions which must be reported to both the regulator and the market. In response to MiFID II, Columbia Threadneedle Investments has implemented wide ranging changes to systems, policies and operating procedures across its business, including: (i) increased transparency and reporting to our clients over costs impacting their investments, (ii) publishing detailed information on a near real-time basis for some trades, and reporting all transactions to the regulator the next business day, (iii) strengthening rules on


requirements and reporting of best execution of our trades, and (iv) moving from clients paying for investment research as part of a bundled transaction fee to Columbia Threadneedle Investments paying for the research.

GDPR sought to harmonize data protection legislation and introduced changes in areas such as: (i) governance and oversight, (ii) processing of personal data, (iii) enhancements around consent and data subject rights, and (iv) international data transfers. GDPR is a step change in the way personal data is regulated in Europe and outside of Europe to the extent that goods or services are being marketed to EU citizens and their personal information is collected and processed in the course of that interaction. GDPR became effective in May 2018, and our GDPR program is operational. We are mindful of other upcoming regulatory change (including those arising from Brexit) and the data privacy impact that it will have on our current business model post-Brexit.

Under the guidance of ESMA (a European supervisor), many national regulators such as the FCA and the CSSF are using data analytics to measure how “active” funds are performing versus benchmarks. Where a regulator finds that a fund, although charging active fees, has a high benchmark correlation, the regulators are asking asset managers to provide evidence of asset management.

In Singapore, our asset management subsidiary Threadneedle Investments Singapore (Pte.) Ltd. (“Threadneedle Singapore”) is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) under the Securities and Futures Act. Threadneedle Singapore holds a capital markets services license with MAS, and employees of Threadneedle Singapore engaging in regulated activities are required to be licensed. MAS rules impose certain capital, operational and compliance (including Senior Manager) requirements and allow for disciplinary action in the event of noncompliance.

Threadneedle companies and activities are also subject to other local country regulations and regulators in Europe, Dubai, Hong Kong, the U.S., South Korea, South America and Australia. Additionally, many of our subsidiaries, including Columbia Management, are also subject to foreign, state and local laws with respect to advisory services that are offered and provided by these subsidiaries, including services provided to government pension plans.

Other Securities Regulation

Ameriprise Certificate Company is regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. As a registered investment company, Ameriprise Certificate Company must observe certain governance, disclosure, record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements. Ameriprise Certificate Company pays dividends to the parent company and is subject to capital requirements under applicable law and understandings with the SEC and the Minnesota Department of Commerce (Banking Division).

ATC is primarily regulated by the Minnesota Department of Commerce (Banking Division) and is subject to capital adequacy requirements under Minnesota law. It is prohibited from accepting deposits or making personal or commercial loans. As a provider of products and services to tax-qualified retirement plans and IRAs, certain aspects of our business, including the activities of our trust company, fall within the compliance oversight of the DOL and the Department of Treasury, particularly regarding the enforcement of ERISA, and the tax reporting requirements applicable to such accounts. ATC, as well as our investment adviser subsidiaries, may be subject to ERISA, and the regulations thereunder, insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to certain ERISA clients.

Protection and Annuities Regulation

Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by states and other territories where they are domiciled or otherwise licensed to do business. The primary purpose of this regulation and supervision is to protect the interests of contractholders and policyholders. In general, state insurance laws and regulations govern standards of solvency, capital requirements, the licensing of insurers and their agents, premium rates, policy forms, the nature of and limitations on investments, periodic reporting requirements and other matters. In addition, state regulators conduct periodic examinations into insurer market conduct and compliance with insurance and securities laws. The Minnesota Department of Commerce, and the New York State Department of Financial Services (the “Domiciliary Regulators”) regulate certain of the RiverSource Life companies. In addition to being regulated by their Domiciliary Regulators, our RiverSource Life companies are regulated by each of the insurance regulators in the states where each is authorized to transact business. Financial regulation of our RiverSource Life companies is extensive, and their financial transactions (such as intercompany dividends and investment activity) may be subject to pre-approval and/or continuing evaluation by the Domiciliary Regulators.

Aspects of the regulation applicable to our Advice & Wealth Management segment also apply to our Annuities and Protection segments. For example, RiverSource Distributors is registered as a broker-dealer for the limited purpose of acting as the principal underwriter and/or distributor for our

RiverSource

annuities and insurance products sold through AFS and third-party channels. Additionally, ERISA, the SEC’s best interest standards, state and other fiduciary or best interest rules, as well as other similar standards and any rulemaking from the DOL are relevant to our insurance business. We continue to review and analyze the potential impact of these regulations across each of our business lines.

All states require participation in insurance guaranty associations, which assess fees to insurance companies in order to fund claims of policyholders and contractholders of insolvent insurance companies subject to statutory limits. These assessments are generally based on a member insurer’s proportionate share of all premiums written by member insurers in the state during a specified period prior to an insurer’s insolvency. See Note 26 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding guaranty association assessments.


Certain variable annuity and variable life insurance policies offered by the RiverSource Life companies constitute and are registered as securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As such, these products are subject to regulation by the SEC and FINRA. Securities regulators have recently increased their focus on the adequacy of disclosure regarding complex investment products, including variable annuities and life insurance products, and announced that they will continue to review actions by life insurers to improve profitability and reduce risks under in force annuity and insurance products with guaranteed benefits.

The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) created the Federal Insurance Office (“FIO”) within the Department of Treasury. The FIO does not have substantive regulatory responsibilities, though it is tasked with monitoring the insurance industry and the effectiveness of its regulatory framework in addition to providing periodic reports to the President and Congress. We monitor the FIO’s activity to identify and assess emerging regulatory priorities with potential application to our business.

Each of our insurance subsidiaries is subject to risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements designed to assess the adequacy of an insurance company’s total adjusted capital in relation to its investment, insurance and other risks. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has established RBC standards that all state insurance departments have adopted. The RBC requirements are used by the NAIC and state insurance regulators to identify companies that merit regulatory actions designed to protect policyholders. The NAIC RBC report is completed as of December 31 and filed annually, along with the statutory financial statements.

Our RiverSource Life companies are subject to various levels of regulatory intervention if their total adjusted statutory capital falls below defined RBC action levels. At the “company action level,” defined as total adjusted capital level between 100% and 75% of the RBC requirement, an insurer must submit a plan for corrective action with its primary state regulator. The level of regulatory intervention is greater at lower levels of total adjusted capital relative to the RBC requirement. RiverSource Life and RiverSource Life of NY maintain capital levels well in excess of the company action level required by state insurance regulators as noted below as of December 31, 2019:

Ameriprise Financial, as a direct and indirect owner of its insurance subsidiaries, is subject to the insurance holding company laws of the states where its insurance subsidiaries are domiciled. These laws generally require insurance holding companies to register with the insurance department of the insurance company’s state of domicile and to provide certain financial and other information about the operations of the companies within the holding company structure.

As part of its Solvency Modernization Initiative, in 2010 the NAIC adopted revisions to its Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act (“Holding Company Act”) to enhance insurer group supervision and create a new Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (“ORSA”) Model Act. The Holding Company Act revisions focus on the overall insurance holding company system, establish a framework of regulator supervisory colleges, enhancements to corporate governance, and require the annual filing of an Enterprise Risk Management Report. The ORSA Model Act requires that an insurer create and file, annually, its Own Risk Solvency Assessment, which is a complete self-assessment of its risk management functions and capital adequacy. These laws were enacted by the domiciliary states of RiverSource Life: Minnesota and New York. We completed and filed these reports as required by the laws and regulations of those states.

Federal Banking and Financial Holding Company Regulation

Following conversion to a federal savings bank, Ameriprise Bank continues to be subject to regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"), which is the primary regulator of federal savings banks, and by the FDIC in its role as insurer of Ameriprise Bank's deposits. As a federally chartered savings bank, Ameriprise Bank is subject to numerous rules and regulations governing all aspects of the banking business, including lending practices and transactions with affiliates. Ameriprise Bank is also subject to specific capital rules and limits on capital distributions, including payment of dividends. If Ameriprise Bank's capital falls below certain levels, the OCC would be required to take remedial actions and could take other actions, including imposing further limits on dividends or business activities. In addition, an array of Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), fair lending and other consumer protection laws and regulations apply to Ameriprise Bank. Either of the OCC or the FDIC may bring administrative enforcement actions against Ameriprise Bank or its officers, directors or employees if any of them are found to be in violation of the law or engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice.

As the controlling company of Ameriprise Bank, Ameriprise Financial is a savings and loan holding company that is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the FRB. In connection with the conversion, Ameriprise Financial elected to be classified as a financial holding company subject to applicable regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. Further, FRB regulation and supervisory oversight of Ameriprise Financial includes examinations, regular financial reporting, and prudential standards, such as capital, liquidity risk management, and parameters for business conduct and internal governance.


Under the Bank Holding Company Act, bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries are generally limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking. As a financial holding company, we do not need approval: (1) to engage in other activities that the FRB, working with the Secretary of the Treasury, determined or in the future determines to be financial in nature, incidental to an activity that is financial in nature, or complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally, or (2) to acquire shares of companies engaged in such activities. Activities that are financial in nature include, but are not limited to, providing financial or investment advice; securities underwriting and dealing; insurance underwriting; and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies, subject to significant limitation. We may not, however, directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of a bank holding company or a bank without the prior approval of the FRB.

In order to maintain Ameriprise’s status as a financial holding company, Ameriprise Bank, as Ameriprise’s sole insured depository institution subsidiary, must remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” under applicable regulations, and must receive at least a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent examination under the CRA. In addition, Ameriprise, as a financial holding company, must remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” in order to maintain its status as a financial holding company. Failure to meet one or more of these requirements would mean, depending on the requirements not met and any agreement then reached with the FRB, that until cured, Ameriprise Financial could not undertake new activities, continue certain activities or make acquisitions other than those generally permissible for bank holding companies.

After a conformance period, we will be subject to what is commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule (which is the subject of currently pending proposals that would further modify the rule). The Volcker Rule, as modified in 2019, prohibits “banking entities,” including us and our affiliates, from engaging in certain “proprietary trading” activities, as defined in the Volcker Rule, subject to exemptions for underwriting, market-making-related activities, risk-mitigating hedging and certain other activities. The Volcker Rule also prohibits certain investments and relationships by banking entities with “covered funds,” with a number of exemptions and exclusions. It also requires banking entities to have comprehensive compliance programs reasonably designed to ensure and monitor compliance with the Volcker Rule.

The FRB proposed a new capital framework termed the “Building Block Approach” in September 2019 for savings and loan holding companies like Ameriprise that are significantly engaged in insurance activities (“ISLHCs”). In general, under the proposed rule ISLHCs would be required to aggregate state-based insurance capital requirements with banking capital requirements for non-insurance businesses to satisfy specific minimum total requirements and hold an additional capital conservation buffer. The proposed rule was followed by a public comment period that ended in January 2020. We were engaged with the FRB and through industry groups to assess and provide comments regarding potential refinements and improvements to the proposed rule.

Additional Parent Company Regulation and Other Regulation

Ameriprise Financial is a publicly traded company that is subject to SEC and New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) rules and regulations regarding public disclosure, financial reporting, internal controls and corporate governance. The adoption of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act significantly enhanced those rules and regulations.

We have operations in a number of geographical regions outside of the U.S. As such, we continuously monitor developments in EU legislation, as well as in the other markets in which we operate, to ensure that we comply with all applicable legal requirements, including EU directives applicable to financial institutions as implemented in the various member states. Because of the mix of business activities we conduct, we assess the impact of, and monitor our status under, the EU Financial Conglomerates Directive, which contemplates global supervision and prudential regulation of certain financial conglomerates involved in banking, insurance and investment activities.

The FCA, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), has announced that it will not compel panel banks to contribute to LIBOR after 2021. It is likely that banks will not continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 and possibly prior to then. It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates will occur over the next two years. Actions by regulators have resulted in the establishment of alternative reference rates to LIBOR in most major currencies. An enterprise-wide project has been formed and the Company’s significant analysis and readiness work will go through 2020.

Privacy, Environmental and Anti-Money Laundering Laws

Many aspects of our business are subject to comprehensive legal requirements concerning the use and protection of personal information, including client and employee information, from a multitude of different functional regulators and law enforcement bodies. This includes rules adopted pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act, an ever increasing number of state laws and regulations such as the New York State Department of Financial Services’

Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies,

the California Consumer Privacy Act, EU data protection legislation as implemented in the respective EU member states, and data protection rules in other regions in which we operate outside the U.S. and the EU (including GDPR). We have also implemented policies and procedures, including a cybersecurity incident response manual, in response to such requirements. We continue our efforts to safeguard the data entrusted to us in accordance with applicable laws and our internal data protection policies, including taking steps to reduce the potential for identity theft or other


improper use or disclosure of personal information, while seeking to collect only the data that is necessary to properly achieve our business objectives and best serve our clients.

As the owner and operator of real property, we are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. We periodically conduct environmental reviews on our own real estate as well as investment real estate to assess and ensure our compliance with these laws and regulations.

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, commonly referred to as the USA Patriot Act, was enacted in October 2001. It substantially broadened existing anti-money laundering legislation and the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the U.S. In response, we enhanced our existing anti-money laundering programs and developed new procedures and programs, including enhancing our “know your customer” and “due diligence” programs. In addition, we will continue to comply with anti-money laundering legislation in the UK derived from applicable EU directives and international initiatives adopted in other jurisdictions in which we conduct business.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors

Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. We believe that the following information identifies the material factors affecting our company based on the information we currently know. However, the risks and uncertainties our company faces are not limited to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.

Risks Relating to Our Business and Operations

Our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by market fluctuations and by economic, political and other factors.

Our financial condition and results of operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by economic and other factors. Such factors, which can be global, regional, national or local in nature, include: (i) political, social, economic and market conditions; (ii) the availability and cost of capital; (iii) the level and volatility of equity prices, commodity prices and interest rates, currency values and other market indices; (iv) technological changes and events; (v) U.S. and foreign government fiscal and tax policies; (vi) U.S. and foreign government ability, real or perceived, to avoid defaulting on government securities; (vii) the availability and cost of credit; (viii) inflation; (ix) investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets; (x) terrorism and armed conflicts; and (xi) natural disasters such as weather catastrophes and widespread health emergencies. Furthermore, changes in consumer economic variables, such as the number and size of personal bankruptcy filings, the rate of unemployment, decreases in property values, and the level of consumer confidence and consumer debt, may substantially affect consumer loan levels and credit quality, which, in turn, could impact client activity in all of our businesses. These factors also may have an impact on our ability to achieve our strategic objectives.

Declines and volatility in U.S. and global market conditions have impacted our businesses in the past and may do so again. Our businesses have been, and in the future may be, adversely affected by U.S. and global capital market and credit crises, the repricing of credit risk, equity market volatility and decline and stress or recession in the U.S. and global economies generally. Each of our segments operates in these markets with exposure for us and our clients in securities, loans, derivatives, alternative investments, seed capital and other commitments. It is difficult to predict when, how long and to what extent the aforementioned adverse conditions may exist, which of our markets, products and businesses will be directly affected in terms of revenues, management fees and investment valuations and earnings, and to what extent our clients may seek to bring claims arising out of investment performance that is affected by these conditions. As a result, these factors could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.

Our revenues are largely dependent upon the level and mix of assets we have under management and administration, which are subject to fluctuations based on market conditions and client activity. Downturns and volatility in equity markets can have, and have had, an adverse effect on the revenues and returns from our asset management services, retail advisory accounts, variable annuity contracts and banking products. Because the profitability of these products and services depends on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management, declines in the equity markets will reduce our revenues because the value of the investment assets we manage will be reduced. In addition, market downturns and volatility (as well as general regulatory or economic uncertainty, such as Brexit) may cause, and have caused, potential new purchasers of our products to limit purchases of or to refrain from purchasing products such as mutual funds, OEICs, SICAVs, variable annuities and variable universal life insurance. Downturns and uncertainty may also cause


current shareholders in our mutual funds, OEICs, SICAVs, unit trusts and investment trusts, contractholders in our annuity products and policyholders in our protection products to withdraw cash values from those products.

Most of our variable annuity products contain guaranteed minimum death benefits and guaranteed minimum withdrawal and accumulation benefits. A significant equity market decline or volatility in equity markets could result in guaranteed minimum benefits being higher than what current account values would support, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Although we have hedged a portion of the guarantees for the variable annuity contracts to mitigate the financial loss of equity market declines or volatility, there can be no assurance that such a decline or volatility would not materially impact the profitability of certain products or product lines or our financial condition or results of operations. Further, the cost of hedging our liability for these guarantees has increased as a result of low interest rates and volatility in the equity markets and broad-based market and regulatory-driven changes in the collateral requirements of hedge trading counterparties. In addition, heightened volatility (and the transition away from LIBOR as a widely-accepted interest rate reference) creates greater uncertainty for future hedging effectiveness.

We believe that investment performance is an important factor in the success of many of our businesses. Poor investment performance could impair our revenues and earnings, as well as our prospects for growth.

Poor investment performance could also result in additional benefits paid under certain annuity products (such variable annuity living benefits and death benefits).

A significant portion of our revenue is derived from investment management agreements with the

Columbia Management

family of mutual funds which are terminable on 60 days’ notice. In addition, although some contracts governing investment management services are subject to termination for failure to meet performance benchmarks, institutional and individual clients can terminate their relationships with us or our financial advisors at will or on relatively short notice. Our clients can also reduce the aggregate amount of managed assets or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures, for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates, changes in investment preferences or investment management strategy (for example, “active” or “passive” investing styles), changes in our (or our advisors’) reputation in the marketplace, changes in client management or ownership, loss of key investment management personnel and financial market performance. A reduction in managed assets, and the associated decrease in revenues and earnings, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, if our money market funds experience a decline in market value, we may choose to contribute capital to those funds without consideration, which would result in a loss.

During periods of unfavorable or stagnating market or economic conditions, the level of individual investor participation in the global markets may also decrease, which would negatively impact the results of our retail businesses. Concerns about current market and economic conditions, declining real estate values and decreased consumer confidence have caused, and in the future may cause, some of our clients to reduce the amount of business they do with us. Fluctuations in global market activity could impact the flow of investment capital into or from assets under management and the way customers allocate capital among money market, equity, fixed maturity or other investment alternatives, which could negatively impact our Asset Management, Advice & Wealth Management and Annuities businesses. If we are unable to offer appropriate product alternatives which encourage customers to continue purchasing in the face of actual or perceived market volatility, our sales and management fee revenues could decline. Uncertain economic conditions and heightened market volatility may also increase the likelihood that clients or regulators present or threaten legal claims, that regulators may increase the frequency and scope of their examinations of us or the financial services industry generally, and that lawmakers may enact new requirements or taxation which can have a material impact on our revenues, expenses or statutory capital requirements.

Changes in interest rates and prolonged periods of low interest rates may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Certain of our insurance, annuity, investment products and banking products are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, and future impacts associated with such variations may differ from our historical costs. In addition, interest rate fluctuations could result in fluctuations in the valuation of certain minimum guaranteed benefits contained in some of our variable annuity products. Although we typically hedge to mitigate some of the effect of such fluctuations, significant changes in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

During periods of increasing market interest rates, we may offer higher crediting rates on interest-sensitive products, such as universal life insurance, fixed annuities and face-amount certificates, and we may increase crediting rates on in force products to keep these products competitive. Because yields on invested assets may not increase as quickly as current interest rates, we may have to accept a lower spread and thus lower profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. In addition, increases in market interest rates may cause increased policy surrenders, withdrawals from life insurance policies and annuity contracts and requests for policy loans, as policyholders and contractholders seek to shift assets to products with perceived higher returns. This process may lead to an earlier than expected outflow of cash from our business. These withdrawals and surrenders may require investment assets to be sold at a time when the prices of those assets are lower because of the increase in market interest rates, which may result in realized investment losses. Also, increases in market interest rates may result in extension of certain cash flows from structured mortgage assets. Increases in crediting rates, as well as surrenders and withdrawals, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. An increase in policy surrenders and withdrawals also may require us to accelerate amortization of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) or other intangibles or cause an impairment of goodwill, which would increase our expenses and reduce our net earnings.


During periods of falling interest rates or stagnancy of low interest rates, our spread may be reduced or could become negative, primarily because some of our products have guaranteed minimum crediting rates. Due to the long-term nature of the liabilities associated with certain of our businesses, such as long term care and universal life with secondary guarantees as well as fixed annuities and guaranteed benefits on variable annuities, sustained declines in or stagnancy of low long-term interest rates may subject us to reinvestment risks and increased hedging costs. In addition, reduced or negative spreads may require us to accelerate amortization of DAC, which would increase our expenses and reduce our net earnings.

Interest rate fluctuations also could have an adverse effect on the results of our investment portfolio. During periods of declining market interest rates or stagnancy of low interest rates, the interest we receive on variable interest rate investments decreases. In addition, during those periods, we are forced to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower-yielding high-grade instruments or in lower-credit instruments to maintain comparable returns. Issuers of certain callable fixed income securities also may decide to prepay their obligations in order to borrow at lower market rates, which increases the risk that we may have to reinvest the cash proceeds of these securities in lower-yielding or lower-credit instruments.

Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, our access to capital and our cost of capital.

The capital and credit markets may experience, and have experienced, varying degrees of volatility and disruption. In some cases, the markets have exerted downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers. We need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, interest expenses and dividends on our capital stock. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be required to curtail our operations and our business would suffer.

Our liquidity needs are satisfied primarily through our reserves and the cash generated by our operations. We believe the level of cash and securities we maintain, combined with expected cash inflows from investments and operations, is adequate to meet anticipated short-term and long-term payment obligations. In the event current resources are insufficient to satisfy our needs, we may access financing sources such as bank debt. The availability of additional financing would depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that our shareholders, customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn. Similarly, our access to funds may be rendered more costly or impaired if regulatory authorities or rating organizations take actions against us.

Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may also limit our access to capital required to operate our business. Such market conditions may limit our ability to satisfy statutory capital requirements, generate fee income and market-related revenue to meet liquidity needs and access the capital necessary to grow our business. As such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue different types of capital than we would otherwise, less effectively deploy such capital, or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility.

A downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Financial strength ratings, which various rating organizations publish as a measure of an insurance company’s ability to meet contractholder and policyholder obligations, are important to maintain public confidence in our products, the ability to market our products and our competitive position. A downgrade in our financial strength ratings, or the announced potential for a downgrade, could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways, including: (i) reducing new sales of insurance and annuity products and investment products; (ii) adversely affecting our relationships with our advisors and third-party distributors of our products; (iii) materially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders and withdrawals by contractholders and policyholders; (iv) requiring us to reduce prices for many of our products and services to remain competitive; and (v) adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance or obtain reasonable pricing on reinsurance.

A downgrade in our credit ratings could also adversely impact our future cost and speed of borrowing and have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

In view of the difficulties experienced in recent years by many financial institutions, including our competitors in the insurance industry, the rating organizations have heightened the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions and have requested additional information from the companies that they rate. They may increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating organizations’ models for maintenance of ratings levels, or downgrade ratings applied to particular classes of securities or types of institutions.

Rating organizations may also become subject to tighter laws, regulations or scrutiny governing ratings, which may in turn impact ratings assigned to financial institutions.

We cannot predict what actions rating organizations may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating organizations, which could adversely affect our business. As with other companies in the financial services industry, our ratings could be changed at any time and without any notice by the rating organizations.


Intense competition and the economics of changes in our product revenue mix and distribution channels could negatively impact our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability.

Our businesses operate in intensely competitive industry segments. We compete based on a number of factors, including name recognition, service, the quality of investment advice, investment performance, product offerings and features, price, perceived financial strength, claims-paying ability and credit ratings. Our competitors include broker-dealers, banks, asset managers, insurers and other financial institutions. Certain of our competitors offer web-based or mobile-based financial services or discount brokerage services to individual clients. Many of our businesses face competitors that have greater market share, offer a broader range of products, have greater financial resources, or have higher claims-paying ability or credit ratings than we do. Some of our competitors may possess or acquire intellectual property rights that could provide a competitive advantage to them in certain markets or for certain products, which could make it difficult for us to introduce new products and services. Some of our competitors’ proprietary products or technology could be similar to our own, and this could result in disputes that could impact our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, over time certain sectors of the financial services industry have become considerably more concentrated, as financial institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms, or distribution firms (including our own) are seeking to limit the breadth of product offerings in order to simplify their regulatory and risk management. This convergence could result in our competitors gaining greater resources, and we may experience downward pressures on our pricing and market share as a result of these factors and as some of our competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices. Furthermore, the uncertain regulatory environment in the U.S. and around the world will cause various structural changes to the industry and other competitors may be better positioned to reap the benefits of that structural change and movement of assets around the industry depending on final regulations and trends among distributors and clients.

The offerings available to our advisor network include not only products issued by our RiverSource Life and Columbia Threadneedle Investments companies, but also products issued by unaffiliated insurance companies and asset managers. As a result of this and further openings of our advisor network to the products of other companies, we could experience lower sales of our companies’ products, higher surrenders or redemptions, or other developments which might not be fully offset by higher distribution revenues or other benefits, possibly resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, some of our products, are made available through alliances with unaffiliated third parties. We could experience lower sales or incur higher distribution costs or other developments which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations if alliance relationships are discontinued or if the terms of our alliances change.

We face intense competition in attracting and retaining key talent.

Our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to attract and retain qualified people. We are dependent on our network of advisors to drive growth and results in our wealth management business and also for a significant portion of the sales of our mutual funds, annuities, face-amount certificates, banking and insurance products. In addition, the investment performance of our asset management products and services and the retention of our products and services by our clients are dependent upon the strategies and decisioning of our portfolio managers and analysts. The market for these financial advisors and portfolio managers is extremely competitive, as are the markets for qualified and skilled executives and marketing, finance, legal, compliance and other professionals. From time to time there are regulatory-driven or other trends and developments within the industry, such as changes around the Protocol for Broker Recruiting, that could potentially impact the current competitive dynamics between us and our competitors. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our recruiting and retention costs increase significantly, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.

The impairment or negative performance of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.

We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including broker-dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds, insurers, reinsurers, investment funds and other institutions. The operations of U.S. and global financial services institutions are interconnected and a decline in the financial condition of one or more financial services institutions may expose us to credit losses or defaults, limit our access to liquidity or otherwise disrupt the operations of our businesses. While we regularly assess our exposure to different industries and counterparties, the performance and financial strength of specific institutions are subject to rapid change, the timing and extent of which cannot be known.

Many transactions with and investments in the products and securities of other financial institutions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. With respect to secured transactions, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral we hold cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to it. We also have exposure to financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments, derivative transactions (including with respect to derivatives hedging our exposure on variable annuity contracts with guaranteed benefits), reinsurance, repurchase and underwriting arrangements and equity investments. There can be no assurance that any such losses or impairments to the carrying value of these assets would not materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations.

Downgrades in the credit or financial strength ratings assigned to the counterparties with whom we transact or other adverse reputational impacts to such counterparties could create the perception that our financial condition will be adversely impacted as a result of potential future defaults by such counterparties. Additionally, we could be adversely affected by a general, negative perception of financial institutions caused by the downgrade or other adverse impact to the reputation of other financial institutions.


Accordingly, ratings downgrades or other adverse reputational impacts for other financial institutions could affect our market capitalization and could limit access to or increase our cost of capital.

A number of the products and services we make available to our clients are those offered by third parties, for which we may generate revenue based on the level of assets under management, the number of client transactions or otherwise. The poor performance of such products and services, or negative perceptions of the firms offering such products and services, may adversely impact our sales of such products and services and reduce our revenue. In addition, such failures or poor performance of products and services offered by other financial institutions could adversely impact consumer confidence in products and services that we offer. Negative perceptions of certain financial products and services, or the financial industry in general, may increase the number of withdrawals and redemptions or reduce purchases made by our clients, which would adversely impact the levels of our assets under management, revenues and liquidity position.

A drop in our investment performance as compared to that of our competitors could negatively impact our revenues and profitability.

Investment performance is a key competitive factor for our retail and institutional asset management products and services. Strong investment performance helps to ensure the retention of our products and services by our clients and creates new sales of products and services. It may also result in higher ratings by ratings services such as Morningstar or Lipper, which may compound the foregoing effects. Strong investment performance and its effects are important elements to our stated goals of growing assets under management and achieving economies of scale.

There can be no assurance as to how future investment performance will compare to our competitors or that historical performance will be indicative of future returns. Any drop or perceived drop in investment performance as compared to our competitors could cause a decline in sales of our mutual funds and other investment products, an increase in redemptions and the termination of institutional asset management relationships. These impacts may reduce our aggregate amount of assets under management and reduce management fees. Poor investment performance could also adversely affect our ability to expand the distribution of our products through unaffiliated third parties. Further, any drop in market share of mutual funds sales by our advisors may further reduce profits as sales of other companies’ mutual funds are less profitable than sales of our proprietary funds.

We may not be able to maintain our unaffiliated third-party distribution channels or the terms by which unaffiliated third parties sell our products.

We distribute certain of our investment products through unaffiliated third-party advisors and financial institutions. Maintaining and deepening relationships with these unaffiliated distributors is an important part of our growth strategy, as strong third-party distribution arrangements enhance our ability to market our products and to increase our assets under management, revenues and profitability. There can be no assurance that the distribution relationships we have established will continue, as our distribution partners may cease to operate or otherwise terminate their relationship with us. Any such reduction in access to third-party distributors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products and to generate revenue in our Asset Management and Annuities segments.

Access to distribution channels is subject to intense competition due to the large number of competitors and products in the investment advisory and annuities industries as well as regulatory and consumer trends driving escalating compliance, disclosure and risk management requirements for distributors. Relationships with distributors are subject to periodic negotiation that may result in increased distribution costs and/or reductions in the amount of our products marketed, and the frequency or complexity of these negotiations is expected to increase in light of prevailing regulatory reforms and market volatility. Any increase in the costs to distribute our products or reduction in the type or amount of products made available for sale may have a material effect on our revenues and profitability.

We face risks arising from acquisitions and divestitures.

We have made acquisitions and divestitures in the past and may pursue similar strategic transactions in the future. Risks in acquisition transactions include difficulties in the integration of acquired businesses into our operations and control environment (including our risk management policies and procedures), difficulties in assimilating and retaining employees and intermediaries, difficulties in retaining the existing customers of the acquired entities, assumed or unforeseen liabilities that arise in connection with the acquired businesses, the failure of counterparties to satisfy any obligations to indemnify us against liabilities arising from the acquired businesses, and unfavorable market conditions that could negatively impact our growth expectations for the acquired businesses. Fully integrating an acquired company or business into our operations (such as our recent acquisitions of Lionstone Investments and IPI) may take a significant amount of time. Risks in divestiture transactions (such as our recent divestiture of our auto and home insurance business to American Family Insurance) include difficulties in the separation of the disposed business, retention or obligation to indemnify certain liabilities, the failure of counterparties to satisfy payment obligations, unfavorable market conditions that may impact any earnout or contingency payment due to us, if any, and unexpected difficulties in losing employees of the disposed business. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions. Execution of our business strategies also may require certain regulatory approvals or consents, which may include approvals of the FRB and other domestic and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. These regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the activities or transactions contemplated by our business strategies which may impact negatively our ability to realize fully the expected benefits of certain opportunities. These risks may prevent us from realizing the


expected benefits from acquisitions or divestitures and could result in the failure to realize the full economic value of a strategic transaction or the impairment of goodwill and/or intangible assets recognized at the time of an acquisition. These risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time.

Third-party defaults, bankruptcy filings, legal actions and other events may limit the value of or restrict our access and our clients’ access to cash and investments.

Capital and credit market volatility can exacerbate, and has exacerbated, the risk of third-party defaults, bankruptcy filings, foreclosures, legal actions and other events that may limit the value of or restrict our access and our clients’ access to cash and investments. Although we are not required to do so, we have elected in the past, and we may elect in the future, to compensate clients for losses incurred in response to such events, provide clients with temporary credit or liquidity or other support related to products that we manage, or provide credit liquidity or other support to the financial products we manage. Any such election to provide support may arise from factors specific to our clients, our products or industry-wide factors. If we elect to provide additional support, we could incur losses from the support we provide and incur additional costs, including financing costs, in connection with the support. These losses and additional costs could be material and could adversely impact our results of operations. If we were to take such actions we may also restrict or otherwise utilize our corporate assets, limiting our flexibility to use these assets for other purposes, and may be required to raise additional capital.

Defaults in our fixed maturity securities portfolio or consumer credit holdings could adversely affect our earnings.

Issuers of the fixed maturity securities that we own may default on principal and interest payments. As of December 31, 2019, 3.1% of our fixed maturity securities had ratings below investment-grade. Moreover, economic downturns and corporate malfeasance can increase the number of companies, including those with investment-grade ratings, which default on their debt obligations. Default-related declines in the value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio or consumer credit holdings could cause our net earnings to decline and could also cause us to contribute capital to some of our regulated subsidiaries, which may require us to obtain funding during periods of unfavorable market conditions.

Our valuation of fixed maturity and equity securities may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions which are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition.

Fixed maturity, equity, trading securities and short-term investments, which are reported at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent the majority of our total cash and invested assets. The determination of fair values by management in the absence of quoted market prices is based on valuation methodologies, securities we deem to be comparable, and assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances. The fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. Factors considered in estimating fair value include: coupon rate, maturity, estimated duration, call provisions, sinking fund requirements, credit rating, industry sector of the issuer, interest rates, credit spreads, and quoted market prices of comparable securities. The use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

During periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates and rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities. There may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the financial environment. In such cases, the valuation of certain securities may require additional subjectivity and management judgment. As such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable and may require greater estimation as well as valuation methods that are more sophisticated, which may result in values less than the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. Further, rapidly changing and unexpected credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

The elimination of LIBOR may adversely affect the interest rates on and value of certain derivatives and floating rate securities we hold, the activities we conduct, and any other assets or liabilities whose value is tied to LIBOR.

The FCA, which regulates the LIBOR, has announced that it will not compel panel banks to contribute to LIBOR after 2021. It is likely that banks will not continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 and possibly prior to then. It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates will occur over the next two years.

Actions by regulators have resulted in the establishment of alternative reference rates to LIBOR in most major currencies. The U.S. Federal Reserve, based on the recommendations of the New York Federal Reserve’s Alternative Reference Rate Committee (constituted of major derivative market participants and their regulators), has begun publishing a Secured Overnight Funding Rate (“SOFR”) which is intended to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR, and SOFR-based investment products have been issued in the U.S. Proposals for alternative reference rates for other currencies have also been announced or have already begun publication. Markets are slowly developing in response to these new rates and questions around liquidity in these rates and how to appropriately adjust these rates to eliminate any economic value transfer at the time of transition remain a significant concern for us and others in the marketplace.

Although the full impact of transition remains unclear, this change may have an adverse impact on the value of, return on and trading markets for a broad array of financial products, including any LIBOR-based securities, loans and derivatives that are included in our financial assets


and liabilities. If LIBOR is discontinued after 2021 as expected, there will be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments. There will be significant work required to transition to the new benchmark rates and implement necessary changes to our systems, processes and models. This may impact our existing transaction data, products, systems, operations, valuation and financial risk management processes. In addition, LIBOR may perform differently during the phase-out period than in the past which could result in lower interest payments and a reduction in the value of certain assets.

Accordingly, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the transition away from LIBOR on various derivatives, floating rate securities and other securities we hold, the activities we conduct in our various businesses, and any other assets or liabilities (as well as contractual rights and obligations) whose value is tied to LIBOR. The value or profitability of these products and instruments, and our costs of operations, may be adversely affected until new reference rates and fallbacks for both legacy and new products, instruments and contracts are commercially accepted.

The determination of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on certain investments is subject to management’s evaluation and judgment and could materially impact our results of operations or financial position.

The determination of the amount of allowances and impairments vary by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of inherent and known risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in allowances and impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised. Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments or allowances.

The assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on management’s case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value that considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer or borrower, and management uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security or loan and in assessing the prospects for recovery. Inherent in management’s evaluation of the security or loan are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential.

Some of our investments are relatively illiquid.

We invest a portion of our owned assets in certain privately placed fixed income securities, mortgage loans, policy loans and limited partnership interests, all of which are relatively illiquid. These asset classes represented 12.9% of the carrying value of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2019. If we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of our normal cash requirements, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them for an amount less than we would otherwise have been able to realize, or both, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

The failure of other insurers could require us to pay higher assessments to state insurance guaranty funds.

Our insurance companies are required by law to be members of the guaranty fund association in every state where they are licensed to do business. In the event of insolvency of one or more unaffiliated insurance companies, our insurance companies could be adversely affected by the requirement to pay assessments to the guaranty fund associations. Uncertainty and volatility in the U.S. economy and financial markets in recent years, plus the repercussions of a heightened regulatory environment, have weakened or may weaken the financial condition of numerous insurers, including insurers currently in receiverships, increasing the risk of triggering guaranty fund assessments. For more information regarding assessments from guaranty fund associations, see Note 26 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

If the counterparties to our reinsurance arrangements or to the derivative instruments we use to hedge our business risks default or otherwise fail to fulfill their obligations, we may be exposed to risks we had sought to mitigate, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

We use reinsurance to mitigate our risks in various circumstances as described in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K - “Business - Our Segments - Protection - Reinsurance.” Reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders and contractholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us. Accordingly, we bear credit and performance risk with respect to our reinsurers, including Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company as well as Genworth Life Insurance Company. In July 2016, we finalized various confidential enhancements with Genworth Life Insurance Company that have been shared, in the normal course of regular reviews, with our Domiciliary Regulators and rating agencies. A reinsurer’s insolvency or its inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of our reinsurance agreement could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Notes 2, 7 and 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding reinsurance.

In addition, we use a variety of derivative instruments (including options, forwards, swaps and futures with a number of counterparties to hedge business risks. The amount and breadth of exposure to derivative counterparties, as well as the cost of derivative instruments, have increased significantly in connection with our strategies to hedge guaranteed benefit obligations under our variable annuity products. If our counterparties fail to honor their obligations under the derivative instruments in a timely manner, our hedges of the related risk will be ineffective. That failure could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. This risk of failure of our hedge transactions from counterparty default may be increased by capital market volatility.


We provide investment securities as collateral to our derivative counterparties which they may sell, pledge, or rehypothecate. We have exposure, under the relevant arrangement, if the collateral is not returned to us to the extent that the fair value of the collateral exceeds our liability. Additionally, we may also accept investment securities as collateral from our derivative counterparties, which we may sell, pledge, or rehypothecate. If the counterparties that we pledge the collateral to are not able to return these investment securities under the terms of the relevant arrangements, we would be required to deliver alternative investments or cash to our derivative counterparty, which could impact our liquidity and could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.

If our reserves for future policy benefits and claims or for our bank lending portfolio or for future certificate redemptions and maturities are inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserve liabilities, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We establish reserves as estimates of our liabilities to provide for future obligations under our insurance policies, annuities and investment certificate contracts. We also establish reserves as estimates of the potential for loan losses in our consumer lending portfolios. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of the liability but, rather, are estimates of contract benefits and related expenses we expect to incur over time. The assumptions and estimates we make in establishing reserves require certain judgments about future experience and, therefore, are inherently uncertain. We cannot determine with precision the actual amounts that we will pay for contract benefits, the timing of payments, or whether the assets supporting our stated reserves will increase to the levels we estimate before payment of benefits or claims. We monitor our reserve levels continually. If we were to conclude that our reserves are insufficient to cover actual or expected contract benefits, we would be required to increase our reserves and incur income statement charges for the period in which we make the determination, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. For more information on how we set our reserves, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Morbidity rates, mortality rates or the severity or frequency of other insurance claims that differ significantly from our pricing expectations could negatively affect profitability.

We have historically set, and continue to set, prices for

RiverSource

life disability insurance (and historically LTC insurance) as well as some annuity products based upon expected claim payment patterns, derived from assumptions we make about our policyholders and contractholders, including morbidity and mortality rates. The long-term profitability of these products depends upon how our actual experience compares with our pricing assumptions. For example, if morbidity rates are higher, or mortality rates are lower, than our pricing assumptions, we could be required to make greater payments under disability income insurance policies, chronic care riders and immediate annuity contracts than we had projected. The same holds true for LTC policies we previously underwrote to the extent of the risks that we retained. If mortality rates are higher than our pricing assumptions, we could be required to make greater payments under our life insurance policies and annuity contracts with guaranteed minimum death benefits than we have projected.

The risk that our claims experience may differ significantly from our pricing assumptions is particularly significant for our LTC insurance products notwithstanding our ability to implement future price increases with regulatory approvals. As with life insurance, LTC insurance policies provide for long-duration coverage and, therefore, our actual claims experience will emerge over many years. However, as a relatively new product in the market, LTC insurance does not have the extensive claims experience history of life insurance and, as a result, our ability to forecast future claim rates for LTC insurance is more limited than for life insurance. We have sought to moderate these uncertainties to some extent by partially reinsuring LTC policies at the time the policies were underwritten and limiting our present stand-alone LTC insurance offerings to policies underwritten fully by unaffiliated third-party insurers, and we have also implemented rate increases on certain in force policies. Certain estimates and assumptions used in setting our LTC reserves (which is an inherently uncertain and complex process) are described in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K - “Business - Our Segments - Corporate & Other - Closed Block Long Term Care Insurance.” We may be required to implement additional rate increases in the future and may or may not receive regulatory approval for the full extent and timing of any rate increases that we may seek.

We may face losses if there are significant deviations from our assumptions regarding the future persistency of our insurance policies and annuity contracts.

The prices and expected future profitability of our life insurance and deferred annuity products are based in part upon assumptions related to persistency, which is the probability that a policy or contract will remain in force from one period to the next. Economic and market dislocations may occur, and future consumer persistency behaviors could vary materially from the past. The effect of persistency on profitability varies for different products. For most of our life insurance and deferred annuity products, actual persistency that is lower than our persistency assumptions could have an adverse impact on profitability, especially in the early years of a policy or contract, primarily because we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy or contract.

For our LTC insurance and universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees, as well as variable annuities with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits, actual persistency that is higher than our persistency assumptions could have a negative impact on profitability. If these policies remain in force longer than we assumed, we could be required to make greater benefit payments than we had anticipated when we priced or partially reinsured these products. Some of our LTC insurance policies have experienced higher persistency and poorer morbidity experience than we had assumed, which led us to increase premium rates on certain policies.

Because our assumptions regarding persistency experience are inherently uncertain, reserves for future policy benefits and claims may prove to be inadequate if actual persistency experience is different from those assumptions. Although some of our products permit us


to increase premiums during the life of the policy or contract, we cannot guarantee that these increases would be sufficient to maintain profitability. Additionally, some of these pricing changes require regulatory approval, which may not be forthcoming. Moreover, many of our products do not permit us to increase premiums or limit those increases during the life of the policy or contract, while premiums on certain other products (primarily LTC insurance) may not be increased without prior regulatory approval. Significant deviations in experience from pricing expectations regarding persistency could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our products.

We may be required to accelerate the amortization of DAC, which would increase our expenses.

DAC represents the portion of costs which are incremental and direct to the acquisition of new or renewal business, principally direct sales commissions and other distribution and underwriting costs that have been deferred on the sale of annuity, life and disability income insurance and, to a lesser extent, distribution expenses for certain mutual fund products. For annuity and universal life products, DAC are amortized based on projections of estimated gross profits over amortization periods equal to the approximate life of the business. For other insurance products, DAC are generally amortized as a percentage of premiums over amortization periods equal to the premium-paying period. For certain mutual fund products, we generally amortize DAC over fixed periods on a straight-line basis, adjusted for redemptions.

Our projections underlying the amortization of DAC for insurance and annuity products require the use of certain assumptions, including interest margins, mortality rates, persistency rates, maintenance expense levels and customer asset value growth rates for variable products. We periodically review and, where appropriate, adjust our assumptions. When we change our assumptions, we may be required to accelerate the amortization of DAC or to record a charge to increase benefit reserves.

For more information regarding DAC, see Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Deferred Acquisition Costs.”

Misconduct by our employees and advisors is difficult to detect and deter and could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Misconduct or errors by our employees and advisors could result in violations of law, regulatory sanctions and/or serious reputational or financial harm. Misconduct or errors can occur in each of our businesses and could include: (i) binding us to transactions that exceed authorized limits; (ii) hiding unauthorized or unsuccessful activities resulting in unknown and unmanaged risks or losses; (iii) improperly or inadvertently using, disclosing or otherwise compromising confidential information, including client confidential information; (iv) recommending transactions that are not suitable; (v) engaging in fraudulent or otherwise improper activity, including the misappropriation of funds; (vi) engaging in unauthorized or excessive trading to the detriment of customers; or (vii) otherwise not complying with laws, regulations or our control procedures.

We cannot always deter misconduct by our employees and advisors, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Preventing and detecting misconduct among our franchisee advisors who are not employees of our company presents additional challenges. We also cannot assure you that misconduct by our employees and advisors will not lead to a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

A failure to protect our reputation could adversely affect our businesses.

Our reputation is one of our most important assets. Our ability to attract and retain customers, investors, employees and advisors is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our company. Damage to our reputation could cause significant harm to our business and prospects. Reputational damage may arise from numerous sources including litigation or regulatory actions, failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality, compliance failures, any perceived or actual weakness in our financial strength or liquidity, technological, cybersecurity, or other security breaches (including attempted or inadvertent breaches) resulting in improper disclosure of client or employee personal information, unethical or improper behavior and the misconduct or error of our employees, advisors and counterparties. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters could damage our reputation among existing and potential customers, investors, employees and advisors. Reputations may take decades to build, and any negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse mainstream and social media publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. Adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us.

Our reputation is also dependent on our continued identification of and mitigation against conflicts of interest. As we have expanded the scope of our businesses and our client base, we increasingly have to identify and address potential conflicts of interest, including those relating to our proprietary activities and those relating to our sales of non-proprietary products from manufacturers that have agreed to provide us marketing, sales and account maintenance support. For example, conflicts may arise between our position as a provider of financial planning services and as a manufacturer and/or distributor or broker of asset accumulation, income or insurance products that one of our advisors may recommend to a financial planning client. We have procedures and controls that are designed to identify, address and appropriately disclose perceived conflicts of interest. However, identifying and appropriately addressing conflicts of interest is complex, and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to address conflicts of interest appropriately.

In addition, the SEC and other federal and state regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest. It is possible that potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or enforcement actions. Also, it is possible that the regulatory scrutiny


of, and litigation in connection with, conflicts of interest will make our clients less willing to enter into transactions in which such a conflict may occur, which would adversely affect our businesses.

Our operational systems and networks have been, and will continue to be, subject to evolving cybersecurity or other technological risks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential client or employee information, loss of our proprietary information, damage to our reputation, additional costs to us, regulatory penalties and other adverse impacts. The same is true for systems, networks and operations that franchise advisors control locally.

Our business is reliant upon internal and third-party technology systems and networks to process, transmit and store information, including sensitive client and proprietary information, and to conduct many of our business activities and transactions with our clients, advisors, vendors and other third parties. Maintaining the security and integrity of this information and these systems and networks, and appropriately responding to any cybersecurity and privacy incidents (including attempts), is critical to the success of our business operations, including our reputation, the retention of our advisors and clients, and to the protection of our proprietary information and our clients’ personal information. To date, we have not experienced any material breaches of or interference with our centrally controlled systems and networks, however, we routinely face and address such threats. For example, in past years we and other financial institutions experienced distributed denial of service attacks intended to disrupt the centrally controlled systems that provide clients with access to online systems and information. While we have been able to detect and respond to these incidents to date without loss of client assets or information, we enhanced our corporate security capabilities and cybersecurity incident response manual and will continue to assess our ability to monitor for, detect, prevent, mitigate, respond to and recover from such threats. In addition to the foregoing, our (and our advisors’) experiences with cybersecurity and technology threats have included phishing and spear phishing scams, social engineering attacks, account takeovers, introductions of malware, attempts at electronic break-ins, and the submission of fraudulent payment requests. The number of attempted phishing attacks increased substantially in 2019, and we do not expect a reduction in the future. Any successful breaches or interference (as well as attempted breaches or interference) by third parties or by insiders that may occur in the future could have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.

On a corporate basis, we are subject to international, federal and state regulations, and in some cases contractual obligations, that require us to establish and maintain corporate policies and procedures designed to protect sensitive client, employee, contractor and vendor information and respond to cybersecurity incidents. We have implemented policies that require our franchisee advisors who control locally their own technology operations to do the same. We have implemented and maintain security measures designed to protect against breaches of corporate security and other interference with our corporate systems and networks resulting from attacks by third parties, including hackers, and from employee, advisor or service provider error or malfeasance. We also contractually require third-party vendors who, in the provision of services to us, are provided with access to our systems and information pertaining to our business or our clients, to meet certain physical and information security standards. We recommend through policies that franchise advisors do the same with their facilities, systems and third-party vendors. Changes in our client base, the mix of assets under management or administration and business model or technology platform changes, such as an evolution to accommodate mobile computing, virtual interface and multi-device functionality, may also require corresponding changes in our systems, networks and data security and response measures. While accessing our products and services, our customers may use computers and other devices that sit outside of our security control. We provide tips for clients regarding safe online practices, but cannot be sure clients will adopt some or all such advice. In addition, the ever-increasing reliance on technology systems and networks and the occurrence and potential adverse impact of attacks on such systems and networks (including in recent well-publicized security breaches at other companies), both generally and in the financial services industry, have enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cybersecurity threats. As these threats, and government and regulatory oversight of associated risks, continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to enhance or expand upon the security and response measures we currently maintain or that we allow franchise advisors to maintain and control locally.

Despite the measures we have taken and may in the future take to address and mitigate cybersecurity, privacy and technology risks, we cannot assure you that our systems and networks will not be subject to successful attacks, breaches or interference. Nor can we always assure you that franchise advisors will comply with our policies and procedures in this regard, or that clients will engage in safe online practices. Any such event may result in operational disruptions (including for example, various delays or mistakes in materials provided to our clients and shareholders in the Columbia Threadneedle Investments funds, as well as impacts to pricing, calculation and trading operations for the Columbia Threadneedle Investments funds and various operations for our other businesses),

personal information, which in turn may result in legal claims, regulatory scrutiny and liability, reputational damage, the incurrence of costs to eliminate or mitigate further exposure, the loss of clients or advisors or other damage to our business. While we maintain cyber liability insurance that provides both third-party liability and first-party liability coverages, this insurance may not be sufficient to protect us against all cybersecurity-related losses. Furthermore, we may be subject to indemnification costs and liability to third parties if we breach any confidentiality obligations regarding vendor data or for losses related to the data. In addition, the trend toward broad consumer and general-public notification of such incidents could exacerbate the harm to our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. Even if we successfully protect our technology infrastructure and the confidentiality of sensitive data and conduct appropriate incident response, we may incur

addition, our regulators may seek to hold our company responsible for the acts or omissions of our franchise advisors even where they procure and control much of the physical office space and technology infrastructure they use to operate their businesses locally. We could also suffer harm to our business and


reputation if attempted security breaches are publicized regardless of whether or not harm was actually done to any client or client information or employee or employee information. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, discovery of new vulnerabilities, attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in our systems or third-party systems we or our franchise advisors use, data thefts, physical system or network break-ins or inappropriate access, or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology or other security measures protecting the networks and systems used in connection with our business.

Protection from system interruptions and operating errors is important to our business. If we experience a sustained interruption to our telecommunications or data processing systems, or other failure in operational execution, it could harm our business.

Operating errors and system or network interruptions could delay and disrupt our ability to develop, deliver or maintain our products and services, or to operate compliance or risk management functions, causing harm to our business and reputation and resulting in loss of our advisors, clients or revenue. Interruptions could be caused by operational failures arising from service provider, employee or advisor error or malfeasance, interference by third parties, including hackers, our implementation of new technology, as well as from our maintenance of existing technology. Our financial, accounting, data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate or report data properly, experience connectivity disruptions or otherwise become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, adversely affecting our ability to process transactions or provide products and services to our clients. These interruptions can include fires, floods, earthquakes and other natural disasters, power losses, equipment failures, attacks by third parties, failures of internal or vendor personnel, software, equipment or systems and other events beyond our control. Although we have developed, regularly test and maintain a comprehensive business continuity plan and cybersecurity incident response manual that covers potential disruptions to centrally controlled systems and platforms and require our key technology vendors and service providers to do the same, there are inherent limitations in such plans and they might not, despite testing and monitoring, operate as designed in the event of an actual event or crisis. Further, we cannot control the execution of any business continuity or incident response plans implemented by our service providers or our franchise advisors.

We rely on third-party service providers and vendors for certain communications, technology and business functions and other services, and we face the risk of operational failure (including, without limitation, failure caused by an inaccuracy, untimeliness or other deficiency in data reporting), technical or security failures, termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other third-party service providers that we use to facilitate or are component providers to our securities transactions and other product manufacturing and distribution activities. For example, many of our applications run on a technology infrastructure managed on an outsourced basis by IBM since 2002. Under this arrangement, IBM is responsible for most mainframe, mid-range, computing network and storage operations, which includes a portion of our web hosting operations, and we are subject to the risks of any operational failure, termination or other restraints in this arrangement. These risks are heightened by our deployment in response to both investor interest and evolution in the financial markets of increasingly sophisticated products, such as those which incorporate automatic asset re-allocation, long/short trading strategies or multiple portfolios or funds, and business-driven hedging, compliance and other risk management or investment or financial management strategies. Any such failure, termination or constraint or flawed response could adversely impact our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk, or otherwise achieve desired outcomes.

Risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in identifying or mitigating risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including employee and financial advisor misconduct.

We have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and will continue to do so. Nonetheless, our policies and procedures to identify, monitor and manage risks may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk. Many of our methods of managing risk and the associated exposures are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior or statistics based on historical models. During periods of market volatility, or due to unforeseen events, the historically-derived correlations upon which these methods are based may not be valid. As a result, these methods may not predict future exposures accurately, which could be significantly greater than what our models indicate. Further some controls are manual and are subject to inherent limitations. This could cause us to incur investment losses or cause our hedging and other risk management strategies to be ineffective. Other risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, clients, catastrophe occurrence or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible to us, which may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated.

Moreover, we are subject to the risks of errors and misconduct by our employees and advisors, such as fraud, non-compliance with policies, recommending transactions that are not suitable, and improperly using or disclosing confidential information. These risks are difficult to detect in advance and deter, and could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition. We are further subject to the risk of nonperformance or inadequate performance of contractual obligations by third-party vendors of products and services that are used in our businesses. Management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk. Insurance and other traditional risk-shifting tools may be held by or available to us in order to manage certain exposures, but they are subject to terms such as deductibles, coinsurance, limits and policy exclusions, as well as risk of counterparty denial of coverage, default or insolvency.


As a holding company, we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us to pay dividends and to meet our obligations.

We act as a holding company for our subsidiaries, through which substantially all of our operations are conducted. Dividends from our subsidiaries and permitted payments to us under our intercompany arrangements with our subsidiaries are our principal sources of cash to pay shareholder dividends and to meet our other financial obligations. These obligations include our operating expenses and interest and principal on our borrowings. If the cash we receive from our subsidiaries pursuant to dividend payment and intercompany arrangements is insufficient for us to fund any of these obligations, we may be required to raise cash through the incurrence of additional debt, the issuance of additional equity or the sale of assets. If any of this happens, it could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.

Insurance, banking and securities laws and regulations regulate the ability of many of our subsidiaries (such as our insurance, banking and brokerage subsidiaries and our face-amount certificate company) to pay dividends or make other permitted payments. Further, the FRB’s 2019 proposal for a new capital framework for ISLHCs, termed the “Building Block Approach”, would create new capital requirements (even if there are any refinements to the proposal) which could potentially impact the way we structure our capital or manage our business. See Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K - “Regulation” as well as the information contained in Part II, Item 7 under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.” In addition to the various regulatory restrictions and local law requirements that constrain our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or make other permitted payments to our company, the rating organizations impose various capital requirements on our company and our insurance company subsidiaries in order for us to maintain our ratings and the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. The value of assets on the company-level balance sheets of our subsidiaries is a significant factor in determining these restrictions and capital requirements. As asset values decline, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or make other permitted payments can be reduced. Additionally, the various asset classes held by our subsidiaries, and used in determining required capital levels, are weighted differently or are restricted as to the proportion in which they may be held depending upon their liquidity, credit risk and other factors. Volatility in relative asset values among different asset classes can alter the proportion of our subsidiaries’ holdings in those classes, which could increase required capital and constrain our and our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or make other permitted payments. The regulatory capital requirements and dividend-paying ability of our subsidiaries may also be affected by a change in the mix of products sold by such subsidiaries. For example, fixed annuities typically require more capital than variable annuities, and an increase in the proportion of fixed annuities sold in relation to variable annuities could increase the regulatory capital requirements of our life insurance subsidiaries. This may reduce the dividends or other permitted payments which could be made from those subsidiaries in the near term without the rating organizations viewing this negatively. Further, the capital requirements imposed upon our subsidiaries may be impacted by heightened regulatory scrutiny and intervention, which could negatively affect our and our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or make other permitted payments. Additionally, in the past we have found it necessary and advisable to provide support to certain of our subsidiaries in order to maintain adequate capital for regulatory or other purposes and we may provide such support in the future. The provision of such support could adversely affect our excess capital, liquidity, and the dividends or other permitted payments received from our subsidiaries.

The operation of our business in foreign markets and our investments in non-U.S. denominated securities and investment products subjects us to exchange rate and other risks in connection with international operations and earnings and income generated overseas.

While we are a U.S.-based company, a significant portion of our business operations occurs outside of the U.S. and some of our investments are not denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, we are exposed to certain foreign currency exchange risks that could reduce U.S. dollar equivalent earnings as well as negatively impact our general account and other proprietary investment portfolios. Appreciation of the U.S. dollar could unfavorably affect net income from foreign operations, the value of non-U.S. dollar denominated investments and investments in foreign subsidiaries. In comparison, depreciation of the U.S. dollar could positively affect our net income from foreign operations and the value of non-U.S. dollar denominated investments, though such depreciation could also diminish investor, creditor and rating organizations’ perceptions of our company compared to peer companies that have a relatively greater proportion of foreign operations or investments.

We may seek to mitigate these risks by employing various hedging strategies including entering into derivative contracts. Currency fluctuations, including the effect of changes in the value of U.S. dollar denominated investments that vary from the amounts ultimately needed to hedge our exposure to changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent of earnings and equity of these operations, may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

In addition, conducting and increasing our international operations subjects us to new risks that, generally, we have not faced in the U.S., including: (i) unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements; (ii) difficulties in managing and staffing international operations; (iii) potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earning; (iii) the localization of our solutions and related costs; (iv) the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and different legal standards, including laws and regulations; (v) increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; and (vi) local, regional and global political, social and economic instability abroad. The occurrence of any one of these risks could negatively affect our international business and, consequently, our results of operations generally. Additionally, operating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources. We cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required in establishing, acquiring or integrating operations in other countries, or


adjusting to changes in local or regional political environments (such as may result from Brexit) will produce desired levels of revenues or profitability.

As an example, the full impact of Brexit and its related consequences remain uncertain, including with respect to ongoing negotiations between the UK and EU and new trade agreements with global trading partners. During this period and beyond, the impact of any partial or complete dissolution of the EU on the UK and European economies and the broader global economy could be significant, resulting in negative impacts on currency and financial markets generally, such as increased volatility and illiquidity, and potentially lower economic growth in markets in the UK, Europe and globally, which may adversely affect the value of the

Columbia Threadneedle Investments

funds’ portfolio investments. The UK has one of the largest economies in Europe, and member countries of the EU are substantial trading partners of the UK. The UK financial service sector continues to face uncertainty over the UK’s final relationship with the EU and globally as a result of Brexit. For example, certain financial services operations may have to move outside of the UK following the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020 (e.g., currency trading, international settlement operations). Additionally, depending on the final terms agreed with the EU during this transition period, certain financial services businesses may be forced to move staff and comply with two separate sets of rules, or lose business to firms in Europe. Furthermore, final terms may create the potential for decreased trade, the possibility of capital outflows, devaluation of the pound sterling, the cost of higher corporate bond spreads, and the risk that all the above could negatively impact business and consumer spending as well as foreign direct investment. As a result of Brexit, the British economy and its currency may be negatively impacted by changes to the UK’s economic and political relations with the EU and other countries. Any further exits from the EU, or the possibility of such exits, would likely cause additional market disruption globally and introduce new legal and regulatory uncertainties. The impact of Brexit in the near- and long-term is still unknown and could have additional adverse effects on economies, financial markets, currencies and asset valuations around the world.

The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters and catastrophes could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

The occurrence of natural disasters and catastrophes, including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, fires, blackouts, severe winter weather, explosions, pandemic disease and man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism, insurrections and military actions, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Such disasters and catastrophes may damage our facilities, preventing our employees and financial advisors from performing their roles or otherwise disturbing our ordinary business operations and by impacting insurance claims, as described below. These impacts could be particularly severe to the extent they affect our computer-based data processing, transmission, storage and retrieval systems and destroy or release valuable data. Such disasters and catastrophes may also impact us indirectly by changing the condition and behaviors of our customers, business counterparties and regulators, as well as by causing declines or volatility in the economic and financial markets.

The potential effects of natural and man-made disasters and catastrophes on certain of our businesses include but are not limited to the following: (i) a catastrophic loss of life may materially increase the amount of or accelerate the timing in which benefits are paid under our insurance policies; (ii) an increase in claims and any resulting increase in claims reserves caused by a disaster may harm the financial condition of our reinsurers, thereby impacting the cost and availability of reinsurance and the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries; and (iii) declines and volatility in the financial markets may decrease the value of our assets under management and administration, which could harm our financial condition and reduce our management fees.

We cannot predict the impact that changing climate conditions may have on the frequency and severity of natural disasters or on overall economic stability and sustainability. As such, we cannot be sure that our actions to identify and mitigate the risks associated with such disasters and catastrophes, including predictive modeling, establishing liabilities for expected claims, acquiring insurance and reinsurance and developing business continuity plans, will be effective.

Legal, Regulatory and Tax Risks

Legal and regulatory actions are inherent in our businesses and could result in financial losses or harm our businesses.

We are, and in the future may be, subject to legal and regulatory actions in the ordinary course of our operations, both domestically and internationally. Actions brought against us may result in awards, settlements, penalties, injunctions or other adverse results, including reputational damage. In addition, we may incur significant expenses in connection with our defense against such actions regardless of their outcome. Various regulatory and governmental bodies have the authority to review our products and business practices and those of our employees and independent financial advisors and to bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our employees or advisors, are improper. Pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings relating to aspects of our businesses and operations that are specific to us and proceedings that are typical of the industries and businesses in which we operate. Some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants. In certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. See Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K - “Legal Proceedings.” In or as a result of turbulent times, the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings generally increase.


Our businesses are regulated heavily, and changes to the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses may have an adverse effect on our operations, reputation and financial condition.

Virtually all aspects of our business, including the activities of our parent company and our various subsidiaries, are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations. For a discussion of the regulatory framework in which we operate, see “Business - Regulation.” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Compliance with these applicable laws and regulations is time-consuming and personnel-intensive, and we have invested and will continue to invest substantial resources to ensure compliance by our parent company and our subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, registered representatives and agents. Any enforcement actions, investigations or other proceedings brought against us or our subsidiaries, directors, employees or advisors by our regulators may result in fines, injunctions or other disciplinary actions that could harm our reputation or impact our results of operations. Further, any changes to the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses, as well as changes to the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations, may affect our operations and financial condition. Such changes may impact our operations and profitability and the practices of our advisors, including with respect to the scope of products and services provided, the manner in which products and services are marketed and sold and the incurrence of additional costs of doing business. Ongoing changes to regulation and oversight of the financial industry may produce results, the full impact of which cannot be immediately ascertained. In addition, we expect the worldwide demographic trend of population aging will cause policymakers to continue to focus on the framework of U.S. and non-U.S. retirement systems, which may drive additional changes regarding the manner in which individuals plan for and fund their retirement, the extent of government involvement in retirement savings and funding, the regulation of retirement products and services and the oversight of industry participants. For example, we continue to see enhanced legislative and regulatory interest regarding retirement investing, financial advisors and investment professionals, and we will continue to closely review and monitor any legislative or regulatory proposals and changes. Any incremental requirements, costs and risks imposed on us in connection with such current or future legislative or regulatory changes may constrain our ability to market our products and services to potential customers, and could negatively impact our profitability and make it more difficult for us to pursue our growth strategy.

Certain examples of legislative and regulatory changes that may impact our businesses are described below. Some of the changes could present operational challenges and increase costs. Ultimately these complexities and increased costs could have an impact on our ability to offer cost-effective and innovative insurance products to our clients.

In June 2019 the SEC adopted a package of rulemakings and interpretations related to the provision of advice by broker-dealers and investment advisers, including Regulation Best Interest and the Client Relationship Summary (Form CRS), effective June 30, 2020. Among other things, Regulation Best Interest requires a broker-dealer to act in the best interest of a retail customer when making a recommendation to that customer of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities. The regulation entails heightened standards for broker-dealers, and we anticipate incurring additional costs in order to review and modify our policies and procedures, as well as associated supervisory and compliance controls and the provision of Form CRS to clients.

Furthermore, New York,

Massachusetts

and several other states have either issued their own best interest or fiduciary rules or are considering doing so and those rules may be limited to certain types of products (e.g. insurance and annuities, financial planning, etc.) or may broadly cover all recommendations made by financial advisors. The Department of Labor (“DOL”) has included on its regulatory agenda fiduciary rulemaking regarding investment advice to clients who hold assets in IRAs and certain employer-sponsored retirement plan accounts. The Certified Financial Planner Board has updated its professional standards of conduct to include a fiduciary standard that applies to financial advisors who hold a Certified Financial Planner designation. Currently, Ameriprise has approximately 4,100 financial advisors that hold a Certified Financial Planner designation. Considering the various fiduciary rules and regulations that have been proposed or finalized, we continue to exert significant efforts to evaluate and prepare to comply with each rule.

Depending on the span and substance of any regulations and the timing of their applicability, the scope of any implementation could impact the way we compensate our advisors, particularly with respect to the sale of commission-based products, the access that representatives of affiliated and unaffiliated product manufacturers could have to our advisors and clients, and the manner and degree to which we and our advisors could have selling and marketing costs reimbursed by product manufacturers. We have incurred infrastructure costs in anticipation of compliance with these new regulations, and ongoing costs will be driven by how these regulations may evolve over the course of time. Depending on the final regulations, we could be subject to both increased litigation risk and the possibility of overlapping or competing requirements from other regulators. Our solutions may be different than some or all of our competitors which may lead us to having a competitive advantage or disadvantage as compared to our peers. How our advisors, prospective advisor recruits, distribution partners, competitors and the broader financial industry adapt to any final regulation, or how clients, prospective clients and regulators react to industry and business changes driven thereof, will evolve over the course of time.

MiFID II came into effect in January 2018 and is the most significant regulatory change EU investment firms have recently faced. MiFID II strengthened the requirement for investment firms to act in the client’s best interest, in many areas including conflicts of interest (specifically, inducements and a prohibition on free research), strengthening of best execution requirements and increased costs and charges disclosure, in relation to all services provided to clients. In response to MiFID II, Columbia Threadneedle Investments has implemented wide ranging changes to systems, policies and operating procedures across its business. Implementation of our internal measures will have direct and indirect impacts on us and certain of our affiliates, including significant changes to client


servicing models, distribution models, the fees we are able to charge to clients and the way that our affiliates execute investment decisions for client portfolios. MiFID II and similar regimes may result in existing flows of business moving to less profitable channels or even to competitors providing substitutable products outside the regime. The interpretation and implementation of the inducements rules has also resulted in major changes to how fund managers finance investment research with many firms opting to pay for third-party investment research for U.S. and non-U.S. client accounts regardless of whether such accounts were covered by MiFID II. There is no assurance we will continue to have access to the third-party broker-dealers, banks, investment advisers and other financial intermediaries that currently distribute our products, or continue to have the opportunity to offer all or some of our existing products through them. Any inability to access and successfully sell our products to clients through third-party distribution channels could have a negative effect on our level of AUM and overall business and financial condition.

Effective May 2018, the EU’s GDPR strengthened data protection rules for individuals within the EU. GDPR also addresses export of personal data outside the EU. Compliance with the stringent rules under GDPR will require ongoing reviews of all of our global data processing systems, processes and procedures. A failure to comply with GDPR could result in fines up to 20 million Euros or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is higher. Domestically, state-level laws and regulations continue to evolve creating a patchwork of rules to be examined and followed. Most recently, California passed its California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which became effective on January 1, 2020. Other states may follow suit and promulgate their own privacy legislation.

After the conversion of Ameriprise National Trust Bank into a federal savings bank in May 2019, Ameriprise Financial became subject to ongoing supervision by the FRB, including supervision and prudential standards, requirements related to RBC, stress-testing, resolution planning, and certain risk management requirements. Further, as a financial holding company, our activities are limited to those that are financial in nature, incidental to a financial activity or, with FRB approval, complementary to a financial activity. In order to maintain Ameriprise’s status as a financial holding company, Ameriprise Bank, as Ameriprise’s sole insured depository institution subsidiary, is required to remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” under applicable regulations, and must have received at least a “satisfactory” rating in its most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”). In addition, Ameriprise needs to remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” in order to maintain its status as a financial holding company. As a financial holding company, we depend on dividends, distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries in order to meet our obligations, including our debt service obligations. Our subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to prevent or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Ameriprise. Our broker-dealers and bank subsidiary are limited in their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and are subject to minimum regulatory capital and other requirements, as well as limitations on their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or bank accounts to fund their businesses. These requirements may hinder our ability to access funds from our subsidiaries. We may also become subject to a prohibition or limitations on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our common stock. The federal banking regulators, including the OCC, the FRB and the FDIC, as well as the SEC (through FINRA) have the authority and under certain circumstances, the obligation, to limit or prohibit dividend payments and stock repurchases by the banking organizations they supervise, including Ameriprise and its bank subsidiaries.

Failure to meet one or more of these requirements would mean, depending on the requirements not met, that Ameriprise could not undertake new activities, continue certain activities, or make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies.

Compliance with bank holding company laws and regulations could impact the structure and availability of certain of our products and services and our costs in providing those products and services. Costs of compliance may be driven by how these laws and regulations and the scale of Ameriprise Bank evolves over the course of time.

Any mandated reductions or restructuring of the fees we charge for our products and services resulting from regulatory initiatives or proceedings could reduce our revenues and/or earnings. Fees paid by mutual funds in accordance with plans and agreements of distribution adopted under Rule 12b-1 promulgated under the Investment Company Act and by other sources of managed products are commonly found as a means for product manufacturers and distribution platforms to address the costs of these products and investor education. The SEC has in the past and could again propose measures that would establish a new framework to materially alter Rule 12b-1. Certain industry-wide reduction or restructuring of Rule 12b-1 fees, or other servicing fees, could impact our ability to distribute our own mutual funds and/or the fees we receive for distributing other companies’ mutual funds to our commission-based brokerage customers, which could, in turn, impact our revenues and/or earnings.

Our insurance companies are subject to state regulation and must comply with statutory reserve and capital requirements. State regulators, as well as the NAIC, continually review and update these requirements and other requirements relating to the business operations of insurance companies, including their underwriting and sales practices and their use of affiliated captive insurers. Changes in these requirements that are made for the benefit of the consumer sometimes lead to additional expense for the insurer and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In December 2012, the NAIC adopted a new reserve valuation manual that applies principles-based reserve standards to life insurance products. The valuation manual has been adopted by the required number of states and the percentage of U.S. insurance premium threshold has been reached, therefore, the valuation manual was effective for companies domiciled in adopted states on January 1, 2017. Minnesota adopted the valuation manual in 2016 and New York adopted the valuation manual in December 2018 to be effective January 2020. The RiverSource Life companies have developed an implementation plan and RiverSource Life reported principles-based reserves for a universal life product issued in 2019. The requirement for principles-based life insurance reserves may result in statutory reserves being more sensitive to changes in interest rates, policyholder behavior and other market factors. It is not possible at this time to estimate the potential impact of future changes in statutory reserve and capital requirements on our insurance businesses. Further, we cannot


predict the effect that proposed federal legislation may have on our businesses or competitors, such as the option of federally chartered insurers, a mandated federal systemic risk regulator, future initiatives of the FIO within the Department of the Treasury or by any of the Domiciliary Regulators, the NAIC or the International Association of Insurance Supervisors with respect to insurance holding company supervision, capital standards or systemic risk regulation. For additional discussion on the role and activities of the FIO, see the information provided under the heading “Regulation - Insurance Regulation” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed earlier, the FRB’s 2019 proposal for a new capital framework for ISLHCs, would create new capital requirements (even if there are any refinements to the proposal) which could potentially impact the way we structure our capital or manage our business.

Changes in the supervision and regulation of the financial industry, both domestically and internationally, could materially impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted into law in 2010 called for sweeping changes in the supervision and regulation of the financial services industry designed to provide for greater oversight of financial industry participants, reduce risk in banking practices and in securities and derivatives trading, enhance public company corporate governance practices and executive compensation disclosures, and provide greater protections to individual consumers and investors.

Accordingly, while certain elements of these reforms could be further changed under the Trump administration (such as through the May 2018 legislation that loosened aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act), the Dodd-Frank Act has impacted and is expected to further impact the manner in which we market our products and services, manage our company and its operations and interact with regulators, all of which could materially impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that may impact our business include but are not limited to the establishment of a fiduciary standard for broker-dealers, the resolution authority granted to the FDIC, changes in regulatory oversight and greater oversight over derivatives instruments and trading. After a conformance period, we will be required to comply with the Volcker Rule. The impact of this compliance, as well as recent changes to the Volcker rule, may be operationally difficult to implement and thus may negatively impact our business. Any changes to regulations or changes to the supervisory approach may also result in increased compliance costs to the extent we are required to modify our existing compliance policies, procedures and practices. We will need to respond to changes to the framework for the supervision of U.S. financial institutions, including the actions of the FSOC. To the extent the Dodd-Frank Act or other new regulation of the financial services industry impacts the operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements of unaffiliated financial institutions with whom we transact business, those institutions may seek to pass on increased costs, reduce their capacity to transact, or otherwise present inefficiencies in their interactions with us.

It is uncertain whether the Dodd-Frank Act, the rules and regulations developed thereunder, or any future legislation designed to stabilize the financial markets, the economy generally, or provide better protections to consumers, will have the intended effect. Any new domestic or international legislation or regulatory changes could require us to change certain business practices, impose additional costs, or otherwise adversely affect our business operations, regulatory reporting relationships, results of operations or financial condition. Consequences may include substantially higher compliance costs as well as material effects on fee rates, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, which could materially impact our investments, results of operations and liquidity in ways that we cannot predict. In addition, prolonged government support for, and intervention in the management of, private

institutions

could

distort

customary

and

expected

commercial

behavior

on

the

part of those institutions, adversely

impacting us.

In recent years, other national and international authorities have also proposed measures intended to increase the intensity of regulation of financial institutions, requiring greater coordination among regulators and efforts to harmonize regulatory regimes. These measures have included enhanced RBC requirements, leverage limits, liquidity and transparency requirements, single counterparty exposure limits, governance requirements for risk management, stress-test requirements, debt-to-equity limits for certain companies, early remediation procedures, resolution and recovery planning and guidance for maintaining appropriate risk culture. Our international operations and our worldwide consolidated operations are subject to the jurisdiction of certain of these non-U.S. authorities and may be materially adversely affected by their actions and decisions. Potential measures taken by foreign and international authorities also include the nationalization or expropriation of assets, the imposition of limits on foreign ownership of local companies, changes in laws (including tax laws and regulations) and in their application or interpretation, imposition of large fines, political instability, dividend limitations, price controls, changes in applicable currency, currency exchange controls, or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which they operate or converting local currencies we hold to U.S. dollars or other currencies. Any of these changes or actions may negatively affect our business. A further result of our non-U.S. operations is that we are subject to regulation by non-U.S. regulators and U.S. regulators such as the Department of Justice and the SEC with respect to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977. We expect the scope and extent of regulation outside the U.S., as well as general regulatory oversight, to continue to increase.

A portion of our advisor force are independent contractors. Legislative or regulatory action that redefines the criteria for determining whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor could materially impact our relationships with our advisors and our business, resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations.


Changes in corporate tax laws and regulations and changes in the interpretation of such laws and regulations, as well as adverse determinations regarding the application of such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our earnings and could make some of our products less attractive to clients.

We are subject to the income tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. These tax laws are complex and may be subject to different interpretations. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. In addition, changes to the Internal Revenue Code, administrative rulings or court decisions could increase our provision for income taxes and reduce our earnings.

Many of the products we issue or on which our businesses are based (including both insurance products and non-insurance products) receive favorable treatment under current U.S. federal income or estate tax law. Changes in U.S. federal income or estate tax law could reduce or eliminate the tax advantages of certain of our products and thus make such products less attractive to clients or cause a change in client demand and activity.

We may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims.

We rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. Although we use a broad range of measures to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. We may have to litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability, which represents a diversion of resources that may be significant in amount and may not prove successful. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce the protection of our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete.

We also may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges our operations or activities infringe upon or constitute misappropriation of such other party’s intellectual property rights. Third parties may have, or may eventually be issued, patents or other protections that could be infringed by our products, methods, processes or services or could otherwise limit our ability to offer certain product features. Any party that holds such a patent could make a claim of infringement against us. We may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright, trademark, license usage rights, or misappropriation of trade secret rights. Any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant liability for damages. If we were found to have infringed or misappropriated a third-party patent or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial liability, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or utilizing and benefiting from certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses, or alternatively could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Changes in and the adoption of accounting standards or inaccurate estimates or assumptions in applying accounting policies could have a material impact on our financial statements; changes in the regulation of independent registered public accounting firms are present with increasing frequency in connection with broader market reforms.

Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or liabilities and results of operations and are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. If those assumptions, estimates or judgments were incorrectly made, we could be required to correct and restate prior period financial statements.

We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and other regulators often change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements. In addition, the conduct of our independent registered public accounting firm is overseen by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”). These and other regulators may make additional inquiries regarding, or change their application of, existing laws and regulations regarding our independent auditor, financial statements or other financial reports and the possibility of such additional inquiries or changes is increasing in frequency in connection with broader market reforms. These changes are difficult to predict, and could impose additional governance, internal control and disclosure demands. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements. It is possible that the changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Relating to Our Common Stock

The market price of our shares may fluctuate.

The market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including: (i) changes in expectations concerning our future financial performance and the future performance of the financial services industry in general, including financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; (ii) differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts; (iii) our strategic moves and those of our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures or restructurings; (iv) changes in the regulatory framework of the financial services industry and regulatory action; (v) changes in and the adoption of accounting standards and securities and insurance rating agency


processes and standards applicable to our businesses and the financial services industry; and (vi) changes in general economic or market conditions.

Stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.

Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which could decrease the market value of our common stock.

Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making them unacceptably expensive to the raider and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others: (i) elimination of the right of our shareholders to act by written consent; (ii) rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings, either directly or through proxies; (iii) the right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval; and (iv) limitations on the rights of shareholders to remove directors.

Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.

We believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors time to assess any acquisition proposal. They are not intended to make our company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of our company and our shareholders.

The issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities may result in a dilution of interest or adversely affect the price of our common stock.

Our certificate of incorporation allows our directors to authorize the issuance of additional shares of our common stock, as well as other forms of equity or securities that may be converted into equity securities, without shareholder approval. We have in the past and may in the future issue additional equity or convertible securities in order to raise capital, in connection with acquisitions or for other purposes. Any such issuance may result in a significant dilution in the interests of our current shareholders and adversely impact the market price of our common stock.

Item 1B.  Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2.  Properties

We operate our business from two principal locations, both of which are located in Minneapolis, Minnesota: the Ameriprise Financial Center, an 848,000 square foot building that we lease, and our 871,000 square foot Client Service Center, that we own. Generally, we lease the premises we occupy in other locations, including the 38,000 square foot executive offices that we lease in New York City and branch offices for our employee advisors throughout the U.S.

Our principal leases are in the following locations:

•

Columbia Threadneedle Investments leases offices in Boston containing approximately 156,000 square feet, leases approximately 66,000 square feet of a shared building in London (as well as a second location in Swindon, UK),

approximately 39,000 square feet of a shared building in New York

and also leases property in a number of other cities to support its global operations; and

•

Las Vegas, Nevada (supporting aspects of our Advice & Wealth Management businesses) and Gurugram and Noida India (supporting our broader business in the U.S.).

We believe that the facilities owned or occupied by our company suit our needs and are well maintained.

Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the “Forward-Looking Statements,” our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes that follow and the “Consolidated Five-Year Summary of Selected Financial Data” and the “Risk Factors” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. References to “Ameriprise Financial,” “Ameriprise,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Ameriprise Financial, Inc. exclusively, to our entire family of companies, or to one or more of our subsidiaries.

Overview

Ameriprise is a diversified financial services company with a 125-year history of providing financial solutions. We are a long-standing leader in financial planning and advice with $973 billion in assets under management and administration as of

December 31, 2019

. We offer a broad range of products and services designed to achieve individual and institutional clients’ financial objectives. For additional discussion of our businesses, see Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The products and services we provide retail clients and, to a lesser extent, institutional clients, are the primary source of our revenues and net income. Revenues and net income are significantly affected by investment performance and the total value and composition of assets we manage and administer for our retail and institutional clients as well as the distribution fees we receive from other companies. These factors, in turn, are largely determined by overall investment market performance and the depth and breadth of our individual client relationships.

Financial markets and macroeconomic conditions have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our operating and performance results. In addition, the business, political and regulatory environments in which we operate are subject to elevated uncertainty and substantial, frequent change.

Accordingly, we expect to continue focusing on our key strategic objectives and obtaining operational and strategic leverage from our core capabilities.

The success of these and other strategies may be affected by the factors discussed in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K - “Risk Factors” - and other factors as discussed herein.

Equity price, credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the “spread” income generated on our fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, deposit products and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) and deferred sales inducement costs (“DSIC”) assets, the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.

Earnings, as well as adjusted operating earnings, will be negatively impacted by the ongoing low interest rate environment should it continue. In addition to continuing spread compression in our interest sensitive product lines, a sustained low interest rate environment may result in increases to our reserves and changes in various rate assumptions we use to amortize DAC and DSIC, which may negatively impact our adjusted operating earnings. For additional discussion on our interest rate risk, see Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”

In the third quarter, we update our market-related assumptions and implement model changes related to our living benefit valuation. In addition, we conduct our annual review of life insurance and annuity valuation assumptions relative to current experience and management expectations including modeling changes. These aforementioned changes are collectively referred to as unlocking. We also review our active life future policy benefit reserve adequacy for our long term care (“LTC”) business in the third quarter

.

See our Consolidated and Segment Results of Operations sections for the pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking and LTC loss recognition.

On

October 1

, 2019, we

completed the sale of our

Ameriprise Auto & Home Insurance business (“AAH”)

to

American Family Insurance Mutual Holding Company (American Family Insurance). See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the sale of AAH. This sale is consistent with our focus on our core growth areas of Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management.

In 2018, we made the strategic decision to expand the banking products and services we can provide directly to our clients, and commenced the process to convert Ameriprise National Trust Bank into a federal savings bank with the capabilities to offer FDIC insured deposits and a range of lending products. We completed that process, received regulatory approvals and converted Ameriprise National Trust Bank to a federal savings bank in May 2019.

We consolidate certain variable interest entities for which we provide asset management services. These entities are defined as consolidated investment entities (“CIEs”). While the consolidation of the CIEs impacts our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact to the underlying business results. For further information on CIEs, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The results of operations of the CIEs are reflected in the Corporate & Other segment. On a consolidated basis, the management fees we earn for the services we provide to the CIEs and the related general and administrative expenses are eliminated and the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities related to the CIEs, primarily syndicated loans and debt, are reflected in net investment income. We include the fees from these entities in the management and financial advice fees line within our Asset Management segment.

While our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), management believes that adjusted operating measures, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, net of the related DSIC and DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact on variable


annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization; the market impact on indexed universal life (“IUL”) benefits, net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact on fixed index annuity benefits, net of hedges and the related DAC amortization; mean reversion related impacts; the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments; gain or loss on disposal of a business that is not considered discontinued operations; integration and restructuring charges; income (loss) from discontinued operations; and the impact of consolidating CIEs, best reflect the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitate a more meaningful trend analysis. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our financial performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Also, certain of these non-GAAP measures are taken into consideration, to varying degrees, for purposes of business planning and analysis and for certain compensation-related matters. Throughout

our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, these non-GAAP measures are referred to as adjusted operating measures. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures. Effective first quarter of 2019, management has excluded mean reversion related impacts from our adjusted operating measures. Prior periods have been updated to reflect this change to be consistent with the current period presentation. The mean reversion related impact is defined as the impact on variable annuity and variable universal life (“VUL”) products for the difference between assumed and updated separate account investment performance on DAC, DSIC, unearned revenue amortization, reinsurance accrual and additional insurance benefit reserves. The updated separate account investment performance includes actual investment performance in the current period and the impact of changes in financial market conditions on the assumptions for future investment performance.

It is management’s priority to increase shareholder value over a multi-year horizon by achieving our on-average, over-time financial targets.

Our financial targets are:

•

Adjusted operating earnings per diluted share growth of 12% to 15%, and

•

Adjusted operating return on equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) of over 30%.

The following tables reconcile our GAAP measures to adjusted operating measures:

(1)

Pretax adjusted operating adjustments.

(2)

Calculated using the statutory tax rate of 21%.


The following table reconciles net income to adjusted operating earnings and the five-point average of quarter-end equity to adjusted operating equity:

(1)

Adjustments reflect the sum of after-tax net realized investment gains/losses, net of DSIC and DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges and related DSIC and DAC amortization; the market impact on IUL benefits, net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization, and the reinsurance accrual; the market impact on fixed index annuity benefits, net of hedges and the related DAC amortization; mean reversion related impacts; the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments; gain or loss on disposal of a business that is not considered discontinued operations; integration and restructuring charges; income (loss) from discontinued operations; and net income (loss) from consolidated investment entities. After-tax is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 21%.

(2)

Adjusted operating return on equity, excluding AOCI is calculated using adjusted operating earnings in the numerator and Ameriprise Financial

shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI and the impact of consolidating investment entities using a five-point average of quarter-end equity in the denominator. After-tax is calculated using the statutory rate of 21%.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The accounting and reporting policies that we use affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and, in some cases, the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting and reporting policies and estimates we have identified as fundamental to a full understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition are described below. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about our accounting policies.

Valuation of Investments

The most significant component of our investments is our Available-for-Sale securities, which we carry at fair value within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the fair value of our Available-for-Sale securities. Financial markets are subject to significant movements in valuation and liquidity, which can impact our ability to liquidate and the selling price that can be realized for our securities and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain investments.

Deferred Acquisition Costs

See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our DAC accounting policy.

Non-Traditional Long-Duration Products

For our non-traditional long-duration products (including variable and fixed deferred annuity contracts, universal life (“UL”) and VUL insurance products), our DAC balance at any reporting date is based on projections that show management expects there to be estimated gross profits (“EGPs”) after that date to amortize the remaining balance. These projections are inherently uncertain because they require management to make assumptions about financial markets, mortality levels and contractholder and policyholder behavior over periods extending well into the future. Projection periods used for our annuity products are typically 30 to 50 years and for our UL insurance products 50 years or longer.

EGPs vary based on persistency rates (assumptions at which contractholders and policyholders are expected to surrender, make withdrawals from and make deposits to their contracts), mortality levels, client asset value growth rates (based on equity and bond market performance), variable annuity benefit utilization and interest margins (the spread between earned rates on invested assets and rates credited to contractholder and policyholder accounts). Changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time. When assumptions are changed, the percentage of EGPs used to amortize DAC might also change. A change in the required amortization percentage is applied retrospectively; an increase in amortization percentage


will result in a decrease in the DAC balance and an increase in DAC amortization expense, while a decrease in amortization percentage will result in an increase in the DAC balance and a decrease in DAC amortization expense. The effect on the DAC balance that would result from the realization of unrealized gains (losses) on securities is recognized with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet.

The client asset value growth rates are the rates at which variable annuity and VUL insurance contract values invested in separate accounts are assumed to appreciate in the future. The rates used vary by equity and fixed income investments. The long-term client asset value growth rates are based on assumed gross annual returns of 9% for equity funds and 6.9% for fixed income funds. We typically use a five-year mean reversion process as a guideline in setting near-term equity fund growth rates based on a long-term view of financial market performance as well as recent actual performance. The suggested near-term equity fund growth rate is reviewed quarterly to ensure consistency with management’s assessment of anticipated equity market performance.

A decrease of 100 basis points in separate account fund growth rate assumptions is likely to result in an increase in DAC amortization and an increase in benefits and claims expense for variable annuity and VUL insurance contracts. The following table presents the estimated impact to current period pretax income:

(1)

An increase in the above assumptions by 100 basis points would result in an increase to pretax income for approximately the same amount.

An assessment of sensitivity associated with changes in any single assumption would not necessarily be an indicator of future results.

Traditional Long-Duration Products

For our traditional long-duration products (including traditional life and disability income (“DI”) insurance products), our DAC balance at any reporting date is based on projections that show management expects there to be adequate premiums after the date to amortize the remaining balance. These projections are inherently uncertain because they require management to make assumptions over periods extending well into the future. These assumptions include interest rates, persistency rates and mortality and morbidity rates and are not modified (unlocked) unless recoverability testing determines that reserves are inadequate. Projection periods used for our traditional life insurance are up to 30 years. Projection periods for our DI products are up to 45 years. We may experience accelerated amortization of DAC if policies terminate earlier than projected or a slower rate of amortization of DAC if policies persist longer than projected.

For traditional life and DI insurance products, the assumptions provide for adverse deviations in experience and are revised only if management concludes experience will be so adverse that DAC are not recoverable. If management concludes that DAC are not recoverable, DAC are reduced to the amount that is recoverable based on best estimate assumptions.

Future Policy Benefits and Claims

We

establish reserves to cover the risks associated with non-traditional and traditional long-duration products. Non-traditional long-duration products include variable annuity contracts, fixed annuity contracts and UL and VUL policies. Traditional long-duration products include term life, whole life, DI and LTC insurance products.

Guarantees

accounted for as insurance liabilities include GMDB, GGU, GMIB and the life contingent benefits associated with GMWB. In addition, UL and VUL policies with product features that result in profits followed by losses are accounted for as insurance liabilities.

Guarantees

accounted for as embedded derivatives include GMAB and the non-life contingent benefits associated with GMWB. In addition, the portion of indexed annuities and IUL policies allocated to the indexed account is accounted for as an embedded derivative.

The

establishment of reserves is an estimation process using a variety of methods, assumptions and data elements. If actual experience is better than or equal to the results of the estimation process, then reserves should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses. If actual experience is worse than the results of the estimation process, additional reserves may be required.

Non-Traditional Long-Duration Products, including Embedded Derivatives

UL and VUL

A

portion of our UL and VUL policies have product features that result in profits followed by losses from the insurance component of the contract. These profits followed by losses can be generated by the cost structure of the product or secondary guarantees in the contract. The secondary guarantee ensures that, subject to specified conditions, the policy will not terminate and will continue to


provide a death benefit even if there is insufficient policy value to cover the monthly deductions and charges. The liability for these future losses is determined using actuarial models to estimate the death benefits in excess of account value and the expected assessments (e.g. cost of insurance charges, contractual administrative charges, similar fees and investment margin). Significant assumptions made in projecting future benefits and assessments relate to client asset value growth rates, mortality, persistency and investment margins and are consistent with those used for DAC valuation for the same contracts. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the liability for contracts with secondary guarantees.

Variable Annuities

We

have approximately $80 billion of variable annuity account value that has been issued over a period of more than fifty years. The diversified variable annuity block consists of $29 billion of account value with no living benefit guarantees and $51 billion of account value with living benefit guarantees, primarily guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (“GMWB”) provisions. The business is predominately issued through the

Ameriprise Financial

®

advisor network. The majority of the variable annuity contracts offered by us contain GMDB provisions. We also offer variable annuities with death benefit provisions that gross up the amount payable by a certain percentage of contract earnings which are referred to as gain gross-up (“GGU”) benefits. In addition, we offer contracts with GMWB and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit (“GMAB”) provisions and, until May 2007, we offered contracts containing guaranteed minimum income benefit (“GMIB”) provisions. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our variable annuity contracts.

In

determining the liabilities for GMDB, GGU, GMIB and the life contingent benefits associated with GMWB, we project these benefits and contract assessments using actuarial models to simulate various equity market scenarios. Significant assumptions made in projecting future benefits and assessments relate to customer asset value growth rates, mortality, persistency, benefit utilization and investment margins and are consistent with those used for DAC valuation for the same contracts. As with DAC, management reviews, and where appropriate, adjusts its assumptions each quarter. Unless management identifies a material deviation over the course of quarterly monitoring, management reviews and updates these assumptions annually in the third quarter of each year.

Regarding

the exposure to variable annuity living benefit guarantees, the source of behavioral risk is driven by changes in policyholder surrenders and utilization of guaranteed withdrawal benefits. We have extensive experience studies and analysis to monitor changes and trends in policyholder behavior. A significant volume of company-specific policyholder experience data is available and provides management with the ability to regularly analyze policyholder behavior. On a monthly basis, actual surrender and benefit utilization experience is compared to expectations. Experience data includes detailed policy information providing the opportunity to review impacts of multiple variables. The ability to analyze differences in experience, such as presence of a living benefit rider, existence of surrender charges, and tax qualifications provide us an effective approach in quickly detecting changes in policyholder behavior.

At

least annually, we perform a thorough policyholder behavior analysis to validate the assumptions included in our benefit reserve, embedded derivative and DAC balances. The variable annuity assumptions and resulting reserve computations reflect multiple policyholder variables. Differentiation in assumptions by policyholder age, existence of surrender charges, guaranteed withdrawal utilization, and tax qualification are examples of factors recognized in establishing management’s assumptions used in reserve calculations. The extensive data derived from our variable annuity block informs management in confirming previous assumptions and revising the variable annuity behavior assumptions. Changes in assumptions are governed by a review and approval process to ensure an appropriate measurement of all impacted financial statement balances.

See the table in the previous discussion of “Deferred Acquisition Costs” for the estimated impact to benefits and claims expense related to variable annuity and VUL insurance contracts resulting from a decrease of 100 basis points in separate account fund growth rate assumptions.

Embedded Derivatives

The

fair value of embedded derivatives related to GMAB and the non-life contingent benefits associated with GMWB provisions fluctuate based on equity, interest rate and credit markets which can cause these embedded derivatives to be either an asset or a liability. The fair value of embedded derivatives related to indexed annuities and IUL fluctuate based on equity markets and interest rates and is a liability. In addition, embedded derivatives are impacted by an estimate of our nonperformance risk adjustment. This estimate includes a spread over the LIBOR swap curve as of the balance sheet date. As our estimate of this spread over LIBOR widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase.

Additionally

, our Corporate Actuarial Department calculates the fair value of the embedded derivatives on a monthly basis. During this process, control checks are performed to validate the completeness of the data. Actuarial management approves various components of the valuation along with the final results. The change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives is reviewed monthly with senior management.

See

Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the fair value measurement of embedded derivatives.

Traditional Long-Duration Products

Liabilities for unpaid amounts on reported DI and LTC claims include any periodic or other benefit amounts due and accrued, along with estimates of the present value of obligations for continuing benefit payments. These unpaid amounts are calculated using anticipated claim continuance rates based on established industry tables, adjusted as appropriate for our experience. The discount rates used to calculate present values are based on average interest rates earned on assets supporting the liability for unpaid amounts.


Liabilities for estimates of benefits that will become payable on future claims on term life, whole life and DI policies are based on the net level premium and LTC policies are based on a gross premium valuation reflecting management’s current best estimate assumptions. Net level premium includes anticipated premium payments, mortality and morbidity rates, policy persistency and interest rates earned on assets supporting the liability. Gross premium valuation includes expected premium rate increases, benefit reductions, morbidity rates, policy persistency and interest rates earned on assets supporting the liability. Anticipated mortality and morbidity rates are based on established industry mortality and morbidity tables, with modifications based on our experience. Anticipated premium payments and persistency rates vary by policy form, issue age, policy duration and certain other pricing factors.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

We use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to various market risks. All derivatives are recorded at fair value. The fair value of our derivative instruments is determined using either market quotes or valuation models that are based upon the net present value of estimated future cash flows and incorporate current market observable inputs to the extent available.

For further details on the types of derivatives we use and how we account for them, see Note 2, Note 15 and Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. For discussion of our market risk exposures and hedging program and related sensitivity testing, see Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

For information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our future consolidated results of operations and financial condition, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Sources of Revenues and Expenses

Management and Financial Advice Fees

Management and financial advice fees relate primarily to fees earned from managing mutual funds, private funds, separate account and wrap account assets and institutional investments, as well as fees earned from providing financial advice, administrative services (including transfer agent and administration fees earned from providing services to retail mutual funds) and other custodial services. Management and financial advice fees include performance-based incentive management fees, which we may receive on certain management contracts. Management and financial advice fees also include mortality and expense risk fees.

Distribution Fees

Distribution fees primarily include point-of-sale fees (such as mutual fund front-end sales loads) and asset-based fees (such as 12b-1 distribution and shareholder service fees). Distribution fees also include amounts received under marketing support arrangements for sales of mutual funds and other companies’ products, such as through our wrap accounts, as well as surrender charges on annuities and UL and VUL insurance.

Net Investment Income

Net investment income primarily includes interest income on fixed maturity securities classified as Available-for-Sale, mortgage loans, policy loans, margin loans, other investments, cash and cash equivalents and investments of consolidated investment entities (“CIEs”); the changes in fair value of trading securities, certain derivatives and certain assets and liabilities of CIEs; the pro rata share of net income or loss on equity method investments; and realized gains and losses on the sale of investments and charges for other-than-temporary impairments of investments related to credit losses.

Premiums

Premiums include premiums on auto and home insurance, traditional life, DI and LTC insurance and immediate annuities with a life contingent feature and are net of reinsurance premiums. We sold AAH on October 1, 2019.

Other Revenues

Other revenues primarily include variable annuity guaranteed benefit rider charges and UL and VUL insurance charges, which consist of cost of insurance charges (net of reinsurance premiums and cost of reinsurance for UL insurance products) and administrative charges.

For discussion of our accounting policies on revenue recognition, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Banking and Deposit Interest Expense

Banking and deposit interest expense primarily includes interest expense related to investment certificates and banking deposits. The changes in fair value of stock market certificate embedded derivatives and the derivatives hedging stock market certificates are included within banking and deposit interest expense.

Distribution Expenses

Distribution expenses primarily include compensation paid to our financial advisors, registered representatives, third-party distributors and wholesalers. The portion of these costs which are incremental and direct to the acquisition of a new or renewal insurance policy or annuity contract issued by the RiverSource Life companies are deferred. The amounts capitalized and amortized are based on actual distribution costs. The majority of these costs, such as advisor and wholesaler compensation, vary directly with the level of sales. Distribution expenses also include marketing support and other distribution and administration related payments made to affiliated and unaffiliated distributors of products provided by our affiliates. The majority of these expenses vary with the level of sales, or assets held, by these distributors, and the remainder is fixed. Distribution expenses also include wholesaling costs.


Interest Credited to Fixed Accounts

Interest credited to fixed accounts represents amounts earned by contractholders and policyholders on fixed account values associated with UL and VUL insurance and annuity contracts. The changes in fair value of indexed annuity and IUL embedded derivatives and the derivatives hedging these products are also included within interest credited to fixed accounts.

Benefits, Claims, Losses and Settlement Expenses

Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses consist of amounts paid and changes in liabilities held for anticipated future benefit payments under insurance policies and annuity contracts, along with costs to process and pay such amounts. Amounts are net of benefit payments recovered or expected to be recovered under reinsurance contracts. Benefits under variable annuity guarantees include the changes in fair value of GMWB and GMAB embedded derivatives and the derivatives hedging these benefits, as well as the changes in fair value of derivatives hedging GMDB provisions. Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses also include amortization of DSIC.

Amortization of DAC

Direct sales commissions and other costs capitalized as DAC are amortized over time. For annuity and UL/VUL contracts, DAC are amortized based on projections of EGPs over amortization periods equal to the approximate life of the business. For other insurance products, DAC are generally amortized as a percentage of premiums over amortization periods equal to the premium-paying period.

Interest and Debt Expense

Interest and debt expense primarily includes interest on corporate debt and CIE debt, the impact of interest rate hedging activities and amortization of debt issuance costs.

General and Administrative Expense

General and administrative expense includes compensation, share-based awards and other benefits for employees (other than employees directly related to distribution, such as financial advisors), professional and consultant fees, information technology, facilities and equipment, advertising and promotion, legal and regulatory and corporate related expenses.

Assets Under Management and Administration

Assets under management (“AUM”) include external client assets for which we provide investment management services, such as the assets of the Columbia Threadneedle Investments

funds, institutional clients and clients in our advisor platform held in wrap accounts as well as assets managed by sub-advisors selected by us. AUM also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we provide investment management services and recognize management fees in our Asset Management segment, such as the assets of the general account and the variable product funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries and CIEs. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide

advisory services such as

model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.

Assets under administration (“AUA”) include assets for which we provide administrative services such as client assets invested in other companies’ products that we offer outside of our wrap accounts. These assets include those held in clients’ brokerage accounts. We generally record revenues received from administered assets as distribution fees. We do not exercise management discretion over these assets and do not earn a management fee. These assets are not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. AUA also includes certain assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we do not provide investment management services and do not recognize management fees, such as investments in non-affiliated funds held in the separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries. These assets do not include assets under advisement, for which we provide

advisory services such as

model portfolios but do not have full discretionary investment authority.

The following table presents detail regarding our AUM and AUA:

Total AUM increased $123.9 billion, or 19%, to $778.1 billion as of

December 31, 2019

compared to $654.2 billion as of

December 31, 2018

due to a $65.3 billion increase in Advice & Wealth Management AUM driven by market appreciation and wrap account net inflows and a $63.5 billion increase in Asset Management AUM driven by market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows and retail fund distributions. See our segment results of operations discussion for additional information on changes in our AUM.


Consolidated Results of Operations

Year Ended

December 31, 2019

Compared to Year Ended

December 31, 2018

The following table presents our consolidated results of operations:

Overall

Pretax income decreased $252 million, or 10%, to $2.2 billion for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $2.5 billion for the prior year. The following impacts were significant drivers of the year-over-year change in pretax income:

•

The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) was an expense of $579 million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to an expense of $31 million for the prior year.

•

The market impact of hedges on investments was an expense of $35 million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to a benefit of $11 million for the prior year.

•

A $49 million unfavorable change in the mark-to-market impact on share-based compensation expenses.

•

Higher mark-to-market impact on advisor deferred compensation expense and investments in recruiting experienced advisors.

•

An increase in general and administrative expenses for our Advice & Wealth Management segment related to investments in business growth.

•

An increase in impairments of our investment in affordable housing partnerships, which was $35 million

for the

year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $7 million for the prior year.

•

The cumulative impact of asset management net outflows, partially offset by wrap account net inflows.

•

A gain of $213 million

recognized on the sale of AAH on October 1, 2019.

•

A positive impact from higher average equity markets and higher average short-term interest rates.

•

The mean reversion related impact was a benefit of $57 million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to an expense of $33 million for the prior year.

•

The unfavorable impact of unlocking and LTC loss recognition was $16 million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $53 million for the prior year.


The following table presents the total pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking and LTC loss recognition

for the years ended December 31:

(1)

Includes a $4 million and $5 million net benefit related to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which is excluded from adjusted operating earnings. Refer to Results of Operations by Segment for the impact to pretax adjusted operating earnings attributable to unlocking and LTC loss recognition.

The unfavorable unlocking impact in 2019 primarily reflected the impact from updates to our interest rate assumptions and lower surrenders on annuity contracts with a withdrawal benefit partially offset by a benefit from changes in equity market volatility and correlation assumptions on variable annuities. The unfavorable unlocking impact in the prior year primarily reflected unfavorable mortality experience on universal life (“UL”) and VUL insurance products and lower surrender rate assumptions on variable annuities partially offset by the impact from updates to assumptions on utilization of guaranteed withdrawal benefits.

The unfavorable LTC unlocking and loss recognition in 2019 was primarily due to the impact from updates to our interest rates assumptions and changes in morbidity experience partially offset by higher approved and expected premium rate increases and benefit reductions. The unfavorable LTC unlocking and loss recognition in the prior year was primarily due to changes in morbidity experience partially offset by approved, pending and future expected premium rate increases.

The unfavorable impact of updates to our interest rate assumptions noted above for unlocking and LTC loss recognition was $118 million. Based on the significant recent interest rate dislocation, we extended the grading period one year to reach our ultimate 10-year treasury rate of 5% by assuming rates remain flat for six months and then grade to our long-term rate over the next three years.

Net Revenues

Net

revenues increased $132 million, or 1%, to $13.0 billion for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $12.8 billion for the prior year.

Management and financial advice fees increased $239 million, or 4%, to $7.0 billion for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared

to

$6.8 billion for the prior year primarily due to higher average equity markets,

wrap account net inflows and

a $57 mi

llion increase in performance fees, partially offset by asset management net outflows and a

$27 million negative foreign currency translation impact

.

Distribution

fees increased $42 million, or 2%, to $1.9 billion for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to the prior year reflecting higher average equity markets and higher earnings on brokerage cash due to an increase in average short-term interest rates, partially offset by asset management net outflows.

Net investment income decreased $133 million, or 8%, to $1.5 billion for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $1.6 billion for the prior year primarily due to the following impacts:

•

A $46 million unfavorable change in the market impact of hedges on investments.

•

A $43 million decrease in net investment income of CIEs.

•

Net realized investment losses of $3 million for the

year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to net realized investment gains of $10 million for the prior year.

•

Impairments of our investment in affordable housing partnerships of $35 million

for the

year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $7 million for the prior year.

•

The unfavorable impact of fixed annuity net outflows and the fixed annuities reinsurance transaction.

•

The favorable impact of higher average invested assets related to the bank and certificates and higher average investment yields related to certificates.

Premiums decreased $212 million, or 15%, to $1.2 billion for the

year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $1.4 billion for the prior year primarily reflecting the sale of AAH. Premiums

for the year ended

December 31, 2019

included $827 million from Auto and Home for the nine months prior to sale on October 1, 2019 compared to $1.0 billion for the prior year.


Other

revenues increased $30 million, or 2%, to $1.3 billion for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $1.2 billion for the prior year primarily due to

accretion on our fixed annuities reinsurance deposit receivable,

an increase in variable annuity guaranteed benefit rider charges,

a $7 million gain on the sale of real estate in the third quarter of 2019 and a $7 million expense in the prior year related to a modification of costs within a reinsurance contract, partially offset by the impact of unlocking. Other revenues for 2019 included a $5 million favorable impact from unlocking compared to a $78 million favorable impact in the prior year. The unlocking impact for 2019 reflected updates to our interest rate assumptions. The primary driver of the unlocking impact for the prior year was higher projected gains on reinsurance contracts resulting from unfavorable mortality experience on UL and VUL insurance products.

Gain on disposal of business of $213 million for

the year ended

December 31, 2019

was recognized on the sale of AAH, net of an affinity partner payment of $100 million.

Banking and deposit interest expense increased

$47 million, or 53%, to $136

million for the

year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $


million for the prior year due to

interest expense on banking deposits,

higher average certificate balances and

higher average crediting rates on certificates

.

Expenses

Total expenses increased

$384 million, or 4%, to $10.7

billion for the

year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $10.4 billion for the prior year.

Distribution expenses increased

$173 million, or 5%, to $3.8

billion for the

year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $3.6 billion for the prior year reflecting higher advisor compensation due to wrap account net inflows, higher average markets, higher mark-to-market impact on advisor deferred compensation expense and investments in recruiting experienced advisors, partially offset by the impact of asset management net outflows.

Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased $274 million, or 12%, to $2.6

b

illion for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $

2.3

billion for the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:

•

A $425 million increase in expense from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. The unfavorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $175 million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to a favorable impact of $250 million for the prior year. As the estimate of the nonperformance credit spread over the LIBOR swap curve tightens or widens, the embedded derivative liability will increase or decrease. As the embedded derivative liability on which the nonperformance credit spread is applied increases (decreases), the impact of the nonperformance credit spread is favorable (unfavorable) to expense.

•

A $228

million increase in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related DSIC amortization. This increase was the result of a favorable $315

million

change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves, an unfavorable $549

million

change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits and a favorable $6 million change in the DSIC offset. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:

•

Equity market impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher expense for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to the prior year.

•

Interest rate impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher expense for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to the prior year.

•

Volatility impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher expense for the

year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to the prior year.

•

Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various contractholder behavioral items, were a net favorable impact compared to the prior year.

•

The impact of unlocking excluding LTC was a benefit of $1 million for the

year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to an expense of $112 million for the prior year. The unlocking impact for 2019 primarily reflected a benefit from changes in equity market volatility and correlation assumptions on variable annuities, partially offset by updates to our interest rate assumptions and lower surrenders on annuity contracts with a withdrawal benefit. The unlocking impact for the prior year primarily reflected unfavorable mortality experience on UL and VUL insurance products and lower

surrender rate assumptions on variable annuities, partially offset by a favorable impact from updates to assumptions on utilization of guaranteed withdrawal benefits.

•

Our annual review of LTC active life future policy benefit reserve adequacy in 2019 resulted in unlocking and loss recognition of $8 million compared to $52 million in the prior year.

The unlocking and loss recognition in 2019 was primarily due to the impact from updates to our interest rates assumptions and changes in

morbidity experience

, partially offset by higher approved and expected premium rate increases and benefit reductions.

The unlocking and loss recognition in the prior year was primarily due to changes in morbidity experience, partially offset by approved, pending and future

expected

premium rate increases.

•

A $204 million decrease in auto and home expenses primarily reflecting the sale of AAH.

•

The mean reversion related impact was a benefit of $26 million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to an expense of $12 million for the prior year.


Amortization of DAC decreased $143 million, or 44%, to $179 million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $322 million for the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:

•

The DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits was a benefit of $82 million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to an expense of $23 million for the prior year.

•

The mean reversion related impact was a benefit of $31 million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to an expense of $21 million for the prior year.

•

A $10 million decrease in auto and home expenses primarily reflecting the sale of AAH.

•

A favorable impact from normal year over year experience differences for variable annuities.

•

The impact of unlocking in 2019 was an expense of $14 million and reflected updates to our interest rate assumptions, partially offset by a favorable impact from lower surrenders on annuity contracts with a withdrawal benefit. The impact of unlocking in the prior year was a benefit of $33 million and primarily reflected updated mortality assumptions on UL and VUL insurance products and lower surrender rate assumptions on variable annuities, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from updates to assumptions on utilization of guaranteed withdrawal benefits.

Interest

and debt expense decreased $31 million, or 13%, to $214 million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $


million for the prior year primarily due to a decrease in interest expense of CIEs.

General and administrative expense increased $116 million, or 4%, to $3.3 billion for the

year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $3.2 billion for the prior year primarily due to a $49 million unfavorable change in the mark-to-market impact on share-based compensation expenses, a $28 million increase in compensation related to higher performance fees, bank-related expenses, investments in business growth and a $13 million increase in severance, partially offset by a $15 million positive foreign currency translation impact and a $25 million decrease

in auto and home expenses primarily reflecting the sale of AAH

.

Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate was 15.2% for the

year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to 15.5% for the prior year.

Net excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments was a benefit of $15 million for

the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $25 million for the prior year

. See Note 24 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on income taxes.


Results of Operations by Segment

Year Ended

December 31, 2019

Compared to Year Ended

December 31, 2018

Adjusted operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss management uses to evaluate segment performance. Adjusted operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP pretax income. We believe the presentation of segment adjusted operating earnings as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitating a more meaningful trend analysis. See Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the presentation of segment results and our definition of adjusted operating earnings.

The following table presents summary financial information by segment:

The following table presents the segment pretax adjusted operating impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking and LTC loss recognition for the years ended December 31:


Advice & Wealth Management

The following table presents the changes in wrap account assets and average balances for the years ended December 31:

(1)

Advisory wrap account assets represent those assets for which clients receive advisory services and are the primary driver of revenue earned on wrap accounts. Clients may hold non-advisory investments in their wrap accounts that do not incur an advisory fee. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, all advisory fee billing is calculated in advance on a monthly basis using point-in-time assets. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2019, some advisory accounts billed in arrears on a quarterly or monthly basis using average daily assets.

(2)

Average ending balances are calculated using an average of the prior period’s ending balance and all months in the current period.

Wrap account assets increased $66.0 billion, or 26%, during the year ended

December 31, 2019

due to net inflows of $17.6 billion and market appreciation and other of $48.4 billion. Average advisory wrap account assets increased $29.8 billion, or 12%, compared to the prior year reflecting net inflows and market appreciation.

The following table presents the results of operations of our Advice & Wealth Management segment on an adjusted operating basis:

Our Advice & Wealth Management segment pretax adjusted operating earnings, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, increased

$120 million, or 9%, to $1.5

billion for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $

1.4

billion for the prior year reflecting wrap account net inflows, average equity market appreciation and higher earnings on brokerage cash, partially offset by higher expenses from continued investments for growth and higher mark-to-market impact on advisor deferred compensation expenses. Pretax adjusted operating margin was 22.9% for the year ended

Distribution

fees increased

$40 million, or 2%, to $2.3

billion for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $

2.2

billion for the prior year reflecting

higher earnings on brokerage cash due to an increase in average short-term interest rates, partially offset by de

creased transactional activity and lower

sales of variable annuities

. We earned 198 basis points on brokerage cash balances for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to 164 basis points for the prior year.

Net

investment income increased

$95 million, or 30%, to $411

Asset Management

The following tables present the mutual fund performance of our retail

C

olumbia Threadneedle Investments

funds as of December 31:


Mutual fund performance rankings are based on the performance of the Institutional Class for Columbia branded mutual funds. Only funds with Institutional Class shares are included.

Equal Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles: Counts the number of funds with above median ranking divided by the total number of funds. Asset size is not a factor.

Asset Weighted Rankings in Top 2 Quartiles: Sums the total assets of the funds with above median ranking divided by total assets of all funds. Funds with more assets will receive a greater share of the total percentage above or below median.

The performance of each fund is measured on a consistent basis against the most appropriate benchmark — a peer group of similar funds or an index. Prior period rankings have been adjusted to reflect foreign exchange forward and spot contract transactions executed by those funds, and also to include cash items primarily fee rebates, that were previously excluded from the gross performance calculations.

Equal weighted: Counts the number of funds with above median ranking (if measured against peer group) or above index performance (if measured against an index) divided by the total number of funds. Asset size is not a factor.

Asset weighted: Sums the assets of the funds with above median ranking (if measured against peer group) or above index performance (if measured against an index) divided by the total sum of assets in the funds. Funds with more assets will receive a greater share of the total percentage above or below median or index.

Aggregated Allocation (Managed) Funds include funds that invest in other funds of the Threadneedle range including those funds that invest in both equity and fixed income.

Aggregated Threadneedle data includes funds on the Threadneedle platform sub-advised by Columbia Management as well as advisors not affiliated with Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

The full impact of the British exit from the EU


(commonly known as “Brexit”) and its related consequences remain uncertain

, including with respect to ongoing negotiations between the UK and EU and new trade agreements with global trading partners

. This uncertainty may have a negative impact on our UK and European net flows (as well as foreign currency translation if the British Pound weakens).

Total segment AUM increased $63.5 billion, or 15%, during the year ended

December 31, 2019

driven by market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows and retail fund distributions.

Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”)

retail net outflows were $3.1 billion for the year ended

December 31, 2019

reflecting negative consumer sentiment associated with Brexit and geopolitical concerns in Europe. North America retail net inflows, which include reinvested dividends, were $3.2 billion for the year ended

December 31, 2019

, a $5.8 billion improvement compared to the prior year.

Global institutional net outflows of $7.2 billion included $3.4 billion of outflows from former parent-related assets.

The following table presents the results of operations of our Asset Management segment on an adjusted operating basis:

Our

Asset Management segment pretax adjusted operating earnings, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, decreased

$67 million, or 9%, to $661

million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $


million for the prior year primarily due to the cumulative impact of net outflows and a vendor credit of $14 million in the prior year, partially offset by higher average markets and a $29 million increase in net performance fees.

Net Revenues

Net

revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, decreased

$98 million, or 3%, to $2.9

billion for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $

3.0

billion for the prior year.

Management

and financial advice fees decreased

$52 million, or 2%, to $2.5

billion for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to the prior year driven by cumulative net outflows

and a $27 million negative foreign currency translation impact, partially offset by a $57

million increase in performance fees and higher average markets. Our average weighted equity index, which is a proxy for equity movements on AUM, increased 4% for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to the prior year.

Distribution

fees decreased

$25 million, or 6%, to $408

million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $

Other revenues decreased $17 million, or 89%, to $2 million for the

year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $19 million for the prior year due to a $14 million vendor credit in the prior year related to the completion of our front, middle and back-office integration.

Expenses

Total

expenses decreased $31 million, or 1%, to $2.3 billion for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to the prior year.

Distribution

expenses decreased

$33 million, or 3%, to $928 m

illion for the year ended

Annuities

The following table presents the results of operations of our Annuities segment on an adjusted operating basis:

Our Annuities segment pretax adjusted operating income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses (net of the related DSIC and DAC amortization), the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), the market impact on fixed index annuity benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization) and mean reversion related impacts, was essentially flat at $497 million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $496 million for the prior year.

RiverSource

®

variable annuity account balances increased 11% to $80.1 billion as of

December 31, 2019

compared to the prior year due to equity market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows of $3.2 billion. Variable annuity sales decreased 8% compared to the prior year.

RiverSource

®

fixed deferred annuity account balances declined 5% to $8.3 billion as of

December 31, 2019

compared to the prior year as older policies continue to lapse and new sales are limited due to low interest rates. Given the current interest rate environment, our current fixed deferred annuity book is expected to gradually run off and earnings on our fixed deferred annuity business will trend down. We reinsured approximately 20% of our fixed annuities block during the first quarter of 2019. The reinsurance transaction generated $200 million of excess capital and has a marginal impact on fixed annuity adjusted pretax operating earnings.

Net Revenues

Net revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, decreased

$17 million, or 1%, to $2.5

billion for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to the prior year.

Net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, decreased

$90 million, or 14%, to $554

million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $644 million for the prior year due to a $47 million unfavorable impact related to the fixed annuities reinsurance transaction, approximately $30 million from lower average invested assets due to fixed annuity net outflows and approximately $13 million from lower earned interest rates.

Other revenues increased

$76 million, or 13%, to $661

million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $585 million for the prior year primarily due to accretion on our fixed annuities reinsurance deposit receivable and higher fees from variable annuity guarantee sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date and higher average fee rates.

Expenses

Total expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), the market impact on fixed index annuity benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization), mean reversion related impacts and the DAC and DSIC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, decreased

$18 million, or 1%, to $2.0

billion for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to the prior year.


Interest

credited to fixed accounts decreased

$16 million, or 3%, to $445

million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $461 million for the prior year due to lower average fixed deferred annuity account balances.

Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses, which exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC amortization), mean reversion related impacts and the DSIC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, were essentially flat at $664 million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $665 million for the prior year primarily reflecting

the impact of unlocking, partially offset by higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher variable annuity guaranteed benefit rider charges.

Amortization of DAC

, which excludes mean reversion related impacts, the DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits and fixed index annuity benefits and the DAC offset to net realized investment gains or losses,

increased $9 million, or 5%, to $190 million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $181 million for the prior year primarily due to the impact of unlocking, partially offset by a

favorable impact from

normal year over year experience differences for variable annuities.

Protection

The following table presents the results of operations of our Protection segment on an adjusted operating basis:

Our Protection segment pretax adjusted operating earnings, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses (net of the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual), the market impact on IUL benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual) and mean reversion related impacts, increased

$6 million, or 2%, to $261

million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $255 million for the prior year

.

Net Revenues

Net revenues, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses (net of unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual) and the unearned revenue amortization and reinsurance accrual offset to the market impact on IUL benefits, decreased

$49 million, or 4%, to $1.0

billion for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $1.1 billion for the prior year.

Net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, increased $19 million, or 7%, to $308 million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $289 million for the prior year reflecting higher average invested assets.

Other revenues, which exclude the unearned revenue amortization and reinsurance accrual offset to net realized investment gains or losses and the market impact on IUL benefits, decreased

$63 million, or 14%, to $400

million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $463 million for the prior year due to the impact of unlocking, partially offset by a $7 million expense in the prior year related to a modification of costs within a reinsurance contract.


Expenses

Total expenses, which exclude the market impact on IUL benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization), mean reversion related impacts and the DAC offset to net realized investment gains or losses, decreased

$55 million, or 7%, to $786 m

illion for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $841 million for the prior year.

Interest credited to fixed accounts increased

$12 million, or 6%, to $212

million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $200 million for the prior year primarily driven by higher fixed account values associated with UL and VUL insurance.

Benefits

, claims, losses and settlement expenses decreased

$77 million, or 19%, to $327 m

illion for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $404 million for the prior year primarily due to the impact of unlocking.

The unlocking impact for 2019 was an expense of $16 million and primarily reflected updates to our interest rate assumptions. The unlocking impact for the prior year was an expense of $101 million and primarily reflected unfavorable mortality experience on UL and VUL insurance products.

Amortization of DAC increased $18 million, or 51%, to $53 million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $35 million for the prior year primarily reflecting the impact of unlocking. The impact of unlocking for 2019 was an expense of $2 million compared to a benefit of $18 million for the prior year.

Corporate & Other

The following table presents the results of operations of our Corporate & Other segment on an adjusted operating basis:

Our Corporate & Other segment pretax adjusted operating loss excludes net realized investment gains or losses, the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments, gain or loss on disposal of a business that is not considered discontinued operations, integration and restructuring charges, and the impact of consolidating CIEs. Our Corporate & Other segment pretax adjusted operating loss increased

$16 million, or 5%, to $320

million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $304 million for the prior year.

Auto and Home pretax adjusted operating earnings were $13 million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to a pretax adjusted operating loss of $10 million for the prior year. We sold AAH on October 1, 2019.

Our LTC insurance pretax adjusted operating earnings were nil for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to a pretax adjusted operating loss of $61 million for the prior year. Our annual review of LTC active life future policy benefit reserve adequacy resulted in unlocking and loss recognition of $8 million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $52 million in the prior year

.

As of December 31, 2019, our nursing home indemnity LTC block had approximately $83 million in gross in force annual premium and future policyholder benefits and claim reserves of approximately $1.3 billion, net of reinsurance, which was 55% of GAAP reserves. This block has been shrinking over the last few years given the average attained age is 82 and the average attained age of


policyholders on claim is 88. Fifty-five percent of daily benefits in force in this block come from policies that have a lifetime benefit period.

As of December 31, 2019, our comprehensive reimbursement LTC block had approximately $115 million in gross in force annual premium and future policyholder benefits and claim reserves of approximately $1.1 billion, net of reinsurance. This block has higher premiums per policy than the nursing home indemnity LTC policies. The average attained age is 76 and the average attained age of policyholders on claim is 84. Thirty-seven percent of daily benefits in force in this block come from policies that have a lifetime benefit period.

We utilize three primary levers to manage our LTC business. First, we have taken an active approach of steadily increasing rates since 2005, with cumulative rate increases of 162% on our nursing home indemnity LTC block and 93% on our comprehensive reimbursement LTC block as of December 31, 2019. Second, we have a reserving process that reflects the policy features and risk characteristics of our blocks. As of December 31, 2018, we had 30,000 policies that were closed with claim activity, as well as 8,000 open claims. We apply this experience to our in force policies, which were 103,000 as of December 31, 2019, at a very granular level by issue year, attained age and benefit features. Our statutory reserves are $415 million higher than our GAAP reserves and include margins for key assumptions like morbidity and mortality, as well as $233 million in asset adequacy reserves as of December 31, 2019. Lastly, we have prudently managed our investment portfolio primarily through a liquid, investment grade portfolio that is currently in a net unrealized gain position.

We undertake an extensive review of active life future policy benefit reserve adequacy annually during the third quarter of each year, or more frequently if appropriate, using current best estimate assumptions as of the date of the review. Our annual review process includes an analysis of our key reserve assumptions, including, at this time, those for morbidity, terminations (mortality and lapses), premium rate increases and investment yields. Because we have a rigorous annual review of all key reserve assumptions, we believe we are materially less exposed to large one-time reserve adjustments.

Net Revenues

Net revenues, which exclude

net realized investment gains or losses, the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments, gain on disposal of business that is not considered discontinued operations, integration and restructuring charges and revenues attributable to CIEs,

decreased $242 million, or 18%, to $1.1 billion for the year ended

December 31, 2019

December 31, 2019

included $881 million from Auto and Home compared to $1.1 billion for the prior year reflecting the sale of AAH.

Net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses and the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments, decreased

$32 million, or 18%, to $145

million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $177 million for the prior year primarily due to impairments of our investment in affordable housing partnerships. Impairments of our investment in affordable housing partnerships were $35 million

for the

year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $7 million for the prior year.

Premiums decreased $217 million, or 19%, to $931 million for the

year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $1.1 billion for the prior year primarily due to the sale of AAH.

Other revenues increased $11 million to $17 million for the

year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $6 million for the prior year primarily due to a $7 million gain on the sale of real estate in the third quarter of 2019.

Expenses

Total expenses, which exclude integration and restructuring charges and expenses attributable to CIEs, decreased

$226 million, or 14%, to $1.4

billion for the

year ended

for the year ended

December 31, 2019

included $868 million from Auto and Home compared to $1.1 billion for the prior year reflecting the sale of AAH.

Distribution expenses decreased

$11 million to a benefit of $1 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to an expense of $10 million for the prior year reflecting the sale of AAH.

Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses decreased $264 million, or 22%, to $962 million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $1.2 billion for the prior year reflecting a decrease in LTC unlocking and loss recognition and the sale of AAH

.

Amortization of DAC decreased $10 million, or 19%, to $42 million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $52 million for the prior year reflecting the sale of AAH.

Interest and debt expense increased $18 million, or 49%, to $55 million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $37 million for the prior year primarily due to interest expense on

asset backed securities issued by one of our subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2018

. This interest expense is eliminated on a consolidated basis.

General and administrative expense increased $41 million, or 13%, to $356

million for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $315 million for the prior year primarily due to a $33 million unfavorable change in the mark-to-market impact on share-based compensation expenses, investments in growth initiatives and a $13 million increase in severance, partially offset by a $25 million decrease

in auto and home expenses primarily reflecting the sale of AAH

.


Consolidated Results of Operations

Year Ended

December 31, 2018

Compared to Year Ended

December 31, 2017

The following table presents our consolidated results of operations:

Overall

Pretax income increased $270 million, or 12%, to $2.5 billion for the

year ended December 31, 2018

compared to $2.2 billion for the prior year primarily reflecting average equity market appreciation, wrap account net inflows, a positive impact from higher short-term interest rates and a decrease in the unfavorable market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), partially offset by the impact of unlocking, the cumulative impact of asset management net outflows

and the impact on DAC, DSIC and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance

. The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization) was an expense of $31 million for the

year ended December 31, 2018

compared to an expense of $232 million for the prior year.

The impact on DAC, DSIC and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance was an expense of $33 million ($21 million for DAC, $5 million for DSIC and $7 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflecting unfavorable market returns compared to a benefit of $83 million ($36 million for DAC, $8 million for DSIC and $39 million for insurance features in non-traditional long duration contracts) for the prior year reflecting favorable market returns.


The following table presents the total pretax impacts on our revenues and expenses attributable to unlocking and LTC loss recognition

for the years ended December 31:

(1)

Includes a $5 million net benefit related to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits for both the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, which is excluded from adjusted operating earnings. Refer to Results of Operations by Segment for the impact to pretax adjusted operating earnings attributable to unlocking and LTC loss recognition.

The following table presents the impact from the enactment of the legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) for the year ended December 31, 2017:

(1)

Includes the impairment of our investment in affordable housing partnerships due to the Tax Act’s change in statutory tax rate to 21%.

Net Revenues

Net revenues increased $703 million, or 6%, to $12.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $12.1 billion for the prior year.

Management and financial advice fees increased $361 million, or 6%, to $6.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $6.4 billion for the prior year primarily due to an increase in AUM. Average AUM increased $35.4 billion, or 5%, compared to the prior year primarily due to average equity market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows. See our discussion on the changes in AUM in our segment results of operations section.

Distribution fees increased $120 million, or 7%, to $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $1.8 billion for the prior year reflecting average equity market appreciation and higher earnings on brokerage cash due to an increase in short-term interest rates, partially offset by a $30 million decrease related to our transition to share classes without 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts, which we completed during the first quarter of 2017.

Net investment income increased $87 million, or 6%, to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $1.5 billion for the prior year primarily due to a $51 million impairment of our investment in affordable housing partnerships in 2017 due to the enactment of the Tax Act, a $31 million increase in net investment income of CIEs, a $13 million favorable change in the market impact of hedges on investments and an increase in interest earned on brokerage margin loans and cash balances due to higher short-term interest rates, partially offset by a $36 million decrease in net realized investment gains.


Other revenues increased $144 million, or 13%, to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $1.1 billion for the prior year primarily due to the impact of unlocking and an increase in variable annuity guaranteed benefit rider charges, partially offset by a $7 million expense related to a modification of costs within a reinsurance contract.

Banking and deposit interest expense increased $41 million, or 85%, to $89 million for the

year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $48 million for the prior year due to higher average crediting rates on certificates, as well as higher average certificate balances.

Expenses

Total expenses increased $433 million, or 4%, to $10.4 billion for the

year ended December 31, 2018

compared to $9.9 billion for the prior year.

Distribution expenses increased $240 million, or 7%, to $3.6 billion for the

year ended December 31, 2018

compared to $3.4 billion for the prior year reflecting higher advisor compensation due to average equity market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, partially offset by asset management net outflows and a $16 million decrease from changes related to our transition to share classes without 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts.

Benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses increased

$69 million, or 3%, to $2.3 b

illion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $2.2 billion for the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:

•

The impact of unlocking was an expense of $113 million for the

year ended December 31, 2018

compared to a benefit of $139 million for the prior year. The unlocking impact for the

year ended December 31, 2018

primarily reflected unfavorable mortality experience on UL and VUL insurance products and lower

surrender rate assumptions on variable annuities, partially offset by a favorable impact from updates to assumptions on utilization of guaranteed withdrawal benefits.

The unlocking impact for the prior year primarily reflected a benefit from updates to market-related inputs to our living benefit valuation.

•

O

ur annual review of LTC active life future policy benefit reserve adequacy in the third quarter resulted in loss recognition of $51 million

for the

year ended December 31, 2018

compared to

$57 million in the prior year. The loss recognition in both periods was primarily due to unfavorable morbidity experience, partially offset by approved, pending and future

expected

premium increases.

•

A $25 million increase in expense related to higher reserve funding driven by the impact of higher variable annuity guaranteed benefit rider charges.

•

The

impact on DSIC and reserves for insurance features in non-traditional long-duration contracts from actual versus expected market performance was an expense of $12 million for the

year ended December 31, 2018

compared to a benefit of $47 million for the prior year.

•

A $356 million decrease in expense from the unhedged nonperformance credit spread risk adjustment on variable annuity guaranteed benefits. The favorable impact of the nonperformance credit spread was $250 million for the

year ended December 31, 2018

compared to an unfavorable impact of $106 million for the prior year. As the estimate of the nonperformance credit spread over the LIBOR swap curve tightens or widens, the embedded derivative liability will increase or decrease. As the embedded derivative liability on which the nonperformance credit spread is applied increases (decreases), the impact of the nonperformance credit spread is favorable (unfavorable) to expense.

•

A $106

million increase in expense from other market impacts on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, net of hedges in place to offset those risks and the related DSIC amortization. This increase was the result of an unfavorable $1.2

billion

change in the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed living benefits reserves, a favorable $1.1

billion

change in the market impact on derivatives hedging the variable annuity guaranteed benefits and an unfavorable $4 million change in the DSIC offset. The main market drivers contributing to these changes are summarized below:

•

Equity market impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a higher expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year.

•

Interest rate impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a lower expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year.

•

Volatility impact on the variable annuity guaranteed living benefits liability net of the impact on the corresponding hedge assets resulted in a lower expense for the

year ended December 31, 2018

compared to the prior year.

•

Other unhedged items, including the difference between the assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and various contractholder behavioral items, were a net unfavorable impact compared to the prior year.

Amortization of DAC increased $55 million, or 21%, to $322 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $267 million for the prior year primarily reflecting the following items:

•

The impact on DAC from actual versus expected market performance was an expense of $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a benefit of $36 million for the prior year.

•

The DAC offset to the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits was an expense of $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a benefit of $26 million for the prior year.


•

The impact of unlocking was a benefit of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and primarily reflected updated mortality assumptions on UL and VUL insurance products and lower surrender rate assumptions on variable annuities, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from updates to assumptions on utilization of guaranteed withdrawal benefits. The impact of unlocking for the prior year was a benefit of $12 million and primarily reflected improved persistency and mortality on UL and VUL insurance products and a $10 million benefit from a correction related to a variable annuity model assumption, partially offset by updates to market-related inputs to the living benefit valuation.

•

The positive impact on DAC from lower than expected lapses on variable annuities was $10 million.

Interest and debt expense increased $38 million, or 18%, to $245 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $207 million for the prior year primarily due to an increase in interest expense of CIEs.

Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate was 15.5% for the

year ended December 31, 2018

compared to 33.1% for the prior year. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year is primarily the result of the decrease in the federal statutory tax rate and a $286 million expense in 2017 due to provisions in the Tax Act, partially offset by lower levels of the dividends received deduction

and a decrease in the benefit for net excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments, which was $25 million for

the year ended December 31, 2018

compared to $70 million for the prior year

and LTC loss recognition

for the years ended December 31:

Advice & Wealth Management

The following table presents the changes in wrap account assets and average balances for the years ended December 31:

(1)

Inflows associated with acquisition that closed during the period.

(2)

Advisory wrap account assets represent those assets for which clients receive advisory services and are the primary driver of revenue earned on wrap accounts. Clients may hold non-advisory investments in their wrap accounts that do not incur an advisory fee.

(3)

Average ending balances are calculated using an average of the prior period’s ending balance and all months in the current period.

Wrap account assets increased $3.3 billion, or 1%, during the year ended December 31, 2018 due to net inflows of $21.1 billion, partially offset by market depreciation and other of $17.8 billion. Average advisory wrap account assets increased $33.4 billion, or 15%, compared to the prior year reflecting net inflows and market appreciation.

In July 2017, we completed our acquisition of Investment Professionals, Inc. (“IPI”), an independent broker-dealer based in San Antonio, Texas specializing in the on-site delivery of investment programs for financial institutions, including banks and credit unions. The acquisition added 215 financial advisors and $8 billion in client assets (including $0.7 billion in assets under management and $7.3 billion in assets under administration).

$226 million, or 19%, to $1.4

billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $1.2 billion for the prior year reflecting wrap account net inflows, average equity market appreciation and higher earnings on brokerage cash, partially offset by higher general and administrative expense. Pretax adjusted operating margin was 22.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 20.7% for the prior year.

$573 million, or 10%, to $6.2

billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $5.6 billion for the prior year. Adjusted operating net revenue per advisor increased to $624,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, up 9%, from $575,000 for the prior year.

Management and financial fees increased

$385 million, or 12%, to $3.5

billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $3.2 billion for the prior year primarily due to growth in wrap account assets. Average advisory wrap account assets increased $33.4 billion, or 15%, compared to the prior year reflecting net inflows and average equity market appreciation.

Distribution fees increased

$146 million, or 7%, to $2.2

billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $2.1 billion for the prior year reflecting higher earnings on brokerage cash due to an increase in short-term interest rates and the IPI acquisition, partially offset by a $30 million decrease related to our transition to share classes without 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts in the first quarter of 2017.

Net investment income increased

$77 million, or 32%, to $316

million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $239 million for the prior year primarily due to higher investment yields on assets related to certificates and higher invested balances due to certificate net inflows, as well as an increase in interest earned on brokerage margin loans and cash balances due to higher short-term interest rates.

Banking and deposit interest expense increased $41 million, or 85%, to $89 million for the year ended December 31, 2018

compared to $48 million for the prior year due to higher client crediting rates on certificates,

as well as higher average certificate balances

.

$347 million, or 8%, to $4.8

billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $4.5 billion for the prior year.

Distribution expenses increased

$276 million, or 9%, to $3.5

billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $3.2 billion for the prior year reflecting higher advisor compensation due to average equity market appreciation and wrap account net inflows, as well as the IPI acquisition, partially offset by a $16 million decrease from changes related to our transition to share classes without 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts in the first quarter of 2017.

General

and administrative expense increased

$70 million, or 6%, to $1.3

billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $1.2 billion for the prior year primarily due to an increase in staffing costs, allocated overhead expenses, technology-related expenses, marketing expenses, vendor-related expenses linked to revenue growth and the IPI acquisition.


Asset Management

The following table presents managed assets by type:

(1)

Average ending balances are calculated using an average of the prior period’s ending balance and all months in the current period.

The following tables present the changes in global managed assets:

(1)

Amounts represent local currency to US dollar translation for reporting purposes.

(2)

Inflows associated with acquisitions that closed during the period.

(3)

Includes $0.6 billion and $0.5 billion for the total change in Affiliated General Account Assets during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

(4)

Former parent company related assets and net new flows are included in the rollforwards above.


Total segment AUM decreased $63.9 billion, or 13%, during the year ended December 31, 2018 driven by net outflows of $21.2 billion, retail fund distributions of $13.8 billion, market depreciation and a negative impact of foreign currency translation. Total segment AUM net outflows included $8.0 billion of outflows of former parent-related assets.

Global retail net outflows of $5.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 included $17.2 billion of net new outflows, partially offset by $11.6 billion of reinvested dividends. In U.S. retail, net new outflows of $14.1 billion reflected elevated outflows in the fourth quarter from market dislocation, industry pressures on active strategies and outflows from former parent-related assets, partially offset by $11.5 billion of reinvested dividends. In EMEA retail, net outflows of $3.0 billion reflected elevated outflows in the fourth quarter consistent with the industry reflecting weakened market sentiment across all regions related to market volatility and concerns over Brexit, the economy and interest rates.

Global institutional net outflows of $15.6 billion included $5.2 billion of outflows from former parent-related assets and $2.5 billion of CLO redemptions. Third party institutional outflows were elevated and reflect lower sales and higher redemptions of equity and fixed income mandates.

In November 2017, we completed our acquisition of Lionstone Partners, LLC (“Lionstone Investments”), a leading national real estate investment firm, specializing in investment strategies based upon proprietary analytics. This acquisition added $5.4 billion in assets under management.

The following table presents the results of operations of our Asset Management segment on an operating basis:

Our Asset Management segment pretax adjusted operating earnings, which exclude net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $12 million, or 2%, to $728 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $740 million for the prior year primarily due to the cumulative impact of net outflows, a $31 million decrease related to CLO unwinds and $12 million of costs associated with the implementation of our Brexit strategy, partially offset by average equity market appreciation, lower performance-based compensation and continued expense management.

and financial advice fees decreased

$29 million, or 1%, to $2.5

billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $2.6 billion for the prior year driven by cumulative net outflows, a $32 million decrease in incentive fees from CLO unwinds and a $17 million decrease in performance fees, partially offset by average equity market appreciation, a $13 million positive foreign currency translation impact and a $24 million increase from the Lionstone Investments acquisition. Our average weighted equity index, which is a proxy for equity movements on AUM, increased 10% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year.

Distribution

fees decreased

$25 million, or 5%, to $433

million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $458 million for the prior year due to cumulative net outflows and an $11 million decrease related to the transition of advisory accounts to share classes without 12b-1 fees in the first quarter of 2017, partially offset by average equity market appreciation.

General

and administrative expense decreased

$12 million, or 1%, to $1.3

billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to lower performance-based compensation, lower compensation related to CLO unwinds, a $14 million decrease in compensation related to lower performance fees and disciplined expense management, partially offset by $12 million of Brexit-related costs, an $8 million negative foreign currency translation impact and a $25 million increase related to the Lionstone Investments acquisition.

Annuities

The following table presents the results of operations of our Annuities segment on an operating basis:

Our Annuities segment pretax adjusted operating income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses (net of the related DSIC and DAC amortization), the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), the market impact on fixed index annuity benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization) and mean reversion related impacts, decreased $133 million, or 21%, to $496 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $629 million for the prior year primarily due to the impact of unlocking, lower investment yields and variable annuity net outflows, partially offset by average equity market appreciation. The impact of unlocking was an expense of $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to a benefit of $120 million for the prior year.

RiverSource

variable annuity account balances declined 10% to $72.0 billion as of December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year due to equity market depreciation and net outflows of $3.3 billion.

RiverSource

fixed deferred annuity account balances declined 7% to $8.7 billion as of December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year as older policies continue to lapse and new sales are limited due to low interest rates.

Net investment income, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses, decreased $53 million, or 8%, to $644 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $697 million for the prior year primarily due to a decrease of approximately $32 million from lower invested assets due to fixed annuity net outflows and approximately $23 million from lower earned interest rates.


Other revenues increased $35 million, or 6%, to $585 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $550 million for the prior year due to an increase in variable annuity guaranteed benefit rider charges driven by higher average fee rates on variable annuity guarantee sales and sales in the prior year where the fees start on the first anniversary date.

Protection

The following table presents the results of operations of our Protection segment on an operating basis:

Our Protection segment pretax adjusted operating earnings, which excludes net realized investment gains or losses (net of the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual) and the market impact on IUL benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual) and mean reversion related impacts, was essentially flat at

$255

million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $256 million for the prior year

.

•

A $14 million decrease in DI claims, partially offset by a $4 million increase in life claims.

Corporate & Other

The following table presents the results of operations of our Corporate & Other segment on an operating basis:

Our Corporate & Other segment pretax adjusted operating loss excludes net realized investment gains or losses, the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments, gain or loss on disposal of a business that is not considered discontinued operations, integration and restructuring charges, and the impact of consolidating CIEs. Our Corporate & Other segment pretax adjusted operating loss decreased $164 million, or 35%, to $304 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $468 million for the prior year.


Net investment income increased $59 million, or 50%, to $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $118 million for the prior year primarily due to a $51 million impairment of our investment in affordable housing partnerships in 2017 due to the enactment of the Tax Act.

Premiums increased $46 million, or 4%, to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year due to higher average premium in both auto and home insurance products and higher auto policies in force.

General and administrative expense decreased $60 million, or 16%, to $315 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $375 million for the prior year primarily due to a $21 million decline in DOL planning and implementation expenses, lower performance-based compensation and a $9 million expense in the prior year related to the renegotiation of a vendor arrangement.

Fair Value Measurements

We report certain assets and liabilities at fair value; specifically, separate account assets, derivatives, embedded derivatives and most investments and cash equivalents. Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. We include actual market prices, or observable inputs, in our fair value measurements to the extent available. Broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. We validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as: price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our fair value measurements.

Fair Value of Liabilities and Nonperformance Risk

Companies are required to measure the fair value of liabilities at the price that would be received to transfer the liability to a market participant (an exit price). Since there is not a market for our obligations of our variable annuity riders, indexed annuities and IUL insurance, we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price. As a result, we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders, indexed annuities and IUL insurance by updating certain contractholder assumptions, adding explicit margins to provide for risk, and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a market estimate of our nonperformance risk. The nonperformance risk adjustment is based on observable market data adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities. Consistent with general market conditions, this estimate resulted in a spread over the LIBOR swap curve as of December 31, 2019. As our estimate of this spread widens or tightens, the liability will decrease or increase. If this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero spread over the LIBOR swap curve, the reduction to future net income would be approximately $341 million, net of DAC, DSIC, unearned revenue amortization, the reinsurance accrual and income taxes (calculated at the statutory tax rate of 21%), based on December 31, 2019 credit spreads.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Overview

We maintained substantial liquidity during the year ended

December 31, 2019

. At

December 31, 2019

and


, we had $3.7 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents excluding CIEs. We have additional liquidity available through an unsecured revolving credit facility for up to $750 million that expires in October 2022. Under the terms of the credit agreement, we can increase this facility to $1.0 billion upon satisfaction of certain approval requirements. Available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit. At

December 31, 2019

, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and had $1 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our credit facility contains various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We were in compliance with all such covenants at

December 31, 2019

.

On October 1, 2019, we completed the sale of AAH and received gross proceeds of $1.1 billion in cash at closing. After a payment to an affinity partner, the net proceeds were $1.0 billion.

On March 22, 2019, we issued $500 million of 3.00% senior notes due 2022 and incurred debt issuance costs of $3 million. A portion of the net proceeds was used to repay $300 million principal amount of our 7.3% senior notes which matured on June 28, 2019. The remainder of the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.

We enter into short-term borrowings, which may include repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, to reduce reinvestment risk. Short-term borrowings allow us to receive cash to reinvest in longer-duration assets, while maintaining the flexibility to pay back the short-term debt with cash flows generated by the fixed income portfolio. The balance of repurchase agreements as of

December 31, 2019

and


was nil and $50 million, respectively, which is collateralized with agency residential mortgage backed securities from our investment portfolio. Our subsidiaries, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (“RiverSource Life”), and Ameriprise Bank, FSB are members of the FHLB of Des Moines, which provides access to collateralized borrowings. As of

December 31, 2019

and


, we had borrowings from the FHLB of $201 million and $151 million, respectively, which is collateralized with commercial mortgage backed securities. We believe cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances and our availability of revolver borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs.

Dividends from Subsidiaries

Ameriprise Financial is primarily a parent holding company for the operations carried out by our wholly owned subsidiaries. Because of our holding company structure, our ability to meet our cash requirements, including the payment of dividends on our common stock, substantially depends upon the receipt of dividends or return of capital from our subsidiaries, particularly our life insurance


subsidiary, RiverSource Life, our face-amount certificate subsidiary, Ameriprise Certificate Company (“ACC”), AMPF Holding Corporation, which is the parent company of our retail introducing broker-dealer subsidiary, Ameriprise Financial Services, LLC (“AFS”) (previously Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc. until January 2020) and our clearing broker-dealer subsidiary, American Enterprise Investment Services, Inc. (“AEIS”), our transfer agent subsidiary, Columbia Management Investment Services Corp. (“CMIS”), our investment advisory company, Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC (“CMIA”), and Ameriprise International Holdings GmbH, which is the parent company of Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Sàrl. The payment of dividends by many of our subsidiaries is restricted and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements.

Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements for our wholly owned subsidiaries subject to regulatory capital requirements were as follows:

N/A  Not applicable.

#  Amounts are less than $1 million.

(1)

Actual capital is determined on a statutory basis.

(2)

Regulatory capital requirement is the company action level and is based on the statutory risk-based capital filing.

(3)

Regulatory capital requirement is based on the applicable regulatory requirement, calculated as of

December 31, 2019

and


.

(4)

Actual capital is determined on an adjusted GAAP basis.

(5)

ACC is required to hold capital in compliance with the Minnesota Department of Commerce and SEC capital requirements.

(6)

Actual capital and regulatory capital requirements are determined in accordance with U.K. regulatory legislation. The regulatory capital requirements at

December 31, 2019

represent calculations at September 30,


of the rule based requirements, as specified by FCA regulations.

(7)

Regulatory capital requirement is based on minimum requirements for well capitalized banks in accordance with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”).

(8)

The Company sold AAH on October 1, 2019.

In addition to the particular regulations restricting dividend payments and establishing subsidiary capitalization requirements, we take into account the overall health of the business, capital levels and risk management considerations in determining a strategy for payments to our parent holding company from our subsidiaries, and in deciding to use cash to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries.

During the year ended

December 31, 2019

, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $2.7 billion and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $368 million. During the year ended

December 31, 2018

, the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of $2.7 billion and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of $73 million.


The table below presents the historical subsidiary capacity for dividends and other distributions to the parent holding company in each of the years ended December 31:

(1)

For RiverSource Life payments in excess of statutory unassigned funds require advance notice to the Minnesota Department of Commerce, RiverSource Life’s primary regulator, and are subject to potential disapproval. In addition, dividends and other distributions whose fair market value, together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months, exceeds the greater of (1) the previous year’s statutory net gain from operations or (2) 10% of the previous year-end statutory capital and surplus are referred to as “extraordinary dividends.” Extraordinary dividends also require advance notice to the Minnesota Department of Commerce, and are subject to potential disapproval. For dividends exceeding these thresholds, RiverSource Life provided notice to the Minnesota Department of Commerce and received responses indicating that it did not object to the payment of these dividends. Total dividend capacity for RiverSource Life represents dividends paid during year ended December 31 along with any unpaid ordinary dividend capacity, subject to unassigned funds limitation.

(2)

The dividend capacity for ACC is based on capital held in excess of regulatory requirements.

The following table presents cash dividends paid or return of capital to the parent holding company, net of cash capital contributions made by the parent holding company for the following subsidiaries for the years ended December 31:

(1)

Includes forgiveness of parent holding company debt of

$81 million

and $195 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

(2)

In 2018, the amount includes $351 million from a securitized portfolio of advisor loans which were previously held at Ameriprise Advisor Capital, LLC. The securitization transaction eliminated in consolidation.

In 2009, RiverSource Life established an agreement to protect its exposure to Genworth Life Insurance Company (“GLIC”) for its reinsured LTC. In 2016, substantial enhancements to this reinsurance protection agreement were finalized. The terms of these confidential provisions within the agreement have been shared, in the normal course of regular reviews, with our domiciliary regulator and rating agencies. GLIC is domiciled in Delaware, so in the event GLIC were subjected to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings, such proceedings would be located in (and governed by) Delaware laws. Delaware courts have a long tradition of respecting commercial and reinsurance affairs, as well as contracts among sophisticated parties. Similar credit protections to what we have with GLIC have been tested and respected in Delaware and elsewhere in the United States, and as a result we believe our credit protections would be respected even in the unlikely event that GLIC becomes subject to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings in Delaware. Accordingly, while no credit protections are perfect, we believe the correct way to think about the risks represented by our counterparty credit exposure to GLIC is not the full amount of the gross liability that GLIC reinsures, but a much smaller net exposure to GLIC (if any that might exist after taking into account our credit protections). Thus, management believes that our agreement and offsetting non LTC legacy arrangements with Genworth will enable RiverSource Life to recover on all net exposure in all material respects in the event of a rehabilitation or insolvency of GLIC.


Dividends Paid to Shareholders and Share Repurchases

We paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling $518 million and $516 million for the years ended

and


, respectively. On January 29, 2020, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.97 per common share. The dividend will be paid on February 28, 2020 to our shareholders of record at the close of business on February 14, 2020.

In April 2017, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $2.5 billion of our common stock through June 30, 2019, which was exhausted in the second quarter of 2019. In February 2019, our Board of Directors authorized an additional repurchase up to $2.5 billion of our common stock through March 31, 2021. As of

December 31, 2019

, we had $1.1 billion remaining under this share repurchase authorization. We intend to fund share repurchases through existing working capital, future earnings and other customary financing methods. The share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and depending on market conditions and other factors, these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. Acquisitions under the share repurchase program may be made in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means. During the year ended

December 31, 2019

, we repurchased a total of 13.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $141.87 per share.

Cash Flows

Cash flows of CIEs and restricted and segregated cash are reflected in our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash held by CIEs is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial, nor is Ameriprise Financial cash available for general use by its CIEs. Cash segregated under federal and other regulations is held for the exclusive benefit of our brokerage customers and is not available for general use by Ameriprise Financial.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $256 million to $2.3 billion for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $2.6 billion for the prior year

primarily reflecting

a $375 million decrease in cash from changes in restricted and segregated investments, a $264 million decrease in cash from changes in brokerage deposits and

a $100 million payment to an affinity partner in connection with the sale of AAH, partially offset by changes in receivables

.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.1 billion to $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $1.5 billion for the prior year primarily due to an $847 million increase in cash from changes in restricted and segregated investments and lower cash outflows related to derivatives.

Investing Activities

Our investing activities primarily relate to our Available-for-Sale investment portfolio. Further, this activity is significantly affected by the net flows of our investment certificate, fixed annuity and universal life products reflected in financing activities.

Net cash used in investing activities increased $2.6 billion to $3.2 billion for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to $587 million for the prior year primarily reflecting a $3.6 billion increase in cash used for purchases of Available-for-Sale securities, a $193 million decrease in proceeds from sales of Available-for-Sale securities, a $635 million decrease in net cash flows related to investments of consolidated investment entities, a $251 million decrease in cash related to the fixed annuities reinsurance arrangement and a $138 million decrease to cash related to written options with deferred premiums, partially offset by a $1.5 billion increase in proceeds from maturities, sinking fund payments and calls of Available-for-Sale securities and $934 million in proceeds from the sale of AAH, net of cash and cash equivalents sold of $204 million. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the sale of AAH.

Net cash used in investing activities increased $416 million to $587 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $171 million for the prior year primarily due to

a $2.9 billion increase in cash used for purchases of Available-for-Sale securities, a $404 million decrease in cash proceeds from sales, maturities and repayments of mortgage loans reflecting the sale of our remaining consumer loans in 2017 and

a $134 million increase in purchases of other investments,

partially offset by

a $1.8 billion increase in proceeds from maturities, sinking fund payments and calls of Available-for-Sale securities, a $244 million decrease in funding of mortgage loans, a $393 million increase in cash proceeds from sales, maturities and collections of other investments driven by proceeds from

certificates of deposit

, and

a $594 million increase in net cash related to changes in investments of CIEs.

Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.2 billion for the year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to net cash used in financing activities of $1.3 billion for the prior year primarily reflecting a $3.8 billion increase in net cash inflows from banking deposits, proceeds of $497 million from issuance of debt and a $508 million decrease in net cash outflows related to CIE debt, partially offset by a $1.9 billion decrease in cash related to investment certificates due to certificate net outflows, repayment of $300 million of our senior notes in June 2019 and a $313 million increase in share repurchases.

Net cash used in financing activities decreased $522 million to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $1.8 billion for the prior year primarily due to

a $1.5 billion increase in cash proceeds from investment certificates and

a $138 million increase in cash received from purchased options with deferred premiums,

partially offset by

a $483 million increase in cash used for maturities, withdrawals and surrenders of investment certificates, a $474 million decrease in net cash related to changes in debt of CIEs and

a $145 million increase in cash used to repurchase common shares.


Contractual Commitments

The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both our on and off-balance sheet transactions that represent material expected or contractually committed future obligations. The table excludes obligations of CIEs as they are not direct obligations of the Company and have recourse only to the assets of the CIEs. Estimated cash payments due by period as of

December 31, 2019

were as follows:

(1)

See Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our long-term debt.

(2)

These scheduled payments are represented by reserves of approximately $30.5 billion at

December 31, 2019

and are based on interest credited, mortality, morbidity, lapse, surrender and premium payment assumptions. The estimated payments are presented gross before reinsurance. The scheduled payments are undiscounted and exceed the corresponding liability at December 31, 2019. Actual payment obligations may differ if experience varies from these assumptions. As of December 31, 2019, the projected period for which cash payments will be made is 40 years. Separate account liabilities have been excluded as associated contractual obligations would be met by separate account assets.

(3)

The payments due by year are based on contractual term maturities. However, contractholders have the right to redeem the investment certificates earlier and at their discretion subject to surrender charges, if any. Redemptions are most likely to occur in periods of substantial increases in interest rates.

(4)

The fair value of these commitments included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $1.0 billion as of

December 31, 2019

. See Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our deferred premium options.

(5)

Call dates for the obligations presented are either date or event specific. For date specific obligations, we are required to fund a specific amount on a stated date provided there are no defaults under the agreement. For event specific obligations, we are required to fund a specific amount of its capital commitment when properties in a fund become fully stabilized. For event specific obligations, the estimated call date of these commitments is used in the table above.

(6)

Purchase obligations include the minimum contractual amounts by period under contracts that were in effect at

December 31, 2019

. Many of the purchase agreements giving rise to these purchase obligations include termination clauses that may require payment of termination fees if the agreements are terminated by us without cause prior to their stated expiration; however, the table reflects the amounts to be paid assuming the contracts are not terminated.

(7)

Interest on senior notes was estimated based on rates in effect as of

December 31, 2019

.

In addition to the contractual commitments outlined in the table above, we periodically fund the employees’ defined benefit plans. In 2020, we expect to contribute

$16 million

to our pension plans and

$1 million

to our defined benefit postretirement plans. See Note 25 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Total funding commitments related to loans and private funds, which are not included in the table above due to uncertainty with respect to timing of future cash flows, were $61 million and $12 million, respectively, at

December 31, 2019

. For additional information relating to these contractual commitments, see Note 26 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We provide asset management services to investment entities which are considered to be VIEs, such as CLOs, hedge funds, property funds and other private funds, which are sponsored by us. We consolidate certain CLOs. We have determined that consolidation is not required for hedge funds, property funds and other private funds, which are sponsored by us. Our maximum exposure to loss with respect to our investment in these non-consolidated entities is limited to our carrying value and future funding commitments that are legally binding. Other than future funding commitments that are legally binding, we have no obligation to provide further financial or other support to these investment entities nor have we provided any support to these investment entities. See Note 5 and Note 26 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our arrangements with these investment entities.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Risk

Our primary market risk exposures are interest rate, equity price, foreign currency exchange rate and credit risk. Equity price and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations, primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset-based fees we earn, the spread income generated on our fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, brokerage client cash balances, banking deposits, face-amount certificate products and the fixed portion of our variable annuities and variable insurance contracts, the value of DAC and DSIC assets, the value of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the value of derivatives held to hedge these benefits.

RiverSource Life has the following variable annuity guarantee benefits: guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (“GMWB”), guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (“GMAB”), guaranteed minimum death benefits (“GMDB”) and guaranteed minimum income benefits (“GMIB”). Each of these benefits guarantees payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the underlying invested assets.

The variable annuity guarantees continue to be managed by utilizing a hedging program which attempts to match the sensitivity of the assets with the sensitivity of the liabilities. This approach works with the premise that matched sensitivities will produce a highly effective hedging result. Our comprehensive hedging program focuses mainly on first order sensitivities of assets and liabilities: Equity Market Level (Delta), Interest Rate Level (Rho) and Volatility (Vega). Additionally, various second order sensitivities are managed. We use various options (equity index, interest rate swaptions, etc.), swaps (interest rate, total return, etc.) and futures to manage risk exposures. The exposures are measured and monitored daily, and adjustments to the hedge portfolio are made as necessary.

We have a macro hedge program to provide protection against the statutory tail scenario risk arising from variable annuity reserves on our statutory surplus and to cover some of the residual risks not covered by other hedging activities. We assess the residual risk under a range of scenarios in creating and executing the macro hedge program. As a means of economically hedging these risks, we may use a combination of futures, options, swaps and swaptions. Certain of the macro hedge derivatives used contain settlement provisions linked to both equity returns and interest rates; the remaining are interest rate contracts or equity contracts. The macro hedge program could result in additional earnings volatility as changes in the value of the macro hedge derivatives, which are designed to reduce statutory capital volatility, may not be closely aligned to changes in the variable annuity guarantee embedded derivatives.

To evaluate interest rate and equity price risk we perform sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a 12-month period following a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a hypothetical 10% decline in equity prices. The interest rate risk test assumes a sudden 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve, with rates then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. The equity price risk test assumes a sudden 10% drop in equity prices, with equity prices then staying at those levels for the next 12 months. In estimating the values of variable annuity riders, indexed annuities, stock market certificates, IUL insurance and the associated hedge assets, we assume no change in implied market volatility despite the 10% drop in equity prices.


The following tables present our estimate of the impact on pretax income from the above defined hypothetical market movements as of

December 31, 2019

:

N/A  Not Applicable.

(1)

Excludes incentive income which is impacted by market and fund performance during the period and cannot be readily estimated.

(2)

Market impact on DAC and DSIC amortization resulting from lower projected profits.

(3)

In estimating the impact to pretax income on DAC and DSIC amortization and additional insurance benefit reserves, our assumed equity asset growth rates reflect what management would follow in its mean reversion guidelines.

(4)

Market impact on DAC and DSIC amortization related to variable annuity riders is modeled net of hedge impact.

(5)

The market impact of the macro hedge program is modeled net of any related impact to DAC and DSIC amortization.

(6)

Represents the net impact to pretax income. The estimated net impact to pretax adjusted operating income is $(259) million.

The above results compare to an estimated negative net impact to pretax income of $213 million related to a 10% equity price decline and an estimated positive net impact to pretax income of $25 million related to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2018. Our previous disclosure estimating the impact from a 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2018 was $541 million and did not reflect mitigation enhancements made to our hedge programs and overstated the


impact to IUL insurance. The change in equity price exposure as of December 31, 2019 compared to prior year-end was driven by a larger estimated positive impact from our macro hedge program, which has been expanded.

Net

impacts shown in the above table from GMWB riders result largely from differences between the liability valuation basis and the hedging basis. Liabilities are valued using fair value accounting principles, with risk margins incorporated in contractholder behavior assumptions and with discount rates increased to reflect a current market estimate of our risk of nonperformance specific to these liabilities. Our hedging is based on our determination of economic risk, which excludes certain items in the liability valuation including the nonperformance spread risk.

Actual

results could differ materially from those illustrated above as they are based on a number of estimates and assumptions. These include assuming that implied market volatility does not change when equity prices fall by 10% and that the 100 basis point increase in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve. Furthermore, we have not tried to anticipate changes in client preferences for different types of assets or other changes in client behavior, nor have we tried to anticipate all strategic actions management might take to increase revenues or reduce expenses in these scenarios.

The

selection of a 100 basis point interest rate increase as well as a 10% equity price decline should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Impacts of larger or smaller changes in interest rates or equity prices may not be proportional to those shown for a 100 basis point increase in interest rates or a 10% decline in equity prices.

Asset-Based Management and Distribution Fees

We

earn asset-based management fees and distribution fees on our assets under management. As of

December 31, 2019

, the value of our assets under management was $778.1 billion. These sources of revenue are subject to both interest rate and equity price risk since the value of these assets and the fees they earn fluctuate inversely with interest rates and directly with equity prices. We do not currently hedge the interest rate or equity price risk of this exposure.

DAC and DSIC Amortization

For

annuity and UL/VUL products, DAC and DSIC are amortized on the basis of EGPs. EGPs are a proxy for pretax income prior to the recognition of DAC and DSIC amortization expense. When events occur that reduce or increase current period EGPs, DAC and DSIC amortization expense is typically reduced or increased as well, somewhat mitigating the impact of the event on pretax income.

Variable Annuity Riders

The

total contract value of all variable annuities as of

December 31, 2019

was $80.1 billion. These contract values include GMWB and GMAB contracts which were $48.8 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, as of

December 31, 2019

. As of

December 31, 2019

, reserves for GMWB were net liabilities of $1.5 billion and reserves for GMAB were net assets of $39 million. The GMWB and GMAB reserves include the fair value of embedded derivatives, which fluctuates based on equity, interest rate and credit markets which can cause these embedded derivatives to be either an asset or a liability. As of

December 31, 2019

, the reserve for GMDB and GMIB was a net liability of $23 million.

Equity Price Risk

The

variable annuity guaranteed benefits guarantee payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the investment assets. For this reason, when equity prices decline, the returns from the separate account assets coupled with guaranteed benefit fees from annuity holders may not be sufficient to fund expected payouts. In that case, reserves must be increased with a negative impact to earnings.

The

core derivative instruments with which we hedge the equity price risk of our GMWB and GMAB provisions are longer dated put and call options; these core instruments are supplemented with equity futures and total return swaps. See Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our derivative instruments.

Interest Rate Risk

The

GMAB and the non-life contingent benefits associated with the GMWB provisions create embedded derivatives which are carried at fair value separately from the underlying host variable annuity contract. Changes in the fair value of the GMWB and GMAB liabilities are recorded through earnings with fair value calculated based on projected, discounted cash flows over the life of the contract, including projected, discounted benefits and fees. Increases in interest rates reduce the fair value of the GMWB and GMAB liabilities. The GMWB and GMAB interest rate exposure is hedged with a portfolio of longer dated put and call options, interest rate swaps and swaptions. We have entered into interest rate swaps according to risk exposures along maturities, thus creating both fixed rate payor and variable rate payor terms. If interest rates were to increase, we would have to pay more to the swap counterparty, and the fair value of our equity puts would decrease, resulting in a negative impact to our pretax income.

Fixed Annuities, Fixed Insurance and Fixed Portion of Variable Annuities and Variable Insurance Contracts

Our

earnings from fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts are based upon the spread between rates earned on assets held and the rates at which interest is credited to accounts. We primarily invest in fixed rate securities to fund the rate credited to clients. We guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products. Investment assets and client liabilities generally differ as it relates to basis, repricing or maturity characteristics. Rates credited to clients’ accounts generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on the underlying investments. Therefore, in an increasing interest rate environment, higher interest rates may be reflected in crediting rates to clients sooner than in rates earned on invested assets, which could result in a reduced spread between the two rates, reduced earned income and a negative impact on pretax


income. However, the current low interest rate environment is resulting in interest rates below the level of some of our liability guaranteed minimum interest rates (“GMIRs”). Hence, a modest rise in interest rates would not necessarily result in changes to all the liability credited rates while projected asset purchases would capture the full increase in interest rates. This dynamic would result in widening spreads under a modestly rising rate scenario given the current relationship between the current level of interest rates and the underlying GMIRs on the business. Of the $30.5 billion in policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and claims on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of

December 31, 2019

, $16.2 billion is related to liabilities created by these products. We do not hedge this exposure.

As

a result of the low interest rate environment, our current reinvestment yields are generally lower than the current portfolio yield. We expect our portfolio income yields to continue to decline in future periods if interest rates remain low. The carrying value and weighted average yield of non-structured fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans that may generate proceeds to reinvest through 2021 due to prepayment, maturity or call activity at the option of the issuer, excluding securities with a make-whole provision, were $4.1 billion and 3.0%, respectively, as of

December 31, 2019

. In addition, residential mortgage backed securities, which are subject to prepayment risk as a result of the low interest rate environment, totaled $10.0 billion and had a weighted average yield of 2.7% as of

December 31, 2019

. While these amounts represent investments that could be subject to reinvestment risk, it is also possible that these investments will be used to fund liabilities or may not be prepaid and will remain invested at their current yields. In addition to the interest rate environment, the mix of benefit payments versus product sales as well as the timing and volumes associated with such mix may impact our investment yield. Furthermore, reinvestment activities and the associated investment yield may also be impacted by corporate strategies implemented at management’s discretion. The average yield for investment purchases during the year ended

December 31, 2019

was approximately 2.7%.

The

reinvestment of proceeds from maturities, calls and prepayments at rates below the current portfolio yield, which may be below the level of some liability GMIRs, will have a negative impact to future operating results. To mitigate the unfavorable impact that the low interest rate environment has on our spread income, we assess reinvestment risk in our investment portfolio and monitor this risk in accordance with our asset/liability management framework. In addition, we may reduce the crediting rates on our fixed products when warranted, subject to guaranteed minimums.

The following table presents the account values of fixed deferred annuities, fixed insurance, and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts by range of GMIRs and the range of the difference between rates credited to policyholders and contractholders as of

December 31, 2019

and the respective guaranteed minimums, as well as the percentage of account values subject to rate reset in the time period indicated. Rates are reset at our discretion, subject to guaranteed minimums.

(1)

Includes contracts with annual discretionary crediting rate resets and contracts with 12 or less months until the crediting rate becomes discretionary on an annual basis.

(2)

Includes contracts with more than 12 months remaining until the crediting rate becomes an annual discretionary rate.

Equity Indexed Annuities

Our

equity indexed annuity (“EIA”) product is a single premium annuity issued with an initial term of seven years. The annuity guarantees the contractholder a minimum return of 3% on 90% of the initial premium or end of prior term accumulation value upon renewal plus a return that is linked to the performance of the S&P 500

®

Index. The equity-linked return is based on a participation rate initially set at between 50% and 90% of the S&P 500

®

Index, which is guaranteed for the initial seven-year term when the contract is held to full term. As of

December 31, 2019

, we had $18 million in liabilities related to EIAs. We discontinued new sales of EIAs in 2007.


Equity Price Risk

The

equity-linked return to investors creates equity price risk as the amount credited depends on changes in equity prices. To hedge this exposure, we purchase futures, which generate returns to replicate what we must credit to client accounts.

Interest Rate Risk

Most

of the proceeds received from EIAs are invested in fixed income securities with the return on those investments intended to fund the 3% guarantee. We earn income from the difference between the return earned on invested assets and the 3% guarantee rate credited to customer accounts. The spread between return earned and amount credited is affected by changes in interest rates. This risk is not currently hedged and was immaterial as of

December 31, 2019

.

Fixed Index Annuities

The Company’s fixed index annuity product is a fixed annuity that includes an indexed account. The rate of interest credited above the minimum guarantee for funds allocated to the indexed account is linked to the performance of the specific index for the indexed account (subject to a cap). We offer S&P 500

®

Index and MSCI

®

EAFE Index account options. Both options offer two crediting durations, one-year and two-year. The contractholder may allocate all or a portion of the policy value to a fixed or indexed account. The contractholder can choose to add a GMWB for life rider for an additional fee. As of

December 31, 2019

, we had $291 million in liabilities related to fixed index annuities.

Equity Price Risk

The equity-linked return to investors creates equity price risk as the amount credited depends on changes in equity prices. Most of the proceeds received from fixed index annuities are invested in fixed income securities. To hedge the equity exposure, a portion of the investment earnings received from the fixed income securities is used to purchase call spreads and futures which generate returns to replicate what we must credit to client accounts.

Interest Rate Risk

As mentioned above, most of the proceeds received from fixed index annuities are invested in fixed income securities with the return on those investments intended to fund the purchase of call spreads. There are two risks relating to interest rates. First, we have the risk that investment returns are such that we do not have enough investment income to purchase the needed call spreads. Second, in the event the policy is surrendered, we pay out a book value surrender amount and there is a risk that we will incur a loss upon having to sell the fixed income securities backing the liability (if interest rates have risen). This risk is not currently hedged.

Banking Deposits and Brokerage Client Cash Balances

We pay interest on banking deposits and certain brokerage client cash balances and have the ability to reset these rates from time to time based on prevailing economic and business conditions. We earn revenue to fund the interest paid from interest-earning assets or fees from off-balance sheet deposits at FDIC insured institutions, which are indexed to short-term interest rates. In general, the change in interest paid lags the change in revenues earned.

Certificate Products

Fixed Rate Certificates

We have interest rate risk from our investment certificates generally ranging in amounts from $1,000 to $2 million with interest crediting rate terms ranging from three to 48 months. We guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products. Payments collected from clients are primarily invested in fixed income securities to fund the client credited rate with the spread between the rate earned from investments and the rate credited to clients recorded as earned income. Client liabilities and investment assets generally differ as it relates to basis, repricing or maturity characteristics. Rates credited to clients generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on underlying investments. This exposure is not currently hedged although we monitor our investment strategy and make modifications based on our changing liabilities and the expected interest rate environment. Of the $14.4 billion in customer deposits as of

December 31, 2019

, $7.0 billion related to reserves for our fixed rate certificate products.

Stock Market Certificates

Stock market certificates are purchased for amounts generally from $1,000 to $2 million for terms of 52 weeks, 104 weeks or 156 weeks, which can be extended to a maximum of 15 years depending on the term. For each term the certificate holder can choose to participate 100% in any percentage increase in the S&P 500

®

Index up to a maximum return or choose partial participation in any increase in the S&P 500 Index plus a fixed rate of interest guaranteed in advance. If partial participation is selected, the total of equity-linked return and guaranteed rate of interest cannot exceed the maximum return. Liabilities for our stock market certificates are included in customer deposits on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of

December 31, 2019

, we had $463 million in reserves related to stock market certificates. The equity-linked return to investors creates equity price risk exposure. We seek to minimize this exposure with purchased futures and call spreads that replicate what we must credit to client accounts. This risk continues to be fully hedged. Stock market certificates have some interest rate risk as changes in interest rates affect the fair value of the payout to be made to the certificate holder. This risk is not currently hedged and was immaterial as of

December 31, 2019

.

Indexed Universal Life

IUL insurance is similar to UL in many regards, although the rate of credited interest above the minimum guarantee for funds allocated to an indexed account is linked to the performance of the specified index for the indexed account (subject to a cap and floor).


We offer an S&P 500

®

Index account option and a blended multi-index account option comprised of the S&P 500 Index, the MSCI

®

EAFE Index and the MSCI EM Index. Both options offer two crediting durations, one-year and two-year. The policyholder may allocate all or a portion of the policy value to a fixed or any available indexed account. As of

December 31, 2019

, we had $1.9 billion in liabilities related to the indexed accounts of IUL, with the vast majority in the S&P 500

®

Index account option.

Equity Price Risk

The equity-linked return to investors creates equity price risk as the amount credited depends on changes in equity prices. Most of the proceeds received from IUL insurance are invested in fixed income securities. To hedge the equity exposure, a portion of the investment earnings received from the fixed income securities is used to purchase call spreads which generate returns to replicate what we must credit to client accounts.

Interest Rate Risk

As mentioned above, most of the proceeds received from IUL insurance are invested in fixed income securities with the return on those investments intended to fund the purchase of call spreads. There are two risks relating to interest rates. First, we have the risk that investment returns are such that we do not have enough investment income to purchase the needed call spreads. Second, in the event the policy is surrendered we pay out a book value surrender amount and there is a risk that we will incur a loss upon having to sell the fixed income securities backing the liability (if interest rates have risen). This risk is not currently hedged.

Foreign Currency Risk

We have foreign currency risk through our net investment in foreign subsidiaries and our operations in foreign countries. We are primarily exposed to changes in British Pounds (“GBP”) related to our net investment in Threadneedle, which was 578 million GBP as of

December 31, 2019

. Our primary exposure related to operations in foreign countries is to the GBP, the Euro and the Indian Rupee. We monitor the foreign exchange rates that we have exposure to and enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risk when economically prudent. As of

December 31, 2019

, the notional value of outstanding contracts and our remaining foreign currency risk related to operations in foreign countries were not material.

Interest Rate Risk on External Debt

The stated interest rate on the $3.1 billion of our senior unsecured notes is fixed. We entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert the fixed interest rate on $0.4 billion of the senior unsecured notes to floating interest rates based on six-month LIBOR. We hedged the debt in part to better align the interest expense on debt with the interest earned on cash equivalents held on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net interest rate risk of these items is immaterial.

Credit Risk

We

are exposed to credit risk within our investment portfolio, including our loan portfolio, and through our derivative and reinsurance activities. Credit risk relates to the uncertainty of an obligor’s continued ability to make timely payments in accordance with the contractual terms of the financial instrument or contract. We consider our total potential credit exposure to each counterparty and its affiliates to ensure compliance with pre-established credit guidelines at the time we enter into a transaction which would potentially increase our credit risk. These guidelines and oversight of credit risk are managed through a comprehensive enterprise risk management program that includes members of senior management.

We

manage the risk of credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties by applying disciplined fundamental credit analysis and underwriting standards, prudently limiting exposures to lower-quality, higher-yielding investments, and diversifying exposures by issuer, industry, region and underlying investment type. We remain exposed to occasional adverse cyclical economic downturns during which default rates may be significantly higher than the long-term historical average used in pricing.

We

manage our credit risk related to over-the-counter derivatives by entering into transactions with creditworthy counterparties, maintaining collateral arrangements and through the use of master netting arrangements that provide for a single net payment to be made by one counterparty to another at each due date and upon termination. Generally, our current credit exposure on over-the-counter derivative contracts is limited to a derivative counterparty’s net positive fair value of derivative contracts after taking into consideration the existence of netting arrangements and any collateral received. This exposure is monitored and managed to an acceptable threshold level.

The

counterparty risk for centrally cleared over-the-counter derivatives is transferred to a central clearing party through contract novation. Because the central clearing party monitors open positions and adjusts collateral requirements daily, we have minimal credit exposure from such derivative instruments.

Exchange

-traded derivatives are effected through regulated exchanges that require contract standardization and initial margin to transact through the exchange. Because exchange-traded futures are marked to market and generally cash settled on a daily basis, we have minimal exposure to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to such derivative instruments. Other exchange-traded derivatives would be exposed to nonperformance by counterparties for amounts in excess of initial margin requirements only if the exchange is unable to fulfill the contract.

We

manage our credit risk related to reinsurance treaties by evaluating the financial condition of reinsurance counterparties prior to entering into new reinsurance treaties. In addition, we regularly evaluate their financial strength during the terms of the treaties. As of

December 31, 2019

, our largest reinsurance credit risk is related to a LTC coinsurance treaty with life insurance subsidiaries of Genworth Financial, Inc. See Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on reinsurance.

Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Consolidated Financial Statements:


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, including the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under Item 15 (a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated

financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.


Valuation of the reserves for long term care policies

As described in Notes 2 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements,

the total reserves for long term care policies was $5,302 million as of December 31, 2019, which is included in policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and claims on the consolidated balance sheet.

Liabilities for estimates of benefits that will become payable on future claims on long term care policies are based on a gross premium valuation reflecting management’s current best estimate assumptions. Management utilizes best estimate assumptions as of the date the policy is issued with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation, as appropriate. After the liabilities are initially established, management performs premium deficiency tests, using current best estimate assumptions. If a premium deficiency is recognized, the assumptions as of the date of the loss recognition are locked in and used in subsequent periods. In


, management’s current best estimate assumptions included expected premium rate increases, benefit reductions, morbidity rates, policy persistency and interest rates earned on assets supporting the liability, and resulted in the recognition of a premium deficiency and losses of $8 million that were recorded through benefits, claims, losses and expenses.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the reserves for long term care policies

is a critical audit matter are (i) there was significant judgment by management when developing the estimate of the long term care reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the current best estimate assumptions, including expected premium rate increases, benefit reductions, morbidity rates, policy persistency and interest rates earned on assets supporting the liability, and

(ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls related to the valuation of the reserves for long term care policies, including controls over the Company’s development of the current best estimate assumptions. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of the assumptions used, including expected premium rate increases, benefit reductions, morbidity rates, policy persistency and interest rates earned on assets supporting the liability, and testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used by management in the development of the current best estimate assumptions. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of management’s current best estimate assumptions used in the valuation of reserves for long term care policies.

Valuation of the embedded derivatives in certain variable annuity riders

As described in Notes 2, 11, 12, and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, management values embedded derivatives attributable to the provisions of certain variable annuity riders using internal valuation models. As there is no active market for the transfer of these embedded derivatives, such models calculate fair value by discounting expected cash flows. As of December 31, 2019, the net embedded derivative liability in certain variable annuity riders was $763 million, and is included in policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and claims on the consolidated balance sheet. Management’s discounted cash flow model for estimating fair value includes observable capital market assumptions and incorporates significant unobservable inputs related to implied volatility, non-performance risk and contractholder behavior assumptions that include margins for risk, all of which management believes an exit market participant would expect.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the embedded derivatives in certain variable annuity riders is a critical audit matter are

(i) there was significant judgment and estimation by management when developing the fair value of the embedded derivatives in certain variable annuity riders, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained relating to

management’s estimates and significant unobservable inputs related to implied volatility, non-performance risk and contractholder behavior assumptions that include margins for risk

, and

(ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated

financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls related to the valuation of embedded derivatives in certain variable annuity riders, including controls over the significant unobservable inputs.

These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate, evaluating the reasonableness of the significant unobservable inputs related to implied volatility, non-performance risk and contractholder behavior assumptions that include margins for risk,

and testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used by management in the development of the significant unobservable inputs.

Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used

to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of certain significant unobservable inputs related to

implied volatility, non-performance risk and contractholder behavior assumptions that include margins for risk

.

Valuation of certain guarantees on variable annuity and certain life insurance policies accounted for as insurance liabilities

As described in Notes 2, 11, and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company issues universal life, variable universal life and variable annuity policies that have product features that are accounted for as insurance liabilities. The liability for these policies, which is included in policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and claims on the consolidated balance sheet, is determined using actuarial models to estimate the present value of the projected benefits in excess of account value and expected assessments.


Significant assumptions used by management in projecting the present value of future benefits and assessments include customer asset value growth rates, mortality, persistency, and investment margins, and additionally for variable annuity policies, benefit utilization.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of certain guarantees on variable annuity and certain life insurance policies accounted for as insurance liabilities is a critical audit matter are

(i) there was significant judgment by management when developing the estimate of certain guarantees on variable annuity and certain life insurance policies accounted for as insurance liabilities, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the

significant assumptions, including customer asset value growth rates, mortality, persistency, benefit utilization and investment margins,

and

(ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls related to the valuation of certain guarantees on variable annuity and certain life insurance policies accounted for as insurance liabilities, including controls

over the development of the significant assumptions

. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the estimate, evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used, including customer asset value growth rates, mortality, persistency, benefit utilization and investment margins,

and testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used by management in the development of the significant assumptions.

Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in

evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions, including

customer asset value growth rates, mortality, persistency, benefit utilization and investment margins

Basis of Presentation

Ameriprise Financial, Inc. is a holding company, which primarily conducts business through its subsidiaries to provide financial planning, products and services that are designed to be utilized as solutions for clients’ cash and liquidity, asset accumulation, income, protection and estate and wealth transfer needs. The foreign operations of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. are conducted primarily through Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Sàrl and Ameriprise Asset Management Holdings GmbH (collectively, “Threadneedle”).

The

accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Ameriprise Financial, Inc., companies in which it directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in which it is the primary beneficiary (collectively, the “Company”). All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

The

accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).

In 2017, the Company recorded the following out-of-period corrections:

•

an

$


million

decrease to other comprehensive income (“OCI”) related to deferred taxes on currency translations adjustments.

•

a

$


million

out-of-period correction related to a variable annuity model assumption that decreased amortization of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) by

$


million

and decreased benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses by

$


million

.

•

a

$


million

decrease to income tax provision for a reversal of a tax reserve.

The

impact of these corrections was not material to prior period financial statements.

The Company evaluated events or transactions that may have occurred after the balance sheet date for potential recognition or disclosure through the date the financial statements were issued. No subsequent events or transactions were identified.

2.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

A

VIE is an entity that either has equity investors that lack certain essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest (including substantive voting rights, the obligation to absorb the entity’s losses, or the rights to receive the entity’s returns) or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities.

Voting

interest entities (“VOEs”) are those entities that do not qualify as a VIE. The Company consolidates VOEs in which it holds a greater than


%

voting interest. The Company generally accounts for entities using the equity method when it holds a greater than


%

but less than


%

voting interest or when the Company exercises significant influence over the entity. All other investments that are not reported at fair value as trading or Available-for-Sale securities are accounted for under the cost method when the Company owns less than a


%

voting interest and does not exercise significant influence.

A VIE is consolidated by the reporting entity that determines it has both:

•

the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and

•

the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses or the right to receive potentially significant benefits to the VIE.

All

VIEs are assessed for consolidation under this framework. When evaluating entities for consolidation, the Company considers its contractual rights in determining whether it has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance. In determining whether the Company has this power, it considers whether it is acting in a role that enables it to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of an entity or if it is acting in an agent role.

In

determining whether the Company has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Company considers an analysis of its rights to receive benefits such as investment returns and its obligation to absorb losses associated with any investment in the VIE in conjunction with other qualitative factors. Management and incentive fees that are at market and commensurate with the level of services provided, and where the Company does not hold other interests in the VIE that would absorb more than an insignificant amount of the VIE’s expected losses or receive more than an insignificant amount of the VIE’s expected residual returns, are not considered a variable interest and are excluded from the analysis.

The

consolidation guidance has a scope exception for reporting entities with interests in registered money market funds which do not have an explicit support agreement.

Foreign Currency Translation

Net

assets of foreign subsidiaries, whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, are translated into U.S. dollars based upon exchange rates prevailing at the end of each period. Revenues and expenses are translated at daily exchange rates during the period. The resulting translation adjustment, along with any related hedge and tax effects, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). The determination of the functional currency is based on the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in the consolidated results of operations.


Amounts Based on Estimates and Assumptions

Accounting

estimates are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. In part, they are based upon assumptions concerning future events. Among the more significant are those that relate to investment securities valuation and recognition of other-than-temporary impairments, DAC and the corresponding recognition of DAC amortization, valuation of derivative instruments and hedging activities, litigation reserves, future policy benefits and claims reserves and income taxes and the recognition of deferred

tax

assets

and

liabilities.

These

accounting

estimates

reflect

the

best

judgment

of

management

and

actual

results could

differ.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash

equivalents include time deposits and other highly liquid investments with original or remaining maturities at the time of purchase of 90 days or less.

Investments

Available-for-Sale Securities

Available

-for-Sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains (losses) recorded in AOCI, net of impacts to DAC, deferred sales inducement costs (“DSIC”), unearned revenue, benefit reserves, reinsurance recoverables and income taxes. Gains and losses are recognized on a trade date basis in the Consolidated Statements of Operations upon disposition of the securities.

When

the fair value of an investment is less than its amortized cost, the Company assesses whether or not: (i) it has the intent to sell the security (made a decision to sell) or (ii) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery. If either of these conditions exist, an other-than-temporary impairment is considered to have occurred and the Company recognizes an other-than-temporary impairment for the difference between the investment’s amortized cost and its fair value through earnings. For securities that do not meet the above criteria and the Company does not expect to recover a security’s amortized cost, the security is also considered other-than-temporarily impaired. For these securities, the Company separates the total impairment into the credit loss component and the amount of the loss related to other factors. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to credit loss is recognized in earnings.

The

amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to other factors is recognized in OCI, net of impacts to DAC, DSIC, unearned revenue, benefit reserves, reinsurance recoverables and income taxes. For Available-for-Sale securities that have recognized an other-than-temporary impairment through earnings, the difference between the amortized cost and the cash flows expected to be collected is accreted as interest income if through subsequent evaluation there is a sustained increase in the cash flow expected.

Subsequent

increases and decreases in the fair value of Available-for-Sale securities are included in OCI.

The

Company provides a supplemental disclosure on the face of its Consolidated Statements of Operations that presents: (i) total other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized during the period and (ii) the portion of other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in OCI. The sum of these amounts represents the credit-related portion of other-than-temporary impairments that were recognized in earnings during the period. The portion of other-than-temporary losses recognized in OCI includes: (i) the portion of other-than-temporary impairment losses related to factors other than credit recognized during the period and (ii) reclassifications of other-than-temporary impairment losses previously determined to be related to factors other than credit that are determined to be credit-related in the current period. The amount presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as the portion of other-than-temporary losses recognized in OCI excludes subsequent increases and decreases in the fair value of these securities.

For

all securities that are considered temporarily impaired, the Company does not intend to sell these securities (has not made a decision to sell) and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company believes that it will collect all principal and interest due on all investments that have amortized

cost

in excess of fair value that are considered only temporarily impaired.

Factors

the Company considers in determining whether declines in the fair value of fixed maturity securities are other-than-temporary include: (i) the extent to which the market value is below amortized cost; (ii) the duration of time in which there has been a significant decline in value; (iii) fundamental analysis of the liquidity, business prospects and overall financial condition of the issuer; and (iv) market events that could impact credit ratings, economic and business climate, litigation and government actions, and similar external business factors. In order to determine the amount of the credit loss component for corporate debt securities considered other-than-temporarily impaired, a best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected discounted at the security’s effective interest rate is compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. The significant inputs to cash flow projections consider potential debt restructuring terms, projected cash flows available to pay creditors and the Company’s position in the debtor’s overall capital structure.

For

structured investments (e.g., residential mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities and other structured investments), the Company also considers factors such as overall deal structure and its position within the structure, quality of underlying collateral, delinquencies and defaults, loss severities, recoveries, prepayments and cumulative loss projections in assessing potential other-than-temporary impairments of these investments. Based upon these factors, securities that have indicators of potential other-than-temporary impairment are subject to detailed review by management. Securities for which declines are considered temporary continue to be monitored by management until management determines there is no current risk of an other-than-temporary impairment.


Other Investments

Other

investments primarily reflect the Company’s interests in affordable housing partnerships, trading securities, seed money investments, syndicated loans, marketable equity securities and credit card receivables. Affordable housing partnerships and seed money investments are accounted for under the equity method. Trading securities, which primarily include common stocks and bonds, are carried at fair value with unrealized and realized gains (losses) recorded in net investment income. Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in net investment income.

Financing Receivables

Commercial Mortgage Loans, Syndicated Loans and Credit Card Receivables

Commercial

mortgage loans, syndicated loans and credit card receivables are reflected within investments at amortized cost less the allowance for loan losses. Syndicated loans represent the Company’s investment in below investment grade loan syndications. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balances of the loans as earned.

Other Loans

Other

loans primarily consist of policy loans, advisor loans and brokerage margin loans. When originated, policy loan balances do not exceed the cash surrender value of the underlying products. As there is minimal risk of loss related to policy loans, the Company does not record an allowance for loan losses. Policy loans are reflected within investments at the unpaid principal balance, plus accrued interest.

The

Company offers loans to financial advisors primarily for recruiting, transitional cost assistance and retention purposes.

These loans are generally repaid over a five- to nine-year period.

Advisor loans are recorded within receivables at principal less an allowance for loan losses. Interest income is recognized as earned and reflected in other revenues. R

ecoverability of these loans is assessed through analysis of financial advisor retention, loan collection and other criteria. In the event that the financial advisor is no longer affiliated with the Company, any unpaid balance of such loan becomes immediately due.

The

Company’s broker dealer subsidiaries enter into lending arrangements with clients through the normal course of business, which are primarily based on customer margin levels. Margin loans are reported at the unpaid principal balance within receivables. The Company monitors the market value of collateral supporting the margin loans and requests additional collateral when necessary in order to mitigate the risk of loss.

Deposit Receivable

For

each of its reinsurance agreements, the Company determines whether the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability related to insurance risk in accordance with applicable accounting standards. If the Company determines that a reinsurance agreement does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk, the Company records the agreement using the deposit method of accounting. Deposits made are included in receivables. As amounts are received, consistent with the underlying contracts, the deposit receivable is adjusted. The deposit receivable is accreted using the interest method and the accretion is reported in other revenues.

See Note 7 for additional information on the deposit receivable.

Nonaccrual Loans

Generally

, loans are evaluated for or placed on nonaccrual status when either the collection of interest or principal has become


days

past due or is otherwise considered doubtful of collection. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest payments received on loans on nonaccrual status are generally applied to principal unless the remaining principal balance has been determined to be fully collectible.

Commercial

mortgage loans are evaluated for impairment when the loan is considered for nonaccrual status, restructured or foreclosure proceedings are initiated on the property. If it is determined that the fair value is less than the current loan balance, it is written down to fair value less estimated selling costs. Foreclosed property is recorded as real estate owned in other assets.

Allowance for Loan Losses

Management

determines the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on the overall loan portfolio composition, recent and historical loss experience, and other pertinent factors, including when applicable, internal risk ratings, loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios, FICO scores of the borrower, debt service coverage and occupancy rates, along with current economic and market conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates, which may be susceptible to significant change.

The

Company determines the amount of the allowance based on management’s assessment of relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio. The allowance is recorded for homogeneous loan categories on a pool basis, based on an analysis of product mix and risk characteristics of the portfolio, including geographic concentration, bankruptcy experiences, and historical losses, adjusted for current trends and market conditions.

While

the Company attributes portions of the allowance to specific loan pools as part of the allowance estimation process, the entire allowance is available to absorb losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. The allowance is increased through provisions charged to net investment income and reduced/increased by net charge-offs/recoveries.

In

determining the allowance for loan losses for advisor loans, the Company considers its historical collection experience as well as other factors including amounts due at termination, the reasons for the terminated relationship, length of time since termination, and


the former financial advisor’s overall financial position. Concerns regarding the recoverability of these loans primarily arise in the event that the financial advisor is no longer affiliated with the Company. When the review of these factors indicates that further collection activity is highly unlikely, the outstanding balance of the loan is written-off and the related allowance is reduced. The provision for loan losses on advisor loans is recorded in distribution expenses.

Impaired Loans

The

Company considers a loan to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due (both interest and principal) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans may also include loans that have been modified in troubled debt restructurings as a concession to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Management evaluates for impairment all restructured loans and loans with higher impairment risk factors. Factors used by the Company to determine whether all amounts due on commercial mortgage loans will be collected, include but are not limited to, the financial condition of the borrower, performance of the underlying properties, collateral and/or guarantees on the loan, and the borrower’s estimated future ability to pay based on property type and geographic location. The impairment recognized is measured as the excess of the loan’s recorded investment over: (i) the present value of its expected principal and interest payments discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, (ii) the fair value of collateral or (iii) the loan’s observable market price.

Restructured Loans

A

loan is classified as a restructured loan when the Company makes certain concessionary modifications to contractual terms for borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. When the interest rate, minimum payments, and/or due dates have been modified in an attempt to make the loan more affordable to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties, the modification is considered a troubled debt restructuring. Generally, performance prior to the restructuring or significant events that coincide with the restructuring are considered in assessing whether the borrower can meet the new terms which may result in the loan being returned to accrual status at the time of the restructuring or after a performance period. If the borrower’s ability to meet the revised payment schedule is not reasonably assured, the loan remains on nonaccrual status.

Separate Account Assets and Liabilities

Separate

account assets represent funds held for the benefit of and separate account liabilities represent the obligation to the variable annuity contractholders and variable life insurance policyholders who have a contractual right to receive the benefits of their contract or policy and bear the related investment risk. Gains and losses on separate account assets accrue directly to the contractholder or policyholder and are not reported in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Separate account assets are recorded at fair value and separate account liabilities are equal to the assets recognized.

Included in separate account assets and liabilities is the fair value of the pooled pension funds that are offered by Threadneedle.

Restricted and Segregated Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments

Amounts

segregated under federal and other regulations are held in special reserve bank accounts for the exclusive benefit of the Company’s brokerage customers. Cash and cash equivalents included in restricted and segregated cash, cash equivalents and investments are presented as part of cash balances in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Land, Buildings, Equipment and Software

Leases

The Company has operating and finance leases for corporate and field offices. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception or modification. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and corresponding lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the future lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is determined at lease commencement date using a secured rate for a similar term as the period of the lease. Certain lease incentives such as free rent periods are recorded as a reduction of the ROU asset. Lease costs for operating ROU assets is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Certain

leases include one or more options to renew with terms that can extend the lease from

one year

to


years

. The exercise of any lease renewal option is at the sole discretion of the Company. Renewal options are included in the ROU assets and lease liabilities when they either provide an economic incentive to renew or when the costs related to the termination of a lease outweigh the benefits of signing a new lease.

Operating and finance ROU assets are reflected in other assets. Operating lease liabilities and finance lease liabilities are reflected in other liabilities and long-term debt, respectively.


Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill

represents the amount of an acquired company’s acquisition cost in excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually on the measurement date of July 1 and whenever events and circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit. Impairment is the amount carrying value exceeds fair value and is evaluated at the reporting unit level. The Company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether impairment is likely to have occurred. If impairment were to occur, the Company would use the discounted cash flow method, a variation of the income approach.

Intangible

assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives unless they are deemed to have indefinite useful lives. The Company evaluates the definite lived intangible assets remaining useful lives annually and tests for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate. For definite lived intangible assets, impairment to fair value is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable. Indefinite lived intangibles are also tested for impairment annually or whenever circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred.

Goodwill and other intangible assets are reflected in other assets.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Freestanding

derivative instruments are recorded at fair value and are reflected in other assets or other liabilities. The Company’s policy is to not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivatives and collateral arrangements executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on its intended use and the resulting hedge designation, if any. The Company primarily uses derivatives as economic hedges that are not designated as accounting hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The Company occasionally designates derivatives as (i) hedges of changes in the fair value of assets, liabilities, or firm commitments (“fair value hedges”), (ii) hedges of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash flow hedges”), or (iii) hedges of foreign currency exposures of net investments in foreign operations (“net investment hedges in foreign operations”).

Derivative

instruments that are entered into for hedging purposes are designated as such at the time the Company enters into the contract. For all derivative instruments that are designated for hedging activities, the Company documents all of the hedging relationships between the hedge instruments and the hedged items at the inception of the relationships. Management also documents its risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transactions. The Company assesses, at inception and on a quarterly basis, whether derivatives designated as hedges are highly effective in offsetting the fair value or cash flows of hedged items. If it is determined that a derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge, the Company will discontinue the application of hedge accounting.

For

derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as accounting hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in current period earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives are presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations based on the nature and use of the instrument. Changes in fair value of derivatives used as economic hedges are presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations with the corresponding change in the hedged asset or liability.

For

derivative instruments that qualify as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives, as well as changes in the fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments, are recognized on a net basis in current period earnings. The carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted for the change in fair value from the designated hedged risk. If a fair value hedge designation is removed or the hedge is terminated prior to maturity, previous adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged item are recognized into earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item.

For

derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instruments is reported in AOCI and reclassified into earnings when the hedged item or transaction impacts earnings. The amount that is reclassified into earnings is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations with the hedged instrument or transaction impact. Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in current period earnings as a component of net investment income. If a hedge designation is removed or a hedge is terminated prior to maturity, the amount previously recorded in AOCI is reclassified to earnings over the period that the hedged item impacts earnings. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because the forecasted transaction is not expected to occur according to the original strategy, any related amounts previously recorded in AOCI are recognized in earnings immediately.

For

derivative instruments that qualify as net investment hedges in foreign operations, the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recorded in AOCI as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment. Any ineffective portion of the net investment hedges in foreign operations is recognized in net investment income during the period of change.

The

equity component of indexed annuities, indexed universal life (“IUL”) and stock market certificate obligations are considered embedded derivatives. Additionally, certain annuities contain guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit (“GMAB”) and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (“GMWB”) provisions. The GMAB and the non-life contingent benefits associated with GMWB provisions are also considered embedded derivatives.

See Note 15 for information regarding the Company’s fair value measurement of derivative instruments and Note 17 for the impact of derivatives on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.


Deferred Acquisition Costs

The

Company incurs costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance and annuity businesses. The portion of these costs which are incremental and direct to the acquisition of a new or renewal insurance policy or annuity contract are deferred. Significant costs capitalized include sales based compensation related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance policies and annuity contracts, medical inspection costs for successful sales, and a portion of employee compensation and benefit costs based upon the amount of time spent on successful sales. Sales based compensation paid to advisors and employees and third-party distributors is capitalized. Employee compensation and benefits costs which are capitalized relate primarily to sales efforts, underwriting and processing. All other costs which are not incremental direct costs of acquiring an insurance policy or annuity contract are expensed as incurred. The DAC associated with insurance policies or annuity contracts that are significantly modified or internally replaced with another contract are accounted for as contract terminations. These transactions are anticipated in establishing amortization periods and other valuation assumptions.

The

Company monitors other DAC amortization assumptions, such as persistency, mortality, morbidity, interest margin, variable annuity benefit utilization and maintenance expense levels each quarter and, when assessed independently, each could impact the Company’s DAC balances.

The

analysis of DAC balances and the corresponding amortization is a dynamic process that considers all relevant factors and assumptions described previously. Unless the Company’s management identifies a significant deviation over the course of the quarterly monitoring, management reviews and updates these DAC amortization assumptions annually in the third quarter of each year.

Non-Traditional Long-Duration Products

For

non-traditional long-duration products (including variable and fixed deferred annuity contracts, universal life (“UL”) and variable universal life (“VUL”) insurance products), DAC are amortized based on projections of estimated gross profits (“EGPs”) over amortization periods equal to the approximate life of the business.

EGPs

vary based on persistency rates (assumptions at which contractholders and policyholders are expected to surrender, make withdrawals from and make deposits to their contracts), mortality levels, client asset value growth rates (based on equity and bond market performance), variable annuity benefit utilization and interest margins (the spread between earned rates on invested assets and rates credited to contractholder and policyholder accounts) and are management’s best estimates. Management regularly monitors financial market conditions and actual contractholder and policyholder behavior experience and compares them to its assumptions. These assumptions are updated whenever it appears that earlier estimates should be revised. When assumptions are changed, the percentage of EGPs used to amortize DAC might also change. A change in the required amortization percentage is applied retrospectively; an increase in amortization percentage will result in a decrease in the DAC balance and an increase in DAC amortization expense, while a decrease in amortization percentage will result in an increase in the DAC balance and a decrease in DAC amortization expense. The impact on results of operations of changing assumptions can be either positive or negative in any particular period and is reflected in the period in which such changes are made. At each balance sheet date, the DAC balance is adjusted for the effect that would result from the realization of unrealized gains or losses on securities impacting EGPs, with the related change recognized through AOCI.

The

client asset value growth rates are the rates at which variable annuity and VUL insurance contract values invested in separate accounts are assumed to appreciate in the future. The rates used vary by equity and fixed income investments. Management reviews and, where appropriate, adjusts its assumptions with respect to client asset value growth rates on a regular basis. The Company typically uses a five-year mean reversion process as a guideline in setting near-term equity fund growth rates based on a long-term view of financial market performance as well as recent actual performance. The suggested near-term equity fund growth rate is reviewed quarterly to ensure consistency with management’s assessment of anticipated equity market performance. DAC amortization expense recorded in a period when client asset value growth rates exceed management’s near-term estimate will typically be less than in a period when growth rates fall short of management’s near-term estimate.

Traditional Long-Duration Products

For

traditional long-duration products (including traditional life and disability income (“DI”) insurance products), DAC are generally amortized as a percentage of premiums over amortization periods equal to the premium paying period. The assumptions made in calculating the DAC balance and DAC amortization expense are consistent with those used in determining the liabilities.

For

traditional life and DI insurance products, the assumptions provide for adverse deviations in experience and are revised only if management concludes experience will be so adverse that DAC are not recoverable. If management concludes that DAC are not recoverable, DAC are reduced to the amount that is recoverable based on best estimate assumptions and there is a corresponding expense recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Deferred Sales Inducement Costs

Sales

inducement costs consist of bonus interest credits and premium credits added to certain annuity contract and insurance policy values. These benefits are capitalized to the extent they are incremental to amounts that would be credited on similar contracts without the applicable feature. The amounts capitalized are amortized using the same methodology and assumptions used to amortize DAC. DSIC is recorded in other assets, and amortization of DSIC is recorded in benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses.


Reinsurance

The

Company cedes insurance risk to other insurers under reinsurance agreements. The Company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers prior to entering into new reinsurance contracts and on a periodic basis during the contract term.

Reinsurance

premiums paid and benefits received are accounted for consistently with the basis used in accounting for the policies from which risk is reinsured and consistently with the terms of the reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance premiums for traditional life, long term care (“LTC”), DI and auto and home, net of the change in any prepaid reinsurance asset, are reported as a reduction of premiums. UL and VUL reinsurance premiums are reported as a reduction of other revenues. In addition, for UL and VUL insurance policies, the net cost of reinsurance ceded, which represents the discounted amount of the expected cash flows between the reinsurer and the Company, is classified as an asset or contra asset and amortized over the estimated life of the policies in proportion to the estimated gross profits and is subject to retrospective adjustment in a manner similar to retrospective adjustment of DAC. The assumptions used to project the expected cash flows are consistent with those used for DAC valuation for the same contracts. Changes in the net cost of reinsurance are reflected as a component of other revenues. Reinsurance recoveries are reported as components of benefits, claims, losses and settlement expenses.

Insurance

liabilities are reported before the effects of reinsurance. Policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and claims recoverable under reinsurance contracts are recorded within receivables.

The

Company also assumes life insurance and fixed annuity risk from other insurers in limited circumstances. Reinsurance premiums received and benefits paid are accounted for consistently with the basis used in accounting for the policies from which risk is reinsured and consistently with the terms of the reinsurance contracts. Liabilities for assumed business are recorded within policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and claims.

See Note 8 for additional information on reinsurance.

Policyholder Account Balances, Future Policy Benefits and Claims

The

Company establishes reserves to cover the risks associated with non-traditional and traditional long-duration products and short-duration products. Non-traditional long-duration products include variable annuity contracts, fixed annuity contracts and UL and VUL policies. Traditional long-duration products include term life, whole life, DI and LTC insurance products. Prior to the sale of Ameriprise Auto & Home (“AAH”), reserves for short-duration products were established to provide adequately for incurred losses primarily related to auto and home policies. See Note 19 for additional information on the sale of AAH.

Guarantees

accounted for as insurance liabilities include guaranteed minimum death benefit (“GMDB”), gain gross-up (“GGU”), guaranteed minimum income benefit (“GMIB”) and the life contingent benefits associated with GMWB. In addition, UL and VUL policies with product features that result in profits followed by losses are accounted for as insurance liabilities.

Guarantees

accounted for as embedded derivatives include GMAB and the non-life contingent benefits associated with GMWB. In addition, the portion of indexed annuities and IUL policies allocated to the indexed account is accounted for as an embedded derivative.

Changes

in future policy benefits and claims are reflected in earnings in the period adjustments are made. Where applicable, benefit amounts expected to be recoverable from reinsurance companies who share in the risk are separately recorded as reinsurance recoverable within receivables.

Non-Traditional Long-Duration Products

The

liabilities for non-traditional long-duration products include fixed account values on variable and fixed annuities and UL and VUL policies, liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with variable annuities and embedded derivatives for variable annuities, indexed annuities and IUL products.

Liabilities

for fixed account values on variable and fixed deferred annuities and UL and VUL policies are equal to accumulation values, which are the cumulative gross deposits and credited interest less withdrawals and various charges.

A

portion of the Company’s UL and VUL policies have product features that result in profits followed by losses from the insurance component of the contract. These profits followed by losses can be generated by the cost structure of the product or secondary guarantees in the contract. The secondary guarantee ensures that, subject to specified conditions, the policy will not terminate and will continue to provide a death benefit even if there is insufficient policy value to cover the monthly deductions and charges. The liability for these future losses is determined by estimating the death benefits in excess of account value and recognizing the excess over the estimated life based on expected assessments (e.g. cost of insurance charges, contractual administrative charges, similar fees and investment margin). See Note 12 for information regarding the liability for contracts with secondary guarantees.

Liabilities

for indexed annuity products and indexed accounts of IUL products are equal to the accumulation of host contract values covering guaranteed benefits and the fair value of embedded equity options.

The

GMDB and GGU liability is determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits in excess of the projected contract accumulation value and recognizing the excess over the estimated life based on expected assessments (e.g., mortality and expense fees, contractual administrative charges and similar fees).

If

elected by the contract owner and after a stipulated waiting period from contract issuance, a GMIB guarantees a minimum lifetime annuity based on a specified rate of contract accumulation value growth and predetermined annuity purchase rates. The GMIB liability


is determined each period by estimating the expected value of annuitization benefits in excess of the projected contract accumulation

value

at the date of annuitization and recognizing the excess over the estimated life based on expected assessments.

The

liability for the life contingent benefits associated with GMWB provisions is determined by estimating the expected value of benefits that are contingent upon survival after the account value is equal to zero and recognizing the benefits over the estimated life

based

on expected assessments (e.g., mortality and expense fees, contractual administrative charges and similar fees).

In

determining the liabilities for GMDB, GGU, GMIB and the life contingent benefits associated with GMWB, the Company projects these benefits and contract assessments using actuarial models to simulate various equity market scenarios. Significant assumptions made in projecting future benefits and assessments relate to customer asset value growth rates, mortality, persistency, benefit utilization and investment margins and are consistent with those used for DAC valuation for the same contracts. As with DAC, unless the Company’s management identifies a significant deviation over the course of quarterly monitoring, management reviews and updates these assumptions annually in the third quarter of each year.

See

Note 12 for information regarding variable annuity guarantees.

Liabilities for fixed annuities in a benefit or payout status utilize assumptions established as of the date the payout phase is initiated. The liabilities are the present value of future estimated payments reduced for mortality (which is based on industry mortality tables with modifications based on the Company’s experience) and discounted with interest rates.

Embedded Derivatives

The

fair value of embedded derivatives related to GMAB and the non-life contingent benefits associated with GMWB provisions fluctuate based on equity, interest rate and credit markets and the estimate of the Company’s nonperformance risk, which can cause these embedded derivatives to be either an asset or a liability. The fair value of embedded derivatives related to indexed annuities and IUL fluctuate based on equity markets and interest rates and the estimate of the Company’s nonperformance risk and is a liability. See Note 15 for information regarding the fair value measurement of embedded derivatives.

Traditional Long-Duration Products

The

liabilities for traditional long-duration products include liabilities for unpaid amounts on reported claims, estimates of benefits payable on claims incurred but not yet reported and estimates of benefits that will become payable on term life, whole life, DI and LTC policies as claims are incurred in the future.

Liabilities

for unpaid amounts on reported life insurance claims are equal to the death benefits payable under the policies.

Liabilities

for unpaid amounts on reported DI and LTC claims include any periodic or other benefit amounts due and accrued, along with estimates of the present value of obligations for continuing benefit payments. These unpaid amounts are calculated using anticipated claim continuance rates based on established industry tables, adjusted as appropriate for the Company’s experience. The discount rates used to calculate present values are based on average interest rates earned on assets supporting the liability for unpaid amounts.

Liabilities

for estimated benefits payable on claims that have been incurred but not yet reported are based on periodic analysis of the actual time lag between when a claim occurs and when it is reported.

Liabilities

for estimates of benefits that will become payable on future claims on term life, whole life and DI insurance policies are based on the net level premium and LTC policies are based on a gross premium valuation reflecting management’s current best estimate assumptions. Net level premium includes anticipated premium payments, mortality and morbidity rates, policy persistency and interest rates earned on assets supporting the liability. Gross premium valuation includes expected premium rate increases, benefit reductions, morbidity rates, policy persistency and interest rates earned on assets supporting the liability. Anticipated mortality and morbidity rates are based on established industry mortality and morbidity tables, with modifications based on the Company’s experience. Anticipated premium payments and persistency rates vary by policy form, issue age, policy duration and certain other pricing factors.

For

term life, whole life, DI and LTC policies, the Company utilizes best estimate assumptions as of the date the policy is issued with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation, as appropriate. After the liabilities are initially established, management performs premium deficiency tests using best estimate assumptions without provisions for adverse deviation annually in the third quarter of each year unless management identifies a material deviation over the course of quarterly monitoring. If the liabilities determined based on these best estimate assumptions are greater than the net reserves (i.e., GAAP reserves net of any DAC balance), the existing net reserves are adjusted by first reducing the DAC balance by the amount of the deficiency or to zero through a charge to current period earnings. If the deficiency is more than the DAC balance, then the net reserves are increased by the excess through a charge to current period earnings. If a premium deficiency is recognized, the assumptions as of the date of the loss recognition are locked in and used in subsequent periods. The assumptions for LTC insurance products are management’s best estimate as of the date of loss recognition and thus no longer provide for adverse deviations in experience.

See Note 11 for information regarding the liabilities for traditional long-duration products.

Short-Duration Products

Prior

to the sale of AAH, liabilities for short-duration products primarily included auto and home reserves comprised of amounts determined from loss reports on individual claims, as well as amounts based on historical loss experience for losses incurred but not


yet reported. Such liabilities were based on estimates. The Company’s methods for making such estimates and for establishing the resulting liabilities were continually reviewed, and any adjustments were reflected in earnings in the period such adjustments were made.

Unearned Revenue Liability

The

Company’s UL and VUL policies require payment of fees or other policyholder assessments in advance for services to be provided in future periods. These charges are deferred as unearned revenue and amortized using EGPs, similar to DAC. The unearned revenue liability is recorded in other liabilities and the amortization is recorded in other revenues.

For clients who pay financial planning fees prior to the advisor’s delivery of the financial plan, the financial planning fees received in advance are deferred as unearned revenue until the plan is delivered to the client.

Share-Based Compensation

The

Company measures and recognizes the cost of share-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the grant-date fair value of the award and recognizes the expense (net of estimated forfeitures) on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Excess tax benefits or deficiencies are created upon distribution or exercise of awards and are recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. The fair value of each option is estimated on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company recognizes the cost of performance share units granted to the Company’s Executive Leadership Team on a fair value basis until fully vested.

Income Taxes

The

Company’s provision for income taxes represents the net amount of income taxes that the Company expects to pay or to receive from various taxing jurisdictions in connection with its operations. The Company provides for income taxes based on amounts that the Company believes it will ultimately owe taking into account the recognition and measurement for uncertain tax positions. Inherent in the provision for income taxes are estimates and judgments regarding the tax treatment of certain items.

In

connection with the provision for income taxes, the Consolidated Financial Statements reflect certain amounts related to deferred tax assets and liabilities, which result from temporary differences between the assets and liabilities measured for financial statement purposes versus the assets and liabilities measured for tax return purposes.

The

Company is required to establish a valuation allowance for any portion of its deferred tax assets that management believes will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining if a valuation allowance should be established and the amount of such allowance if required. Factors used in making this determination include estimates relating to the performance of the business. Consideration is given to, among other things in making this determination: (i) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards; (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; (iii) taxable income in prior carryback years; and (iv) tax planning strategies. Management may need to identify and implement appropriate planning strategies to ensure its ability to realize deferred tax assets and reduce the likelihood of the establishment of a valuation allowance with respect to such assets. See Note 24 for additional information on the Company’s valuation allowance.

Changes

in tax rates and tax law are accounted for in the period of enactment.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effect of a change in tax laws or rates and the effect is included in income. See Note 24 for further discussion on the enactment of the

legislation commonly referred to as the

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) and the impact to the Company’s provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Revenue Recognition

See Note 4 for discussion of accounting policies on revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2014-09”). The following discussion includes the Company’s accounting policies on recognition of revenues outside the scope of ASU 2014-09.

Mortality

and expense risk fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the fair value of assets held in separate accounts and recognized when assessed.

Interest income is accrued as earned using the effective interest method, which makes an adjustment of the yield for security premiums and discounts on all performing fixed maturity securities classified as Available-for-Sale so that the related security or loan recognizes a constant rate of return on the outstanding balance throughout its term.

When actual prepayments differ significantly from originally anticipated prepayments, the retrospective effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date

and updated future payment assumptions

and a catch-up adjustment is recorded in the current period. In addition, the new effective yield, which reflects anticipated future payments, is used prospectively. Realized gains and losses on securities, other than trading securities and equity method investments, are recognized using the specific identification method on a trade date basis.

Prior to the sale of AAH, premiums on auto and home insurance were net of reinsurance premiums and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Premiums on traditional life, health insurance and immediate annuities with a life contingent feature are net of reinsurance ceded and are recognized as revenue when due.

Variable annuity guaranteed benefit rider charges and cost of insurance charges on UL and VUL insurance (net of reinsurance premiums and cost of reinsurance for universal life insurance products) are recognized as revenue when assessed.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Adoption of New Accounting Standards

Leases – Recognition of Lease Assets and Liabilities on Balance Sheet

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) updated the accounting standards for leases. The update was issued to increase transparency and comparability for the accounting of lease transactions. The standard requires most lease transactions for lessees to be recorded on the balance sheet as lease assets and lease liabilities and both quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements. The standard was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Entities had the option to adopt the standard using a modified retrospective approach at either the beginning of the earliest period presented or as of the date of adoption. The Company adopted the standard using a modified retrospective approach as of January 1, 2019. The Company also elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the accounting standard that allows entities to carryforward their historical lease classification and to not reassess contracts for embedded leases among other things. The Company recorded a right-of-use asset of

$


million

and a corresponding lease liability of

$


million

substantially related to real estate leases. The amount the lease liability exceeds the right-of-use asset primarily reflects lease incentives recorded as a reduction of the right-of-use asset that were previously recorded as a liability. The adoption of the standard did not have other material impacts on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. See Note 18 for additional disclosures on leases.

Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income – Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

In

February 2018, the FASB updated the accounting standards related to the presentation of tax effects stranded in AOCI. The update allows a reclassification from AOCI to retained earnings for tax effects stranded in AOCI resulting from the Tax Act. The election of the update was optional. The update was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Entities could record the impacts either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Act is recognized. The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2019 and elected not to reclassify the stranded tax effects in AOCI.

Derivatives and Hedging – Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities

In

August 2017, the FASB updated the accounting standards to amend the hedge accounting recognition and presentation requirements. The objectives of the update are to better align the financial reporting of hedging relationships to the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities and simplify the application of the hedge accounting guidance. The update also adds new disclosures and amends existing disclosure requirements. The standard was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and was required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis. The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2019. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Receivables – Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs – Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities

In

March 2017, the FASB updated the accounting standards to shorten the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium. Under previous guidance, premiums were generally amortized over the contractual life of the security. The amendments require the premium to be amortized to the earliest call date. The update applies to securities with explicit, non-contingent call features that are callable at fixed prices and on preset dates. The standard was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and was required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2019. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In

May 2014, the FASB updated the accounting standards for revenue from contracts with customers. The update provides a five-step

revenue

recognition model for all revenue arising from contracts with customers and affects all entities that enter into contracts to provide goods or services to their customers (unless the contracts are in the scope of other standards). The standard also updates the accounting for certain costs associated with obtaining and fulfilling a customer contract and requires disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information that enables users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The standard was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The standard was permitted to be applied retrospectively for all periods presented or retrospectively with a cumulative-effect adjustment at the date of adoption. The Company adopted the revenue recognition guidance on a retrospective basis on January 1, 2018. The update does not apply to revenue associated with the manufacturing of insurance and annuity products or financial instruments as these revenues are in the scope of other standards. Therefore, the update did not have an impact on these revenues. The Company’s implementation efforts included the identification of revenue within the guidance and the review of the customer contracts to determine the Company’s performance obligation and the associated timing of each performance obligation. The Company determined that certain payments received primarily related to franchise advisor fees should be presented as revenue rather than a reduction of expense. The impact of the change was an increase to revenues of

$


million

and an increase to expenses of

$


million

for the year ended

December 31, 2017

. See Note 4 for new disclosures on revenue from contracts with customers.


Financial Instruments – Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

In January 2016, the FASB updated the accounting standards on the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The update requires entities to carry marketable equity securities, excluding investments in securities that qualify for the equity method of accounting, at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in net income each reporting period. The update affects other aspects of accounting for equity instruments, as well as the accounting for financial liabilities utilizing the fair value option. The update eliminates the requirement to disclose the methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial assets or liabilities held at cost on the balance sheet and requires entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of these financial instruments. The standard was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2018 using a modified retrospective approach. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Compensation – Retirement Benefits – Defined Benefit Plans – General – Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans

In

August 2018, the FASB updated the accounting standards related to disclosures for sponsors of defined benefit plans. The update requires disclosure of the weighted-average interest crediting rate for cash balance plans and an explanation of the reasons for significant gains and losses related to changes in the benefit obligation for the period. The update also eliminates the disclosure of the amounts in AOCI expected to be recognized as components of net period benefit cost over the next fiscal year. The update is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2020, and should be applied retrospectively. The Company early adopted the standard in the fourth quarter of 2018 on a retrospective basis. The adoption did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Fair Value Measurement – Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement

In

August 2018, the FASB updated the accounting standards related to disclosures for fair value measurements. The update eliminates the following disclosures: 1) the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, 2) the policy of timing of transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy, and 3) the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. The new disclosures include changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in OCI for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements of instruments held at the end of the reporting period and the range and weighted average used to develop significant unobservable inputs and how the weighted average was calculated. The new disclosures are required on a prospective basis; all other provisions should be applied retrospectively. The update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for the entire standard or only the provisions to eliminate or modify disclosure requirements. The Company early adopted the provisions of the standard to eliminate or modify disclosure requirements in the fourth quarter of 2018. The update does not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Compensation – Stock Compensation

In

March 2016, the FASB updated the accounting standards related to employee share-based payments. The update requires all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. This change is required to be applied prospectively to excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies resulting from settlements after the date of adoption. No adjustment is recorded for any excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies previously recorded in additional paid in capital. The update also requires excess tax benefits to be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows. This provision can be applied on either a prospective or retrospective basis. The update permits entities to make an accounting policy election to recognize forfeitures as they occur rather than estimating forfeitures to determine the recognition of expense for share-based payment awards. The standard was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2017 on a prospective basis, except for the cash flow statement provision, which the Company applied on a retrospective basis. During periods in which the settlement date value differs materially from the grant date fair value of certain share-based payment awards, the Company may experience volatility in income tax recognized in its consolidated results of operations. During the year ended

December 31, 2017

, the Company recognized net excess tax benefits of

$


million

as a reduction to the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company maintained its accounting policy of estimating forfeitures. As a result of the adoption of the standard, net excess tax benefits of

$


million

for the year ended

December 31, 2017

are included in the Other, net line within operating cash flows on the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows.

Future Adoption of New Accounting Standards

Income Taxes – Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes

In

December 2019, the FASB updated the accounting standards to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The update eliminates certain exceptions to accounting principles related to intraperiod tax allocation (prospective basis), deferred tax liabilities related to outside basis differences (modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption) and year-to-date losses in interim periods (prospective basis). The update also amends existing guidance related to situations when an entity receives a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill (prospective basis), allocation of income tax expense when members of a consolidated tax filing group issue separate financial statements (retrospective basis for all periods presented), interim recognition of enactment of tax laws or rate changes (prospective basis) and franchise taxes and other taxes partially based on income (retrospective basis for all periods presented or a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption). The standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The method of adoption is noted parenthetically after each amendment above.


The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

Financial Services – Insurance – Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts

In

August 2018, the FASB updated the accounting standard related to long-duration insurance contracts. The guidance revises key elements of the measurement models and disclosure requirements for long-duration insurance contracts issued by insurers and reinsurers.

The

guidance establishes a significant new category of benefit features called market risk benefits that protect the contractholder from other-than-nominal capital market risk and expose the insurer to that risk. Insurers will have to measure market risk benefits at fair value. Market risk benefits include variable annuity guaranteed benefits (i.e. guaranteed minimum death, withdrawal, withdrawal for life, accumulation and income benefits). The portion of the change in fair value attributable to a change in the instrument-specific credit risk of market risk benefits in a liability position will be recorded in OCI.

Significant changes also relate to the measurement of the liability for future policy benefits for nonparticipating traditional long-duration insurance contracts and immediate annuities with a life contingent feature include the following:

•

Insurers will be required to review and update the cash flow assumptions used to measure the liability for future policy benefits rather than using assumptions locked in at contract inception. The review of assumptions to measure the liability for all future policy benefits will be required annually at the same time each year, or more frequently if suggested by experience. The effect of updating assumptions will be measured on a retrospective catch-up basis and presented separate from the ongoing policyholder benefit expense in the statement of operations in the period the update is made. This new unlocking process will be required for the Company’s term and whole life insurance, disability income, long term care insurance and immediate annuities with a life contingent feature.

•

The discount rate used to measure the liability for future policy benefits will be standardized. The current requirement to use a discount rate reflecting expected investment yields will change to an upper-medium grade (low credit risk) fixed income corporate instrument yield (generally interpreted as an “A” rating) reflecting the duration characteristics of the liability. Entities will be required to update the discount rate at each reporting date with the effect of discount rate changes reflected in OCI.

•

The current premium deficiency test is being replaced with a net premium ratio cap of 100%. If the net premium ratio (i.e. the ratio of the present value of total expected benefits and related expenses to the present value of total expected premiums) exceeds 100%, insurers are required to recognize a loss in the statement of operations in the period. Contracts from different issue years will no longer be permitted to be grouped to determine contracts in a loss position.

In

addition, the update requires DAC and DSIC relating to all long-duration contracts and most investment contracts to be amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the contract independent of profit emergence. Under the new guidance, interest will not accrue to the deferred balance and DAC and DSIC will not be subject to an impairment test.

The

update requires significant additional disclosures, including disaggregated rollforwards of the liability for future policy benefits, policyholder account balances, market risk benefits, DAC and DSIC, as well as qualitative and quantitative information about expected cash flows, estimates and assumptions. The update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. The standard should be applied to the liability for future policy benefits and DAC and DSIC on a modified retrospective basis and applied to market risk benefits on a retrospective basis with the option to apply full retrospective transition if certain criteria are met. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on its consolidated results of operations, financial condition and disclosures.

Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software – Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract

In

August 2018, the FASB updated the accounting standards related to customer’s accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement (“CCA”) that is a service contract. The update requires implementation costs for a CCA to be evaluated for capitalization using the same approach as implementation costs associated with internal-use software. The update also addresses presentation, measurement and impairment of capitalized implementation costs in a CCA that is a service contract. The update requires new disclosures on the nature of hosting arrangements that are service contracts, significant judgements made when applying the guidance and quantitative disclosures, including amounts capitalized, amortized and impaired. The update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. The Company adopted the standard using a prospective approach on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment

In

January 2017, the FASB updated the accounting standards to simplify the accounting for goodwill impairment. The update removes the hypothetical purchase price allocation (Step 2) of the goodwill impairment test. Goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value. The standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and should be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.


Financial Instruments – Credit Losses – Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

In

June 2016, the FASB updated the accounting standards related to accounting for credit losses on certain types of financial instruments. The update replaces the current incurred loss model for estimating credit losses with a new model that requires an entity to estimate the credit losses expected over the life of the asset. Generally, the initial estimate of the expected credit losses and subsequent changes in the estimate will be reported in current period earnings and recorded through an allowance for credit losses on the balance sheet. The current credit loss model for Available-for-Sale debt securities does not change; however, the credit loss calculation and subsequent recoveries are required to be recorded through an allowance. The standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. A modified retrospective cumulative adjustment to retained earnings should be recorded as of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective for loans, receivables, and other financial instruments subject to the new expected credit loss model. Prospective adoption is required for establishing an allowance related to Available-for-Sale debt securities, certain beneficial interests, and financial assets purchased with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination. The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

The following tables present revenue disaggregated by segment on an adjusted operating basis with a reconciliation of segment revenues to those reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations:



(1)

Revenues not included in the scope of the revenue from contracts with customers standard. The amounts primarily consist of revenue associated with insurance and annuity products or financial instruments.

Prior period revenues for the Protection and Corporate segments in the table above have been restated to reflect the transfer of AAH results to the Corporate segment in the first quarter of 2019. See Note 19 for additional information on the sale of AAH.

The following discussion describes the nature, timing, and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows arising from the Company’s contracts with customers on a consolidated basis.

Management and Financial Advice Fees

Asset Management Fees

The Company earns revenue for performing asset management services for retail and institutional clients. The revenue is earned based on a fixed or tiered rate applied, as a percentage, to assets under management. Assets under management vary with market fluctuations and client behavior. The asset management performance obligation is considered a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and are satisfied each day over the contract term. Asset management fees are accrued, invoiced and collected on a monthly or quarterly basis.

The Company’s asset management contracts for Open Ended Investment Companies (“OEICs”) in the UK and Société d'Investissement à Capital Variable (“SICAVs”) in Europe include performance obligations for asset management and fund distribution services. The amounts received for these services are reported as management and financial advice fees. The revenue recognition pattern is the same for both performance obligations as the fund distribution services revenue is variably constrained due to factors outside the Company’s control including market volatility and client behavior (such as how long clients hold their investment) and not recognized until assets under management are known.


The Company may also earn performance-based management fees on institutional accounts, hedge funds, collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), OEICs, SICAVs and property funds based on a percentage of account returns in excess of either a benchmark index or a contractually specified level. This revenue is variable and impacted primarily by the performance of the assets being managed compared to the benchmark index or contractually specified level. The revenue is not recognized until it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. Performance-based management fees are invoiced on a quarterly or annual basis.

Advisory Fees

The Company earns revenue for performing investment advisory services for certain brokerage customer’s discretionary and non-discretionary managed accounts. The revenue is earned based on a contractual fixed rate applied, as a percentage, to the market value of assets held in the account. The investment advisory performance obligation is considered a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and are satisfied each day over the contract term. Advisory fees are accrued daily and invoiced or charged on a monthly or quarterly basis.

Financial Planning Fees

The Company earns revenue for providing financial plans to its clients. The revenue earned for each financial plan is either a fixed fee (received monthly, quarterly or annually) or a variable fee (received monthly or quarterly) based on a contractual fixed rate applied, as a percentage, to assets held in a client’s investment advisory account. The financial planning fee is based on the complexity of a client’s financial and life situation and his or her advisor’s experience. The performance obligation is satisfied at the time the financial plan is delivered to the customer. The Company records a contract liability for the unearned revenue when cash is received before the plan is delivered. The financial plan contracts with clients are annual contracts. Amounts recorded as a contract liability are recognized as revenue when the financial plan is delivered, which occurs within the annual contract period.

For fixed fee arrangements, revenue is recognized when the financial plan is delivered. The Company accrues revenue for any amounts that have not been received at the time the financial plan is delivered.

For variable fee arrangements, revenue is recognized for cash that has been received when the financial plan is delivered. The amount received after the plan is delivered is variably constrained due to factors outside the Company’s control including market volatility and client behavior. The revenue is recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur that is generally each month or quarter end as the advisory account balance uncertainty is resolved.

Contract liabilities for financial planning fees, which are included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were

$


million

and

$


million

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

The Company pays sales commissions to advisors when a new financial planning contract is obtained or when an existing contract is renewed. The sales commissions paid to the advisors prior to financial plan delivery are considered costs to obtain a contract with a customer and are initially capitalized. When the performance obligation to deliver the financial plan is satisfied, the commission is recognized as distribution expense. Capitalized costs to obtain these contracts are reported in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and were

$


million

and

$


million

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

Transaction and Other Fees

The Company earns revenue for providing customer support, shareholder and administrative services (including transfer agent services) for affiliated mutual funds and networking, sub-accounting and administrative services for unaffiliated mutual funds. The Company also receives revenue for providing custodial services and account maintenance services on brokerage and retirement accounts that are not included in an advisory relationship. Transfer agent and administrative revenue is earned based on either a fixed rate applied, as a percentage, to assets under management or an annual fixed fee for each fund position. Networking and sub-accounting revenue is earned based on either an annual fixed fee for each account or an annual fixed fee for each fund position. Custodial and account maintenance revenue is generally earned based on a quarterly or annual fixed fee for each account. Each of the customer support and administrative services performance obligations are considered a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and are satisfied each day over the contract term. Transaction and other fees (other than custodial service fees) are invoiced or charged to brokerage accounts on a monthly or quarterly basis. Custodial service fees are invoiced or charged to brokerage accounts on an annual basis. Contract liabilities for custodial service fees, which are included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were

nil

as of both

December 31, 2019

and


.

The Company earns revenue for providing trade execution services to franchise advisors. The trade execution performance obligation is satisfied at the time of each trade and the revenue is primarily earned based on a fixed fee per trade. These fees are invoiced and collected on a semi-monthly basis.

Distribution Fees

Mutual Funds and Insurance and Annuity Products

The Company earns revenue for selling affiliated and unaffiliated mutual funds, fixed and variable annuities and insurance products. The performance obligation is satisfied at the time of each individual sale. A portion of the revenue is based on a fixed rate applied, as a percentage, to amounts invested at the time of sale. The remaining revenue is recognized over the time the client owns the investment or holds the contract and is generally earned based on a fixed rate applied, as a percentage, to the net asset value of the fund, or the value of the insurance policy or annuity contract. The ongoing revenue is not recognized at the time of sale because it is variably constrained due to factors outside the Company’s control including market volatility and client behavior (such as how long


clients hold their investment, insurance policy or annuity contract). This ongoing revenue may be recognized for many years after the initial sale. The revenue will not be recognized until it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur.

The Company earns revenue for providing unaffiliated partners an opportunity to educate the Company’s advisors or to support availability and distribution of their products on the Company’s platforms. These payments allow the outside parties to train and support the advisors, explain the features of their products and distribute marketing and educational materials, and support trading and operational systems necessary to enable the Company’s client servicing and production distribution efforts. The Company earns revenue for placing and maintaining unaffiliated fund partners and insurance companies’ products on the Company’s sales platform (subject to the Company’s due diligence standards). The revenue is primarily earned based on a fixed fee or a fixed rate applied, as a percentage, to the market value of assets invested. These performance obligations are considered a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and are satisfied each day over the contract term. These fees are invoiced and collected on monthly basis.

Other Products

The Company earns revenue for selling unaffiliated alternative products. The performance obligation is satisfied at the time of each individual sale. A portion of the revenue is based on a fixed rate applied, as a percentage, to amounts invested at the time of sale. The remaining revenue is recognized over the time the client owns the investment and is earned generally based on a fixed rate applied, as a percentage, to the market value of the investment. The ongoing revenue is not recognized at the time of sale because it is variably constrained due to factors outside the Company’s control including market volatility and client behavior (such as how long clients hold their investment). The revenue will not be recognized until it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur.

The Company earns revenue from brokerage clients for the execution of requested trades. The performance obligation is satisfied at the time of trade execution and amounts are received on the settlement date. The revenue varies for each trade based on various factors that include the type of investment, dollar amount of the trade and how the trade is executed (online or broker assisted).

The Company earns revenue for placing clients’ deposits in its brokerage sweep program with third-party banks. The amount received from the third-party banks is impacted by short-term interest rates. The performance obligation with the financial institutions that participate in the sweep program is considered a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and are satisfied each day over the contract term. The revenue is earned daily and settled monthly based on a rate applied, as a percentage, to the deposits placed.

Other Revenues

The Company earns revenue from fees charged to franchise advisors for providing various services the advisors need to manage and grow their practices. The primary services include: licensing of intellectual property and software, compliance supervision, insurance coverage, technology services and support, consulting and other services. The services are either provided by the Company or third- party providers. The Company controls the services provided by third parties as it has the right to direct the third parties to perform the services, is primarily responsible for performing the services and sets the prices the advisors are charged. The Company recognizes revenue for the gross amount of the fees received from the advisors. The fees are primarily collected monthly as a reduction of commission payments.

Intellectual property and software licenses, along with compliance supervision, insurance coverage, and technology services and support are primarily earned based on a monthly fixed fee. These services are considered a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and are satisfied each day over the contract term. The consulting and other services performance obligations are satisfied as the services are delivered and revenue is earned based upon the level of service requested. Prior to the implementation of the revenue recognition standard, fees received from the advisors for software licenses, compliance supervision, technology services and support, consulting, and other services were recorded as a reduction to the Company’s expenses to provide the services and totaled

$


million

for the year ended

December 31, 2017

.

Receivables

Receivables for revenue from contracts with customers are recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied and the Company has an unconditional right to the revenue. Receivables related to revenues from contracts with customers were

$


million

and

$


million

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

5.

Variable Interest Entities

The Company provides asset management services to investment entities which are considered to be VIEs, such as CLOs, hedge funds and other private funds, property funds, and certain non-U.S. series funds (OEICs and SICAVs) (collectively, “investment entities”), which are sponsored by the Company. In addition, the Company invests in structured investments other than CLOs and certain affordable housing partnerships which are considered VIEs. The Company consolidates certain investment entities (collectively, “consolidated investment entities”) if the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Other than future funding commitments that are legally binding, the Company has no obligation to provide financial or other support to the non-consolidated VIEs beyond its investment nor has the Company provided any support to these entities. See Note 26 for information on future funding commitments.

See Note 2 for further discussion of the Company’s accounting policy on consolidation.

CLOs

CLOs are asset backed financing entities collateralized by a pool of assets, primarily syndicated loans and, to a lesser extent, high-yield bonds. Multiple tranches of debt securities are issued by a CLO, offering investors various maturity and credit risk


characteristics. The debt securities issued by the CLOs are non-recourse to the Company. The CLO’s debt holders have recourse only to the assets of the CLO. The assets of the CLOs cannot be used by the Company. Scheduled debt payments are based on the performance of the CLO’s collateral pool. The Company earns management fees from the CLOs based on the value of the CLO’s collateral pool and, in certain instances, may also receive incentive fees. The fee arrangement is at market and commensurate with the level of effort required to provide those services. The Company has invested in a portion of the unrated, junior subordinated notes of certain CLOs. The Company consolidates certain CLOs where it is the primary beneficiary and has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the CLO.

The Company's maximum exposure to loss with respect to non-consolidated CLOs is limited to its amortized cost, which was

$


million

and

$


million

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively. The Company classifies these investments as Available-for-Sale securities. See Note 6 for additional information on these investments.

Property Funds

The Company provides investment advice and related services to property funds, some of which are considered VIEs. For investment management services, the Company generally earns management fees based on the market value of assets under management, and in certain instances may also receive performance-based fees. The fee arrangement is at market and commensurate with the level of effort required to provide those services. The Company does not have a significant economic interest and is not required to consolidate  any of the property funds. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss with respect to its investment in these entities is limited to its carrying value. The carrying value of the Company’s investment in property funds is reflected in other investments and was

$


million

and

$


million

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

Hedge Funds and other Private Funds

The Company does not consolidate hedge funds and other private funds which are sponsored by the Company and considered VIEs. For investment management services, the Company earns management fees based on the market value of assets under management, and in certain instances may also receive performance-based fees. The fee arrangement is at market and commensurate with the level of effort required to provide those services and the Company does not have a significant economic interest in any fund. The Company's maximum exposure to loss with respect to its investment in these entities is limited to its carrying value. The carrying value of the Company’s investment in these entities is reflected in other investments and was

nil

and

$


million

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

Non-U.S. Series Funds

The Company manages non-U.S. series funds, which are considered VIEs. For investment management services, the Company earns management fees based on the market value of assets under management, and in certain instances may also receive performance-based fees. The fee arrangement is at market and commensurate with the level of effort required to provide those services. The Company does not consolidate these funds and its maximum exposure to loss is limited to its carrying value. The carrying value of the Company’s investment in these funds is reflected in other investments and was

$


million

and

$


million

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

Affordable Housing Partnerships and Other Real Estate Partnerships

The Company is a limited partner in affordable housing partnerships that qualify for government-sponsored low income housing tax credit programs and partnerships that invest in multi-family residential properties that were originally developed with an affordable housing component. The Company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary and therefore does not consolidate these partnerships.

A majority of the limited partnerships are VIEs. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its investment in the VIEs is limited to the carrying value. The carrying value is reflected in other investments and was

$


million

and

$


million

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively. The Company had a

$


million

and a

$


million

liability recorded as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively, related to original purchase commitments not yet remitted to the VIEs. The Company has not provided any additional support and is not contractually obligated to provide additional support to the VIEs beyond the funding commitments.

Structured Investments

The Company invests in structured investments which are considered VIEs for which it is not the sponsor. These structured investments typically invest in fixed income instruments and are managed by third parties and include asset backed securities, commercial and residential mortgage backed securities. The Company classifies these investments as Available-for-Sale securities. The Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these structures due to the size of the Company’s investment in the entities and position in the capital structure of these entities. The Company's maximum exposure to loss as a result of its investment in these structured investments is limited to its amortized cost. See Note 6 for additional information on these structured investments.


Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities

The Company categorizes its fair value measurements according to a three-level hierarchy. See Note 15 for the definition of the three levels of the fair value hierarchy.

The following tables present the balances of assets and liabilities held by consolidated investment entities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

(1)

The carrying value of the CLOs’ debt is set equal to the fair value of the CLOs’ assets. The estimated fair value of the CLOs’ debt was

$

1.7

billion

as of both

December 31, 2019

and


.


The following tables provide a summary of changes in Level 3 assets and liabilities held by consolidated investment entities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

(1)

Included in net investment income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Securities and loans transferred from Level 3 primarily represent assets with fair values that are now obtained from a third-party pricing service with observable inputs or priced in active markets. Securities and loans transferred to Level 3 represent assets with fair values that are now based on a single non-binding broker quote.

All Level 3 measurements as of

December 31, 2019

and


were obtained from non-binding broker quotes where unobservable inputs utilized in the fair value calculation are not reasonably available to the Company.


Determination of Fair Value

Assets

Investments

The fair value of syndicated loans obtained from third-party pricing services using a market approach with observable inputs is classified as Level 2. The fair value of syndicated loans obtained from third-party pricing services with a single non-binding broker quote as the underlying valuation source is classified as Level 3. The underlying inputs used in non-binding broker quotes are not readily available to the Company.

See Note 15 for a description of the Company’s determination of the fair value of corporate debt securities, common stocks and other investments.

Receivables

For receivables of the consolidated CLOs, the carrying value approximates fair value as the nature of these assets has historically been short term and the receivables have been collectible. The fair value of these receivables is classified as Level 2.

Liabilities

Debt

The fair value of the CLOs’ assets, typically syndicated bank loans, is more observable than the fair value of the CLOs’ debt tranches for which market activity is limited and less transparent. As a result, the fair value of the CLOs’ debt is set equal to the fair value of the CLOs’ assets and is classified as Level 2.

Other Liabilities

Other liabilities consist primarily of securities purchased but not yet settled held by consolidated CLOs. The carrying value approximates fair value as the nature of these liabilities has historically been short term. The fair value of these liabilities is classified as Level 2.

Fair Value Option

The

Company has elected the fair value option for the financial assets and liabilities of the consolidated CLOs. Management believes that the use of the fair value option better matches the changes in fair value of assets and liabilities related to the CLOs.

The following table presents the fair value and unpaid principal balance of loans and debt for which the fair value option has been elected:

(1)

The carrying value of the CLOs’ debt is set equal to the fair value of the CLOs’ assets. The estimated fair value of the CLOs’ debt was

$

1.7

billion

as of both

December 31, 2019

and

As part of Ameriprise Financial’s ongoing monitoring process, management determined that the change in gross unrealized losses on its Available-for-Sale securities is attributable to lower interest rates as well as tighter credit spreads.

The following table presents a rollforward of the cumulative amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for OTTI related to credit losses on Available-for-Sale securities for which a portion of the securities’ total OTTI was recognized in OCI:


Net realized gains and losses on Available-for-Sale securities, determined using the specific identification method, recognized in earnings were as follows:

Other-than temporary impairments for the year ended

December 31, 2019

primarily related to credit losses on corporate debt securities and investments held by AAH. The Company recognized an impairment of $5 million in the first quarter of 2019 on investments held by AAH as the Company no longer intended to hold the securities until the recovery of fair value to book value. See Note 19 for additional information on the sale of AAH. Other-than temporary impairments for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to credit losses on asset backed securities.

Financing Receivables

The Company’s financing receivables primarily include commercial mortgage loans, syndicated loans, policy loans, advisor loans, margin loans, credit card receivables and the deposit receivable. See Note 2 for information regarding the Company’s accounting policies related to loans and the allowance for loan losses.

Allowance for Loan Losses

Policy loans do not exceed the cash surrender value at origination. As there is minimal risk of loss related to policy loans, the Company does not record an allowance for loan losses. The Company monitors collateral supporting margin loans and requests additional collateral when necessary in order to mitigate the risk of loss. The Company does not have an allowance for loan losses for the deposit receivable as the receivable is supported by a trust and there is minimal risk of loss.


Commercial Mortgage Loans and Syndicated Loans

Commercial mortgage loans which management has assigned its highest risk rating


were less than


%

of total commercial mortgage loans as of both

December 31, 2019

and


. Loans with the highest risk rating represent distressed loans which the Company has identified as impaired or expects to become delinquent or enter into foreclosure within the next six months. In addition, the Company reviews the concentrations of credit risk by region and property type.

$

1.7

billion

of fixed annuity polices sold through third parties, which is approximately 20% of in force fixed annuity account balances. The arrangement contains investment guidelines and a trust to meet the Company’s risk management objectives. The transaction was effective as of January 1, 2019.


8.

Reinsurance

The Company reinsures a portion of the insurance risks associated with its traditional life, DI and LTC insurance products through reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated reinsurance companies. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the Company from its primary obligation to policyholders.

The Company generally reinsures


%

of the death benefit liability for new term life insurance policies beginning in 2001 and new individual UL and VUL insurance policies beginning in 2002. Policies issued prior to these dates are not subject to these same reinsurance levels.

However, for IUL policies issued after September 1, 2013 and VUL policies issued after January 1, 2014, the Company generally reinsures


%

of the death benefit liability. Similarly, the Company reinsures


%

of the death benefit and morbidity liabilities related to its UL product with LTC benefits.

The maximum amount of life insurance risk the Company will retain is

$


million

on a single life and

$


million

on any flexible premium survivorship life policy; however, reinsurance agreements are in place such that retaining more than

$

1.5

million

of insurance risk on a single life or a flexible premium survivorship life policy is very unusual. Risk on UL and VUL policies is reinsured on a yearly renewable term basis. Risk on most term life policies starting in 2001 is reinsured on a coinsurance basis, a type of reinsurance in which the reinsurer participates proportionally in all material risks and premiums associated with a policy.

For existing LTC policies, the Company has continued ceding


%

of the risk on a coinsurance basis to subsidiaries of Genworth Financial, Inc. (“Genworth”) and retains the remaining risk. For RiverSource Life of NY, this reinsurance arrangement applies for 1996 and later issues only. Under these agreements, the Company has the right, but never the obligation, to recapture some, or all, of the risk ceded to Genworth.

Generally, the Company retains at most

$

5,000

per month of risk per life on DI policies sold on policy forms introduced in most states starting in 2007 and reinsures the remainder of the risk on a coinsurance basis with unaffiliated reinsurance companies. The Company retains all risk for new claims on DI contracts sold on other policy forms introduced prior to 2007. The Company also retains all risk on accidental death benefit claims and substantially all risk associated with waiver of premium provisions.

As of both

December 31, 2019

and


, traditional life and UL insurance policies in force were

$

195.1

billion

, of which

$

142.8

billion

and

$

142.4

billion

as of

December 31, 2019

and


were reinsured at the respective year ends.

The effect of reinsurance on premiums for the Company’s traditional long-duration contracts was as follows:

Cost of insurance and administrative charges for non-traditional long-duration products are reflected in other revenues and were net of reinsurance ceded of

$

Deferred Acquisition Costs and Deferred Sales Inducement Costs

In the third quarter of the year, management updates market-related inputs and implements model changes related to the living benefit valuation. In addition, management conducts its annual review of life insurance and annuity valuation assumptions relative to current experience and management expectations including modeling changes. These aforementioned changes are collectively referred to as unlocking. The impact of unlocking to DAC for the year ended December 31,


primarily reflected updates to interest rate assumptions, partially offset by a favorable impact from lower surrenders on annuity contracts with a withdrawal benefit. The impact of unlocking to DAC for the year ended December 31,


primarily reflected updated mortality assumptions on UL and VUL insurance products and lower surrender rate assumptions on variable annuities, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from updates


to assumptions on utilization of guaranteed withdrawal benefits. The impact of unlocking to DAC for the year ended December 31,


primarily reflected improved persistency and mortality on UL and VUL insurance products and a correction related to a variable annuity model assumption partially offset by updates to market-related inputs to the living benefit valuation.

The balances of and changes in DAC were as follows:

The balances of and changes in DSIC, which is included in other assets, were as follows:

Policyholder Account Balances, Future Policy Benefits and Claims and Separate Account Liabilities

Policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and claims consisted of the following:

(1)

Includes fixed deferred annuities, non-life contingent fixed payout annuities and indexed annuity host contracts.

(2)

Includes the fair value of GMAB embedded derivatives that was a net asset as of both December 31,


and


reported as a contra liability.


Fixed Annuities

Fixed

annuities include deferred, payout and indexed annuity contracts.

Deferred

contracts offer a guaranteed minimum rate of interest and security of the principal invested. Payout contracts guarantee a fixed income payment for life or the term of the contract. Liabilities for fixed annuities in a benefit or payout status are based on future estimated payments using established industry mortality tables and interest rates, ranging from

2.71

%

to

9.38

%

as of December 31,


, depending on year of issue, with an average rate of approximately

3.83

%

. The Company generally invests the proceeds from the annuity contracts in fixed rate securities.

The

Company’s equity indexed annuity (“EIA”) product is a single premium fixed deferred annuity. The Company discontinued new sales of EIAs in 2007. The contract was issued with an initial term of

seven years

and interest earnings are linked to the performance of the S&P 500

®

Index. This annuity has a minimum interest rate guarantee of


%

on


%

of the initial premium, adjusted for any surrenders. The Company generally invests the proceeds from the annuity contracts in fixed rate securities and hedges the equity risk with derivative instruments.

The

Company’s fixed index annuity product is a fixed annuity that includes an indexed account. The rate of interest credited above the minimum guarantee for funds allocated to the indexed account is linked to the performance of the specific index for the indexed account (subject to a cap). The Company offers S&P 500

®

Index and MSCI

®

EAFE Index account options. Both options offer two crediting durations, one-year and two-year. The contractholder may allocate all or a portion of the policy value to a fixed or indexed account. The portion of the policy allocated to the indexed account is accounted for as an embedded derivative. The Company hedges the interest credited rate including equity and interest rate risk related to the indexed account with derivative instruments. The contractholder can choose to add a GMWB for life rider for an additional fee.

See

Note 17 for additional information regarding the Company’s derivative instruments used to hedge the risk related to indexed annuities.

Variable Annuities

Purchasers

of variable annuities can select from a variety of investment options and can elect to allocate a portion to a fixed account. A vast majority of the premiums received for variable annuity contracts are held in separate accounts where the assets are held for the exclusive benefit of those contractholders.

Most of the variable annuity contracts currently issued by the Company contain one or more guaranteed benefits, including GMWB, GMAB, GMDB and GGU provisions. The Company previously offered contracts with GMIB provisions. See Notes 2 and 12 for additional information regarding the Company’s variable annuity guarantees. The Company does not currently hedge its risk under the GGU and GMIB provisions. See Notes 15 and 17 for additional information regarding the Company’s derivative instruments used to hedge risks related to GMWB, GMAB and GMDB provisions.

Insurance Liabilities

UL/VUL is the largest group of insurance policies written by the Company. Purchasers of UL accumulate cash value that increases by a fixed interest rate. Purchasers of VUL can select from a variety of investment options and can elect to allocate a portion to a fixed account or a separate account. A vast majority of the premiums received for VUL policies are held in separate accounts where the assets are held for the exclusive benefit of those policyholders.

IUL

is a UL policy that includes an indexed account. The rate of credited interest above the minimum guarantee for funds allocated to the indexed account is linked to the performance of the specific index for the indexed account (subject to a cap and floor). The Company offers an S&P 500

®

Index account option and a blended multi-index account option comprised of the S&P 500 Index, the MSCI

®

EAFE Index and the MSCI EM Index. Both options offer two crediting durations, one-year and two-year. The policyholder may allocate all or a portion of the policy value to a fixed or any available indexed account. The portion of the policy allocated to the indexed account is accounted for as an embedded derivative at fair value. The Company hedges the interest credited rate including equity and interest rate risk related to the indexed account with derivative instruments. See Note 17 for additional information regarding the Company’s derivative instruments used to hedge the risk related to IUL.

The

Company also offers term life insurance as well as DI products. The Company no longer offers standalone LTC products and whole life insurance but has in force policies from prior years.

Insurance

liabilities include accumulation values, incurred but not reported claims, obligations for anticipated future claims, unpaid reported claims and claim adjustment expenses.

The

liability for estimates of benefits that will become payable on future claims on term life, whole life and DI policies is based on the net level premium and LTC policies is based on a gross premium valuation reflecting management’s current best estimate assumptions. Both include the anticipated interest rates earned on assets supporting the liability. Anticipated interest rates for term and whole life ranged from


%

to


%

as of December 31,


. Anticipated interest rates for DI policies ranged from

3.5

%

to

7.5

%

as of December 31,


and for LTC policies ranged from

5.8

%

to

6.8

%

as of December 31,


.

The

liability for unpaid reported claims on DI and LTC policies includes an estimate of the present value of obligations for continuing benefit payments. The discount rates used to calculate present values are based on average interest rates earned on assets supporting the liability for unpaid amounts and were

4.5

%

and

6.0

%

for DI and LTC claims, respectively, as of December 31,


.


Portions of the Company’s UL and VUL policies have product features that result in profits followed by losses from the insurance component of the policy. These profits followed by losses can be generated by the cost structure of the product or secondary guarantees in the policy. The secondary guarantee ensures that, subject to specified conditions, the policy will not terminate and will continue to provide a death benefit even if there is insufficient policy value to cover the monthly deductions and charges.

Separate Account Liabilities

Separate account liabilities consisted of the following:

Threadneedle Investment Liabilities

Threadneedle provides a range of unitized pooled pension funds, which invest in property, stocks, bonds and cash. The investments are selected by the clients and are based on the level of risk they are willing to assume. All investment performance, net of fees, is passed through to the investors. The value of the liabilities represents the fair value of the pooled pension funds.

12.

Variable Annuity and Insurance Guarantees

The majority of the variable annuity contracts offered by the Company contain GMDB provisions. The Company also offers variable annuities with GGU, GMWB and GMAB provisions. The Company previously offered contracts containing GMIB provisions. See Notes 2 and 11 for additional information regarding the Company’s variable annuity guarantees.

The GMDB and GGU provisions provide a specified minimum return upon death of the contractholder. The death benefit payable is the greater of (i) the contract value less any purchase payment credits subject to recapture less a pro-rata portion of any rider fees, or (ii) the GMDB provisions specified in the contract. The Company has the following primary GMDB provisions:

•

Return of premium — provides purchase payments minus adjusted partial surrenders.

•

Reset — provides that the value resets to the account value every sixth contract anniversary minus adjusted partial surrenders. This provision was often provided in combination with the return of premium provision and is no longer offered.

•

Ratchet — provides that the value ratchets up to the maximum account value at specified anniversary intervals, plus subsequent purchase payments less adjusted partial surrenders.

The variable annuity contracts with GMWB riders typically have account values that are based on an underlying portfolio of mutual funds, the values of which fluctuate based on fund performance. At issue the guaranteed amount is equal to the amount deposited but the guarantee may be increased annually to the account value (a “step-up”) in the case of favorable market performance or by a benefit credit if the contract includes this provision.

The Company has GMWB riders in force, which contain one or more of the following provisions:

•

Withdrawals at a specified rate per year until the amount withdrawn is equal to the guaranteed amount.

•

Withdrawals at a specified rate per year for the life of the contractholder (“GMWB for life”).

•

Withdrawals at a specified rate per year for joint contractholders while either is alive.

•

Withdrawals based on performance of the contract.

•

Withdrawals based on the age withdrawals begin.

•

Credits are applied annually for a specified number of years to increase the guaranteed amount as long as withdrawals have not been taken.

Variable annuity contractholders age


or younger at contract issue can also obtain a principal-back guarantee by purchasing the optional GMAB rider for an additional charge. The GMAB rider guarantees that, regardless of market performance at the end of the


-year waiting period, the contract value will be no less than the original investment or a specified percentage of the highest anniversary value, adjusted for withdrawals. If the contract value is less than the guarantee at the end of the


-year period, a lump sum will be added to the contract value to make the contract value equal to the guarantee value.

Certain UL policies offered by the Company provide secondary guarantee benefits. The secondary guarantee ensures that, subject to specified conditions, the policy will not terminate and will continue to provide a death benefit even if there is insufficient policy value to cover the monthly deductions and charges.


The following table provides information related to variable annuity guarantees for which the Company has established additional liabilities:

(1)

Individual variable annuity contracts may have more than one guarantee and therefore may be included in more than one benefit type. Variable annuity contracts for which the death benefit equals the account value are not shown in this table

.

The net amount at risk for GMDB, GGU and GMAB is defined as the current guaranteed benefit amount in excess of the current contract value. The net amount at risk for GMIB is defined as the greater of the present value of the minimum guaranteed annuity payments less the current contract value or zero. The net amount at risk for GMWB is defined as the greater of the present value of the minimum guaranteed withdrawal payments less the current contract value or zero.

The following table provides information related to insurance guarantees for which the Company has established additional liabilities:

The net amount at risk for UL secondary guarantees is defined as the current guaranteed death benefit amount in excess of the current policyholder account balance.


Changes in additional liabilities (contra liabilities) for variable annuity and insurance guarantees were as follows:

(1)

The incurred claims for GMWB and GMAB include the change in the fair value of the liabilities (contra liabilities) less paid claims.

The liabilities for guaranteed benefits are supported by general account assets.

The following table summarizes the distribution of separate account balances by asset type for variable annuity contracts providing guaranteed benefits:

Customer Deposits

Customer deposits consisted of the following:


Investment Certificates

The Company offers fixed rate investment certificates primarily in amounts ranging from

$

1,000

to

$


million

with interest crediting rate terms ranging from


to


months. Investment certificates may be purchased either with a lump sum payment or installment payments. Certificate owners are entitled to receive a fixed sum at either maturity or upon demand depending on the type of certificate. Payments from certificate owners are credited to investment certificate reserves, which generally accumulate interest at specified percentage rates. Certain investment certificates allow for a surrender charge on premature surrenders. Reserves for certificates that do not allow for a surrender charge were

$

2.7

billion

as of

December 31, 2019

. The Company generally invests the proceeds from investment certificates in fixed and variable rate securities.

Certain investment certificate products have returns tied to the performance of equity markets. The Company guarantees the principal for purchasers who hold the certificate for the full term and purchasers may participate in increases in the stock market based on the S&P 500

®

Index, up to a maximum return. Purchasers can choose


%

participation in the market index up to the cap or


%

participation plus fixed interest with a combined total up to the cap. Current first term certificates have maximum returns of

2.75

%

to

13.25

%

, depending on the term length. The equity component of these certificates is considered an embedded derivative and is accounted for separately. See Note 17 for additional information about derivative instruments used to economically hedge the equity price risk related to the Company’s stock market certificates.

Banking and Brokerage Deposits

Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities

GAAP defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date; that is, an exit price. The exit price assumes the asset or liability is not exchanged subject to a forced liquidation or distressed sale.


Valuation Hierarchy

The Company categorizes its fair value measurements according to a three-level hierarchy. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used by the Company’s valuation techniques. A level is assigned to each fair value measurement based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:

Level 1

Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date.

Level 2

Prices or valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.

Level 3

Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.

The following tables present the balances of assets and liabilities of Ameriprise Financial measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

, net of DAC, DSIC, unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual, for the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


and


, respectively.


Securities transferred from Level 3 primarily represent securities with fair values that are now obtained from a third-party pricing service with observable inputs. Securities transferred to Level 3 represent securities with fair values that are now based on a single non-binding broker quote.

The following tables provide a summary of the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements developed by the Company or reasonably available to the Company of Level 3 assets and liabilities:

(1)

The nonperformance risk is the spread added to the observable interest rates used in the valuation of the embedded derivatives

.

(2)

The utilization of guaranteed withdrawals represents the percentage of contractholders that will begin withdrawing in any given year.

(3)

Market volatility is implied volatility of fund of funds and managed volatility funds.

Level 3 measurements not included in the table above are obtained from non-binding broker quotes where unobservable inputs utilized in the fair value calculation are not reasonably available to the Company.

Uncertainty of Fair Value Measurements

Significant increases (decreases) in the yield/spread to U.S. Treasuries used in the fair value measurement of Level 3 corporate debt securities in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.


Significant increases (decreases) in the annual default rate and discount rate used in the fair value measurement of Level 3 asset backed securities in isolation, generally, would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement and significant increases (decreases) in loss recovery in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.

Significant increases (decreases) in the constant prepayment rate in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.

Significant increases (decreases) in nonperformance risk used in the fair value measurement of the IUL embedded derivatives in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.

Significant increases (decreases) in nonperformance risk and surrender rate used in the fair value measurement of the indexed annuity embedded derivatives in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) liability value.

Significant increases (decreases) in utilization and volatility used in the fair value measurement of the GMWB and GMAB embedded derivatives in isolation would have resulted in a significantly higher (lower) liability value.

Significant increases (decreases) in nonperformance risk and surrender rate used in the fair value measurement of the GMWB and GMAB embedded derivatives in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) liability value. Utilization of guaranteed withdrawals and surrender rates vary with the type of rider, the duration of the policy, the age of the contractholder, the distribution channel and whether the value of the guaranteed benefit exceeds the contract accumulation value.

Significant increases (decreases) in the discount rate used in the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration liability in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.

Determination of Fair Value

The Company uses valuation techniques consistent with the market and income approaches to measure the fair value of its assets and liabilities. The Company’s market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The Company’s income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future projected cash flows to a single discounted present value amount. When applying either approach, the Company maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs.

The following is a description of the valuation techniques used to measure fair value and the general classification of these instruments pursuant to the fair value hierarchy.

Assets

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents include time deposits and other highly liquid investments with original or remaining maturities at the time of purchase of 90 days or less. Actively traded money market funds are measured at their NAV and classified as Level 1. The Company’s remaining cash equivalents are classified as Level 2 and measured at amortized cost, which is a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the short time between the purchase of the instrument and its expected realization.

Investments (Available-for-Sale Securities, Equity Securities and Trading Securities)

When available, the fair value of securities is based on quoted prices in active markets. If quoted prices are not available, fair values are obtained from third-party pricing services, non-binding broker quotes, or other model-based valuation techniques.

Level 1 securities primarily include U.S. Treasuries.

Level 2 securities primarily include corporate bonds, residential mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities, state and municipal obligations and foreign government securities. The fair value of these Level 2 securities is based on a market approach with prices obtained from third-party pricing services. Observable inputs used to value these securities can include, but are not limited to, reported trades, benchmark yields, issuer spreads and non-binding broker quotes.

Level 3 securities primarily include certain corporate bonds, non-agency residential mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities. The fair value of corporate bonds, non-agency residential mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities and certain asset backed securities classified as Level 3 is typically based on a single non-binding broker quote. The underlying inputs used for some of the non-binding broker quotes are not readily available to the Company. The Company’s privately placed corporate bonds are typically based on a single non-binding broker quote. The fair value of certain asset backed securities is determined using a discounted cash flow model. Inputs used to determine the expected cash flows include assumptions about discount rates and default, prepayment and recovery rates of the underlying assets. Given the significance of the unobservable inputs to this fair value measurement, the fair value of the investment in certain asset backed securities is classified as Level 3.

In

consideration of the above, management is responsible for the fair values recorded on the financial statements. Prices received from third-party pricing services are subjected to exception reporting that identifies investments with significant daily price movements as well as no movements. The Company reviews the exception reporting and resolves the exceptions through reaffirmation of the price or recording an appropriate fair value estimate. The Company also performs subsequent transaction testing. The Company performs annual due diligence of third-party pricing services. The Company’s due diligence procedures include assessing the vendor’s valuation qualifications, control environment, analysis of asset-class specific valuation methodologies, and understanding of sources of market


observable assumptions and unobservable assumptions, if any, employed in the valuation methodology. The Company also considers the results of its exception reporting controls and any resulting price challenges that arise.

Separate Account Assets

The fair value of assets held by separate accounts is determined by the NAV of the funds in which those separate accounts are invested. The NAV is used as a practical expedient for fair value and represents the exit price for the separate account. Separate account assets are excluded from classification in the fair value hierarchy.

Investments and Cash Equivalents Segregated for Regulatory Purposes

Investments and cash equivalents segregated for regulatory purposes includes U.S. Treasuries that are classified as Level 1.

Other Assets

Derivatives that are measured using quoted prices in active markets, such as derivatives that are exchange-traded are classified as Level 1 measurements. The variation margin on futures contracts is also classified as Level 1. The fair value of derivatives that are traded in less active over-the-counter (“OTC”) markets is generally measured using pricing models with market observable inputs such as interest rates and equity index levels. These measurements are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy and include swaps, foreign currency forwards and the majority of options. The counterparties’ nonperformance risk associated with uncollateralized derivative assets was immaterial as of

December 31, 2019

and


. See Note 16 and Note 17 for further information on the credit risk of derivative instruments and related collateral.

Liabilities

Policyholder Account Balances, Future Policy Benefits and Claims

There is no active market for the transfer of the Company’s embedded derivatives attributable to the provisions of certain variable annuity riders, index annuity and IUL products.

The Company values the embedded derivatives attributable to the provisions of certain variable annuity riders using internal valuation models. These models calculate fair value as the present value of future expected benefit payments less the present value of future expected rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature. The projected cash flows used by these models include observable capital market assumptions and incorporate significant unobservable inputs related to implied volatility as well as contractholder behavior assumptions that include margins for risk, all of which the Company believes an exit market participant would expect. The fair value also reflects a current estimate of the Company’s nonperformance risk specific to these embedded derivatives. Given the significant unobservable inputs to this valuation, these measurements are classified as Level 3. The embedded derivatives attributable to these provisions are recorded in policyholder ac

count balances, future policy benefits and claims.

The Company uses various Black-Scholes calculations to determine the fair value of the embedded derivatives associated with the provisions of its fixed index annuity and IUL products. The Company uses a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of the embedded derivatives associated with the provisions of its equity index annuity product. The projected cash flows generated by this model are based on significant observable inputs related to interest rates, volatilities and equity index levels and, therefore, are classified as Level 2. The fair value of fixed index annuity and IUL embedded derivatives includes significant observable interest rates, volatilities and equity index levels and the significant unobservable estimate of the Company’s nonperformance risk. Given the significance of the nonperformance risk assumption to the fair value, the fixed index annuity and IUL embedded derivatives are classified as Level 3. The embedded derivatives attributable to these provisions are recorded in policyholder account balances, future policy benefits and claims.

Customer Deposits

The Company uses various Black-Scholes calculations to determine the fair value of the embedded derivative liability associated with the provisions of its stock market certificates (“SMC”). The inputs to these calculations are primarily market observable and include interest rates, volatilities and equity index levels. As a result, these measurements are classified as Level 2.

Other Liabilities

Derivatives that are measured using quoted prices in active markets, such as derivatives that are exchange-traded are classified as Level 1 measurements. The variation margin on futures contracts is also classified as Level 1. The fair value of derivatives that are traded in less active OTC markets is generally measured using pricing models with market observable inputs such as interest rates and equity index levels. These measurements are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy and include swaps, foreign currency forwards and the majority of options. The Company’s nonperformance risk associated with uncollateralized derivative liabilities was immaterial as of

December 31, 2019

and


. See Note 16 and Note 17 for further information on the credit risk of derivative instruments and related collateral.

Securities sold but not yet purchased represent obligations of the Company to deliver specified securities that it does not yet own, creating a liability to purchase the security in the market at prevailing prices. When available, the fair value of securities is based on quoted prices in active markets. If quoted prices are not available, fair values are obtained from nationally-recognized pricing services, or other model-based valuation techniques such as the present value of cash flows. Level 1 securities sold but not yet purchased primarily include U.S Treasuries traded in active markets. Level 2 securities sold but not yet purchased primarily include corporate bonds.


Contingent consideration liabilities consist of earn-outs and/or deferred payments related to the Company’s acquisitions. Contingent consideration liabilities are recorded at fair value using a discounted cash flow model under multiple scenarios and an unobservable input (discount rate). Given the use of a significant unobservable input, the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.

Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

The Company assesses its investment in affordable housing partnerships for other-than-temporary impairment. The investments that are determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired are written down to their fair value. The Company uses a discounted cash flow model to measure the fair value of these investments. Inputs to the discounted cash flow model are estimates of future net operating losses and tax credits available to the Company and discount rates based on market condition and the financial strength of the syndicator (general partner). The balance of affordable housing partnerships measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis was

$


million

and

$


million

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively, and is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

Asset and Liabilities Not Reported at Fair Value

The following tables provide the carrying value and the estimated fair value of financial instruments that are not reported at fair value:

(1)

The fair value of separate account liabilities - investment contracts as of December 31, 2018 was previously incorrectly omitted from the fair value hierarchy based on use of NAV per share as a practical expedient.

Receivables include the deposit receivable, brokerage margin loans, securities borrowed and loans to financial advisors. Restricted and segregated cash includes cash segregated under federal and other regulations held in special reserve bank accounts for the exclusive benefit of the Company’s brokerage customers. Other investments and assets primarily include syndicated loans, credit card


receivables, certificate of deposits with original or remaining maturities at the time of purchase of more than 90 days, the Company’s membership in the FHLB and investments related to the Community Reinvestment Act. See Note 7 for additional information on mortgage loans, policy loans, syndicated loans, credit card receivables and the deposit receivable.

Policyholder account balances, future policy benefit and claims include fixed annuities in deferral status, non-life contingent fixed annuities in payout status, indexed annuity host contracts and the fixed portion of a small number of variable annuity contracts classified as investment contracts. See Note 11 for additional information on these liabilities. Investment certificate reserves represent customer deposits for fixed rate certificates and stock market certificates. Banking and brokerage deposits are amounts payable to customers related to free credit balances, funds deposited by customers and funds accruing to customers as a result of trades or contracts. Separate account liabilities are primarily investment contracts in pooled pension funds offered by Threadneedle. Debt and other liabilities include the Company’s long-term debt, short-term borrowings, securities loaned and future funding commitments to affordable housing partnerships and other real estate partnerships. See Note 14 for further information on the Company’s long-term debt and short-term borrowings.

16.

Offsetting Assets and Liabilities

Certain financial instruments and derivative instruments are eligible for offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s derivative instruments, repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending agreements are subject to master netting and collateral arrangements and qualify for offset. A master netting arrangement with a counterparty creates a right of offset for amounts due to and from that same counterparty that is enforceable in the event of a default or bankruptcy. Securities borrowed and loaned result from transactions between the Company’s broker dealer subsidiary and other financial institutions and are recorded at the amount of cash collateral advanced or received. Securities borrowed and securities loaned are primarily equity securities. The Company’s securities borrowed and securities loaned transactions generally do not have a fixed maturity date and may be terminated by either party under customary terms.

The Company’s policy is to recognize amounts subject to master netting arrangements on a gross basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The following tables present the gross and net information about the Company’s assets subject to master netting arrangements:

(1)

Represents the amount of assets that could be offset by liabilities with the same counterparty under master netting or similar arrangements that management elects not to offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.


The following tables present the gross and net information about the Company’s liabilities subject to master netting arrangements:

(1)

Represents the amount of liabilities that could be offset by assets with the same counterparty under master netting or similar arrangements that management elects not to offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In the tables above, the amount of assets or liabilities presented are offset first by financial instruments that have the right of offset under master netting or similar arrangements, then any remaining amount is reduced by the amount of cash and securities collateral. The actual collateral may be greater than amounts presented in the tables.

When the fair value of collateral accepted by the Company is less than the amount due to the Company, there is a risk of loss if the counterparty fails to perform or provide additional collateral. To mitigate this risk, the Company monitors collateral values regularly and requires additional collateral when necessary. When the value of collateral pledged by the Company declines, it may be required to post additional collateral.

Freestanding derivative instruments are reflected in other assets and other liabilities. Cash collateral pledged by the Company is reflected in other assets and cash collateral accepted by the Company is reflected in other liabilities. Repurchase agreements are reflected in short-term borrowings. Securities borrowing and lending agreements are reflected in receivables and other liabilities, respectively. See Note 17 for additional disclosures related to the Company’s derivative instruments, Note 14 for additional disclosures related to the Company’s repurchase agreements and Note 5 for information related to derivatives held by consolidated investment entities.

17.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities

Derivative instruments enable the Company to manage its exposure to various market risks. The value of such instruments is derived from an underlying variable or multiple variables, including equity, foreign exchange and interest rate indices or prices. The Company primarily enters into derivative agreements for risk management purposes related to the Company’s products and operations.

Certain of the Company’s freestanding derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements. The Company’s policy on the recognition of derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheets is to not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivatives and collateral arrangements executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement. See Note 16 for additional information regarding the estimated fair value of the Company’s freestanding derivatives after considering the effect of master netting arrangements and collateral.


The Company uses derivatives as economic hedges and accounting hedges. The following table presents the notional value and gross fair value of derivative instruments, including embedded derivatives:

N/A  Not applicable.

none

of these securities. In addition, as of both

December 31, 2019

and


, non-cash collateral accepted was held in separate custodial accounts and was not included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.


Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges

The following table presents a summary of the impact of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, including embedded derivatives, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations:

The Company holds derivative instruments that either do not qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. These derivative instruments are used as economic hedges of equity, interest rate, credit and foreign currency exchange rate risk related to various products and transactions of the Company.

Certain annuity contracts contain GMWB or GMAB provisions, which guarantee the right to make limited partial withdrawals each contract year regardless of the volatility inherent in the underlying investments or guarantee a minimum accumulation value of consideration received at the beginning of the contract period, after a specified holding period, respectively. The GMAB and non-life contingent GMWB provisions are considered embedded derivatives, which are bifurcated from their host contracts for valuation purposes and reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. The Company economically hedges the exposure related to GMAB and non-life contingent GMWB provisions using options (equity index, interest rate swaptions, etc.), swaps (interest rate, total return, etc.) and futures.


The deferred premium associated with certain of the above options and swaptions is paid or received semi-annually over the life of the contract or at maturity. The following is a summary of the payments the Company is scheduled to make and receive for these options and swaptions as of

December 31, 2019

:

Actual timing and payment amounts may differ due to future settlements, modifications or exercises of the contracts prior to the full premium being paid or received.

The Company has a macro hedge program to provide protection against the statutory tail scenario risk arising from variable annuity reserves on its statutory surplus and to cover some of the residual risks not covered by other hedging activities. As a means of economically hedging these risks, the Company may use a combination of futures, options, swaps and swaptions. Certain of the macro hedge derivatives may contain settlement provisions linked to both equity returns and interest rates. The Company’s macro hedge derivatives that contain settlement provisions linked to both equity returns and interest rates, if any, are shown in other contracts in the tables above.

Indexed annuity, IUL and stock market certificate products have returns tied to the performance of equity markets. As a result of fluctuations in equity markets, the obligation incurred by the Company related to indexed annuity, IUL and stock market certificate products will positively or negatively impact earnings over the life of these products. The equity component of indexed annuity, IUL and stock market certificate product obligations are considered embedded derivatives, which are bifurcated from their host contracts for valuation purposes and reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. As a means of economically hedging its obligations under the provisions of these products, the Company enters into index options and futures contracts.

The Company enters into futures, credit default swaps and commodity swaps to manage its exposure to price risk arising from seed money investments in proprietary investment products. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge its exposure to certain foreign transactions. The Company enters into futures and total return swaps to economically hedge its exposure related to compensation plans. The Company enters into interest rate swaps to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments.

Cash Flow Hedges

The Company has designated derivative instruments as a cash flow hedge of interest rate exposure on forecasted debt interest payments. For derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative instruments is reported in AOCI and reclassified into earnings when the hedged item or transaction impacts earnings. The amount that is reclassified into earnings is presented within the same line item as the earnings impact of the hedged item in interest and debt expense.

Prior to the adoption of the new accounting standard

Derivatives and Hedging - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities

on January 1, 2019, the Company recorded the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instruments in AOCI and any ineffective portion in current period earnings. See Note 3 for additional information on the adoption of the new accounting standard.

For the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


and


, the amounts reclassified from AOCI to earnings related to cash flow hedges were immaterial. The estimated net amount recorded in AOCI as of

December 31, 2019

that the Company expects to reclassify to earnings as a reduction to interest and debt expense within the next twelve months is

$


million

. Currently, the longest period of time over which the Company is hedging exposure to the variability in future cash flows is


years

and relates to forecasted debt interest payments. See Note 21 for a rollforward of net unrealized derivative gains (losses) included in AOCI related to cash flow hedges.

Fair Value Hedges

The Company entered into and designated as fair value hedges

two

interest rate swaps to convert senior notes due 2019 and 2020 from fixed rate debt to floating rate debt. The interest rate swap related to the senior notes due June 2019 was settled during the second quarter when the debt was repaid. The swaps have identical terms as the underlying debt being hedged. The Company recognizes gains and losses on the derivatives and the related hedged items within interest and debt expense. See Note 14 for the cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges.


The following table is a summary of the impact of derivatives designated as hedges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations:

Net Investment Hedges

The Company entered into, and designated as net investment hedges in foreign operations, forward contracts to hedge a portion of the Company’s foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with its investment in Threadneedle. As the Company determined that the forward contracts are effective, the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized in AOCI as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment.

For the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


, the Company recognized a loss of

$


million

and a gain of

$


million

, respectively, in OCI.

Credit Risk

Credit risk associated with the Company’s derivatives is the risk that a derivative counterparty will not perform in accordance with the terms of the applicable derivative contract. To mitigate such risk, the Company has established guidelines and oversight of credit risk through a comprehensive enterprise risk management program that includes members of senior management. Key components of this program are to require preapproval of counterparties and the use of master netting and collateral arrangements whenever practical. See Note 16 for additional information on the Company’s credit exposure related to derivative assets.

Certain of the Company’s derivative contracts contain provisions that adjust the level of collateral the Company is required to post based on the Company’s debt rating (or based on the financial strength of the Company’s life insurance subsidiaries for contracts in which those subsidiaries are the counterparty). Additionally, certain of the Company’s derivative contracts contain provisions that allow the counterparty to terminate the contract if the Company’s debt does not maintain a specific credit rating (generally an investment grade rating) or the Company’s life insurance subsidiary does not maintain a specific financial strength rating. If these termination provisions were to be triggered, the Company’s counterparty could require immediate settlement of any net liability position. As of

December 31, 2019

and


, the aggregate fair value of derivative contracts in a net liability position containing such credit contingent provisions was

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively. The aggregate fair value of assets posted as collateral for such instruments as of

December 31, 2019

and


was

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively. If the credit contingent provisions of derivative contracts in a net liability position as of

December 31, 2019

and


were triggered, the aggregate fair value of additional assets that would be required to be posted as collateral or needed to settle the instruments immediately would have been

nil

and

$


million

, respectively.

18.

Leases

The following table presents the balances for operating and finance ROU assets and lease liabilities:

The components of lease expense include operating and finance lease costs. For the year ended

, operating lease costs were

$


million

. For the year ended

December 31, 2019

, finance lease costs consisted of

$


million

in amortization and

$


million

of interest expense. Amortization is recorded in general and administrative expenses and interest expense is recorded in interest and debt expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.


Maturities of lease liabilities, weighted-average remaining term and weighted-average discount rate are as follows:

Maturities of lease liabilities prior to the adoption of new lease guidance were as follows:

For the year ended

December 31, 2019

. The Company recognized a gain on disposal of

$


million

in the fourth quarter of 2019, which is net of the

$


million

payment to an affinity partner.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company’s share-based compensation plans consist of the Amended and Restated Ameriprise Financial 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2005 ICP”), the Ameriprise Financial 2008 Employment Incentive Equity Award Plan (the “2008 Plan”), the Ameriprise Financial Franchise Advisor Deferred Compensation Plan (“Franchise Advisor Deferral Plan”) and the Ameriprise Advisor Group Deferred Compensation Plan (“Advisor Group Deferral Plan”).

The components of the Company’s share-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, were as follows:

, there was

$


million

of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards under the Company’s share-based compensation plans, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

3.0

years

.

Amended and Restated Ameriprise Financial 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan

The 2005 ICP, which was amended and approved by shareholders on April 30, 2014, provides for the grant of cash and equity incentive awards to directors, employees and independent contractors, including stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance shares and similar awards designed to comply with the applicable federal regulations and laws of jurisdiction. Under the 2005 ICP, a maximum of

54.4

million shares may be issued. Of this total, no more than

4.5

million shares may be issued after April 30, 2014 for full value awards, which are awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights. Shares issued under the 2005 ICP may be authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares.

Ameriprise Financial 2008 Employment Incentive Equity Award Plan

The 2008 Plan is designed to align employees’ interests with those of the shareholders of the Company and attract and retain new employees. The 2008 Plan provides for the grant of equity incentive awards to new employees, primarily those, who became employees in connection with a merger or acquisition, including stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, and other equity-based awards designed to comply with the applicable federal and foreign regulations and laws of jurisdiction. Under the 2008 Plan, a maximum of

6.0

million shares may be issued.

Stock Options

Stock options granted under the 2005 ICP and the 2008 Plan have an exercise price not less than


%

of the current fair market value of a share of the Company’s common stock on the grant date and a maximum term of


years

. Stock options granted generally vest ratably over

three

to

four years

. Vesting of option awards may be accelerated based on age and length of service. Stock options granted are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the fair value of the awards on the date of grant. The grant date fair value of the options is calculated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

The following weighted average assumptions were used for stock option grants:

The dividend yield assumption represents the Company’s expected dividend yield based on its historical dividend payouts and management’s expectations. The expected volatility is based on the Company’s historical and implied volatilities. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected option life is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the grant date. The expected life of the option is based on the Company’s past experience and other considerations.

The weighted average grant date fair value for options granted during

28.33

, respectively.

Restricted Stock Awards

Restricted stock awards granted under the 2005 ICP and 2008 Plan generally vest ratably over

three

to

four years

or at the end of

five years

. Compensation expense for restricted stock awards is based on the market price of Ameriprise Financial common stock on the date of grant and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Quarterly dividends are paid on restricted stock, as declared by the Company’s Board of Directors, during the vesting period and are not subject to forfeiture.

Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Share Units

The 2005 ICP provides for the grant of deferred share units to non-employee directors of the Company and the 2005 ICP and 2008 Plan provide for the grant of restricted stock units or deferred share units to employees. The director awards are fully vested upon issuance and are settled for Ameriprise Financial common stock upon the director’s termination of service. The employee awards generally vest ratably over

three

to

four years

. Compensation expense for deferred share units and restricted stock units is based on the market price of Ameriprise Financial stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock units and deferred stock units granted to employees are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period or on an accelerated basis if certain age and length of service requirements are met. Deferred share units granted to non-employee directors are expensed immediately. Dividends are paid on restricted stock units, as declared by the Company’s Board of Directors, during the vesting period and are not subject to forfeiture. Dividend equivalents are issued on deferred share units, as dividends are declared by the Company's Board of Directors, and are not paid until distribution of the award. Dividend equivalents on the director awards are not subject to forfeiture, but on employee awards they are forfeited if the award is forfeited.

Ameriprise Financial Deferred Compensation Plan

The Ameriprise Financial Deferred Compensation Plan (“DCP”) under the 2005 ICP gives certain employees the choice to defer a portion of their eligible compensation, which can be invested in investment options as provided by the DCP, including the Ameriprise Financial Stock Fund. The DCP is an unfunded non-qualified deferred compensation plan under section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company provides a match on certain deferrals. Participant deferrals vest immediately and the Company match vests after three years. Distributions are made in shares of the Company’s common stock for the portion of the deferral invested in the Ameriprise Financial Stock Fund and the Company match, for which the Company has recorded in equity. The DCP does allow for accelerated vesting of the share-based awards in cases of death, disability and qualified retirement. Compensation expense related to the Company match is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period or on an accelerated basis if certain age and length of service requirements are met. Dividend equivalents are issued on deferrals into the Ameriprise Financial Stock Fund and the Company match. Dividend equivalents related to deferrals are not subject to forfeiture, whereas dividend equivalents related to the Company match are subject to forfeiture until fully vested.

Ameriprise Financial Franchise Advisor Deferral Plan

The Franchise Advisor Deferral Plan gives certain advisors the choice to defer a portion of their commissions into Ameriprise Financial stock or other investment options. The Franchise Advisor Deferral Plan is an unfunded non-qualified deferred compensation plan under section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The Franchise Advisor Deferral Plan allows for the grant of share-based awards of up to

12.5

million shares of common stock. The number of units awarded is based on the performance measures, deferral percentage and the market value of Ameriprise Financial common stock on the deferral date as defined by the plan. Share-based awards are fully vested and are not subject to forfeitures.

In addition to the voluntary deferral, certain advisors are eligible to earn additional deferred stock awards on commissions over a specified threshold or based on the success of the advisors they coach. The awards vest ratably over

three

or

four years

. The Franchise Advisor Deferral Plan allows for accelerated vesting of the share-based awards based on age and years as an advisor. Commission expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Share units receive dividend equivalents, as dividends are declared by the Company’s Board of Directors, until distribution and are subject to forfeiture until vested.

Ameriprise Advisor Group Deferred Compensation Plan

The Advisor Group Deferral Plan, which was created in April 2009, allows for employee advisors to receive share-based bonus awards which are subject to future service requirements and forfeitures. The Advisor Group Deferral Plan is an unfunded non-qualified deferred compensation plan under section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The Advisor Group Deferral Plan also gives qualifying employee advisors the choice to defer a portion of their base salary or commissions. This deferral can be in the form of Ameriprise Financial stock or other investment options. Deferrals are not subject to future service requirements or forfeitures. Under the Advisor Group Deferral Plan, a maximum of

3.0

million shares may be issued. Awards granted under the Advisor Group Deferral Plan may be settled in cash and/or shares of the Company’s common stock according to the award’s terms. Share units receive dividend equivalents, as dividends are declared by the Company’s Board of Directors, until distribution and are subject to forfeiture until vested.

Performance Share Units

Under the 2005 ICP, the Company’s Executive Leadership Team may be awarded a target number of performance share units (“PSUs”). PSUs will be earned only to the extent that the Company attains certain goals relating to the Company’s performance and relative total shareholder returns against peers over a

three

-year period. The awards also have a

three

-year service condition with cliff vesting with an accelerated service condition based on age and length of service. The actual number of PSUs ultimately earned could vary from

zero

, if performance goals are not met, to as much as


%

of the target for awards made prior to 2018 and


%

of the target for awards made in 2018 or later, if performance goals are significantly exceeded. The value of each target PSU is equal to the value of one share of Ameriprise Financial common stock. The total amount of target PSUs outstanding at the end of

December 31, 2019

The Company may also reacquire shares of its common stock under its share-based compensation plans related to restricted stock awards and certain option exercises. The holders of restricted shares may elect to surrender a portion of their shares on the vesting date to cover their income tax obligation. These vested restricted shares are reacquired by the Company and the Company’s payment of the holders’ income tax obligations are recorded as a treasury share purchase.

Regulatory Requirements

Restrictions

on the transfer of funds exist under regulatory requirements applicable to certain of the Company’s subsidiaries. As of

December 31, 2019

, the aggregate amount of unrestricted net assets was approximately

$

1.9

billion

.

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) defines Risk-Based Capital (“RBC”) requirements for insurance companies. The RBC requirements are used by the NAIC and state insurance regulators to identify companies that merit regulatory actions designed to protect policyholders. These requirements apply to the Company’s life insurance companies. The Company’s life insurance companies each met their respective minimum RBC requirements.

The

Company’s life insurance companies are required to prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with the accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance departments of their respective states of domicile, which vary materially from GAAP. Prescribed statutory accounting practices include publications of the NAIC, as well as state laws, regulations and general administrative rules. The more significant differences from GAAP include charging policy acquisition costs to expense as incurred, establishing annuity and insurance reserves using different actuarial methods and assumptions, valuing investments on a different basis and excluding certain assets from the balance sheet by charging them directly to surplus, such as a portion of the net deferred income tax assets.

RiverSource Life received approval from the Minnesota Department of Commerce to apply a permitted statutory accounting practice, effective July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019, for certain derivative instruments used to economically hedge the interest rate exposure of certain variable annuity products that do not qualify for statutory hedge accounting. The permitted practice is intended to mitigate the impact to statutory surplus from the misalignment between variable annuity statutory reserves, which are not carried at fair value, and the fair value of derivatives used to economically hedge the interest rate exposure of non-life contingent living benefit guarantees.

The permitted practice allowed RiverSource Life to defer a portion of the change in fair value, net investment income and realized gains or losses generated from designated derivatives to the extent the amounts do not offset the current period interest-rate related change in the variable annuity statutory reserve liability. The deferred amount could be amortized over ten years using the straight-line method with the ability to accelerate amortization at management’s discretion. As of June 30, 2019, RiverSource Life elected to accelerate amortization of the net deferred amount associated with its permitted practice.

State

insurance statutes contain limitations as to the amount of dividends that insurers may make without providing prior notification to state regulators. For RiverSource Life, payments in excess of unassigned surplus, as determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by the State of Minnesota, require advance notice to the Minnesota Department of Commerce, RiverSource Life’s primary regulator, and are subject to potential disapproval. RiverSource Life’s statutory unassigned surplus aggregated

$


million

and

$


million

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

In

addition, dividends whose fair market value, together with that of other dividends made within the preceding 12 months, exceed the greater of the previous year’s statutory net gain from operations or


%

of the previous year-end statutory capital and surplus are referred to as “extraordinary dividends.” Extraordinary dividends also require advance notice to the Minnesota Department of Commerce, and are subject to potential disapproval. Statutory capital and surplus for RiverSource Life was

$

2.9

billion

and

$

3.3

billion

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.


Statutory net gain from operations and net income (loss) are summarized as follows:

Government

debt securities of

and


held by the Company’s life insurance subsidiaries were on deposit with various states as required by law.

Ameriprise

Certificate Company (“ACC”) is registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”). ACC markets and sells investment certificates to clients. ACC is subject to various capital requirements under the 1940 Act, laws of the State of Minnesota and understandings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the Minnesota Department of Commerce. The terms of the investment certificates issued by ACC and the provisions of the 1940 Act also require the maintenance by ACC of qualified assets. Under the provisions of its certificates and the 1940 Act, ACC was required to have qualified assets (as that term is defined in Section 28(b) of the 1940 Act) in the amount of

$

7.5

billion

and

$

7.9

billion

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively. ACC had qualified assets of

$

8.0

billion

and

$

8.4

billion

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

Ameriprise

Financial and ACC entered into a Capital Support Agreement on March 2, 2009, pursuant to which Ameriprise Financial agrees to commit such capital to ACC as is necessary to satisfy applicable minimum capital requirements. Effective April 30, 2014, this agreement was amended to revise the maximum commitment to

$


million

. For the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


, ACC did not draw upon the Capital Support Agreement and had met all applicable capital requirements.

Threadneedle’s

required capital is predominantly based on the requirements specified by its regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), under its Capital Adequacy Requirements for asset managers.

The

Company has

four

broker-dealer subsidiaries as of

December 31, 2019

, American Enterprise Investment Services Inc., Ameriprise Financial Services, LLC (previously Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc. until January 2020), RiverSource Distributors, Inc. and Columbia Management Investment Distributors, Inc. The broker-dealers are subject to the net capital requirements of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and the Uniform Net Capital requirements of the SEC under Rule 15c3-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Ameriprise

Trust Company is subject to capital adequacy requirements under the laws of the State of Minnesota as enforced by the Minnesota Department of Commerce.

Ameriprise

Bank, FSB (“Ameriprise Bank”) is subject to regulation by the Comptroller of Currency (“OCC”) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in its role as insurer of its deposits. Ameriprise Bank is required to maintain sufficient capital under specific capital rules in compliance with OCC regulations and polices, in addition to other rules and regulations governing all aspects of the banking business.

24.

Income Taxes

The components of income tax provision attributable to continuing operations were as follows:


On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law. The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 included an expense of

$


million

due to the enactment of the Tax Act. The

$


million

expense included: 1) a

$


million

expense for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities to the Tax Act’s statutory rate of 21%; 2) a

$


million

expense for the foreign provisions of the Tax Act, including a deemed repatriation tax of the Company’s total post-1986 earnings and profits (“E&P”); and 3) an

$


million

expense for the remeasurement of tax contingencies, specifically state tax contingencies and interest accrued for tax contingencies. In 2018, the Company finalized its accounting related to the Tax Act and recorded a

$


million

benefit related to foreign provisions.

The geographic sources of pretax income from continuing operations were as follows:

The principal reasons that the aggregate income tax provision attributable to continuing operations is different from that computed by using the U.S. statutory rates of 21% for 2019 and 2018 and 35% for 2017 were as follows:

The decrease in the Company’s effective tax rate for the year ended

December 31, 2018

compared to


was primarily the result of the decrease in the federal statutory rate and a

$


million

expense in 2017 due to provisions of the Tax Act, partially offset by lower levels of the dividends received deduction

and a decrease in the benefit for net excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments

.

Accumulated

earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, which totaled

$


million

as of

December 31, 2019

, are intended to be permanently reinvested outside the United States. The expected incremental tax expense on these earnings relates to potential unrecoverable foreign withholding taxes if the earnings are distributed. As of December 31, 2019, this potential future cost is estimated to be immaterial.


Deferred income tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the assets and liabilities measured for GAAP reporting versus income tax return purposes.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the statutory rate of 21% as of both December 31, 2019 and 2018.

The

significant components of the Company’s deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are included net within other assets or other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were as follows:

Included

in the Company’s deferred income tax assets are tax benefits primarily related to state net operating losses of

$


million

, net of federal benefit, which will expire beginning December 31,


. Based on analysis of the Company’s tax position, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize certain state net operating losses of

$


million

, state deferred tax assets of

$


million

and foreign deferred tax assets of

$


million

; therefore, a valuation allowance of

$


million

has been established.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:

If recognized, approximately

$


million

,

$


million

and

$


million

, net of federal tax benefits, of unrecognized tax benefits as of

December 31, 2019

,


, and


, respectively, would affect the effective tax rate.

It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next 12 months. The Company estimates that the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by

$


million

to

$


million

in the next 12 months primarily due to Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) settlements and state exams.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision. The Company recognized a net decrease of

$


million

, a net increase of

$


million

, and

nil

in interest and penalties for the years ended


December 31, 2019

,


, and


, respectively. As of

December 31, 2019

and


, the Company had a payable of

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, related to accrued interest and penalties.

The Company or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the third quarter of 2019, the federal statutes of limitation closed for the 2014 and 2015 tax years. The Company’s tax returns for 2014 and 2015 are effectively settled except for one issue which was claimed on amended returns filed in the second quarter of 2019. The IRS is currently auditing the Company’s U.S. income tax returns for 2016 and 2017. The Company’s state income tax returns are currently under examination by various jurisdictions for years ranging from 2009 through 2017. In the United Kingdom (“UK”), Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs is performing a business risk review of the company’s UK subsidiaries for the 2016 tax year.

Retirement Plans and Profit Sharing Arrangements

Defined Benefit Plans

Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

The Company’s U.S. non-advisor employees are generally eligible for the Ameriprise Financial Retirement Plan (the “Retirement Plan”), a noncontributory defined benefit plan which is a qualified plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”). Funding of costs for the Retirement Plan complies with the applicable minimum funding requirements specified by ERISA and is held in a trust. The Retirement Plan is a cash balance plan by which the employees’ accrued benefits are based on notional account balances, which are maintained for each individual. Each pay period these balances are credited with an amount equal to a percentage of eligible compensation as defined by the Retirement Plan (which includes, but is not limited to, base pay, performance based incentive pay, commissions, shift differential and overtime). Prior to March 1, 2010, the percentage ranged from

2.5

%

to


%

based on employees’ age plus years of service. Effective March 1, 2010, the percentage ranges from

2.5

%

to


%

based on employees’ years of service. Employees eligible for the plan at the time of the change will continue to receive the same percentage they were receiving until the new schedule becomes more favorable. Employees’ balances are also credited with a fixed rate of interest that is updated each January 1 and is based on the average of the daily

five

-year U.S. Treasury Note yields for the previous October 1 through November 30, with a minimum crediting rate of


%

. Employees are fully vested after

three years

of service or upon retirement at or after age 65, disability or death while employed. Employees have the option to receive annuity payments or a lump sum payout of vested balance at termination or retirement. The Retirement Plan’s year-end is September 30.

Effective April 2020, the Company will no longer enroll employees in the Retirement Plan. Instead, newly eligible employees will receive a company contribution to the Ameriprise Financial 401(k) Plan (the “401(k) Plan”). Active participants in the Retirement Plan as of April 2020 will continue to receive company allocations to the Retirement Plan each pay period. However, the company allocations to the Retirement Plan will not increase from the percentage received as of April 2020. These plan changes are reflected in the obligations disclosed as of December 31, 2019.

In addition, the Company sponsors the Ameriprise Financial Supplemental Retirement Plan (the “SRP”), an unfunded non-qualified deferred compensation plan subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. This plan is for certain highly compensated employees to replace the benefit that cannot be provided by the Retirement Plan due to IRS limits. The SRP generally parallels the Retirement Plan but offers different payment options.

The Company also sponsors unfunded defined benefit postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance to retired U.S. employees. On December 31, 2016, the access to retiree health care coverage was closed to all active employees who had previously met the qualification requirements. Instead, only existing retirees, as of January 1, 2017, qualifying for the plan and electing coverage will be provided a fixed amount to subsidize health care insurance purchased through other providers. Net periodic postretirement benefit costs were not material for the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


and


.

Most employees outside the U.S. are covered by local retirement plans, some of which are funded, while other employees receive payments at the time of retirement or termination under applicable labor laws or agreements.

All components of the net periodic benefit cost are recorded in general and administrative expense and were as follows:


The prior service costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active participants. Actuarial gains and losses in excess of


%

of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected average remaining service period of active participants.

The following table provides a reconciliation of changes in the benefit obligation:

The actuarial loss for pension plans for 2019 was primarily

due to a decrease in the discount rate assumption as of December 31,


compared to the prior year-end, as well as demographic experience during the Retirement Plan year.

The actuarial gain for pension plans for 2018 was primarily

due to an increase in the discount rate assumption as of December 31,


compared to the prior year-end, partially offset by demographic experience during the Retirement Plan year.

The following table provides a reconciliation of changes in the fair value of assets:

The following table provides information for pension plans with benefit obligations in excess of plan assets:

The weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations were as follows:

The weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost of pension plans were as follows:

In developing the expected long-term rate of return on assets, management evaluated input from an external consulting firm, including their projection of asset class return expectations and long-term inflation assumptions. The Company also considered historical returns on the plans’ assets. Discount rates are based on yields available on high-quality corporate bonds that would generate cash flows necessary to pay the benefits when due.

The Company’s pension plans’ assets are invested in an aggregate diversified portfolio to minimize the impact of any adverse or unexpected results from a security class on the entire portfolio. Diversification is interpreted to include diversification by asset type, performance and risk characteristics and number of investments. When appropriate and consistent with the objectives of the plans, derivative instruments may be used to mitigate risk or provide further diversification, subject to the investment policies of the plans. Asset classes and ranges considered appropriate for investment of the plans’ assets are determined by each plan’s investment committee. The target allocations are


%

equity securities,


%

debt securities and


%

all other types of investments, except for the assets in pooled pension funds which are


%

equity securities and


%

debt securities and additional voluntary contribution assets outside the U.S. which are allocated at the discretion of the individual and will be converted at retirement into the defined benefit pension plan. Actual allocations will generally be within


%

of these targets. As of

December 31, 2019

, there were no significant holdings of any single issuer and the exposure to derivative instruments was not significant.


The following tables present the Company’s pension plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

(1)

Amounts are comprised of certain investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient and have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

Equity securities are managed to track the performance of common market indices for both U.S. and non-U.S. securities, primarily across large cap, small cap and emerging market asset classes. Debt securities are managed to track the performance of common market indices for both U.S. and non-U.S. investment grade bonds as well as a pool of U.S. high yield bonds. Collective investment funds include equity and debt securities. Real estate funds are managed to track the performance of a broad population of investment grade non-agricultural income producing properties. The Company’s investments in hedge funds include investments in a multi-strategy fund and an off-shore fund managed to track the performance of broad fund of fund indices. Pooled pension funds are managed to track a specific benchmark based on the investment objectives of the fund. Cash equivalents consist of holdings in a money market fund that seeks to equal the return of the three month U.S. Treasury bill.

The fair value of equity securities using quoted prices in active markets is classified as Level 1. Level 1 debt securities include U.S. Treasuries and actively traded mutual funds. Level 2 debt securities include mortgage and asset backed securities, agency


securities and corporate debt securities. The fair value of the Level 2 securities is determined based on a market approach using observable inputs.

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company’s employees are generally eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan. The 401(k) Plan allows eligible employees to make contributions through payroll deductions up to IRS limits and invest their contributions in one or more of the 401(k) Plan investment options, which include the Ameriprise Financial Stock Fund. The Company provides a dollar for dollar match up to the first


%

of eligible compensation an employee contributes on a pretax and/or Roth 401(k) basis for each annual period. Effective April 2020, employees not eligible to participate in the Retirement Plan will receive a 2% company contribution to their 401(k) Plan once they become eligible for contributions.

Under the 401(k) Plan, employees become eligible for contributions under the plan during the pay period they reach


days

of service. Match contributions are fully vested after

Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies

Commitments

The following table presents the Company’s funding commitments as of December 31:

Guarantees

The Company’s life and annuity products all have minimum interest rate guarantees in their fixed accounts. As of

December 31, 2019

, t

hese guarantees range from


%

to


%

.

Contingencies

The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in the normal course of business in legal proceedings which include regulatory inquiries, arbitration and litigation, including class actions concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of its activities as a diversified financial services firm. These include proceedings specific to the Company as well as proceedings generally applicable to


business practices in the industries in which it operates. The Company can also be subject to legal proceedings arising out of its general business activities, such as its investments, contracts, leases and employment relationships. Uncertain economic conditions, heightened and sustained volatility in the financial markets and significant financial reform legislation may increase the likelihood that clients and other persons or regulators may present or threaten legal claims or that regulators increase the scope or frequency of examinations of the Company or the financial services industry generally.

As with other financial services firms, the level of regulatory activity and inquiry concerning the Company’s businesses remains elevated. From time to time, the Company receives requests for information from, and/or has been subject to examination or claims by, the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the OCC, the UK Financial Conduct Authority, the FRB, state insurance and securities regulators, state attorneys general and various other domestic or foreign governmental and quasi-governmental authorities on behalf of themselves or clients concerning the Company’s business activities and practices, and the practices of the Company’s financial advisors. The Company typically has numerous pending matters which include information requests, exams or inquiries that the Company has received during recent periods regarding certain matters, including: sales and distribution of mutual funds, exchange traded funds, annuities, equity and fixed income securities, real estate investment trusts, insurance products, and financial advice offerings, including managed accounts; supervision of the Company’s financial advisors and other associated persons; administration of insurance and annuity claims; security of client information; trading activity and the Company’s monitoring and supervision of such activity; and transaction monitoring systems and controls. The Company has cooperated and will continue to cooperate with the applicable regulators.

These legal and regulatory proceedings are subject to uncertainties and, as such, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even reasonably possible, or to reasonably estimate the amount of any loss. The Company cannot predict with certainty if, how or when any such proceedings will be initiated or resolved. Matters frequently need to be more developed before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding. An adverse outcome in one or more proceeding could eventually result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, in addition to further claims, examinations or adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Company establishes an accrued liability for contingent litigation and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company discloses the nature of the contingency when management believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that the outcome may be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. In such cases, there still may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts reasonably estimated and accrued. When a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrued liability, but continues to monitor, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling a matter, further developments that would make such loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. Once the Company establishes an accrued liability with respect to a loss contingency, the Company continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established, and any appropriate adjustments are made each quarter.

Guaranty Fund Assessments

RiverSource Life and RiverSource Life of NY are required by law to be a member of the guaranty fund association in every state where they are licensed to do business. In the event of insolvency of one or more unaffiliated insurance companies, the Company could be adversely affected by the requirement to pay assessments to the guaranty fund associations. The Company projects its cost of future guaranty fund assessments based on estimates of insurance company insolvencies provided by the National Organization of Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Associations (“NOLHGA”) and the amount of its premiums written relative to the industry-wide premium in each state. The Company accrues the estimated cost of future guaranty fund assessments when it is considered probable that an assessment will be imposed, the event obligating the Company to pay the assessment has occurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated.

The Company has a liability for estimated guaranty fund assessments and a related premium tax asset. As of both

December 31, 2019

and


, the estimated liability was

$


million

. As of

December 31, 2019

and


, the related premium tax asset was

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively. The expected period over which guaranty fund assessments will be made and the related tax credits recovered is not known.

27.

Related Party Transactions

The Company may engage in transactions in the ordinary course of business with significant shareholders or their subsidiaries, between the Company and its directors and officers or with other companies whose directors or officers may also serve as directors or officers for the Company or its subsidiaries. The Company carries out these transactions on customary terms.

The Company’s executive officers and directors may have transactions with the Company or its subsidiaries involving financial products and insurance services. All obligations arising from these transactions are in the ordinary course of the Company’s business and are on the same terms in effect for comparable transactions with the general public. Such obligations involve normal risks of collection and do not have features or terms that are unfavorable to the Company or its subsidiaries.

These transactions have not had a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.


28.

Segment Information

The Company’s reporting segments are Advice & Wealth Management, Asset Management, Annuities, Protection and Corporate & Other.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those of the Company, except for operating adjustments defined below, the method of capital allocation, the accounting for gains (losses) from intercompany revenues and expenses and not providing for income taxes on a segment basis.

The largest source of intersegment revenues and expenses is retail distribution services, where segments are charged transfer pricing rates that approximate arm’s length market prices for distribution through the Advice & Wealth Management segment. The Advice & Wealth Management segment provides distribution services for affiliated and non-affiliated products and services. The Asset Management segment provides investment management services for the Company’s owned assets and client assets, and accordingly charges investment and advisory management fees to the other segments. All intersegment activity is eliminated in the Company’s consolidated results.

All costs related to shared services are allocated to the segments based on a rate times volume or fixed basis.

The Advice & Wealth Management segment provides financial planning and advice, as well as full-service brokerage services, primarily to retail clients through the Company’s advisors. These services are centered on long-term, personal relationships between the Company’s advisors and its clients and focus on helping clients achieve their financial goals. The Company’s advisors provide a distinctive approach to financial planning and have access to a broad selection of both affiliated and non-affiliated products to help clients meet their financial needs and goals. A significant portion of revenues in this segment are fee-based and driven by the level of client assets, which is impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. The Company also earns net investment income on owned assets primarily from certificate and banking products. This segment earns revenues (distribution fees) for distributing non-affiliated products and intersegment revenues (distribution fees) for distributing the Company’s affiliated products and services provided to its retail clients. Intersegment expenses for this segment include expenses for investment management services provided by the Asset Management segment.

The Asset Management segment provides investment management, advice and products to retail, high net worth and institutional clients on a global scale through the

Columbia Threadneedle Investments

®

brand, which represents the combined capabilities, resources and reach of Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC (“Columbia Management”) and Threadneedle. Columbia Management primarily provides products and services in the U.S. and Threadneedle primarily provides products and services internationally. The Company offers U.S. retail clients with a range of products through both unaffiliated third party financial institutions and the Advice & Wealth Management segment. The Company provides institutional products and services through its institutional sales force. Retail products for non-U.S. investors are primarily distributed through third-party financial institutions and unaffiliated financial advisors. Retail products include U.S. mutual funds and their non-U.S. equivalents, exchange-traded funds and variable product funds underlying insurance and annuity separate accounts. Institutional asset management services are designed to meet specific client objectives and may involve a range of products, including those that focus on traditional asset classes, separately managed accounts, individually managed accounts, CLOs, hedge fund or alternative strategies, collective funds and property funds. CLOs, hedge fund or alternative strategies and certain private funds are often classified as alternative assets. Revenues in this segment are primarily earned as fees based on managed asset balances, which are impacted by market movements, net asset flows, asset allocation and product mix. The Company may also earn performance fees from certain accounts where investment performance meets or exceeds certain pre-identified targets. The Asset Management segment also provides intercompany asset management services for Ameriprise Financial subsidiaries. The fees for all such services are reflected within the Asset Management segment results through intersegment transfer pricing. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by the Advice & Wealth Management and Annuities and Protection segments.

The Annuities segment provides variable and fixed annuity products of RiverSource Life companies to individual clients. The Company provides variable and fixed annuity products through its advisors. Revenues for the Company’s variable annuity products are primarily earned as fees based on underlying account balances, which are impacted by both market movements and net asset flows. Revenues for the Company’s fixed deferred annuity products are primarily earned as net investment income on the RiverSource Life companies’ general account assets supporting fixed account balances, with profitability significantly impacted by the spread between net investment income earned and interest credited on the fixed account balances. The Company also earns net investment income on general account assets supporting reserves for immediate annuities with a non-life contingent feature and for certain guaranteed benefits offered with variable annuities and on capital supporting the business. Revenues for the Company’s immediate annuities with a life contingent feature are earned as premium revenue. Intersegment revenues for this segment reflect fees paid by the Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of variable insurance trust funds (“VIT Funds”) under the variable annuity contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by the Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by the Asset Management segment.

The Protection segment offers a variety of products to address the protection and risk management needs of the Company’s retail clients including life and DI insurance. Life and DI products are primarily provided through the Company’s advisors. The Company issues insurance policies through its RiverSource life insurance subsidiaries. The primary sources of revenues for this segment are


premiums, fees and charges that the Company receives to assume insurance-related risk. The Company earns net investment income on owned assets supporting insurance reserves and capital supporting the business. The Company also receives fees based on the level of the RiverSource Life companies’ separate account assets supporting VUL investment options. This segment earns intersegment revenues from fees paid by the Asset Management segment for marketing support and other services provided in connection with the availability of VIT Funds under the VUL contracts. Intersegment expenses for this segment include distribution expenses for services provided by the Advice & Wealth Management segment, as well as expenses for investment management services provided by the Asset Management segment.

The Corporate & Other segment consists of net investment income or loss on corporate level assets, including excess capital held in the Company’s subsidiaries and other unallocated equity and other revenues as well as unallocated corporate expenses. The Corporate & Other segment also includes the results of the Company’s closed block long term care business. The Corporate & Other segment also includes revenues and expenses of consolidated investment entities, which are excluded on an operating basis. Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, the results of AAH, which had been reported as part of the Protection segment, were reflected in the Corporate & Other segment. Prior periods presented have been restated to reflect the change. The Company sold AAH on October 1, 2019.

Management uses segment adjusted operating measures in goal setting, as a basis for determining employee compensation and in evaluating performance on a basis comparable to that used by some securities analysts and investors. Consistent with GAAP accounting guidance for segment reporting, adjusted operating earnings is the Company’s measure of segment performance. Adjusted operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP pretax income. The Company believes the presentation of segment adjusted operating earnings, as the Company measures it for management purposes, enhances the understanding of its business by reflecting the underlying performance of its core operations and facilitating a more meaningful trend analysis.

Effective first quarter of 2019, management has excluded mean reversion related impacts from the Company’s adjusted operating measures. Prior periods have been updated to reflect this change to be consistent with the current period presentation. The mean reversion related impact is defined as the impact on variable annuity and VUL products for the difference between assumed and updated separate account investment performance on DAC, DSIC, unearned revenue amortization, reinsurance accrual and additional insurance benefit reserves.

Adjusted operating earnings is defined as adjusted operating net revenues less adjusted operating expenses. Adjusted operating net revenues and adjusted operating expenses exclude the market impact on IUL benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization, unearned revenue amortization, and the reinsurance accrual), mean reversion related impacts, integration and restructuring charges, gain or loss on disposal of a business that is not considered discontinued operations, results of discontinued operations and the impact of consolidating investment entities. Adjusted operating net revenues also exclude net realized investment gains or losses (net of unearned revenue amortization and the reinsurance accrual) and the market impact of hedges to offset interest rate changes on unrealized gains or losses for certain investments. Adjusted operating expenses also exclude the market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits (net of hedges and the related DSIC and DAC amortization), the market impact on fixed index annuity benefits (net of hedges and the related DAC amortization), and the DSIC and DAC amortization offset to net realized investment gains or losses. The market impact on variable annuity guaranteed benefits, fixed index annuity benefits and IUL benefits includes changes in embedded derivative values caused by changes in financial market conditions, net of changes in economic hedge values and unhedged items including the difference between assumed and actual underlying separate account investment performance, fixed income credit exposures, transaction costs and certain policyholder contract elections, net of related impacts on DAC and DSIC amortization. The market impact also includes certain valuation adjustments made in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, including the impact on embedded derivative values of discounting projected benefits to reflect a current estimate of the Company’s life insurance subsidiary’s nonperformance spread.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We

maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be reported in the Exchange Act filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in and pursuant to SEC regulations, including controls and procedures designed to ensure that this information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure. It should be noted that, because of inherent limitations, our company’s disclosure controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met.

Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance as of

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth fiscal quarter of the year to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company.

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, and includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


Because

of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The

Company’s management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

. In making this assessment, the Company’s management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Based

on management’s assessment and those criteria, we believe that, as of

December 31, 2019

, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
