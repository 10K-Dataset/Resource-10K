COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION

ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED AUGUST 29, 2004



PART I

Item 1—Business

Costco
Wholesale Corporation (“Costco” or the “Company”) began operations in 1983 in Seattle, Washington. In October 1993, Costco merged with The Price Company, which had pioneered the membership warehouse concept in 1976, to form
Price/Costco, Inc., a Delaware corporation. In January 1997, after the spin-off of most of its non-warehouse assets to Price Enterprises, Inc., the Company changed its name to Costco Companies, Inc. On August 30, 1999, the Company reincorporated
from Delaware to Washington and changed its name to Costco Wholesale Corporation, which trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol “COST”.

General

Costco operates membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members very low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected private label products in a wide range of merchandise
categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. This rapid inventory turnover, when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in
no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, enables Costco to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers, discount retailers and supermarkets.

Costco buys the majority of its merchandise directly from manufacturers for shipment either directly to Costco’s
selling warehouses or to a consolidation point (“depot”) where various shipments are combined so as to minimize freight and handling costs. As a result, Costco eliminates many of the costs associated with multiple step distribution
channels, which include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers, use of central receiving, storing and distributing warehouses, and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor. By providing this more cost-effective means
of distributing goods, Costco meets the needs of business customers who otherwise would pay a premium for small purchases and for the distribution services of traditional wholesalers, and who cannot otherwise obtain the full range of their product
requirements from any single source. In addition, these business members will often combine personal shopping with their business purchases. The cost savings on brand name and selected private label merchandise are the primary motivation for
individuals shopping for their personal needs. Costco’s merchandise selection is designed to appeal to both the business and consumer requirements of its members by offering a wide range of nationally branded and selected private label
products, often in case, carton or multiple-pack quantities, at attractively low prices.

Because of its high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover, Costco generally has the opportunity to receive cash from the sale of a substantial portion of its inventory at mature warehouse operations before it is
required to pay all its merchandise vendors, even though Costco takes advantage of early payment terms to obtain payment discounts. As sales in a given warehouse increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid, a greater percentage of the
inventory is financed through payment terms provided by vendors rather than by working capital.

Costco’s typical warehouse format averages approximately 139,000 square feet. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of
selling space, in the handling of merchandise and in the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the availability of low prices on brand name and selected private label goods, Costco’s warehouses need not be located
on prime commercial real estate sites or have elaborate facilities.

By strictly controlling the entrances and exits of its warehouses and using a membership format, Costco has been able to limit inventory losses to approximately two-tenths of one percent of net sales—well below those of typical
discount retail operations. Losses associated with dishonored checks have also been minimal and bank information from business members is verified prior to establishing a check purchase limit. Members are identified and prevented from cashing checks
at the point of sale when they have presented dishonored checks to Costco.



Item 1—Business (Continued)

Costco’s policy is generally to limit marketing and promotional expenses to new warehouse openings, occasional direct
mail marketing to prospective new members and direct marketing programs to existing members promoting selected merchandise. These practices result in lower marketing expenses as compared to typical discount retailers and supermarkets. In connection
with new warehouse openings, Costco’s marketing teams personally contact businesses in the area that are potential wholesale members. These contacts are supported by direct mailings during the period immediately prior to opening. Potential Gold
Star (individual) members are contacted by direct mail or by providing such mailings to be distributed through employee associations and other entities. After a membership base is established in an area, most new memberships result from
word-of-mouth advertising, follow-up contact by direct mail distributed through regular payroll or other organizational communications to employee groups and ongoing direct solicitations to prospective wholesale members.

Costco’s warehouses generally operate on a seven-day, 68-hour week, and
are open somewhat longer during the holiday season. Generally, warehouses are open weekdays between 10:00 a.m. and 8:30 p.m., with earlier closing hours on the weekend. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours of
operation are shorter than those of traditional wholesalers, discount retailers and supermarkets and due to other operational efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is
generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities of each item, thereby reducing labor required for handling and stocking. In addition, sales are processed through centralized, automated check-out
stands. Most items are not individually price-marked; rather, each item is bar-coded so it can be scanned into electronic cash registers. This allows price changes without remarking merchandise. Substantially all manufacturers provide merchandise
pre-marked with the item numbers and bar codes and many provide special, larger package sizes.

Costco’s merchandising strategy is to provide the customer with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than could be
obtained through traditional wholesalers, discount retailers or supermarkets. An important element of this strategy is to carry only those products on which Costco can provide its members significant cost savings. Items that members may request but
that cannot be purchased at prices low enough to pass along meaningful cost savings are often not carried. Costco seeks to limit specific items in each product line to fast selling models, sizes and colors. Therefore, the Company carries an average
of approximately 4,000 active stockkeeping units (“SKU’s”) per warehouse in its core warehouse business, as opposed to discount retailers and supermarkets that normally stock 40,000 to 60,000 SKU’s or more. These practices are
consistent with Costco’s membership policies of satisfying both the business and personal shopping needs of its wholesale members, thereby encouraging high volume shopping. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton or
multiple-pack quantities only. Appliances, equipment and tools often feature commercial and professional models. In keeping with its policy of customer satisfaction, Costco’s policy is to accept returns of merchandise within a reasonable time
after purchase.

The following table indicates the approximate
percentage of net sales accounted for by each major category of items sold by Costco during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002:



Item 1—Business (Continued)

Costco has direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand name merchandise. No significant portion of
merchandise is obtained by Costco from any one of these or any other single supplier. Costco has not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise, and believes that if one or more of its current sources of supply
became unavailable, it would be able to obtain alternative sources without experiencing a substantial disruption of its business. Costco may also purchase selected private label merchandise of the same product, as long as quality and customer demand
are comparable and the savings to its members are greater.

Financial information of the Company’s segments and geographic areas is included in Note 9, Segment Reporting, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Costco reports on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the
end of August. The first, second and third quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). There is no material seasonal impact on Costco’s
operations, except an increased level of sales and earnings during the Christmas holiday season. Fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002 all consisted of 52 weeks.

Membership Policy

Costco’s membership format is designed to reinforce customer loyalty and provide a continuing source of membership fee revenue. Costco has two
primary types of members: Business and Gold Star (individual) members. In addition, the Company offers an Executive Membership program to both Business and Gold Star members.

Businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license or other evidence of business existence, may
become Business members. Costco promotes Business membership through its merchandise selection and its membership marketing programs. Business members generally pay an annual membership fee of $45 for the primary and spouse membership card with
add-on membership cards available for an annual fee of $35 (including a free spouse card).

Individual memberships (Gold Star Memberships) are available to employees of federal, state and local governments, financial institutions, corporations, utility and transportation companies, public and private
educational institutions, other organizations and to other persons. Individual members generally pay an annual membership fee of $45, which includes a spouse card.

Executive memberships are available to all members for an annual fee of $100. The Executive Membership program offers
members additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services offered by Costco, such as merchant credit card processing, small business loans, auto and home insurance, long-distance telephone service, check printing, and real
estate and mortgage services. The services offered are generally provided by third-party providers and vary by state. In addition, Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per
year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco.

As of August
29, 2004, Costco had approximately 4.8 million primary Business memberships and approximately 15.0 million Gold Star memberships. Included within this membership base are approximately 2.9 million members that have upgraded to the Executive
Membership program. Members can utilize their memberships at any Costco warehouse location.

Labor

As of August 29,
2004, Costco had approximately 113,000 employees, including approximately 7,000 individuals who were employed by Costco Mexico (a 50%-owned joint venture), which is not consolidated. Approximately forty-five percent of the employee base is
part-time. Approximately 13,600 hourly employees in California, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and one warehouse in Virginia are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. All remaining employees are non-union. Costco considers its
employee relations to be good.



Item 1—Business (Continued)

Competition

The Company operates in the rapidly changing and highly competitive merchandising industry. When The Price Company pioneered the membership warehouse club
concept in 1976, the dominant companies selling comparable lines of merchandise were department stores, grocery stores and traditional wholesalers. Since then, new merchandising concepts and aggressive marketing techniques have led to a more intense
and focused competitive environment. Wal-Mart has become the largest retailer in the United States (and the world) and has expanded further into various food merchandising formats. Target has also emerged as a significant retail competitor. Over
1,100 warehouse club locations exist across the U.S. and Canada, including the 390 warehouses operated by the Company in North America; and every major metropolitan area has one, if not several, club operations. Low-cost operators selling a single
category or narrow range of merchandise, such as Lowe’s, Home Depot, Office Depot, PetSmart, Toys-R-Us, Best Buy, Circuit City and Barnes & Noble, have significant market share in their categories. New forms of retailing involving modern
technology are boosting sales in certain stores, while home shopping and electronic commerce over the Internet is becoming increasingly popular. Likewise, in the institutional food business, companies such as Smart & Final, which operates
predominately in California, Washington, Oregon and Arizona, are capturing an increasingly greater share of the institutional food business from wholesale operators and others.

Regulation

Certain state laws require that the Company apply minimum markups to its selling prices for specific goods, such as tobacco products and alcoholic
beverages. While compliance with such laws may cause the Company to charge somewhat higher prices than it otherwise would charge, other retailers are also typically governed by the same restrictions, and the Company believes that compliance with
such laws does not have a material adverse effect on its operations.

It is the policy of the Company to sell at lower than manufacturers’ suggested retail prices. Some manufacturers attempt to maintain the resale price of their products by refusing to sell to the Company or to other purchasers that do
not adhere to suggested retail prices or that otherwise sell at discounted prices. To date, the Company believes that it has not been materially affected by its inability to purchase directly from such manufacturers. Both federal and state
legislation is proposed from time to time which, if enacted, would restrict the Company’s ability to purchase goods or extend the application of laws enabling the establishment of minimum prices. The Company cannot predict the effect on its
business of the enactment of such federal or state legislation.

Certain states, counties and municipalities have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operations or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including the Company, within their
jurisdictions. The Company believes that, if enacted, such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations.

Item 2—Properties

Warehouse Properties

At August 29, 2004, Costco operated 417 warehouse clubs:
327 in the United States (in 36 states and Puerto Rico); 63 in Canada (in 9 Canadian provinces); 15 in the United Kingdom (12 in England; 3 in Scotland); five in Korea; three in Taiwan; and four in Japan. The following is a summary of owned and
leased warehouses by region:

NUMBER OF WAREHOUSES

The following
schedule shows warehouse openings (net of warehouse closings) by region for the past five fiscal years and expected openings (net of closings) through December 31, 2004:

At August 29, 2004,
the Company operated (through a 50%-owned joint venture, of which Costco is the managing partner) 24 warehouses in Mexico. These warehouses are not included in the number of warehouses open in any period because the joint venture is accounted for
using the equity method and, therefore, its operations are not consolidated in the Company’s financial statements.

The Company’s headquarters are located in Issaquah, Washington. Additionally, the Company maintains regional buying and administrative offices,
operates regional cross-docking facilities (depots) for the consolidation and distribution of certain shipments to the warehouses, and operates various processing, packaging, and other facilities to support ancillary and other businesses.



Item 3—Legal Proceedings

The
Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. The Company is a defendant in two actions purportedly brought as class actions on behalf of certain present and former
Costco managers in California, in which plaintiffs allege that they have not been properly compensated for overtime work. Scott M. Williams v. Costco Wholesale Corporation, United States District Court (San Diego), Case No. 02-CV-2003 NAJ (JFS);
Superior Court for the County of San Diego, Case No. GIC-792559; Greg Randall v. Costco Wholesale Corporation, Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles, Case No. BC-296369. The Company is also a defendant in an overtime compensation case
purportedly brought as a class action on behalf of present and former hourly employees in California, in which plaintiffs allege that Costco’s semi-annual bonus formula is improper with regard to retroactive overtime pay. Anthony Marin v.
Costco Wholesale Corporation, Superior Court for the County of Alameda, Case No. RG-04150447. Claims in these three actions are made under various provisions of the California Labor Code and the California Business and Professions Code. Plaintiffs
seek restitution/disgorgement, compensatory damages, various statutory penalties, liquidated damages, punitive, treble and exemplary damages, and attorneys’ fees. The Company also is a defendant in an action purportedly brought as a class
action on behalf of certain present and former female managers, in which plaintiffs allege denial of promotion based on gender in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Shirley “Rae” Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corporation,
United States District Court (San Francisco), Case No. C-04-3341-MHP. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages, exemplary and punitive damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees. In none of these four cases has the Court been asked yet to
determine whether the action should proceed as a class action or, if so, the definition of the class. The Company expects to vigorously defend these actions and does not believe that any claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the
aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or results of its operations.

Item 4—Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

The Company’s annual meeting is scheduled for 10:00 a.m. on January 27, 2005, at the Meydenbauer Center in Bellevue, Washington. Matters to be voted on will be included in the Company’s proxy statement to be
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and distributed to stockholders prior to the meeting.



PART II

Item 5—Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Costco Common Stock is quoted on The NASDAQ Stock Market’s National Market under the symbol “COST.”

The following table sets forth the closing high and low sales prices of
Costco Common Stock for the period January 1, 2002 through October 29, 2004. The quotations are as reported in published financial sources.

On October 29, 2004
the Company had 7,754 stockholders of record.

Participants in
the Company’s 401(k) plan have purchased more shares of the Company’s common stock in their plan accounts than were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company received no proceeds from any of these sales. Upon
receipt of regulatory approvals, the Company presently intends to make a rescission offer to plan participants who purchased the Company’s common stock in 401(k) plan accounts during the preceding twelve months. The Company does not believe
that the rescission offer will materially impact its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

DIVIDEND POLICY

Under its two revolving credit agreements, Costco is generally permitted to pay dividends in any fiscal year up to an amount equal to fifty percent of its
consolidated net income for that fiscal year. On April 28, 2004, Costco declared its first quarterly cash dividend. The first dividend of $0.10 per share was paid May 31, 2004, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 10, 2004. The
second dividend of $0.10 per share was paid August 27, 2004 to shareholders of record at the close of business on July 23, 2004.

Payment of future dividends is subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Factors considered in determining the size of the dividends are
profitability and expected capital needs of the Company. Subject to the qualifications stated above, the Company presently expects to pay dividends on a quarterly basis.

EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS

Information related to the Company’s equity compensation plans is incorporated herein by reference to the Proxy Statement. The Proxy Statement will
be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission within 120 days of the end of the Company’s fiscal year.

Executive Overview and Selected Consolidated Statements of Income Data
(dollars in thousands, except earnings per share)

Overview

Costco operates membership warehouses based
on the concept that offering members very low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected private label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. This rapid
inventory turnover, when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, enables Costco to operate profitably at
significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers, discount retailers and supermarkets.

Key items for fiscal year 2004 included:

•

Net sales increased 13.1% over the prior year, driven by an increase in comparable sales of 10% and the opening of 20 new warehouses;

•

Membership fees for fiscal 2004 increased 12.7% to $961,280 representing new member sign ups at new warehouses opened during the fiscal year, increasing penetration of the
Company’s Executive Membership program, and continued strong member renewal rates;

•

Gross margin (net sales less merchandise costs) improved three basis points as a percent of net sales over the prior year, resulting in part from a fourteen basis point improvement
in margin in merchandise and ancillary departments;

•

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales improved eight basis points over the prior year, largely due to higher sales, changes to our health care
plans and a flattening of the rising trend in our workers’ compensation costs;

•

Net income for fiscal 2004 increased 22.4% to $882,393, or $1.85 per diluted share; and

•

For the first time, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend, and the Company issued quarterly dividends in the third and fourth quarters of $0.10 per share.

SELECTED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME DATA

The table below presents selected operational data, the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the Consolidated
Statements of Income and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items.

(a)

Defined as net sales less merchandise costs.

Comparison of Fiscal 2004 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2003 (52 weeks):

(dollars in thousands, except earnings per share)

Net Income

Net income
for fiscal 2004 increased 22.4% to $882,393, or $1.85 per diluted share, from $721,000, or $1.53 per diluted share during fiscal year 2003.

Net Sales

Net sales increased 13.1% to $47,145,712 in fiscal 2004 from $41,692,699 in fiscal 2003. Approximately 78% of the increase was due to an increase in
comparable warehouse sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year. The balance of the increase was due to opening 20 new warehouses during fiscal 2004 and a net of 23 new warehouses (29 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2003, a portion
of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales. Net sales were reduced by the implementation of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03-10, “Application of Issue No. 02-16, “Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller)
for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor,” by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers,” which was effective at the beginning of the Company’s fiscal 2004 third quarter. EITF 03-10, which primarily
impacts the Company’s vendor coupon programs, reduces net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount and does not affect the Company’s consolidated gross margin or net income. Had EITF 03-10 been in effect for the comparable periods in
fiscal 2003, the net sales increase in fiscal 2004 would have been 13.8%. (See Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, EITF 03-10.)

For fiscal 2004, comparable sales increased 10% from fiscal 2003. Had EITF 03-10 been in effect for the comparable periods in fiscal 2003, the comparable
sales increase for fiscal 2004 would have been 11%.



Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Continued)

Changes in prices of merchandise did not materially affect the sales increases, with the exception of gasoline, where price increases accounted for a
sales increase of approximately 70 basis points. In addition, due to the weaker U.S. dollar throughout fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales, accounting for a
comparable sales increase of approximately 190 basis points year-over-year. Sales were also positively impacted by the supermarket strikes in Southern California during the first half of the Company’s fiscal year. The positive impact to sales
for the entire fiscal year was estimated to be 35 to 50 basis points.

Membership Fees

Membership fees increased
12.7% to $961,280, or 2.04% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $852,853, or 2.05% of net sales, in fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily due to additional membership sign-ups at the 20 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2004; increased penetration of
the Company’s Executive membership, including the rollout of the program into Canada, which began in the first quarter of fiscal 2004; and high overall member renewal rates consistent with recent years, currently at 86%.

Gross Margin

Gross margin increased 13.4% to $5,053,696, or 10.72% of net sales, in fiscal 2004 from $4,457,316, or 10.69% of net sales,
in fiscal 2003. The three basis point increase, as a percent of net sales, reflected a 14 basis point increase in gross margin in the Company’s merchandise departments, helped by strong year-over-year gross margin gains in the Company’s
ancillary business operations, particularly gasoline and pharmacy. Year-over-year gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was also positively impacted by the implementation of EITF 03-10, whereby net sales and merchandise costs were reduced,
resulting in an eight basis point increase. The year-over-year gross margin percentage was reduced by 12 basis points due to the increased rewards related to the Executive Membership Two-Percent Reward Program, resulting from an increase in the
penetration of the Executive Member program.

The gross margin
figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Fiscal 2004 included a $6,090 LIFO charge (increase in merchandise costs), while fiscal 2003 included a $19,650 LIFO credit (reduction in
merchandise costs). The impact of the LIFO adjustment on a year-over-year basis negatively impacted margin by an additional six basis points. If all inventories had been valued using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, inventories would have been
lower by $13,410 and $19,500 at August 29, 2004 and August 31, 2003, respectively.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 9.75% during fiscal 2004 from 9.83% during fiscal 2003. Had EITF 03-10 been in effect in fiscal 2003, SG&A expenses as a percent to net sales
would have shown additional improvement of seven basis points in fiscal 2004.

For fiscal 2004, warehouse and central operating costs positively impacted SG&A comparisons year-over-year by approximately 21 basis points, primarily due to increased expense leverage of warehouse payroll,
benefits (primarily health care), utility and workers’ compensation costs. During the latter half of fiscal 2004, the Company implemented changes to its employee healthcare plans that reduced its overall healthcare costs, primarily in the
fourth quarter. This improvement was partially offset by the seven basis point increase resulting from the adoption of EITF 03-10, a two basis point increase in expense related to the establishment of additional insurance liabilities resulting from
financial difficulties being experienced by one of the Company’s third-party insurance providers, and an increase in stock-based compensation costs following the Company’s prospective adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 123, “Accounting for Stock Based Compensation,” during fiscal 2003, of four basis points.

Preopening expenses totaled $30,451, or 0.07% of net sales, during fiscal 2004 compared to $36,643, or 0.09% of net sales, during fiscal 2003. This reduction was due to fewer warehouse openings. During fiscal 2004, the Company opened 20 new
warehouses compared to 29 new warehouses (including 5 relocations) during fiscal 2003. Pre-opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses.

Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net

The net provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $1,000 in fiscal
2004, compared to $19,500 in fiscal 2003. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long-lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new facilities, and losses or gains resulting from the sale of real
property. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of $16,548 for warehouse closing expenses that were offset by gains of $15,548 on the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2003 included charges of $11,836 for warehouse closing
expenses, $4,697 for impairment of long-lived assets and $2,967 for net losses on the sale of real property. At August 29, 2004, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $10,367, of which $9,184 related to future lease obligations. This compares
to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $8,609 at August 31, 2003, of which $7,833 related to future lease obligations.

Interest Expense

Interest expense totaled $36,651 in fiscal 2004, compared to $36,920 in fiscal 2003. Interest expense in both fiscal 2004 and 2003 includes interest on
the 3

% and 5


/


% Senior Notes and on balances outstanding under the Company’s bank credit facilities and
promissory notes. The decrease was primarily a result of the Company’s reduction in short-term borrowings, principally related to its foreign subsidiaries. This decrease was substantially offset by increases in interest rates on the Senior
Notes due to interest rate swap agreements converting the interest rate from fixed to floating.

Interest Income and Other

Interest income and other totaled $51,627 in fiscal 2004, compared to $38,525 in fiscal 2003. The increase primarily reflects greater interest earned on
higher cash and cash equivalents balances and short-term investments. In addition, a reduction in the expense to record minority interest in the earnings of foreign subsidiaries was reported in fiscal 2004 as the Company increased its ownership in
Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%.

Provision for Income Taxes

The effective income tax rate on earnings was 37% in
fiscal 2004 and 37.75% in fiscal 2003. The decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to lower statutory income tax rates for foreign operations and one-time benefits associated with certain tax planning strategies.

Comparison of Fiscal 2003 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2002 (52 weeks):

(dollars in thousands, except earnings per share)

Net Income

Net income for fiscal 2003 increased 3.0% to $721,000, or $1.53 per diluted share, from $699,983, or $1.48 per diluted share during fiscal year 2002.

Net Sales

Net sales increased 9.7% to $41,692,699 in fiscal 2003 from $37,993,093 in
fiscal 2002. Approximately 55% of the increase was due to an increase in comparable warehouse sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at



Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Continued)

least a year, and approximately 45% of the increase was due to opening a net of 23 new warehouses (29 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2003 and a net of 29 new warehouses (35 opened, 6 closed) during fiscal 2002, a
portion of which is not included in comparable warehouse sales. With the exception of price increases in gasoline, which accounted for a comparable sales increase of approximately 70 basis points, changes in prices of merchandise did not materially
contribute to sales increases. In addition, due to the weaker U.S. dollar in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002, translation of foreign sales into U.S. dollars contributed to the increase in sales, accounting for a comparable sales increase of
approximately one percent year-over-year. Comparable sales increased at a five percent annual rate in fiscal 2003 compared to a six percent annual rate during fiscal 2002.

Membership fees

Membership fees increased 10.8% to $852,853, or 2.05% of net sales, in fiscal 2003 from $769,406, or 2.03% of net sales, in fiscal 2002. This increase was
primarily due to additional membership sign-ups at the 23 net new warehouses opened in fiscal 2003, and increased penetration of the Company’s Executive Membership. Overall, member renewal rates remained consistent with the prior year,
currently at 86%.

Gross Margin

Gross margin (defined as net sales minus merchandise costs) increased 11.2%
to $4,457,316, or 10.69% of net sales, in fiscal 2003 from $4,009,972, or 10.55% of net sales, in fiscal 2002. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales reflects merchandise gross margin improvement within the Company’s
ancillary warehouse businesses and international operations accounting for increases of 15 and eight basis points, respectively. Additionally, increased rewards related to the Executive Membership Two-Percent Reward Program reduced gross margin by
seven basis points. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The effect of the LIFO adjustment for fiscal 2003 was to increase gross margin by $19,650, compared to a
gross margin increase of $13,500 in fiscal 2002. If all inventories had been valued using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, inventories would have been lower by $19,500 at August 31, 2003 and higher by $150 at September 1, 2002.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales
increased to 9.83% during fiscal 2003 from 9.41% during fiscal 2002. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales was primarily due to increases in employee healthcare, workers’ compensation (primarily
in the state of California) and salary costs within the Company’s domestic operations. International expenses also increased, accounting for approximately seven basis points of the 42 basis points year-over-year increase.

Preopening Expenses

Preopening expenses totaled $36,643, or 0.09% of net sales, during fiscal 2003, compared to $51,257, or 0.13% of net sales,
during fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2003, the Company opened 29 new warehouses (including five relocations) compared to 35 new warehouses (including six relocations) during fiscal 2002. Pre-opening expenses also include costs related to remodels and
expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses.

Provision for
Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, net

The net provision
for impaired assets and closing costs was $19,500 in fiscal 2003 compared to $21,050 in fiscal 2002. The provision includes costs related to impairment of long-lived assets, future lease obligations of warehouses that have been relocated to new
facilities and any losses or gains resulting from the sale of real property. The provision for fiscal 2003 included charges of $11,836 for warehouse closing expenses, $4,697 for impairment of long-lived assets and $2,967 for net losses on the sale
of real property. The fiscal 2002 provision included charges of $13,683 for warehouse closing expenses and $7,765 for Canadian administrative reorganization, which were offset by $398 of net gains on the sale of real property. At August 31, 2003 the
reserve for

warehouse closing costs was $8,609, of which $7,833 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $11,845 at September 1, 2002, of which $10,395 related to future lease
obligations.

Interest Expense

Interest expense totaled $36,920 in fiscal 2003, compared to $29,096 in
fiscal 2002. Interest expense in fiscal 2003 includes interest on the 3

The increase is primarily related to the reduction in interest capitalized related to warehouse construction, as the overall cost of projects under construction was lower than in fiscal 2002. The increase was also attributed to the Company’s
issuance of $300,000 5

interest expense related to borrowings under its commercial paper program in fiscal 2003.

Interest Income and Other

Interest income and other totaled $38,525 in fiscal 2003, compared to $35,745 in fiscal 2002. The increase primarily reflects greater interest earned on
higher cash and cash equivalents balances on hand throughout fiscal 2003, as compared to fiscal 2002, which was partially offset by an increase in the expense to record the minority interest in earnings of foreign subsidiaries.

Provision for Income Taxes

The effective income tax rate on earnings was 37.75% in fiscal 2003 and
38.50% in fiscal 2002. The decrease in the effective income tax rate, year-over-year, is primarily attributable to lower statutory income tax rates for foreign operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)

Cash Flows

Cash flow generated from warehouse operations provides a significant source of liquidity. Net cash provided by operating
activities totaled $2,098,783 in fiscal 2004 compared to $1,507,208 in fiscal 2003. The increase of $591,575 is primarily a result of an increase in the change in receivables, other current assets, deferred income and accrued and other current
liabilities of $507,860, due primarily to the collection of an operating tax receivable and increases in the workers’ compensation accrual, income taxes payable, executive membership two-percent reward accrual and deferred membership income in
fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. In addition, the increase in net income of $161,393 contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities.

The primary investing activity continues to be the purchase of property and equipment and the construction of facilities related to the Company’s
warehouse expansion and remodel projects. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,048,481 in fiscal 2004 compared to $790,588 in fiscal 2003, an increase of $257,893. The increase in investing activities primarily relates to net purchases
of short-term investments of $303,945 and the purchase of the remaining 20% minority interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited of $95,153, which was partially offset by a reduction in the acquisition of property and equipment and the construction of
facilities for new and remodeled warehouses of $105,045 (from $810,665 to $705,620) between fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004, as new warehouse openings decreased year-over-year from 29 (including five relocated warehouses) in fiscal 2003 to 20 in fiscal
2004.



Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Continued)

Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $209,569 in fiscal 2004 compared to net cash used of $1,428 in fiscal 2003. The increase of $210,997
primarily resulted from an increase in bank checks outstanding of $243,890 and the increase in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options of $90,077, which were offset by the payment of cash dividends in fiscal 2004 of $92,137 and from the
reduction in the issuance of long-term debt of $59,424 in fiscal 2003 to no additional issuances of long-term debt in the current fiscal year.

Dividends

Costco’s Board of Directors declared two quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share in fiscal 2004. The first quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per
share, in the amount of $45,939, was paid May 31, 2004 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 10, 2004. The second quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, in the amount of $46,198, was paid August 27, 2004, to shareholders of
record at the close of business on July 23, 2004.

Contractual Obligations

The Company’s commitment to make future payments
under contractual obligations was as follows, as of August 29, 2004.

Expansion Plans

Costco’s primary requirement for capital is the financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements, as well as additional capital for
international expansion.

While there can be no assurance that
current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is management’s current intention to spend approximately $900,000 to $1,000,000 during fiscal 2005 in the United States and Canada for real estate,
construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations; and approximately $100,000 to $150,000 for international expansion, including the United Kingdom, Asia, Mexico and other potential ventures. These expenditures are
expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.

Expansion plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2005 are to open approximately 30 new warehouse clubs inclusive of seven relocations to
larger and better-located warehouses. The Company expects to continue its review of expansion plans in its international operations, including the United Kingdom and Asia, along with other international markets. At present, the Company is planning
to open two additional warehouses in the U.K and one additional warehouse in both the Taiwan and Japan markets during fiscal 2005. Costco and its Mexico-based joint venture partner, Controladora Comercial Mexicana, each own a 50% interest in Costco
Mexico. Costco Mexico plans to open two to three new warehouse clubs during fiscal 2005.

Additional Equity Investments in Subsidiary

On October 3, 2003, the Company acquired from Carrefour Nederland B.V. its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited for cash of $95,153, bringing Costco’s ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited
to 100%.

Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts
stated in thousands of US dollars)

The Company has a
$500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $300,000 bank credit facility with a group of ten banks, of which $150,000 expired on November 9, 2004 and $150,000 expires on November 15, 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under
the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. The Company presently does not plan to renew the $150,000 portion of the credit facility that expired on November 9, 2004.

A wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary has a $152,000 commercial paper program
supported by a $46,000 bank credit facility with a Canadian bank, that is guaranteed by the Company and expires in March 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility.

The Company has agreed to limit the combined amount
outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the combined amounts of the supporting bank credit facilities, which are $346,000 at August 29, 2004, decreased to $196,000 on November 9, 2004.

The Company’s wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary has a short-term $27,400
bank line of credit that originally expired in November 2004. Subsequent to the Company’s fiscal year end, the bank line of credit was extended through February 10, 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit.

The Company’s Korean subsidiary has a short-term $10,400
bank line of credit, which expires in January 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit.

The Company’s wholly-owned UK subsidiary has a $108,000 bank revolving credit facility expiring in February 2007 and a $63,000 bank overdraft
facility renewable on a yearly basis in March. At August 29, 2004, $21,595 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility with an applicable interest rate of 5.285% and no amounts were outstanding under the bank overdraft facility.

Letters of Credit

The
Company has letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $338,000. The outstanding commitments under these facilities at August 29, 2004 totaled approximately $166,800, including approximately
$52,900 in standby letters of credit.

In April 2003, the Company’s wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.92% in the aggregate amount of
approximately $36,576, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi-annually and principal is due on April 26, 2010.

In November 2002, the Company’s wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes bearing interest at 0.88% in the aggregate amount of
approximately $27,432, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi-annually and principal is due on November 7, 2009. The Company guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by its wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary.

In March 2002, the Company issued $300,000 of 5

Derivatives

The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments
and uses them only to manage well-defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms. The
aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 29, 2004 was not material. The only significant derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated
with its borrowings and to manage the Company’s mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. As of August 29, 2004, the Company had “fixed-to-floating” interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate
fair value of $25,754, which is recorded in other assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. These swaps were entered into effective November 13, 2001, and March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the
Company’s $300,000 7

% Senior Notes and the Company’s $300,000 5

% Senior Notes, respectively. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in the fair value
of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on the Company’s
financial condition or consolidated financial statements.

Stock Repurchase
Program

On November 30, 2001, the Company’s Board of
Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program,



Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Continued)

the Company could repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions warrant. The repurchased shares would constitute authorized, but non-issued shares and would be used
for general corporate purposes, including stock option grants under stock option programs. On October 25, 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the program for another three years. To date, no shares have been repurchased under either program.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of the Company’s financial statements requires
that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations. Management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise
inventory, impairment of long-lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance/self-insurance liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the
present circumstances.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time
customers take possession of merchandise or receive services. When the Company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on
the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The Company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels.

Merchandise Inventories

Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting, and are stated using the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the expected annual effect of
inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. The Company considers in its calculation of the LIFO cost the estimated net realizable value of inventory in those inventory pools where deflation exists and
records a write down of inventory where estimated net realizable value is less than LIFO inventory.

The Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales. The provision is adjusted
periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results, which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters.

Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning those rebates
provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational
approach.

Impairment of long-lived assets and warehouse closing costs

The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets
for indicators of impairment. Management’s judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time. Future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring an adjustment of these assets to
their then-current fair market value.

The Company provides
estimates for warehouse closing costs when it is appropriate to do so based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Future circumstances may result in the Company’s actual future closing costs or the
amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates.



Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Continued)

Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities

The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers’
liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise,
demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In March 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB)
Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments,” (EITF 03-1). The guidance prescribes a three-step model for
determining whether an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure
requirements are effective for annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF 03-1-1, “Effective Date of Paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue No. 03-1 ‘The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments,” (FSP EITF 03-01-1). FSP EITF 03-1-1 delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue 03-01. During
the period of the delay, FSP EITF 03-1-1 states that companies should continue to apply relevant “other-than-temporary” guidance. The adoption of EITF 03-1, excluding paragraphs 10-20, did not impact the Company’s consolidated
financial statements. The Company will assess the impact of paragraphs 10-20 of EITF 03-1 once the guidance has been finalized.

In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (FIN 46R), which
addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a
corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to
support its activities. FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity’s activities or entitled to receive a majority of
the entity’s residual returns or both. FIN 46R replaces FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” which was issued in January 2003 and revised the implementation date to the first fiscal period ending
after March 15, 2004, with the exception of special purpose entities. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In November 2003, the EITF reached consensus on Issue No. 03-10,
“Application of Issue No. 02-16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers,” with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the
vendor’s sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003 and, therefore, apply to such
transactions starting with the Company’s fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February 16, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03-10 did not affect the Company’s consolidated gross profit or net income, but did result in a reduction of both
net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount. For fiscal 2004, net sales and merchandise costs have been reduced by $334,065. Had the Company’s comparable periods in fiscal 2003 and 2002 been reported under EITF 03-10 guidance, the sales
and cost of sales would have been reduced by $282,288 and $248,155, respectively.



Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Continued)

In November 2002, the EITF reached consensus on certain issues discussed in Issue No. 02-16, “Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for
Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor,” with respect to determining how a reseller should characterize consideration received from a vendor and when to recognize and how to measure that consideration in its income statement. Requirements
for recognizing volume-based rebates are effective for arrangements entered into or modified after November 21, 2002 and resellers with other supplier payments should generally apply the new rules prospectively for agreements entered into or
modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this consensus by the Company in fiscal 2003 did not have a significant impact on the Company on an annual basis, but resulted in a change in the timing for the recognition of some vendor allowances
for certain agreements entered into subsequent to December 31, 2002 and extends the recognition time frame beyond that which was in effect for similar contracts entered into prior to December 31, 2002. Net income for fiscal 2004 was negatively
impacted by approximately $2,808 (after-tax) due to the adoption of EITF 02-16.

Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in
speculative or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.

The nature and amount of the Company’s long and short-term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market
conditions and other factors. As of August 29, 2004, the Company’s fixed rate long-term debt includes its $851,648 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $130,561.
The Company’s debt also includes $300,000 7

% Senior Notes and
$300,000 5


/


% Senior Notes. The Company has entered into
“fixed-to-floating” interest rate swaps on the Senior Notes, effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may
affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt.

The Company holds interest-bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Short-term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the
purchase date. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. As the
majority of these instruments are of a short-term nature, if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments. For those instruments that are classified as
available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Based on the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balances
at August 29, 2004, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $27,000 to interest income (pre-tax) on an annual basis.

Most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies,
limiting the Company’s exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into short-term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The fair
value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at August 29, 2004 was not material to the Company’s results of operations or its financial position.



Item 8—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Financial statements of Costco are as follows:

Item 9—Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A—Controls and Procedures

The Company carried out an evaluation as of August 29, 2004, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to timely alert them to any material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) that must be included in the Company’s periodic Securities and Exchange
Commission filings. There have been no significant changes in the Company’s internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to their evaluation.

At the end of fiscal year 2005, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will
require management of the Company to provide in its annual report an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting and the Company’s independent public accounting firm will be required to
attest to management’s assessment. The Company is in the process of performing the system and process documentation, evaluation and testing required for management to make this assessment and for the auditors to provide its attestation report.
The Company has not completed this process or its assessment, and this process will require significant amounts of management time and resources. In the course of evaluation and testing, management may identify deficiencies that will need to be
addressed and remediated.

Item 9B—Other Information

None.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Costco Wholesale Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries as of August
29, 2004 and August 31, 2003 and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income and cash flows for the 52 weeks ended August 29, 2004, August 31, 2003, and September 1, 2002. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries as of August 29,
2004 and August 31, 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the 52 weeks ended August 29, 2004, August 31, 2003, and September 1, 2002, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
February 16, 2004, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 03-10, “Application of Issue No. 02-16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers,” and effective September 2, 2002, the Company
adopted the fair value method of recording stock-based compensation expense in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” Additionally, as discussed in Note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements, during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2003, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02-16, “Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a
Vendor,” based on the specific transition guidance.

Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco Wholesale Corporation, a Washington corporation, and
its subsidiaries (“Costco” or the “Company”). All material inter-company transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation.

Costco operates membership warehouses that offer low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected
private label products in a wide range of merchandise categories in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities. At August 29, 2004, Costco operated 441 warehouse clubs: 324 in the United States and three in Puerto Rico; 63 in Canada; 15 in the
United Kingdom; five in Korea; three in Taiwan; four in Japan; and 24 warehouses in Mexico with a joint venture partner.

The Company’s investments in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are
accounted for under the equity method. The investment in Costco Mexico is included in other assets and was $178,997 at August 29, 2004 and $167,293 at August 31, 2003. The equity in earnings of Costco Mexico is included in interest income and other
and for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, was $22,208, $21,400 and $21,028, respectively. The amount of retained earnings that represents undistributed earnings of Costco Mexico was $108,282 and $86,074 at August 29, 2004 and August 31, 2003,
respectively.

Fiscal Years

The Company reports on a 52/53-week fiscal year basis, which ends on the
Sunday nearest August 31st. Fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002 were 52-week years.

Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all
highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase and proceeds due from credit and debit card transactions with settlement terms of less than five days to be cash equivalents. Of the total cash and cash
equivalents of $2,823,135 at August 29, 2004 and $1,545,439 at August 31, 2003, credit and debit card receivables were $441,244 and $412,861, respectively.

Short-term Investments

Short-term investments have a maturity of three months to five years at the date of purchase. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be
classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Short-term investments classified as available for sale are recorded at
market value using the specific identification method; unrealized gains and losses are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Included within corporate notes and bonds are investments totaling $171,179 that have been designated
as “hold to maturity securities” and are recorded at cost. At August 29, 2004, the cost of these securities approximated market value.

Short-term investments at August 29, 2004 were as follows:



COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in thousands, except per share data) (Continued)

Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Receivables, net

Receivables consist primarily of vendor rebates and promotional allowances, receivables from government tax authorities and other miscellaneous amounts
due to the Company, and are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $1,139 at August 29, 2004 and $1,529 at August 31, 2003. Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on known troubled accounts and historical experience
applied to an aging of accounts.

Vendor Rebates and Allowances

Periodic payments from vendors in the form of volume
rebates or other purchase discounts that are evidenced by signed agreements are reflected in the carrying value of the inventory when earned or as the Company progresses towards earning the rebate or discount and as a component of cost of sales as
the merchandise is sold. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of the related agreement, or by other systematic and rational approach.

Merchandise Inventories

Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as
determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail
method of accounting, and are stated using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. The Company records
an adjustment each quarter if necessary, for the expected annual effect of inflation and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. The Company considers in its calculation of the LIFO cost the estimated net realizable
value of inventory in those inventory pools where deflation exists and records a write down of inventory where estimated net realizable value is less than LIFO inventory. The LIFO inventory adjustment for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 decreased
gross margin by $590 as compared to an increase of $14,650 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. If all merchandise inventories had been valued using the FIFO method, inventories would have been lower by $13,410 and $19,500 at August 29, 2004 at
August 31, 2003, respectively.

The Company provides
for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a standard percentage of sales. This provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the actual shrinkage results of the physical inventory counts, which generally occur
in the second and fourth quarters of the Company’s fiscal year.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment
are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization expenses are computed using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes. Buildings are generally depreciated over twenty-five to thirty-five years; equipment and fixtures are
depreciated over three to ten years; leasehold improvements are



COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in thousands, except per share data) (Continued)

Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

amortized over the initial term of the lease or the useful lives of the assets. The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the acquisition and
development of software and amortizes those costs using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to five years.

Interest costs incurred on property and equipment during the construction period are capitalized. The amount of interest costs capitalized was $4,155 in
fiscal 2004, $3,272 in fiscal 2003, and $13,480 in fiscal 2002.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets

The Company periodically evaluates
the realizability of long-lived assets for impairment when management makes the decision to relocate or close a warehouse or when events or changes in circumstances occur, which may indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
The Company evaluates the carrying value of the asset by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition with the asset’s reported net carrying value. The Company recorded
a pre-tax, non-cash charge of $2,592, $4,697 and $0 in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, reflecting its estimate of impairment relating to real property. The charge reflects the difference between the carrying value and fair value, which was
based on estimated market valuations for those assets whose carrying value is not currently anticipated to be recoverable through future cash flows.

Goodwill

Goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, resulting from certain business combinations is included in other assets, and totaled $65,721 at August 29,
2004 and $46,549 at August 31, 2003. The increase in goodwill was due to the Company increasing its ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited from 80% to 100% in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 142, “Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangibles,” which specifies that goodwill and some intangible assets should no longer be amortized, but instead will be subject to periodic impairment testing. Accordingly, the
Company reviews previously reported goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances dictate. No impairment of goodwill has been incurred to date.

Accounts Payable

The Company’s banking system provides for the daily replenishment of major bank accounts as checks are presented. Accordingly, included in accounts
payable at August 29, 2004 and August 31, 2003 are $438,025 and $216,980, respectively, representing the excess of outstanding checks over cash on deposit at the banks on which the checks were drawn.

Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities

The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to
provide for the potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers’ liability, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are
retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these
liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.

(dollars in thousands, except per share data) (Continued)

Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Derivatives

The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well-defined interest rate and foreign exchange
risks. Short-term forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases. The only significant derivative instruments the Company holds are interest rate swaps, which the Company
uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the Company’s mix of fixed and variable-rate debt. As of August 29, 2004, the Company had “fixed-to-floating” interest rate swaps with an aggregate
notional amount of $600,000 and an aggregate fair value of $25,754, which is recorded in other assets. These swaps were entered into effective November 13, 2001, and March 25, 2002, and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the
Company’s $300,000 7


/


% Senior Notes and the Company’s $300,000 5


/


% Senior Notes, respectively. As the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt, the changes in
the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the fair value recorded on the hedged debt, and result in no net earnings impact.

Equity Investments in Subsidiary

On October 3, 2003, the Company acquired from Carrefour Nederland B.V. its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited for cash of $95,153,
bringing Costco’s ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 100%. In conjunction with this purchase the Company increased the carrying value of the land and buildings of Costco Wholesale UK Limited by $12,808 and recorded goodwill of
$16,719.

Foreign Currency Translations

The functional currencies of the Company’s international subsidiaries
are the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary is located. Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies, as well as the Company’s investment in the Costco Mexico joint venture, are translated at the exchange rate on the
balance sheet date. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are charged or credited to other accumulated comprehensive income (loss). Revenue and expenses of the Company’s consolidated foreign operations are translated at average
rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are included in expenses and were not significant in either fiscal 2004, 2003, or 2002.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When the Company
collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. The
Company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels. The reserve for sales returns (sales returns net of merchandise costs) was $5,524 and $4,869 at August 29, 2004 and August 31, 2003, respectively.

Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by
substantially all of the Company’s members. The Company accounts for membership fee revenue on a “deferred basis,” whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over the one-year term of the membership. The Company’s
Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco. The Company accounts for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related
liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding

Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non-redemptions based on historical data. The reduction in sales for the fiscal years
ended August 29, 2004, August 31, 2003 and September 1, 2002, and the related liability as of those dates were as follows:

Merchandise Costs

Merchandise costs consist of the purchase price of inventory sold,
inbound shipping charges and all costs related to our depot operations, including freight from depots to selling warehouses. Merchandise costs also include salaries, benefits, depreciation on production equipment, and other related expenses incurred
in certain fresh foods and ancillary departments.

Selling, General and
Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and
administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and workers’ compensation costs for warehouse employees, other than fresh foods and certain ancillary businesses, as well as all regional and home office employees, including
buying personnel. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include utilities, bank charges and substantially all building and equipment depreciation, as well as other operating costs incurred to support warehouse operations.

Marketing and Promotional Expenses

Costco’s policy is generally to limit marketing and promotional
expenses to new warehouse openings, occasional direct mail marketing to prospective new members and direct mail marketing programs to existing members promoting selected merchandise. Marketing and promotional costs are expensed as incurred.

Preopening Expenses

Preopening expenses related to new warehouses, major remodels/expansions,
new regional offices and other startup operations are expensed as incurred.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company adopted
the fair value based method of recording stock options consistent with SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” for all employee stock options granted subsequent to fiscal year end 2002. Specifically, the Company adopted
SFAS No. 123 using the “prospective method” with guidance provided from SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure.” All employee stock option grants made since the beginning of fiscal
2003 have or will be expensed over the related stock option vesting period based on the fair value at the date the options are granted. Prior to fiscal 2003, the Company applied Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, “Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations in accounting for stock options. Because the Company granted stock options to employees at exercise prices equal to fair market value on the date of grant, no compensation cost was
recognized for option grants.

Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Had compensation costs for the Company’s stock-based compensation plans been determined based on
the fair value at the grant dates for awards made prior to fiscal 2003, under those plans and consistent with SFAS No. 123, the Company’s net income and net income per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value of the Company’s financial
instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to their short-term nature or variable interest rates. Short-term investments classified as available for sale are recorded at market value
with unrealized gains or losses reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Short-term investments designated as “hold-to-maturity” securities are recorded at cost and approximated market value at August 29, 2004. The fair
value of fixed rate debt at August 29, 2004 and August 31, 2003 was $1,581,368 and $1,415,252, respectively.

Closing Costs

Warehouse closing costs incurred relate principally to the Company’s efforts to relocate certain warehouses that were not otherwise impaired to larger and better-located facilities. The provision for fiscal 2004 included charges of
$16,548 for warehouse closing expenses offset by net gains of $15,548 related to the sale of real property. The fiscal 2003 provision included charges of $11,836 for warehouse closing expenses and $2,967 for net losses on the sale of real property.
As of August 29, 2004, the Company’s reserve for warehouse closing costs was $10,367, of which $9,184 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $8,609 at August 31, 2003, of which $7,833
related to future lease obligations.

The Company recently
determined that its joint venture Costco Mexico had incorrectly reported to the Company the amount of deferred taxes recorded by Costco Mexico under SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” As a result, the Company overstated its share
in the equity in earnings of Costco Mexico (reported in interest income and other) in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002 by approximately $1,000, $1,000 and $6,000, respectively – representing less than 1% of the Company’s income before
income taxes in each of these years. The cumulative balance sheet effect (reflected in other assets), over the past 12 fiscal years, has been to overstate the Company’s investment in Costco Mexico by approximately $24,000, or less than .16% of
total assets at fiscal 2004 year end. The Company believes that the incorrect reporting of deferred taxes of Costco Mexico has not materially impacted its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Accordingly, these
amounts have not been adjusted in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income
taxes under the provisions of SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” That standard requires companies to account for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability method.

Under the asset and liability method of SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credits and loss carry-forwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized.

Net Income Per Common and Common Equivalent Share

The following data show the amounts used in computing earnings per share
(EPS) and the effect on income and the weighted average number of shares of dilutive potential common stock.

The diluted share base
calculation for fiscal years ended August 29, 2004, August 31, 2003 and September 1, 2002, excludes 24,747,815, 33,362,000 and 6,908,000 stock options outstanding, respectively. These options are excluded due to their anti-dilutive effect.

Dividends

Costco’s Board of Directors declared two quarterly cash dividends of
$0.10 per share in fiscal 2004. The first quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share, in the amount of $45,939, was paid May 31, 2004 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 10, 2004. The second quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per
share, in the amount of $46,198, was paid August 27, 2004, to shareholders of record at the close of business on July 23, 2004. The Company presently expects to pay a cash dividend on a quarterly basis going forward.

Stock Repurchase Program

On November 30, 2001, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a stock
repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock through November 30, 2004. Under the program, the Company could repurchase shares at any time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions
warrant. The repurchased shares would constitute authorized, but non-issued shares and would be used for general corporate purposes, including stock option grants under stock option programs. On October 25, 2004, the Board of Directors renewed the
program for another three years. To date, no shares have been repurchased under either program.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In March 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its
Application to Certain Investments,” (EITF 03-1). The guidance prescribes a three-step model for determining



COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in thousands, except per share data) (Continued)

Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

whether an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments. The accounting guidance is
effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the disclosure requirements are effective for annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF 03-1-1,
“Effective Date of Paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue No. 03-1 ‘The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments,” (FSP EITF 03-01-1). FSP EITF 03-1-1 delays the effective date for the measurement
and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue 03-01. During the period of the delay, FSP EITF 03-1-1 states that companies should continue to apply relevant “other-than-temporary” guidance. The adoption of EITF 03-1,
excluding paragraphs 10-20, did not impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company will assess the impact of paragraphs 10-20 of EITF 03-1 once the guidance has been finalized.

In December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (revised December
2003), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (FIN 46R), which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly
should consolidate the entity. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors
that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46R requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable
interest entity’s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s residual returns or both. FIN 46R replaces FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” which was issued in January 2003
and revised the implementation date to the first fiscal period ending after March 15, 2004, with the exception of special purpose entities. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

In November 2003, the EITF reached
consensus on Issue No. 03-10, “Application of Issue No. 02-16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers,” with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by
the vendor for honoring the vendor’s sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales. These rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after November 25, 2003 and,
therefore, apply to such transactions starting with the Company’s fiscal third quarter of 2004, which began February 16, 2004. The adoption of EITF 03-10 did not affect the Company’s consolidated gross profit or net income, but did result
in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount. For fiscal 2004, net sales and merchandise costs have been reduced by $334,065. Had the Company’s comparable periods in fiscal 2003 and 2002 been reported under EITF
03-10 guidance, the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by $282,288 and $248,155, respectively.

In November 2002, the EITF reached consensus on certain issues discussed in Issue No. 02-16, “Accounting by a Customer (Including a Reseller) for
Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor,” with respect to determining how a reseller should characterize consideration received from a vendor and when to recognize and how to measure that consideration in its income statement. Requirements
for recognizing volume-based rebates are effective for arrangements entered into or modified after November 21, 2002 and resellers with other supplier payments should generally apply the new rules prospectively for agreements entered into or
modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this consensus by the Company in fiscal 2003 did not have a significant impact on the Company on an annual basis. However, the application of the consensus has resulted in a change in the timing for
the recognition of some vendor allowances for certain agreements entered into subsequent to December 31, 2002 and extends the recognition time frame beyond that which was in effect for similar contracts

entered into prior to December 31, 2002. Net income for fiscal 2004 was negatively impacted by approximately $2,808 (after-tax) due to the adoption of EITF
02-16.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior fiscal years to conform with the presentation adopted in the current fiscal year.

Note 2—Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income is net income, plus certain other items that are
recorded directly to stockholders’ equity. Comprehensive income was $976,517 for fiscal 2004 and $800,745 for fiscal 2003. Foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on short-term investments are the components
applied to net income to calculate the Company’s comprehensive income and totaled $94,264 and ($140), respectively, for fiscal 2004 and $79,745, which related only to foreign currency translation adjustments in fiscal 2003.

Note 3—Debt

Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in thousands of US dollars)

The Company has in place a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a
$300,000 bank credit facility with a group of ten banks, of which $150,000 expired on November 9, 2004 and $150,000 expires on November 15, 2005. At August 29, 2004 and August 31, 2003, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper program
and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. The Company presently does not plan to renew the $150,000 portion of the credit facility that expired on November 9, 2004.

A wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary has a $152,000 commercial paper program supported by a $46,000 bank credit facility with
a Canadian bank that is guaranteed by the parent company and expires in March 2005. At August 29, 2004 and August 31, 2003, no amounts were outstanding under the Canadian commercial paper program or the bank credit facility.

The Company has agreed to limit the combined amount outstanding under the
U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the combined amounts of the supporting bank credit facilities, which are $346,000 at August 29, 2004, decreased to $196,000 on November 9, 2004.

The Company’s wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary has a short-term $27,400
bank line of credit that originally expired in November 2004. Subsequent to the Company’s fiscal year end, the bank line of credit was extended through February 10, 2005. At August 29, 2004 and August 31, 2003, no amounts were outstanding under
the line of credit.

The Company’s Korean subsidiary has
a short-term $10,400 bank line of credit, which expires in January 2005. At August 29, 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit.

indentures contain certain limitations on the Company’s and certain subsidiaries’ ability to create liens securing indebtedness and to enter into certain sale-leaseback transactions. In November 2001, the Company entered into
“fixed-to-floating” interest rate swap agreements that replaced the fixed interest rate with a floating rate indexed to LIBOR. The Company plans to repay the 7

approximately $36,576, through a private placement. Interest is payable semi-annually and principal is due on April 26, 2010.

The Company guarantees all of the promissory notes issued by its wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary.

On August 19, 1997, the Company completed the sale of $900,000 principal
amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes (the “Notes”) due August 19, 2017. The Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3

of $22.00. Holders of the Notes may require the Company to purchase the Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) on August 19, 2007, or 2012. The Company, at its option, may redeem the Notes (at the discounted
issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time on or after August 19, 2002. As of August 29, 2004, $48,352 in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock.

In February 1996, the Company filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. On October 23, 2001, an additional $100,000 in debt securities was registered, bringing the total amount of debt registered under the shelf

Maturities of long-term debt during the next five fiscal years and
thereafter are as follows:

Note 4—Leases

The Company leases land and/or warehouse buildings at 91 of the 417
warehouses open at August 29, 2004, and certain other office and distribution facilities under operating leases with remaining terms ranging from 1 to 44 years. These leases generally contain one or more of the following options which the Company
can exercise at the end of the initial lease term: (a) renewal of the lease for a defined number of years at the then fair market rental rate; (b) purchase of the property at the then fair market value; or (c) right of first refusal in the event of
a third party purchase offer. Certain leases provide for periodic rental increases based on the price indices and some of the leases provide for rents based on the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume. Contingent rents have not been
material. The Company accounts for its leases with step-rent provisions on a straight-line basis over the original term of the lease.

Additionally, the Company leases certain equipment and fixtures under short-term operating leases that permit the Company to either renew for a series of
one-year terms or to purchase the equipment at the then fair market value.

Aggregate rental expense for fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002, was $95,800, $84,146, and $69,894, respectively. Future minimum payments, net of sub-lease income of $148,339, during the next five fiscal years and thereafter
under non-cancelable leases with terms in excess of one year, at August 29, 2004, were as follows:

Note 5—Stock Options

The Company’s 1993 Combined Stock Grant and Stock Option Plan (the “1993 plan”)
provided for the issuance of up to 60 million shares of its common stock upon the exercise of stock options and up to 3,333,332 shares through stock grants. During fiscal 2002 the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2002 plan”) was adopted
following shareholder approval. The 2002 plan authorized 30 million shares of common stock for issuance, subject to adjustment. For future grants, the 2002 plan replaces the 1993 plan and the 1993 plan has been amended to provide that no more
options or stock grants may be issued under such plan. Any shares under the 1993 plan that remain available for future option grants (and any additional shares that subsequently become available through cancellation of unexercised options
outstanding) will be added to the number of shares available for grant under the 2002 plan. The 2002 plan authorizes the Company to grant stock options to eligible employees, directors and consultants. Options granted under these plans have a
ten-year term and generally have a vesting period of five years. At August 29, 2004, options for approximately 27.5 million shares were vested and 11.7 million shares were available for future grants under the plan.

In fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 the Company recognized stock compensation
costs of $36,508, $12,069 and $0, respectively. The effects of applying SFAS No. 123 were substantially less in fiscal 2003 than the effects on net income and earnings per share in fiscal 2004 and expected in future periods because this was the
initial year of adoption. Fiscal 2004 reflects compensation expense from options granted in that year, as well as continuing recognition of expense associated with options issued in prior years as they vest. Shares granted in fiscal 2004 and 2003
totaled 7,780,924 and 8,479,550 shares, respectively, with the majority of these shares being granted in the middle of the fiscal third quarter for both fiscal years.

Total stock compensation costs on a pre-tax basis that would have been recorded had SFAS No. 123 been adopted as of its
initial effective date would have totaled $92,679, $112,863 and $123,159 in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions used for grants in 2004, 2003 and 2002:

respectively.

Note 6—Retirement Plans

The Company has a 401(k) Retirement Plan that is available to all U.S.
employees who have completed 90 days of employment. For all U.S. employees, with the exception of California union employees, the plan allows pre-tax deferral against which the Company matches 50% of the first one thousand dollars of employee
contributions. In addition, the Company will provide each eligible participant a contribution based on salary and years of service.

California union employees participate in a defined benefit plan sponsored by their union. The Company makes contributions based upon its union agreement.
For all the California union employees, the Company sponsored 401(k) plan currently allows pre-tax deferral against which the Company matches 50% of the first five hundred dollars of employee contributions. In addition, the Company will provide each
eligible participant a contribution based on hours worked and years of service. The Company has a defined contribution plan for Canadian and United Kingdom employees and contributes a percentage of each employee’s salary.

Amounts expensed under these plans were $169,664, $149,392 and $127,189 for
fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company has defined contribution 401(k) and retirement plans only, and thus has no liability for post-retirement benefit obligations under the SFAS No. 106 “Employer’s Accounting for
Post-retirement Benefits Other than Pensions.”

Note 7—Income Taxes

The provisions for income taxes for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 are as follows:

For fiscal 2004 the
annual effective tax rate remained constant throughout the year at 37%. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and 2002 the Company adjusted the annual effective tax rate used in calculating the tax provision from 38.5% to 37.75%, and from 40.0% to
38.5%, respectively, resulting in the reduction in the income tax provision in the fourth quarter of $5,873 and $11,315, respectively.

Reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the effective rate for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 is as follows:

Note 7—Income Taxes (Continued)

The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

The deferred tax
accounts at August 29, 2004 and August 31, 2003 include current deferred income tax assets of $116,291 and $213,939, respectively; non-current deferred income tax assets of $6,755 and $14,316, respectively; current deferred income tax liabilities of
$0 and $74,002, respectively; and non-current deferred income tax liabilities of $200,137 and $182,749, respectively.

The Company has not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of non-U.S. affiliates aggregating approximately $857,963 at
August 29, 2004, as such earnings have been reinvested for the foreseeable future. Because of the availability of U.S. foreign tax credits, it is not practicable to determine the U.S. federal income tax liability or benefit associated with such
earnings if such earnings were not reinvested for the foreseeable future.

Note 8—Commitments and Contingencies

Legal
Proceedings

The Company is involved from time to time in
claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. The Company is a defendant in two actions purportedly brought as class actions on behalf of certain present and former Costco managers in California, in which
plaintiffs allege that they have not been properly compensated for overtime work. The Company is also a defendant in an overtime compensation case purportedly brought as a class action on behalf of present and former hourly employees in California,
in which plaintiffs allege that Costco’s semi-annual bonus formula is improper with regard to retroactive overtime pay. Claims in these three actions are made under various provisions of the California Labor Code and the California Business and
Professions Code. Plaintiffs seek restitution/disgorgement, compensatory damages, various statutory penalties, liquidated damages, punitive, treble and exemplary damages, and attorneys’ fees. The Company also is a defendant in an action
purportedly brought as a class action on behalf of certain present and former female managers, in which plaintiffs allege denial of promotion based on gender in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Plaintiffs seek compensatory
damages, exemplary and punitive damages, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees. In none of these four cases has the Court been asked yet to determine whether the action should proceed as a class action or, if so, the definition of the class.
The Company expects to vigorously defend these actions and does not believe that any claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or results of its
operations.
