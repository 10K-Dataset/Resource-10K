Part I

Item 1—Business

Costco Wholesale Corporation ("Costco" or the "Company") began operations in 1983 in Seattle, Washington. In October 1993, Costco merged with The Price
Company, which had pioneered the membership warehouse concept in 1976, to form Price/Costco, Inc., a Delaware corporation. In January 1997, after the spin-off of most of its
non-warehouse assets to Price Enterprises, Inc., the Company changed its name to Costco Companies, Inc. On August 30, 1999, the Company reincorporated from Delaware to
Washington and changed its name to Costco Wholesale Corporation, which trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol "COST".

General

Costco operates membership warehouses based on the concept that offering members very low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected
private label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. This rapid inventory turnover, when combined with the operating
efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, enables Costco to
operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers, discount retailers and supermarkets.

Costco
buys nearly all of its merchandise directly from manufacturers for shipment either directly to Costco's selling warehouses or to a consolidation point ("depot") where various
shipments are combined so as to minimize freight and handling costs. As a result, Costco eliminates many of the costs associated with multiple step distribution channels, which include purchasing from
distributors as opposed to manufacturers, use of central receiving, storing and distributing warehouses, and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor. By providing this more
cost-effective means of distributing goods, Costco meets the needs of business customers who otherwise would pay a premium for small purchases and for the distribution services of
traditional wholesalers, and who cannot otherwise obtain the full range of their product requirements from any single source. In addition, these business members will often combine personal shopping
with their business purchases. The cost savings on brand name and selected private label merchandise are the primary motivation for individuals shopping for
their personal needs. Costco's merchandise selection is designed to appeal to both the business and consumer requirements of its members by offering a wide range of nationally branded and selected
private label products, often in case, carton or multiple-pack quantities, at attractively low prices.

Because
of its high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover, Costco generally has the opportunity to receive cash from the sale of a substantial portion of its inventory at mature
warehouse operations before it is required to pay all its merchandise vendors, even though Costco takes advantage of early payment terms to obtain payment discounts. As sales in a given warehouse
increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid, a greater percentage of the inventory is financed through payment terms provided by vendors rather than by working capital.

Costco's
typical warehouse format averages approximately 137,000 square feet. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, in the handling of
merchandise and in the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the availability of low prices on brand name and selected private label goods, Costco's warehouses need not
be located on prime commercial real estate sites or have elaborate facilities.

By
strictly controlling the entrances and exits of its warehouses and by limiting membership to selected groups and businesses, Costco has been able to limit inventory losses to less
than three-tenths of one percent of net sales—well below those of typical discount retail operations. Losses associated with


dishonored checks have also been minimal, since individual memberships are generally limited to members of qualifying groups, and bank information from business members is verified prior to
establishing a check purchase limit. Memberships are invalidated at the point of sale for those members who have issued dishonored checks to Costco.

Costco's
policy is generally to limit marketing and promotional expenses to new warehouse openings, occasional direct mail marketing to prospective new members and annual direct mail
marketing programs to existing members promoting selected merchandise. These practices result in lower marketing expenses as compared to typical discount retailers and supermarkets. In connection with
new warehouse openings, Costco's marketing teams personally contact businesses in the area that are potential wholesale members. These contacts are supported by direct mailings during the period
immediately prior to opening. Potential Gold Star (individual) members are contacted by direct mail or by providing such mailings to be distributed through credit unions, employee associations and
other entities representing individuals who are eligible for Gold Star membership. After a membership base is established in an area, most new memberships result from
word-of-mouth advertising, follow-up contact by direct mail distributed through regular payroll or other organizational communications to employee groups and
ongoing direct solicitations to prospective wholesale members.

Costco's
warehouses generally operate on a seven-day, 68-hour week, and are open somewhat longer during the holiday season. Generally, warehouses are open
weekdays between 10:00 a.m. and 8:30 p.m., with earlier closing hours on the weekend. Because these hours of operation are shorter than those of traditional discount grocery retailers
and supermarkets, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities of each
item, thereby reducing labor required for handling and stocking. In addition, sales are processed through centralized, automated check-out stands. Most items are not individually price
marked; rather, each item is bar-coded so it can be scanned into electronic cash registers. This allows price changes without remarking merchandise. Substantially all manufacturers provide
merchandise pre-marked with the item numbers and bar codes and many provide special, larger package sizes.

Costco's
merchandising strategy is to provide the customer with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than could be obtained through traditional
wholesalers, discount retailers or supermarkets. An important element of this strategy is to carry only those products on which Costco can provide its members significant cost savings. Items which
members may request but which cannot be purchased at prices low enough to pass along meaningful cost savings are usually not carried. Costco seeks to limit specific items in each product line to fast
selling models, sizes and colors. Therefore, the Company carries an average of only 3,700 to 4,500 active stockkeeping units ("SKU's") per warehouse in its core warehouse business, as opposed to
discount retailers and supermarkets which normally stock 40,000 to 60,000 SKU's or more. These practices are consistent with Costco's membership policies of satisfying both the business and personal
shopping needs of its wholesale members, thereby encouraging high volume shopping. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton or multiple-pack quantities only.
Appliances, equipment and tools often feature commercial and professional models. Costco's policy is to accept returns of merchandise within a reasonable time after purchase.


The following table indicates the approximate percentage of net sales accounted for by each major category of items sold by Costco during fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999:

Costco
has direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand name merchandise. No significant portion of merchandise is obtained by Costco from any one of these or any
other single supplier. Costco has not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise, and believes that if one or more of its current sources of supply became
unavailable, it would be able to obtain alternative sources without experiencing a substantial disruption of its business. Costco may also purchase selected private label merchandise of the same
product, as long as quality and customer demand are comparable, and the savings to its customers are greater.

Costco
reports on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of 13 four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first, second and third
quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). There is no material seasonal impact on
Costco's operations, except an increased level of sales and earnings during the Christmas holiday season. Fiscal 2001 was a 52-week fiscal year.

Membership Policy

Costco's membership format is designed to reinforce customer loyalty and provide a continuing source of membership fee revenue. Costco has two primary types of
members: Business and Gold Star (individual) members. In addition, the Company offers an Executive Membership program to both Business and Gold Star members.

Businesses,
including individuals with a business license, retail sales license or other evidence of business existence, may become Business members. Costco promotes Business
membership through its merchandise selection and its membership marketing programs. Business members generally pay an annual membership fee of $45 for the primary and spouse membership card with
add-on membership cards available for an annual fee of $35 (including a free spouse card).

Individual
memberships are available to employees of federal, state and local governments, financial institutions, corporations, utility and transportation companies, public and
private educational institutions, and other selected organizations. Individual members generally pay an annual membership fee of $45, which includes a spouse card.

Executive
Memberships are available to all members for an annual fee of $100. The Executive Membership program offers members additional savings and benefits on various business and
consumer services offered by Costco, such as merchant credit card processing, small business loans, auto and home


insurance, long-distance telephone service, check printing, and real estate and mortgage services. The services offered are generally provided by third-party providers and vary by state.
In addition, Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of $500 per year, on all qualified purchases made at Costco.

As
of September 2, 2001, Costco had approximately 4.4 million Business memberships and approximately 12.7 million Gold Star memberships. Members can utilize their
memberships at any Costco warehouse location.

Labor

As of September 2, 2001, Costco had approximately 86,000 employees, about one-half of whom were part-time. Approximately
12,450 hourly employees in California, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and
one warehouse in Virginia are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. In addition, one warehouse in the Canadian province of British Columbia is represented by the Retail Wholesale
Union. All remaining employees are non-union. Costco considers its employee relations to be good.

Competition

The Company operates in the rapidly changing and highly competitive merchandising industry. When The Price Company pioneered the membership warehouse club
concept in 1976, the dominant companies selling comparable lines of merchandise were department stores, grocery stores and traditional wholesalers. Since then, new merchandising concepts and
aggressive marketing techniques have led to a more intense and focused competitive environment. Wal-Mart has become the largest retailer in the United States (and the world) and has
expanded further into various food merchandising formats. Target has also emerged as a significant retail competitor. Approximately 917 warehouse clubs exist across the U.S. and Canada, including the
324 warehouses operated by the Company in North America; and every major metropolitan area has one, if not several, club operations. Low-cost operators selling a single category or narrow
range of merchandise, such as Home Depot, Office Depot, PetSmart, Toys-R-Us, Circuit City and Barnes & Noble, have significant market share in their respective
categories. New forms of retailing involving modern technology are boosting sales in certain stores, while home shopping and electronic commerce over the Internet is becoming increasingly popular.
Likewise, in the institutional food business, companies such as Smart & Final, which operates predominately in California, Washington, Oregon, Florida and Arizona, are capturing an increasingly
greater share of the institutional food business from wholesale operators and others.

Regulation

Certain state laws require that the Company apply minimum markups to its selling prices for specific goods, such as tobacco products and alcoholic beverages.
While compliance with such laws may cause the Company to charge somewhat higher prices than it otherwise would charge, other retailers are also typically governed by the same restrictions, and the
Company believes that compliance with such laws does not have a material adverse effect on its operations.

It
is the policy of the Company to sell at lower than manufacturers' suggested retail prices. Some manufacturers attempt to maintain the resale price of their products by refusing to
sell to the Company or to other purchasers that do not adhere to suggested retail prices or that otherwise sell at discounted prices. To date, the Company believes that it has not been materially
affected by its inability to purchase directly from such manufacturers. Both federal and state legislation is proposed from time to time which, if enacted, would restrict the Company's ability to
purchase goods or extend the application of laws enabling


the establishment of minimum prices. The Company cannot predict the effect on its business of the enactment of such federal or state legislation.

Certain
states, counties and municipalities have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operations or expansion plans of certain large retailers
and warehouse clubs, including the Company, within their jurisdictions. The Company believes that, if enacted, such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
operations.

As
of September 2, 2001, the Company operated (through a 50%-owned joint venture) 20 warehouses in Mexico. These warehouses are not included in the number of warehouses open in
any period because the joint venture is accounted for on the equity basis and therefore their operations are not consolidated in the Company's financial statements.

The
Company's headquarters are located in Issaquah, Washington. Additionally, the Company maintains regional buying and administrative offices, operates regional cross-docking
facilities (depots) for the consolidation and distribution of certain shipments to the warehouses, and operates various processing, packaging, and other facilities to support ancillary and other
businesses.


Item 3—Legal Proceedings

The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings and litigation arising from its business and property ownership. The Company does not believe
that any such claim, proceeding, or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of its operations.

Item 4—Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

The Company's annual meeting is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. on January 30, 2002, at the Nob Hill Masonic Center in San Francisco, California. Matters
to be voted on will be included in the Company's proxy statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and distributed to stockholders prior to the meeting.

For these purposes, forward-looking statements are statements that address activities, events, conditions or developments that the Company expects or anticipates may occur in the future. Such
forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. These risks and
uncertainties include, but are not limited to, domestic and international economic conditions including exchange rates, the effects of competition and regulation, conditions affecting the acquisition,

Comparison of Fiscal 2001 (52 weeks) and Fiscal 2000 (53 weeks):

(dollars in thousands, except earnings per share)

Net income for fiscal 2001, a 52-week fiscal year, decreased 5% to $602,089, or $1.29 per diluted share, from $631,437, or $1.35 per diluted share
during fiscal year 2000, a 53-week fiscal year.

Net
sales increased 8% to $34,137,021 in fiscal 2001 from $31,620,723 in fiscal 2000. This increase was due to higher sales at existing locations opened prior to fiscal 2000;
increased sales at 21 warehouses (25 opened, 4 closed) that were opened in fiscal 2000 and in operation for the entire 2001 fiscal year; and first year sales at the 32 new warehouses opened (39
opened, 7 closed) during fiscal 2001. Changes in prices did not materially impact sales levels.

Comparable
sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year, increased at a 4% annual rate in fiscal 2001 compared to an 11% annual rate during fiscal 2000.

Membership
fees and other revenue increased 21% to $660,016, or 1.93% of net sales, in fiscal 2001 from $543,573, or 1.72% of net sales, in fiscal 2000. This increase was primarily
due to the increase in membership fees across most membership categories, averaging approximately $5 per member, which
became effective beginning with renewals on October 1, 2000. Additionally, membership sign-ups at the 32 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2001 were also a factor in this increase.

Gross
margin (defined as net sales minus merchandise costs) increased 7% to $3,538,881, or 10.37% of net sales, in fiscal 2001 from $3,298,553, or 10.43% of net sales, in fiscal 2000.
Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased by six basis points due to costs related to the Executive Membership two percent reward program, which was somewhat offset by gross margin
improvement in the Company's core merchandising activities and ancillary operations. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) method. If all inventories had been valued using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, inventories would have been higher by $13,650 at
September 2, 2001, and $8,150 at September 3, 2000.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 9.17% during fiscal 2001 from 8.71% during fiscal 2000, due to a number of a factors, including an
increase in the entry level wage rate of hourly employees beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000; continued expansion of the Company's co-branded credit card program; higher
utility and energy costs; and higher expenses associated with an increase in new warehouse openings year-over-year (a net of 32 and 21 warehouses opened in fiscal 2001 and
2000, respectively) where expense ratios to sales are typically higher than in more mature warehouses.

Preopening
expenses totaled $59,571, or 0.17% of net sales, during fiscal 2001 and $42,321, or 0.13% of net sales, during fiscal 2000. During fiscal 2001, the Company opened 39 new
warehouses (including relocations) compared to 25 new warehouses (including relocations) during fiscal 2000. Pre-opening


expenses also include costs related to remodels and expanded ancillary operations at existing warehouses, as well as expanded international operations.

The
provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $18,000 in fiscal 2001 compared to $7,000 in fiscal 2000. The fiscal 2001 provision includes charges of $19,000 for the
Canadian administrative reorganization (See "Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"—Liquidity and Capital Resources),
$15,231 for the impairment of long-lived assets and $2,412 for warehouse closing expense, which were offset by $18,643 of gains on the sale of real property. At September 2, 2001,
the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $15,434, of which $6,538 related to future lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for warehouse closing costs of $11,762 at September 3, 2000,
of which $8,887 related to future lease obligations. (See Part II, "Item 8—Financial Statements"—Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements—Note 1).

Interest
expense totaled $32,024 in fiscal 2001, and $39,281 in fiscal 2000. The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest related to
construction projects and a
decrease related to the retirement of an unsecured note payable to banks with a principal amount totaling $140,000 in April 2001.

Interest
income and other totaled $43,238 in fiscal 2001 compared to $54,226 in fiscal 2000. The decrease was primarily due to lower rates of interest earned on lower balances of cash
and cash equivalents and short-term investments during fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000, which was partially offset by improved earnings from Costco Mexico (a 50% owned joint
venture) on a year-over-year basis.

The
effective income tax rate on earnings was 40% in both fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000.

Comparison of Fiscal 2000 (53 weeks) and Fiscal 1999 (52 weeks):

(dollars in thousands, except earnings per share)

Net income for fiscal 2000, a 53-week fiscal year, increased 59% to $631,437, or $1.35 per diluted share, from $397,298, or $0.86 per diluted share
during fiscal year 1999, a 52-week fiscal year. Net income for fiscal 1999 was impacted by both a $50,000 fourth quarter pre-tax provision for impaired assets and warehouse
closing costs, as well as the one-time $118,023 non-cash, after-tax charge recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 1999, reflecting the cumulative effect of the
Company's change in accounting for membership fees from a cash to a deferred method. Excluding the impact of these two charges, net income in fiscal 1999 would have been $545,321, or $1.18 per diluted
share and would have resulted in a 16% increase in net income in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999.

Net
sales increased 17% to $31,620,723 in fiscal 2000 from $26,976,453 in fiscal 1999. This increase was due to: (i) higher sales at existing locations opened prior to fiscal
1999; (ii) increased sales at 14 warehouses (21 opened, 7 closed) that were opened in fiscal 1999 and in operation for the entire 2000 fiscal year; (iii) first year sales at the 21 new
warehouses opened (25 opened, 4 closed) during fiscal 2000; and (iv) fiscal 2000 being a 53-week fiscal year. Changes in prices did not materially impact sales levels.

Comparable
sales, that is sales in warehouses open for at least a year, increased at an 11% annual rate in fiscal 2000 compared to a 10% annual rate during fiscal 1999.

Membership
fees and other revenue increased 13% to $543,573, or 1.72% of net sales, in fiscal 2000 from $479,578, or 1.78% of net sales, in fiscal 1999. This increase was primarily
due to membership sign-ups at the 21 new warehouses opened in fiscal 2000.

Gross
margin (defined as net sales minus merchandise costs) increased 18% to $3,298,553, or 10.43% of net sales, in fiscal 2000 from $2,806,254, or 10.40% of net sales, in fiscal
1999. Gross margin as a


percentage of net sales increased due to increased sales penetration of certain higher gross margin ancillary businesses and private label products and improved performance of the Company's
international operations. The gross margin figures reflect accounting for most U.S. merchandise inventories on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. If all inventories had been
valued using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, inventories would have been higher by $8,150 at September 3, 2000, and $11,150 at August 29, 1999.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 8.71% during fiscal 2000 from 8.67% during fiscal 1999, primarily reflecting higher expenses
associated with international expansion, the rollout of certain ancillary businesses and an increase in credit card merchant fees associated with the rollout of a new co-branded credit
card program which was partially offset by a year-over-year improvement in the Company's core warehouse operations driven by an increase in comparable warehouse sales and
improvements within Central and Regional administrative offices.

Preopening
expenses totaled $42,321, or 0.13% of net sales, during fiscal 2000 and $31,007, or 0.11% of net sales, during fiscal 1999. During fiscal 2000, the Company opened 25 new
warehouses compared to 21 new warehouses during fiscal 1999. Pre-opening expenses also include costs related to remodels, expanded fresh foods and ancillary operations at existing
warehouses, as well as expanded international operations, and the opening of two new regional offices.

The
provision for impaired assets and closing costs was $7,000 in fiscal 2000 compared to $56,500 in fiscal 1999. The fiscal 2000 provision includes a charge of $10,956 for the
impairment of long-lived assets, which was offset by $3,956 of gains on the sale of real property. The fiscal 1999 provision includes a charge of $31,080 for the impairment of
long-lived assets and $30,865 for warehouse and other facility closing costs, which were offset by $5,445 of gains on the sale of real property. The provision for closing costs in fiscal
1999 includes $24,773 for future lease obligations and $6,092 for other expenses directly related to the closedown of warehouses and other facilities. At September 3, 2000, the reserve for
closing costs was $11,762, of which $8,887 related to future lease obligations.

Interest
expense totaled $39,281 in fiscal 2000, and $45,527 in fiscal 1999. The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest related to
construction projects and a decrease in the interest rate related to the 7.125% Senior Notes due to entering into a "fixed-to-floating" interest rate swap agreement in
December 1999 that effectively converted the fixed rate of 7.125% to a floating rate indexed to the 30-day commercial paper rate. In August 2000, the swap agreement was
amended to index the floating rate to the three-month LIBOR rate. Effective December 12, 2000, the Company terminated the swap agreement.

Interest
income and other totaled $54,226 in fiscal 2000 compared to $44,266 in fiscal 1999. The increase was primarily due to higher rates of interest earned on higher balances of
cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments during fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal 1999 and improved earnings from Costco Mexico; a 50% owned joint venture.

The
effective income tax rate on earnings was 40% in both fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999.

Liquidity and Capital Resources (dollars in thousands)

Expansion Plans

Costco's primary requirement for capital is the financing of the land, building and equipment costs for new warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse
operations and working capital requirements, as well as


additional capital for international expansion through investments in foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures.

While
there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is management's current intention to spend an
aggregate of approximately $1,000,000 to $1,150,000 during fiscal 2002 in the United States and Canada for real estate, construction, remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related
operations; and approximately $100,000 to $150,000 for international expansion, including the United Kingdom, Asia, Mexico and other potential ventures. These expenditures will be financed with a
combination of cash provided from operations, the use of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, short-term borrowings under revolving credit facilities and other
financing sources as required.

Expansion
plans for the United States and Canada during fiscal 2002 are to open approximately 34 to 36 new warehouse clubs, including six to seven relocations to larger and
better-located warehouses. The Company expects to continue expansion of its international operations and plans to open two to three additional units in the United Kingdom through its 80%-owned
subsidiary, and one additional unit in Korea through its 96%-owned subsidiary. Other international markets are being assessed.

Costco
and its Mexico-based joint venture partner, Controladora Comercial Mexicana, each own a 50% interest in Costco Mexico. As of September 2, 2001, Costco Mexico operated 20
warehouses in Mexico and plans to open one or two new warehouse clubs during fiscal 2002.

Reorganization of Canadian Administrative Operations

On January 17, 2001, the Company announced plans to reorganize and consolidate the administration of its operations in Canada. Anticipated costs related
to the reorganization are estimated to total $26,000 pre-tax ($15,600 after-tax, or $.03 per diluted share), expensed as incurred in fiscal 2001 and to be incurred in the first
quarter of fiscal 2002. During the current year the Company expensed $19,000 related to this reorganization and consolidation process and has reported this charge as part of the provision for impaired
assets and closing costs.

Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs (all amounts stated in thousands of US dollars)

The Company has in place a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $500,000 bank credit facility with a group of 10 banks, of which $250,000 expires
on November 12, 2002 and $250,000 expires on November 15, 2005. At September 2, 2001, $194,000 was outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding
under the loan facility.

In
addition, a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $129,000 commercial paper program supported by a $90,000 bank credit facility with three Canadian banks, which expires in March,
2002. At September 2, 2001, no amounts were outstanding under the bank credit facility or the Canadian commercial paper program.

The
Company has agreed to limit the combined amount outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the $590,000 combined amounts of the respective supporting
bank credit facilities.

The
Company's wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary has a short-term 3 billion Yen bank line of credit, equal to approximately $25,000, expiring in November 2002.
At September 2, 2001, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit.


Letters of Credit

The Company has separate letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $556,000. The outstanding
commitments under these facilities at September 2, 2001 totaled approximately $127,000, including approximately $29,000 in standby letters of credit.

Financing Activities

During April 2001, the Company retired its unsecured note payable to banks of $140,000 using cash provided from operations, cash and cash equivalents
and short-term borrowings under its commercial paper program.

In
October 2000, the Company's wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary issued 2.070% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of 3.5 billion Yen, equal to $29,400, through a
private placement. Interest is payable annually and principal is due on October 23, 2007.

In
July 2001, the Company's wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary issued 1.187% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of 3 billion Yen, equal to $25,200, through a private
placement. Interest is payable semi-annually and principal is due on July 9, 2008.

In
February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. To date, no securities
have been issued under this filing. On October 23, 2001, subsequent to fiscal 2001 year end, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer up to an additional
$100,000 in debt securities, bringing the total amount of debt securities registered under shelf registration to $600,000.

Derivatives

The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well-defined interest rate and foreign
exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases. The amount of interest rate and foreign exchange contracts
outstanding at September 2, 2001 were not material to the Company's results of operations or its financial position. Effective December 10, 1999, the Company entered into a
"fixed-to-floating" interest rate swap agreement on its $300,000 7.125% Senior Notes, replacing the fixed interest rate with a floating rate indexed to the 30-day
commercial paper rate. On August 11, 2000, the swap agreement was amended to index the floating rate to the three-month LIBOR rate. Effective December 12, 2000, the Company terminated
the swap agreement, resulting in a
gain of approximately $5,000, the benefit of which is being amortized over the remaining term of the debt.

Financial Position and Cash Flows

The Company was in a negative working capital position at September 2, 2001 of approximately $230,000, compared to a positive working capital position
of approximately $66,000 at September 3, 2000. The decrease in net working capital of approximately $296,000 was primarily due to decreases in net inventory levels (inventories less accounts
payable) of approximately $282,000 and increases in short term borrowings of approximately $185,000, offset by an increase in receivables of approximately $150,000.

Net
cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,032,563 in fiscal 2001 compared to $1,070,358 in fiscal 2000. The decrease in net cash from operating activities
year-over-year is primarily a result of a 5% decrease in net income.


Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,339,843 in fiscal 2001 compared to $1,045,664 in fiscal 2000. The investing activities primarily relate to additions to property and
equipment for new and remodeled warehouses of $1,447,549 and $1,228,421 in fiscal 2001 and 2000, respectively. Property dispositions provided the Company with $110,002 in fiscal 2001 and $62,730 in
the prior fiscal year. Net cash used in investing activities also reflects proceeds from sales of short-term investments of $41,599 and $208,959 during fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000,
respectively. Additionally, in fiscal 2001, no funds were used to acquire additional ownership in non-wholly owned subsidiaries, whereas in fiscal 2000 the Company purchased an additional
20% interest in Costco UK from Littlewoods Organisation PLC. The Company increased its investment in Costco Mexico, a 50% owned joint venture, by $28,500 in fiscal 2001. Costco Mexico operates 20
warehouses in Mexico.

Net
cash provided by financing activities totaled $394,345 in fiscal 2001 compared to $58,605 in fiscal 2000. The increase in financing activity for the current year relates to an
increase in short-term borrowings (primarily through the Company's commercial paper program) of $185,942, an increase in bank checks outstanding of $216,661, net proceeds from
long-term borrowings of $81,951 and proceeds from stock option exercises of $62,000, offset by retirement of long-term debt in the current fiscal year of $159,328. Included in
this long-term debt retirement was the retirement of its $140,000 unsecured notes payable to banks in April 2001.

The
Company's balance sheet as of September 2, 2001 reflects a $1,455,846 or 17% increase in total assets since September 3, 2000. The increase is primarily due to a net
increase in property and equipment and merchandise inventory related to the Company's expansion program.

Stock Repurchase Program (dollars in thousands except per share data)

The Company's stock repurchase program, that was authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock over a
three-year period commencing on November 5, 1998, has expired. Under the program, the Company could repurchase shares from time to time in the open market or in private transactions
as market conditions warranted. The repurchased shares would constitute authorized, but unissued shares and would be used for general corporate purposes including stock option grants under stock
option programs. As of September 3, 2000, the Company had repurchased 3.13 million shares of common stock at an average price of $31.96 per share, totaling approximately $99,946
(excluding commissions). The Company did not acquire any additional shares under this program subsequent to fiscal 2000.

Membership Fee Increases

Effective September 1, 2000, the Company increased annual membership fees for its Gold Star (individual), Business, and Business Add-on
Members. These fee increases averaged approximately $5 per member across its member categories.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

During June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative and Hedging Activities, and in June 2000 the FASB issued SFAS 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, an amendment of
SFAS 133. These standards require companies to record derivative financial instruments on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from
changes in the fair value of those derivatives would be accounted for based on the use of the derivative and whether the instrument qualified for hedge accounting, as defined in SFAS 133 and
138. The


Company was required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 133 and 138 on September 4, 2000, the first day of fiscal 2001. The Company's use of derivative instruments was limited to the
fixed-to-floating swap contract on its 7.125% Senior Notes, which was terminated on December 12, 2000, and foreign exchange contracts. The impact of the adoption of this
accounting standard in fiscal 2001 was not material.

In
June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, "Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangibles", which specifies that goodwill and some intangible assets will no longer be
amortized, but instead will be subject to periodic impairment testing. This pronouncement is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2003, but may be adopted in fiscal 2002. The Company is in
the process of evaluating the financial statement impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 142.

In
June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," effective for the Company on January 1, 2003. This Statement addresses
financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. The Company is in the process of
evaluating the financial statement impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 143.

In
August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," effective for the Company on
January 1, 2002. This Statement supersedes FASB Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of" and other related accounting guidance. The Company is in the process of evaluating the financial statement impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 144.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure of Market Risk

The Company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and currency rates. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative
or leveraged transactions, nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.

The
nature and amount of the Company's long and short-term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors.
As of September 2, 2001, all of the Company's debt is fixed rate. The Company's long-term debt includes its $851,877 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes,
Senior Notes with a principal amount of $300,000 and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling $86,411. While fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of this debt,
interest expense will not be affected due to the fixed interest rate of the notes and capital lease obligations.

The
Company's short-term investments as of September 2, 2001 include corporate notes and bonds with maturities of less than sixty days. These investments are
classified as available for sale. If interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately, it could have a material impact on the fair value of these investments. However, changes in interest rates
would not likely have a material impact on interest income.

Most
foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies, limiting the Company's exposure to changes in currency rates. The Company periodically enters into forward
foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases. The foreign exchange contracts outstanding at September 2, 2001 were not
material to the Company's results of operations or its financial position.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To
Costco Wholesale Corporation:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Costco Wholesale Corporation (a Washington corporation) and subsidiaries ("Costco") as of September 2, 2001 and
September 3, 2000, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the 52 weeks ended September 2, 2001, the 53 weeks ended September 3,
2000 and the 52 weeks ended August 29, 1999. These financial statements are the responsibility of Costco's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Costco as of September 2, 2001 and
September 3, 2000, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the 52 weeks ended September 2, 2001, the 53 weeks ended September 3, 2000 and the 52 weeks ended
August 29, 1999, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

As
explained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, during the year ended August 29, 1999, the Company changed its method of accounting for membership fee
income from a cash basis to a deferred basis whereby membership fee income is recognized ratably over the one-year life of the membership.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco Wholesale Corporation, a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries ("Costco" or the
"Company"). All material inter-company transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. Costco primarily operates membership warehouses under the Costco
Wholesale name.

Costco
operates membership warehouses that offer very low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and selected private label products in a wide range of merchandise
categories in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities. At September 2, 2001, Costco operated 365 warehouse clubs: 264 in the United States; 60 in Canada; 11 in the
United Kingdom; five in Korea; three in Taiwan; two in Japan; and 20 warehouses in Mexico with a joint venture partner.

The
Company's investment in the Costco Mexico joint venture and in other unconsolidated joint ventures that are less than majority owned are accounted for under the equity method. The
investment in Costco Mexico is included in other assets and was $147,905 at September 2, 2001 and $92,523 at September 3, 2000. The equity in earnings of Costco Mexico is included in
interest income and other and for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, was $17,378, $10,592 and $5,978, respectively.

Fiscal Years

The Company reports on a 52/53-week fiscal year basis, which ends on the Sunday nearest August 31st. Fiscal year 2001 was 52 weeks, fiscal
year 2000 was 53 weeks and fiscal year 1999 was 52 weeks.

Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Short-term Investments

At September 2, 2001 and September 3, 2000, short-term investments consisted of the following:

The
Company's short-term investments have been designated as being available-for-sale and, accordingly, are reported at fair value. The fair market
value of short-term investments approximates their carrying value and unrealized holding gains and losses were not significant at September 2, 2001 or September 3, 2000.
Realized gains and losses are included in interest income and were not significant in fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999. Short-term investments held by the Company at September 2, 2001,
mature between one and sixty days from the purchase date.


Receivables, net

Receivables consist primarily of vendor rebates and promotional allowances and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company, and are net of allowance for
doubtful accounts of $3,474 at September 2, 2001 and $3,368 at September 3, 2000.

Merchandise Inventories, net

Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using the
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more
closely matching current costs with current revenues. If all merchandise inventories had been valued using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, inventories would have been
higher by $13,650 at September 2, 2001 and $8,150 at September 3, 2000.

The
Company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a standard percentage of sales. This provision is adjusted periodically to
reflect the actual shrinkage results of the physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the Company's fiscal year.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization expenses are computed using the straight-line method for financial
reporting purposes and accelerated methods for tax purposes. Buildings are depreciated over twenty-five to thirty-five years; equipment and fixtures are depreciated over three
to ten years; and land rights and leasehold improvements are amortized over the initial term of the lease.

Interest
costs incurred on property and equipment during the construction period are capitalized. The amount of interest costs capitalized was $19,157 in fiscal 2001, $10,919 in
fiscal 2000, and $4,380 in fiscal 1999.

Goodwill

Goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, resulting from certain business combinations is included in other assets, and totaled $43,831 at September 2,
2001 and $49,230 at September 3, 2000. Goodwill is being amortized over 2 to 40 years using the straight-line method. Accumulated amortization was $19,757 at
September 2, 2001 and $15,896 at September 3, 2000.


Acquisition of Minority Interest

On May 26, 2000, the Company acquired from the Littlewoods Organisation PLC its 20% equity interest in Costco Wholesale UK Limited, bringing the
Company's ownership in Costco Wholesale UK Limited to 80%. The acquisition was funded with cash and cash equivalents on hand. Costco Wholesale UK Limited currently operates eleven Costco warehouse
locations.

Accounts Payable

The Company's banking system provides for the daily replenishment of major bank accounts as checks are presented. Accordingly, included in accounts payable at
September 2, 2001 and September 3, 2000 are $270,757 and $55,002 respectively, representing the excess of outstanding checks over cash on deposit at the banks on which the checks were
drawn.

Derivatives

The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and only uses them to manage well-defined interest rate and foreign
exchange risks. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases. The amount of interest rate and foreign exchange contracts
outstanding at year-end or in place during fiscal 2001 and 2000 was immaterial to the Company's results of operations or its financial position.

Effective
December 10, 1999, the Company entered into a "fixed-to-floating" interest rate swap agreement on its $300,000 7.125% Senior Notes. Effective
December 12, 2000, the Company terminated the swap agreement resulting in a gain of approximately $5,000, which is being amortized over the remaining term of the debt.

Foreign Currency Translations

Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies, as well as the Company's investment in the Costco Mexico joint venture, are translated at the exchange
rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are charged or credited to other comprehensive income (loss). Revenue and expenses of the Company's consolidated
foreign operations are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are included in expenses.

Membership Fees

Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of the Company's members. Effective with the first quarter of fiscal 1999,
the Company changed its method of accounting for membership fee income from a "cash basis" to a "deferred basis" whereby membership fee income is recognized ratably over the one- year life
of the membership. The change to the deferred method of accounting for membership fees resulted in a one-time, non-cash, pre-tax charge of approximately $196,705
($118,023 after-tax, or $.25 per diluted share) to reflect the cumulative effect of the accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal 1999.


Marketing and Promotional Expenses

Costco's policy is generally to limit marketing and promotional expenses to new warehouse openings, occasional direct mail marketing to prospective new members
and annual direct mail marketing programs to existing members promoting selected merchandise. Marketing and promotional costs are expensed as incurred.

Preopening Expenses

Preopening expenses related to new warehouses, major remodels/expansions, regional offices and other startup operations are expensed as incurred.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company periodically evaluates the realizability of long-lived assets based on expected future cash flows. In accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 121, the Company recorded pretax, non-cash charges of $15,231, $10,956 and $31,080 in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, reflecting
its estimate of impairment relating principally to excess property and closed warehouses. The charge reflects the difference between carrying value and fair value, which was based on estimated market
valuations for those assets whose carrying value was not recoverable through future cash flows.

Reorganization of Canadian Administrative Operations

On January 17, 2001, the Company announced plans to reorganize and consolidate the administration of its operations in Canada. Anticipated costs related
to the reorganization are estimated to total $26,000 pre-tax ($15,600 after-tax, or $.03 per diluted share), expensed as incurred in fiscal 2001 and to be incurred in the first
quarter of fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2001 the Company expensed $19,000 related to this reorganization and consolidation process. This charge is included in the provision for impaired assets and
closing costs.

Closing Costs

Warehouse closing costs incurred relate principally to the Company's efforts to relocate certain warehouses that were not otherwise impaired to larger and
better-located facilities. As of September 2, 2001, the Company's reserve for warehouse closing costs was $15,434, of which $6,538 related to lease obligations. This compares to a reserve for
warehouse closing costs of $11,762 at September 3,2000, of which $8,887 related to lease obligations.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."
That standard requires companies to account for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability method.

stock options outstanding, respectively.
These options are excluded due to their anti-dilutive effect as a result of their exercise prices being greater than the average market price of the common shares during those fiscal
years.

The
Company's stock repurchase program that was authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase up to $500,000 of Costco Common Stock over a three-year period,
commencing on November 5, 1998, has expired. Under the program, the Company could repurchase shares from time to time in the open market or in private transactions as market conditions
warranted. The repurchased shares would constitute authorized, but unissued shares and would be used for general corporate purposes including stock option grants under stock option programs. As of
September 3, 2000, the Company had repurchased 3.13 million shares of common stock at an average price of $31.96 per share, totaling approximately $99,946 (excluding commissions). The
Company did not acquire any additional shares under this program subsequent to fiscal 2000.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

During June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative and Hedging Activities, and in June 2000, issued SFAS 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, an amendment of SFAS 133.
These standards require companies to record derivative financial instruments on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair
value of those derivatives would be accounted for based on the use of the derivative and whether the instrument qualified for hedge accounting, as defined in SFAS 133 and 138. The Company was
required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 133 and 138 on September 4, 2000, the first day of fiscal 2001. The Company's use of derivative instruments is limited to the
fixed-to-floating swap contract on its 7.125% Senior Notes, which was terminated on December 12, 2000, and foreign exchange contracts. The impact of adoption was not
material.

In
June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, "Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangibles" which specifies that goodwill and some intangible assets will no longer be
amortized, but instead will be subject to periodic impairment testing. This pronouncement is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2003, but may be adopted in fiscal 2002. The Company is in
the process of evaluating the financial statement impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 142.

In
June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," effective for the Company on January 1, 2003. This Statement addresses
financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. The Company is in the process of
evaluating the financial statement impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 143.

In
August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," effective for the Company on
January 1, 2002. This Statement supersedes FASB Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of" and other related accounting guidance. The Company is in the process of evaluating the financial statement impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 144.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.


Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been reflected in the financial statements in order to conform prior years to the current year presentation.

Note 2—Debt

Bank Lines of Credit and Commercial Paper Programs

The Company has in place a $500,000 commercial paper program supported by a $500,000 bank credit facility with a group of 10 banks, of which $250,000 expires
on November 12, 2002 and $250,000 expires on November 15, 2005. At September 2, 2001, $194,000 was outstanding under the commercial paper program and no amounts were outstanding
under the loan facility. Covenants related to the credit facility place limitations on total company indebtedness. As of September 2, 2001, the Company was in compliance with all restrictive
covenants.

In
addition, a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has a $129,000 commercial paper program supported by a $90,000 bank credit facility with three Canadian banks, which expires in March,
2002. At September 2, 2001, no amounts were outstanding under the bank credit facility or the Canadian commercial paper program.

The
Company has agreed to limit the combined amount outstanding under the U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs to the $590,000 combined amounts of the respective supporting
bank credit facilities.

The
Company's wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary has a short-term 3 billion Yen bank line of credit, equal to approximately $25,000, expiring in November 2002.
At September 2, 2001, no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit.

Letters of Credit

The Company has separate letter of credit facilities (for commercial and standby letters of credit), totaling approximately $556,000. The outstanding
commitments under these facilities at September 2, 2001 totaled approximately $127,000 including approximately $29,000 in standby letters of credit.

In
June 1995, the Company issued $300,000 of 7.125% Senior Notes due June 15, 2005. Interest on the notes is payable semiannually on June 15 and
December 15. The indentures contain certain limitations on the Company's and certain subsidiaries' ability to create liens securing indebtedness and to enter into certain sale leaseback
transactions. In December 1999, the Company entered into a "fixed-to-floating" interest rate swap agreement, which, as amended, replaced the fixed interest rate with a
floating rate indexed to LIBOR. In December 2000, the Company terminated the swap agreement, resulting in a gain of approximately $5,000, which is being amortized over the remaining term of the
debt. As of September 2, 2001, the Company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants.

In
October 2000, the Company's wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary issued 2.070% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of 3.5 billion Yen, equal to $29,400, through a
private placement. Interest is payable annually and principal is due on October 23, 2007.

In
July 2001, the Company's wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary issued 1.187% promissory notes in the aggregate amount of 3 billion Yen, equal to $25,200, through a private
placement. Interest is payable semi-annually and principal is due on July 9, 2008.

During
April 2001, the Company retired its unsecured note payable to banks of $140,000 using cash provided from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and
short-term borrowings under its commercial paper program.

On
August 19, 1997, the Company completed the sale of $900,000 principal amount at maturity Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes (the "Notes") due August 19, 2017. The Notes
were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.500%, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $449,640. The Notes are convertible into a maximum of 20,438,180 shares of Costco Common Stock at an
initial conversion price of $22.00. Holders of the Notes may require the Company to purchase the Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) on August 19,
2002, 2007, or 2012. The Company, at its option, may redeem the Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time on or after August 19, 2002. As of
September 2, 2001, $48,123 in principal amount of the Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders to shares of Costco Common Stock.

In
February 1996, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement for $500,000 of senior debt securities. To date, no securities
have been issued under this filing. On October 23, 2001, subsequent to fiscal 2001 year end, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer up to an additional
$100,000 in debt securities, bringing the total amount of debt securities registered under shelf registration to $600,000.

At
September 2, 2001, the fair value of the 7.125% Senior Notes, based on market quotes, was approximately $317,460. The Senior Notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. The
fair value of the 3.500% Zero Coupon Subordinated Notes at September 2, 2001, based on market quotes, was approximately $755,615. The fair value of other long-term debt approximates
carrying value.

Note 3—Leases

The Company leases land and/or warehouse buildings at 71 of the 345 warehouses open at September 2, 2001, and certain other office and distribution
facilities under operating leases with remaining terms ranging from 1 to 30 years. These leases generally contain one or more of the following options which the Company can exercise at the end
of the initial lease term: (a) renewal of the lease for a defined number of years at the then fair market rental rate; (b) purchase of the property at the then fair market value; or
(c) right of first refusal in the event of a third party purchase offer. Certain leases provide for periodic rental increases based on the price indices and some of the leases provide for rents
based on the greater of minimum guaranteed amounts or sales volume. Contingent rents have not been material.

Additionally,
the Company leases certain equipment and fixtures under short-term operating leases that permit the Company to either renew for a series of
one-year terms or to purchase the equipment at the then fair market value.

Aggregate
rental expense for fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999, was $70,394, $67,886, and $59,263, respectively. Future minimum payments during the next five fiscal years and thereafter

Note 4—Stock Options

The Company's 1993 Combined Stock Grant and Stock Option Plan (the New Stock Option Plan) provides for the issuance of up to 60 million shares of its
common stock upon the exercise of stock options and up to 3,333,332 shares through stock grants. Prior to the merger of The Price Company and Costco Wholesale Corporation, various incentive and
non-qualified stock option plans existed which allowed certain key employees and directors to purchase or be granted common stock of The Price Company and


Costco Wholesale Corporation (collectively the Old Stock Option Plans). Options were granted for a maximum term of ten years, and were exercisable upon vesting. Options granted under these plans
generally vest ratably over five to nine years. Subsequent to the merger, new grants of options have not been made under the Old Stock Option Plans. At September 2, 2001, options for
approximately 15.5 million shares were vested and 3.8 million shares were available for future grants under the plan.

The
Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for stock options. The Company grants stock options to employees
at exercise prices equal to fair market value on the date of grant, accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the plans. Had compensation cost for the Company's stock-based
compensation plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans consistent with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (SFAS No.123),
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," the Company's net income and net income per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

The

pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share in future years.

The

Note 5—Retirement Plans

The Company has a 401(k) Retirement Plan that is available to all U.S. employees who have completed 90 days of employment, except California union
employees. The plan allows pre-tax deferral against which the Company matches 50% of the first one thousand dollars of employee contributions. In addition, the Company will provide each
eligible participant a contribution based on salary and years of service. The Company has a defined contribution plan for Canadian and United Kingdom employees and contributes a percentage of each
employee's salary.

California
union employees participate in a defined benefit plan sponsored by their union. The Company makes contributions based upon its union agreement. The Company also sponsors a
401(k) plan


for the California union employees. The plan currently allows pre-tax deferral against which the Company matches 50% of the first four hundred dollars of employee contributions.

Amounts
expensed under these plans were $108,256, $97,830, and $85,974 for fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. The Company has defined contribution 401(k) and retirement plans
only, and thus has no liability for post-retirement benefit obligations under the SFAS No. 106 "Employer's Accounting for Post-retirement Benefits Other than Pensions."
