PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Overview

Prudential Financial, Inc., a financial services leader with approximately $784 billion of assets under management as of December 31,
2010, has operations in the United States, Asia, Europe and Latin America. Through our subsidiaries and affiliates, we offer a wide array of financial products and services, including life insurance, annuities, retirement-related services, mutual
funds, investment management, and real estate services. We offer these products and services to individual and institutional customers through proprietary and third party distribution networks. Our principal executive offices are located in Newark,
New Jersey.

The businesses of Prudential
Financial are separated into the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. The Financial Services Businesses comprises our U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management division, U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance
division, and International Insurance and Investments division as well as our Corporate and Other operations. The Closed Block Business comprises the assets and related liabilities of the Closed Block described below and certain related assets and
liabilities.

We maintain diversified investment
portfolios in our insurance companies to support our liabilities to customers in our Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, as well as our other general liabilities. Our investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed
maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans, equity securities and other invested assets. As of December 31, 2010, the general account investment portfolio totaled $209.9 billion for the Financial Services Businesses and $65.6
billion for the Closed Block Business. For additional information on our investment portfolio see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—General Account Investments” and Note 4 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Prudential
Financial has two classes of common stock outstanding. The Common Stock, which is publicly traded (NYSE:PRU), reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses, while the Class B Stock, which was issued through a private placement and
does not trade on any exchange, reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business.

Demutualization and Separation of the Businesses

Demutualization

On December 18, 2001, our date of demutualization, Prudential Insurance converted from a mutual life insurance company owned by its policyholders to a stock life insurance company and became an
indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial. The demutualization was carried out under Prudential Insurance’s Plan of Reorganization, dated as of December 15, 2000, as amended, which we refer to as the Plan of Reorganization.
On the date of demutualization, eligible policyholders, as defined in the Plan of Reorganization, received shares of Prudential Financial’s Common Stock or the right to receive cash or policy credits, which are increases in policy values or
increases in other policy benefits, upon the extinguishment of all membership interests in Prudential Insurance.



On the date of demutualization, Prudential Financial completed an initial public offering of
its Common Stock, as well as the sale of shares of Class B Stock, a separate class of common stock, through a private placement. In addition, on the date of demutualization, Prudential Holdings, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial
that owns the capital stock of Prudential Insurance, issued $1.75 billion in senior secured notes, which we refer to as the IHC debt. A portion of the IHC debt was insured by a bond insurer. Concurrent with the demutualization, various subsidiaries
of Prudential Insurance were reorganized, becoming direct or indirect subsidiaries of Prudential Financial.

The Plan of Reorganization required us to establish and operate a regulatory mechanism known as the Closed Block. The Closed Block is
designed generally to provide for the reasonable expectations of holders of participating individual life insurance policies and annuities included in the Closed Block for future policy dividends after demutualization by allocating assets that will
be used for payment of benefits, including policyholder dividends, on these policies. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Closed Block. The Plan of Reorganization provided that Prudential Insurance may,
with the prior consent of the New Jersey Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, enter into agreements to transfer to a third party all or any part of the risks under the Closed Block policies. The Closed Block is 90% reinsured, including 17% by a
wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial.

Separation of
the Businesses

The businesses of Prudential
Financial are separated into the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business for financial statement purposes. For a discussion of the operating results of the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The Financial Services Businesses comprises our U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management division, U.S. Individual Life and Group
Insurance division, and International Insurance and Investments division as well as our Corporate and Other operations. See “—Financial Services Businesses” below for a more detailed discussion of the divisions comprising the
Financial Services Businesses. The Closed Block Business comprises the assets and related liabilities of the Closed Block and certain other assets and liabilities, including the IHC debt. See “—Closed Block Business” below for
additional discussion of the Closed Block Business. We refer to the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business collectively as the Businesses.

The following diagram reflects the allocation of Prudential Financial’s consolidated assets and liabilities between the Financial
Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business:



There is no legal separation of the two Businesses. The foregoing allocation of assets and
liabilities does not require Prudential Financial, Prudential Insurance, any of their subsidiaries or the Closed Block to transfer any specific assets or liabilities to a separate legal entity. Financial results of the Closed Block Business,
including debt service on the IHC debt, will affect Prudential Financial’s consolidated results of operations, financial position and borrowing costs. In addition, any net losses of the Closed Block Business, and any dividends or distributions
on, or repurchases of, the Class B Stock, will reduce the assets of Prudential Financial legally available for dividends on the Common Stock. Accordingly, you should read the financial information for the Financial Services Businesses together with
the consolidated financial information of Prudential Financial.

The Common Stock reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Class B Stock reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business. However, the market value of the Common Stock
may not reflect solely the performance of the Financial Services Businesses.

In order to separately reflect the financial performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business since the date of demutualization, we have allocated all our assets and
liabilities and earnings between the two Businesses, and we account for them as if they were separate legal entities. All assets and liabilities of Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries not included in the Closed Block Business constitute the
assets and liabilities of the Financial Services Businesses. Assets and liabilities allocated to the Closed Block Business are those that we consider appropriate to operate that Business. The Closed Block Business consists principally of:

•

within Prudential Insurance, the Closed Block Assets, Surplus and Related Assets (see below), deferred policy acquisition costs and other assets in
respect of the policies included in the Closed Block and, with respect to liabilities, the Closed Block Liabilities;

•

within Prudential Holdings, LLC, the principal amount of the IHC debt, related unamortized debt issuance costs and hedging activities, and a guaranteed
investment contract; and

•

within Prudential Financial, dividends received from Prudential Holdings, LLC, and reinvestment proceeds thereof, and other liabilities of Prudential
Financial, in each case attributable to the Closed Block Business.

The Closed Block Assets consist of (1) those assets initially allocated to the Closed Block including fixed maturities, equity securities, commercial loans and other long- and short-term investments;
(2) cash flows from such assets; (3) assets resulting from the reinvestment of such cash flows; (4) cash flows from the Closed Block Policies; and (5) assets resulting from the investment of cash flows from the Closed Block
Policies. The Closed Block Assets include policy loans, accrued interest on any of the foregoing assets and premiums due on the Closed Block Policies. The Closed Block Liabilities are Closed Block Policies and other liabilities of the Closed Block
associated with the Closed Block Assets. The Closed Block Assets and Closed Block Liabilities are supported by additional assets held outside the Closed Block by Prudential Insurance to provide additional capital with respect to the Closed Block
Policies, as well as invested assets held outside the Closed Block that initially represented the difference between the Closed Block Assets and the sum of the Closed Block Liabilities and the interest maintenance reserve. We refer to these
additional assets and invested assets outside the Closed Block collectively as the Surplus and Related Assets. The interest maintenance reserve, recorded only under statutory accounting principles, captures realized capital gains and losses
resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates. These gains and losses are amortized into statutory investment income over the expected remaining life of the investments sold or impaired.

On the date of demutualization, the majority of the net
proceeds from the issuances of the Class B Stock and the IHC debt was allocated to our Financial Services Businesses. Also, on the date of demutualization, Prudential Holdings, LLC distributed $1.218 billion of the net proceeds of the IHC debt to
Prudential Financial to use for general corporate purposes in the Financial Services Businesses. Prudential Holdings, LLC deposited $437 million of the net proceeds of the IHC debt in a debt service coverage account maintained in the Financial
Services Businesses that, together with reinvested earnings thereon, constitutes a source of payment and security for the IHC debt. The remainder of the net proceeds, $72 million, was used to purchase a guaranteed investment contract to fund a
portion of the bond insurance related to the IHC debt. To the extent we use the debt service coverage account to service payments with respect to the IHC debt or to pay dividends to Prudential Financial for



purposes of the Closed Block Business, a loan from the Financial Services Businesses to the Closed Block Business would be established. Such an inter-business loan would be repaid by the Closed
Block Business to the Financial Services Businesses when earnings from the Closed Block Business replenish funds in the debt service coverage account to a specified level. See Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information on the IHC debt and the debt service coverage account.

We believe that the proceeds from the issuances of the Class B Stock and IHC debt allocated to the Financial Services Businesses reflected capital in excess of that necessary to support the Closed Block
Business and that the Closed Block Business as established has sufficient assets and cash flows to service the IHC debt. The Closed Block Business was financially leveraged through the issuance of the IHC debt, and dividends on the Class B Stock are
subject to prior servicing of the IHC debt. It is expected that any inter-business loan referred to above will be repaid in full out of the Surplus and Related Assets, but not the Closed Block Assets. Any such loan will be subordinated to the IHC
debt.

The Financial Services Businesses will bear
any expenses and liabilities from litigation affecting the Closed Block Policies and, as discussed below, the consequences of certain potential adverse tax determinations. In connection with the sale of the Class B Stock and IHC debt, we agreed to
indemnify the investors in those securities with respect to certain matters, and any cost of that indemnification would be borne by the Financial Services Businesses.

Within the Closed Block Business, the assets and cash flows
attributable to the Closed Block accrue solely to the benefit of the Closed Block policyholders through policyholder dividends after payment of benefits, expenses and taxes. The Surplus and Related Assets accrue to the benefit of the holders of
Class B Stock. The earnings on, and distribution of, the Surplus and Related Assets over time will be the source or measure of payment of the interest and principal of the IHC debt and of dividends on the Class B Stock. The earnings of the Closed
Block are reported as part of the Closed Block Business, although no cash flows or assets of the Closed Block accrue to the benefit of the holders of Common Stock or Class B Stock. The Closed Block Assets are not available to service interest or
principal of the IHC debt or dividends on the Class B Stock.

Inter-Business Transfers and Allocation Policies

Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors has adopted certain policies with respect to inter-business transfers and accounting and
tax matters, including the allocation of earnings. Such policies are summarized below. In the future, the Board of Directors may modify, rescind or add to any of these policies. However, the decision of the Board of Directors to modify, rescind or
add to any of these policies is subject to the Board of Directors’ general fiduciary duties. In addition, we have agreed with the investors in the Class B Stock and the insurer of the IHC debt that, in most instances, the Board of Directors may
not change these policies without their consent.

Inter-Business Transactions and Transfers

The transactions permitted between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, subject to any required regulatory
approvals and the contractual limitations noted above, include the following:

•

The Closed Block Business may lend to the Financial Services Businesses, and the Financial Services Businesses may lend to the Closed Block Business,
in each case on terms no less favorable to the Closed Block Business than comparable internal loans and only for cash management purposes in the ordinary course of business and on market terms pursuant to our internal short-term cash management
facility.

•

Other transactions between the Closed Block and businesses outside of the Closed Block, including the Financial Services Businesses, are permitted if,
among other things, such transactions benefit the Closed Block, are at fair market value and do not exceed, in any calendar year, a specified formula amount.

•

Capital contributions to Prudential Insurance may be for the benefit of either the Financial Services Businesses or the Closed Block Business and
assets of the Financial Services Businesses within Prudential Insurance may be transferred to the Closed Block Business within Prudential Insurance in the form of a loan which is subordinated to all existing obligations of the Closed Block Business
and on market terms.



•

An inter-business loan from the Financial Services Businesses to the Closed Block Business may be established to reflect usage of the net proceeds of
the IHC debt initially deposited in the debt service coverage account, and any reinvested earnings thereon, to pay debt service on the IHC debt or dividends to Prudential Financial for purposes of the Closed Block Business.

•

In addition to the foregoing, the Financial Services Businesses may lend to the Closed Block Business, on either a subordinated or non-subordinated
basis, on market terms as may be approved by Prudential Financial.

•

The Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business may engage in such other transactions on market terms as may be approved by Prudential
Financial and, if applicable, Prudential Insurance.

•

The Board of Directors has discretion to transfer assets of the Financial Services Businesses to the Closed Block, or use such assets for the benefit
of Closed Block policyholders, if it believes such transfer or usage is in the best interests of the Financial Services Businesses, and such transfer or usage may be made without requiring any repayment of the amounts transferred or used or the
payment of any other consideration from the Closed Block Business.

•

Cash payments for administrative purposes from the Closed Block Business to the Financial Services Businesses are based on formulas that initially
approximated the actual expenses incurred by the Financial Services Businesses to provide such services based on insurance and policies in force and statutory cash premiums. Administrative expenses recorded by the Closed Block Business, and the
related income tax effect, are based upon actual expenses incurred under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP, utilizing the Company’s methodology for the allocation of such expenses. Any difference in the cash
amount transferred and actual expenses incurred as reported under U.S. GAAP will be recorded, on an after-tax basis at the applicable current rate, as direct adjustments to the respective equity balances of the Closed Block Business and the
Financial Services Businesses, without the issuance of shares of either Business to the other Business. This direct equity adjustment modifies earnings available to each class of common stock for earnings per share purposes. Internal investment
expenses recorded and paid by the Closed Block Business, and the related income tax effect, are based upon actual expenses incurred under U.S. GAAP and in accordance with internal arrangements governing recordkeeping, bank fees, accounting and
reporting, asset allocation, investment policy and planning and analysis.

Accounting Policies

Accounting policies relating to the allocation of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses between the two Businesses include:

•

All our assets, liabilities, equity and earnings are allocated between the two Businesses and accounted for as if the Businesses were separate legal
entities. Assets and liabilities allocated to the Closed Block Business are those that we consider appropriate to operate that Business. All remaining assets and liabilities of Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries constitute the assets and
liabilities of the Financial Services Businesses.

•

For financial reporting purposes, revenues; administrative, overhead and investment expenses; taxes other than federal income taxes; and certain
commissions and commission-related expenses associated with the Closed Block Business are allocated between the Closed Block Business and the Financial Services Businesses in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Interest expense and routine maintenance and
administrative costs generated by the IHC debt are considered directly attributable to the Closed Block Business and are therefore allocated to the Closed Block Business, except as indicated below.

•

Any transfers of funds between the Closed Block Business and the Financial Services Businesses will typically be accounted for as either reimbursement
of expense, investment income, return of principal or a subordinated loan, except as described under “—Inter-Business Transactions and Transfers” above.

•

The Financial Services Businesses will bear any expenses and liabilities from litigation affecting the Closed Block Policies and the consequences of
certain potential adverse tax determinations noted below. In connection with the sale of the Class B Stock and IHC debt, we agreed to indemnify the investors with respect to certain matters, and any such indemnification would be borne by the
Financial Services Businesses.



Tax Allocation and Tax Treatment

The Closed Block Business within each legal entity is
treated as if it were a consolidated subsidiary of Prudential Financial. Accordingly, if the Closed Block Business has taxable income, it recognizes its share of income tax as if it were a consolidated subsidiary of Prudential Financial. If the
Closed Block Business has losses or credits, it recognizes a current income tax benefit.

If the Closed Block Business within any legal entity has taxable income, it pays its share of income tax in cash to the Financial Services Businesses. If it has losses or credits, it receives its benefit
in cash from the Financial Services Businesses. If the losses or credits cannot be currently utilized in the consolidated federal income tax return of Prudential Financial for the year in which such losses or credits arise, the Closed Block Business
will receive the full benefit in cash, and the Financial Services Businesses will subsequently recover the payment at the time the losses or credits are actually utilized in computing estimated payments or in the consolidated federal income tax
return of Prudential Financial. Certain tax costs and benefits are determined under the Plan of Reorganization with respect to the Closed Block using statutory accounting rules that may give rise to tax costs or tax benefits prior to the time that
those costs or benefits are actually realized for tax purposes. If at any time the Closed Block Business is allocated any such tax cost or a tax benefit under the Plan of Reorganization that is not realized at that same time under the relevant tax
rules but will be realized in the future, the Closed Block Business will pay such tax cost or receive such tax benefit at that time, but it will be paid to or paid by the Financial Services Businesses. When such tax cost or tax benefit is
subsequently realized under the relevant tax rules, the tax cost or tax benefit will be allocated to the Financial Services Businesses.

The foregoing principles are applied so as to prevent any item of income, deduction, gain, loss, credit, tax cost or tax benefit being
taken into account more than once by the Closed Block Business or the Financial Services Businesses. For this purpose, items determined under the Plan of Reorganization with respect to any period prior to the date of demutualization were taken into
account, with any such pre-demutualization tax attributes relating to the Closed Block being attributed to the Closed Block Business and all other pre-demutualization tax attributes being attributed to the Financial Services Businesses. The Closed
Block Business will also pay or receive its appropriate share of tax or interest resulting from adjustments attributable to the settlement of tax controversies or the filing of amended tax returns to the extent that the tax or interest relates to
controversies or amended returns arising with respect to the Closed Block Business and attributable to tax periods after the date of demutualization, except to the extent that the tax is directly attributable to the characterization of the IHC debt
for tax purposes, in which case the tax will be borne by the Financial Services Businesses. In particular, if a change of tax law after the date of demutualization, including any change in the interpretation of any tax law, results in the
recharacterization of all or part of the IHC debt for tax purposes or a significant reduction in the income tax benefit associated with the interest expense on all or part of the IHC debt, the Financial Services Businesses will continue to pay the
foregone income tax benefit to the Closed Block Business until the IHC debt has been repaid or Prudential Holdings, LLC has been released from its obligations to the bond insurer and under the IHC debt as if such recharacterization or reduction of
actual benefit had not occurred.

Internal
Short-Term Cash Management Facilities

The
Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business participate in separate internal short-term cash management facilities, pursuant to which they invest cash from securities lending and repurchase activities as well as certain trading and
operating activities. The net funds invested in the facility are generally held in investments that are short-term, including mortgage- and asset-backed securities. Each Business holds discrete ownership of its investments in separate facilities
without affecting or being affected by the level of participation of the other Business.

Financial Services Businesses

The Financial Services Businesses is comprised of three divisions, containing seven segments, and our Corporate and Other operations. The U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management division is
comprised of the Individual Annuities, Retirement and Asset Management segments. The U.S. Individual Life



and Group Insurance division is comprised of the Individual Life and Group Insurance segments. The International Insurance and Investments division is comprised of the International Insurance and
International Investments segments.

See Note 22
to the Consolidated Financial Statements for revenues, income and loss, and total assets by segment of the Financial Services Businesses.

U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division

The U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management
division conducts its business through the Individual Annuities, Retirement and Asset Management segments.

Individual Annuities

Our Individual Annuities segment manufactures and distributes individual variable and fixed annuity products, primarily to the U.S. mass affluent market. In general, we consider households with investable
assets or annual income in excess of $100,000 to be mass affluent in the U.S. market. Our focus on innovative product design coupled with our risk management strategies, as discussed below, has contributed to growth in our business in recent years
and a reduced risk profile. Our annuity products are distributed through a diverse group of independent financial planners, wirehouses, banks, and insurance agents, including Prudential Agents and the agency distribution force of The Allstate
Corporation, or Allstate. In the second half of 2006, we began distributing our annuity products through Allstate’s agency distribution force, as discussed below.

On June 1, 2006, we acquired Allstate’s variable
annuity business through a reinsurance transaction for $635 million of total consideration. Beginning June 1, 2006, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the results of operations of the acquired variable annuity business have been
included in our consolidated financial statements. The acquisition increased our scale and third party distribution capabilities in the U.S., including access to the Allstate-affiliated broker-dealer. The integration of the variable annuity business
acquired from Allstate was completed during the second quarter of 2008.

Competition

The Individual Annuities segment competes with other providers of retirement savings and accumulation products, including other large, well-established insurance and financial services companies. We
compete in the individual annuities business primarily based on our ability to offer innovative product features. Our risk management allows us to offer these features and helps to hedge or limit our exposure to certain of the related risks,
utilizing a combination of product design elements, such as an automatic rebalancing element, also referred to as an asset transfer feature, and externally purchased hedging instruments. The automatic rebalancing element, included in the design of
certain optional living benefits, transfers assets between variable investments selected by the annuity contractholder and investments that are expected to be more stable (e.g., a separate account bond portfolio), according to a static mathematical
formula as discussed in more detail below. By transferring assets to the more stable investment, the automatic rebalancing element helps to reduce our risk associated with the optional living benefit. We have benefited from the impact of market
disruptions on some of our competitors, certain of which have either exited the variable annuity marketplace or have implemented product modifications in recent years to increase pricing and scale back product features. Although we have implemented
similar modifications, we believe our modified product offerings have remained competitively positioned. While new competitors are entering the market and others have become more aggressive in product design and pricing, we believe our product
offerings and differentiated risk management strategies will continue to provide us with an attractive risk and profitability profile, as all currently-offered optional living benefit features include the automatic rebalancing element and most sales
include the highest daily guaranteed contract value feature which is described below. In addition to our product features, we also compete based on brand recognition, the breadth of our distribution platform and our customer service capabilities.



Products

We offer variable annuities that provide our customers with
tax-deferred asset accumulation together with a base death benefit and a suite of optional guaranteed death and living benefits. The benefit features contractually guarantee the contractholder a return of no less than (1) total deposits made to
the contract less any partial withdrawals (“return of net deposits”), (2) total deposits made to the contract less any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return (“minimum return”), and/or (3) the highest contract value
on a specified date minus any withdrawals (“contract value”). These guarantees may include benefits that are payable in the event of death, annuitization or at specified dates during the accumulation period and withdrawal and income
benefits payable during specified periods. Our latest optional living benefits guarantee, among other features, the ability to make withdrawals based on the highest daily contract value plus a minimum return, credited for a period of time. This
highest daily guaranteed contract value is accessible through periodic withdrawals for the life of the contractholder, and not as a lump-sum surrender value.

Our variable annuity investment options provide our customers with the opportunity to invest in proprietary and non-proprietary mutual
funds, frequently under asset allocation programs, and fixed-rate accounts. The investments made by customers in the proprietary and non-proprietary mutual funds generally represent separate account interests that provide a return linked to an
underlying investment portfolio. The general account investments made in the fixed-rate accounts are credited with interest at rates we determine, subject to certain minimums. We also offer fixed annuities that provide a guarantee of principal and
interest credited at rates we determine, subject to certain contractual minimums. Certain investments made in the fixed-rate accounts of our variable annuities and certain fixed annuities impose a market value adjustment if the invested amount is
not held to maturity. Based on the contractual terms, the market value adjustment can be positive, resulting in an additional amount for the contractholder, or negative, resulting in a deduction from the contractholder’s account value or
redemption proceeds.

The primary risk exposures
of our variable annuity contracts relate to actual deviations from, or changes to, the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products, including equity market returns, interest rates, market volatility, timing of annuitization and
withdrawals, contract lapses and contractholder mortality. The rate of return we realize from our variable annuity contracts will vary based on the extent of the differences between our actual experience and the assumptions used in the original
pricing of these products. As part of our risk management strategy, we hedge or limit our exposure to certain of these risks primarily through a combination of product design elements, such as an automatic rebalancing element, and externally
purchased hedging instruments. Our returns can also vary by contract based on our risk management strategy, including the impact of any capital markets movements that we may hedge, the impact on that portion of our variable annuity contracts that
benefit from the automatic rebalancing element, and the impact of risks that are not able to be hedged.

As of December 31, 2010, 73% of total variable annuity account values contain a living benefit feature and 76% of variable annuity
account values with living benefit features included an automatic rebalancing element in the product design. The automatic rebalancing element, also referred to as an asset transfer feature, included in the design of certain optional living
benefits, transfers assets between the variable investments selected by the annuity contractholder and, depending on the benefit feature, a fixed-rate account in the general account or a bond portfolio within the separate account. The transfers are
based on the static mathematical formula used with the particular optional benefit which considers a number of factors, including the impact of investment performance on the contractholder’s total account value. In general, negative investment
performance may result in transfers to either a fixed-rate account in the general account or a bond portfolio within the separate account, and positive investment performance may result in transfers back to contractholder-selected investments.
Overall, the automatic rebalancing element is designed to help mitigate our exposure to equity market risk and market volatility. Beginning in 2009, our offerings of optional living benefit features associated with currently-sold variable annuity
products all include an automatic rebalancing element, and in 2009 we discontinued any new sales of optional living benefit features without an automatic rebalancing element. Other product design elements we utilize for certain products to manage
these risks include asset allocation restrictions and minimum issuance age requirements. For information regarding the account values and net amount at risk associated with contracts which include the automatic rebalancing element, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management
Division—Individual Annuities—Variable Annuity Net Amount at Risk.”



As mentioned above, in addition to our automatic rebalancing element, we also manage certain
risks associated with our variable annuity products through our hedging programs. In our living benefit hedging program, we purchase equity options and futures as well as interest rate derivatives to hedge certain optional living benefit features
accounted for as embedded derivatives against changes in equity markets, interest rates, and market volatility. Historically, our hedging strategy sought to generally match the sensitivities of the embedded derivative liability as defined by GAAP,
excluding the impact of the market-perceived risk of our own non-performance, with capital market derivatives and options. In the third quarter of 2010, we revised our hedging strategy as, in the low interest rate environment, we do not believe the
GAAP value of the embedded derivative liability to be an appropriate measure for determining the hedge target. Our new hedge target continues to be grounded in a GAAP/capital markets valuation framework but incorporates modifications to the
risk-free return assumption to account for the fact that the underlying customer separate account funds which support these living benefits are invested in assets that contain risk. Consistent with sound risk management practices, we evaluate hedge
levels versus our target given overall capital considerations of the Company and prevailing capital market conditions and may decide to temporarily hedge to an amount that differs from our hedge target definition. Because this decision is based on
the overall capital considerations of the Company as a whole, the impact on results from temporarily hedging to an amount that differs from our hedge target definition is reported through Corporate and Other operations. For information regarding the
results of our hedging program, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—U.S. Retirement Solutions and
Investment Management Division—Individual Annuities.”

In the second quarter of 2009, we began the expansion of our hedging program to include a portion of the market exposure related to the overall capital position of our variable annuity business, including
the impact of certain statutory reserve exposures. These capital hedges primarily consisted of equity-based total return swaps that were designed to partially offset changes in our capital position resulting from market driven changes in certain
living and death benefit features of our variable annuity products. During the second quarter of 2010, we removed the equity component of our capital hedge within the Individual Annuities segment by terminating the equity-based total return swaps,
as part of a new program to more broadly address the equity market exposure of the statutory capital of the Company as a whole, under stress scenarios. Since the new program incorporates capital implications across a number of businesses, the
results of the hedges under that program are reported within Corporate and Other operations. Additionally, as mentioned above, to the extent we decide to hedge to an amount that differs from our target hedge definition in our living benefit hedge
program, those results would also be reported through Corporate and Other operations. We continue to assess the composition of the hedging program on an ongoing basis.

Marketing and Distribution

Prudential Agents

Our Prudential Agents distribute variable annuities with
proprietary and non-proprietary investment options, as well as fixed annuities. For additional information regarding our Prudential Agent force, see “—U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance Division—Individual Life.”

Third Party Distribution

Our individual annuity products are also offered through a
variety of third party channels, including independent brokers, wirehouses, banks, and Allstate’s proprietary distribution force. Our distribution efforts are supported by a network of 308 internal and external wholesalers as of
December 31, 2010.

Underwriting and Pricing

We earn asset management and other fees
determined as a percentage of the average assets of the proprietary mutual funds in our variable annuity products. We also earn mortality and expense fees and other fees for various insurance-related options and features, including optional
guaranteed death and living benefit features, based on the average daily net asset value of the annuity separate accounts or the amount of guaranteed value under the optional living benefit, as applicable. We receive administrative service fees from
many of the



proprietary and non-proprietary mutual funds. We price our variable annuities, including optional guaranteed death and living benefits, based on an evaluation of the risks assumed and considering
applicable hedging costs. We price our fixed annuities as well as the fixed-rate accounts of our variable annuities based on assumptions as to investment returns, expenses and persistency. Competition also influences our pricing. We seek to maintain
a spread between the return on our general account invested assets and the interest we credit on our fixed annuities and the fixed-rate accounts of our variable annuities. For assets transferred to a fixed-rate account in the general account
pursuant to the automatic rebalancing element discussed above, we earn a spread for the difference between the return on our general account invested assets and the interest credited, similar to our fixed annuities. To encourage persistency, most of
our variable and fixed annuities have surrender or withdrawal charges for a specified number of years. In addition, the living benefit features of our variable annuity products encourage persistency because the potential value of the living benefit
is fully realized only if the contract persists.

Reserves

We establish and carry as liabilities
actuarially-determined reserves for future policy benefits that we believe will meet our future obligations for our in force annuity contracts, including the death benefit and living benefit guarantee features associated with some of these
contracts. We base these reserves on assumptions we believe to be appropriate for investment yield, persistency, expenses, withdrawal rates, mortality rates, as well as margins for adverse deviation. Certain of the living benefit guarantee features
on variable annuity contracts are accounted for as embedded derivatives and are carried at fair value. The fair values of these benefit features are calculated as the present value of future expected benefit payments to customers less the present
value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature, and are based on management’s expectation of how a market participant would value these embedded derivative liabilities. For variable and fixed annuity contracts, we
establish liabilities for policyholders’ account balances that represent cumulative gross premium payments plus credited interest and/or fund performance, less withdrawals, and all applicable mortality and expense charges.

Retirement

Our Retirement segment, which we refer to in the marketplace as Prudential Retirement, provides retirement
investment and income products and services to retirement plan sponsors in the public, private, and not-for-profit sectors. Our full service business provides recordkeeping, plan administration, actuarial advisory services, tailored participant
education and communication services, trustee services and institutional and retail investments. We service defined contribution, defined benefit and non-qualified plans. For clients with combinations of defined contribution, defined benefit and
non-qualified plans, we offer integrated recordkeeping services. For participants leaving our clients’ plans, we provide a broad range of rollover products through our broker-dealer, Prudential Investment Management Services LLC, our bank,
Prudential Bank & Trust, FSB, and certain of our insurance companies. In addition, in our institutional investment products business, we offer guaranteed investment contracts, or GICs, funding agreements, institutional and retail notes,
investment-only stable value products, structured settlement annuities, and group annuities, for defined contribution plans, defined benefit plans, non-qualified plans, and individuals. Results of our institutional investment products business
include proprietary spread lending activities where we borrow on a secured or unsecured basis to support investments on which we earn a spread between the asset yield and liability cost.

In recent years we have completed two acquisitions which have increased our scale, expanded our sales and
distribution capabilities and broadened our array of product and service offerings in our full service business.

Union Bank of California’s Retirement Business

On December 31, 2007, we acquired a portion of the
retirement business of Union Bank of California, N.A. for $103 million of cash consideration. This acquisition increased the scale of our product and service offerings and expanded our sales and distribution capabilities on the west coast of the
U.S. The integration of this business was completed in 2008.



MullinTBG

On October 10, 2008, we acquired MullinTBG Insurance
Agency Services, LLC and related entities, or MullinTBG, a provider of executive benefit solutions and financing strategies, including administration of non-qualified executive benefit plans. This acquisition broadened our array of product
offerings, expanded our sales and distribution capabilities and enhanced our position as a single source servicer of both qualified and non-qualified retirement and deferred compensation plans.

Competition

The Retirement segment competes with other large,
well-established insurance companies, asset managers, recordkeepers and diversified financial institutions. In our full service business, we compete primarily based on pricing, the breadth of our service and investment offerings, investment
performance, and our ability to offer product features to meet the retirement income needs of our clients. We have seen a trend towards unbundling of the purchase decision related to the recordkeeping and investment offerings, where the variety and
flexibility of available funds and their performance are key selection criteria to plan sponsors and intermediaries. In recent years, there has been consolidation among industry providers seeking to increase scale, improve cost efficiencies, and
enter new market segments. However, the market remains competitive with few dominant players.

In our institutional investment products business, we compete primarily based on our pricing and structuring capabilities, which are supported by the financial strength ratings of our U.S. insurance
companies. Sales of institutional investment products are affected by competitive factors such as investment performance, company credit and financial strength ratings, product design, marketplace visibility, distribution capabilities, fees,
crediting rates, and customer service. In recent years, market disruptions and rating agency downgrades have caused some of our competitors to withdraw from the institutional market. A continuing lack of supply to the stable value wrap market has
created a significant growth opportunity, which has resulted in a material increase in this business activity.

Products and Services

Full Service

Our full service business offers plan sponsors and their participants a broad range of products and services to assist in the delivery and administration of defined contribution, defined benefit, and
non-qualified plans, including recordkeeping and administrative services, comprehensive investment offerings and consulting services to assist plan sponsors in managing fiduciary obligations. As part of our investment products, we offer a variety of
general and separate account stable value products and other fee-based separate accounts, as well as retail mutual funds and institutional funds advised by affiliated and non-affiliated investment managers. In addition, certain products that are
designed for the benefit of participants are marketed and sold on an investment-only basis through our full service distribution channels. Revenue is generated from asset-based fees, recordkeeping and other advisory fees. For certain stable value
products discussed below, profits result from the spread between the rate of return on investments we earn and the interest rates we credit, less expenses. In connection with non-qualified retirement and deferred compensation plans, we earn
recordkeeping fees and commissions on products sold to finance the sponsor’s plan liability. Prudential Financial’s asset management units earn fees from the management of the general account assets supporting retirement products,
including stable value products as discussed below and, to the extent these units are selected to manage client assets associated with fee-based products, they also earn asset management fees related to those assets.

Our full service general account and separate account stable
value products contain an obligation to pay interest at a specified rate for a specific period of time and to repay account balances or market value upon contract termination. These stable value products are either fully or partially participating,
with annual or semi-annual rate resets giving effect to previous investment experience. We earn administrative fees for providing recordkeeping and other administrative services for these products. In addition, we earn profits from partially
participating products from the spread between the rate of return we earn on the investments and the interest rates we credit, less expenses.



We also offer fee-based separate account products, through which customer funds are held in
a separate account, retail mutual funds, institutional funds, or a client-owned trust. These products generally pass all of the investment results to the customer. In certain cases, these contracts are subject to a minimum interest rate guarantee
backed by the general account. Additionally, we offer guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits associated with certain defined contribution accounts, and hedge certain of the related risks utilizing externally purchased hedging instruments.

Our full service offerings are supported by
participant communications and education programs, and a broad range of plan consulting services, including non-discrimination testing, plan document services, signature-ready documents for required filings, and full actuarial support for defined
benefit plans. Additional services include non-qualified deferred compensation plan administration, including executive benefit solutions and financing strategies, investment advisory services, and merger and acquisition support.

We also offer a broad range of brokerage and banking
solutions, including rollover individual retirement accounts, or IRA’s, mutual funds, and guaranteed income products. Our rollover products and services are marketed to participants who terminate or retire from organizations that are clients of
our retirement plan recordkeeping services.

Institutional Investment Products

The institutional investment products business primarily offers products to the stable value and payout annuity markets. In addition to
the profits discussed below, Prudential Financial’s asset management units earn fees from the management of the general account assets supporting retirement products and, to the extent these units are selected to manage client assets associated
with fee-based products, they also earn asset management fees related to those assets.

Stable Value Markets.

Our stable value markets area manufactures investment-only products for use in retail and institutional capital markets and qualified plan markets. Our
primary investment-only general account products are GICs, funding agreements, retail notes and institutional notes. This area also manufactures general and separate account and client-owned trust stable value products, the results of which are
reflected in the full service business. We also offer investment-only stable value wrap products through which customers’ funds are held in either a client-owned trust or a separate account. We pass investment results through to the customer,
subject to a minimum interest rate guarantee backed by the general account and earn fees for providing this guarantee.

Our investment-only general account products offered within this market contain an obligation to pay interest at a specified rate and to
repay principal at maturity or following contract termination. Because these obligations are backed by our general account, we bear the investment and asset/liability management risk associated with these contracts. Generally, profits from our
general account products result from the spread between the rate of return we earn on the investments and the interest rates we credit, less expenses. The credited interest rates we offer and the volume of issuance are impacted by many factors,
including the financial strength ratings of our U.S. insurance companies, overall market conditions, and other competitive factors.

Payout Annuity Markets.

Our payout annuity markets area offers traditional general and separate account
products designed to provide a predictable source of monthly income, generally for the life of the participant, such as structured settlements, voluntary income products and close-out annuities, which fulfill the payment guarantee needs of the
personal injury lawsuit settlement market, the distribution needs of defined contribution participants and the payment obligations of defined benefit plans, respectively. With our general account products, the obligation to make annuity payments to
our annuitants is backed by our general account assets, and we bear all of the investment, mortality, retirement, asset/liability management, and expense risk associated with these contracts. Our profits from structured settlements, voluntary income
products and close-out annuities result from the emerging experience related to investment returns, timing of mortality, timing of retirement, and the level of expenses being more or less favorable than assumed in the original pricing. The volume of
issuance of these products is impacted by many factors, including the financial strength ratings of our U.S. insurance companies.



We also provide participating separate account annuity contracts, which are fee-based
products that cover payments to retirees to be made by defined benefit plans. These contracts permit a plan sponsor to retain the risks and rewards of investment and actuarial results while receiving a general account guarantee for all annuity
payments covered by the contract.

Marketing and
Distribution

We distribute our products
through a variety of channels. In our full service business, our dedicated sales and support teams manage our distribution efforts in offices across the country. We sell our products and services through third-party financial advisors, brokers, and
benefits consultants and, to a lesser extent, directly to plan sponsors. We market our rollover IRA products and services to plan participants through a centralized service team.

In our stable value markets area within our institutional
investment products business, we distribute GICs and funding agreements to institutional investors through our direct sales force and through intermediaries. We also have a global Funding Agreement Notes Issuance Program, or FANIP, pursuant to which
a statutory trust issues medium-term notes secured by funding agreements issued to the trust by Prudential Insurance. The medium-term notes are sold to institutional investors through intermediaries under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”). In addition, a portion of Prudential Financial’s SEC-registered medium-term notes program is allocated for sales to retail investors. The proceeds from the sale of the retail notes may be
used by Prudential Financial to purchase funding agreements from Prudential Insurance. Proceeds from the retail notes may also be used for general corporate purposes. In February 2009, Prudential Insurance also began issuing funding agreements
directly to the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York.

In our payout annuity markets area within our institutional investment products business, structured settlements are distributed through
structured settlement specialists. Voluntary income products are distributed through the defined contribution portion of our full service business, directly to plan sponsors, or as part of annuity shopping services. Close-out annuities and
participating separate account annuity products are typically distributed through actuarial consultants and third-party brokers.

Underwriting and Pricing

We set our rates for our stable value products within our full service and institutional investment products businesses using pricing
models that consider the investment environment and our risk, expense and profitability assumptions. In addition, for products within our payout annuity markets area, our models also use assumptions for mortality and early retirement risks. Upon
sale of a product, we adjust the duration of our asset portfolio and lock in the prevailing interest rates. Management continuously monitors cash flow experience and works closely with our Asset Liability Management and Risk Management groups to
review performance and ensure compliance with our investment policies. We seek to mitigate interest rate risks, including those associated with the current low interest rate environment, with thorough underwriting, pricing and active asset/liability
matching portfolio management.

Reserves

We establish and carry as liabilities actuarially-determined
reserves for future policy benefits that we believe will meet our future obligations for our in force annuity products. We base these reserves on assumptions we believe to be appropriate for investment yield, expenses, mortality rates, retirement,
as well as margins for adverse deviation as appropriate. For accumulation products, we establish liabilities for policyholders’ account balances and additional reserves for investment experience that will accrue to the customer but have not yet
been reflected in credited rates.

Asset Management

The Asset Management segment provides a
broad array of investment management and advisory services by means of institutional portfolio management, mutual funds, asset securitization activity and other structured



products, and proprietary investments. These products and services are provided to the public and private marketplace, as well as our U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance division,
International Insurance and Investments division and Individual Annuities and Retirement segments, as well as the Closed Block Business.

We earn asset management fees which are typically based upon a percentage of assets under management. In certain asset management fee
arrangements, we also receive performance-based incentive fees when the return on assets under management exceeds certain benchmark returns or other performance targets. Transaction fees are earned as a percentage of the transaction price associated
with the sale or purchase of assets in certain funds, primarily related to real estate. In addition, we earn commercial mortgage servicing fees and investment results from proprietary investing.

Competition

The Asset Management segment competes with numerous asset
managers and other financial institutions. In the markets for our asset management products, we compete based on a number of factors, including investment performance, investment philosophy and process, talent, organizational stability and the
client relationship. Our private placement and commercial mortgage businesses compete based on price, terms, execution and the strength of our relationship with the borrower. The competition will vary depending on the product or service being
offered.

Operating Data

The following tables set forth the assets under management
of the investment management and advisory services group of our Asset Management segment at fair value by asset class and source as of the dates indicated.

(1)

Consists of third party institutional assets and group insurance contracts.

(2)

Consists of: (a) individual mutual funds and both variable annuities and variable life insurance assets in our separate accounts; (b) funds invested in
proprietary mutual funds through our defined contribution plan products; and (c) third party sub-advisory relationships. Fixed annuities and the fixed rate options of both variable annuities and variable life insurance are included in the
general account.



(3)

Includes private fixed income and commercial mortgage assets of institutional customers of $10.9 billion as of December 31, 2010, $10.1 billion as of
December 31, 2009 and $9.1 billion as of December 31, 2008, and private fixed income and commercial mortgage assets in our general account of $72.5 billion, $64.5 billion and $61.7 billion, as of those dates, respectively.

Products and Services

In our asset management areas, we offer the following
products and services:

Public Fixed Income
Asset Management

Our public fixed income
organization manages fixed income portfolios for U.S. and international, institutional and retail clients, as well as for our general account. Our products include traditional broad market fixed income strategies and single-sector strategies. We
manage traditional asset-liability strategies, as well as customized asset-liability strategies. We also manage hedge strategies, as well as collateralized loan obligations. We also serve as a non-custodial securities lending agent.

Portfolios are managed by seasoned portfolio managers
across six sector specialist teams: Corporate, Leveraged Finance, Emerging Markets, Global Rates and Securitized Products, Municipals and Money Markets. A separate team is dedicated to securities lending activities. All strategies are managed using
a research-based approach, supported by significant credit research, quantitative research, and risk management organizations.

Public Equity Asset Management

Our public equity organization provides discretionary and non-discretionary asset management services to a wide range of clients. We
manage a broad array of publicly-traded equity asset classes using various investment styles. The public equity organization is comprised of two wholly-owned registered investment advisors, Jennison Associates LLC and Quantitative Management
Associates LLC. Jennison Associates uses fundamental, team-based research to manage portfolios for institutional and private clients through separately-managed accounts and commingled vehicles, including mutual funds through subadvisory
relationships. Jennison Associates also manages fixed income portfolios for institutional clients through discretionary accounts and commingled vehicles, including mutual funds through subadvisory relationships. Quantitative Management Associates
manages equity and asset allocation portfolios for institutional and subadvisory clients, including mutual funds, using proprietary quantitative models tailored to meet client objectives.

Private Fixed Income Asset Management

Our private fixed income organization provides asset management services by investing in private placement
investment grade debt, private placement below investment grade debt, and mezzanine debt securities. These investment capabilities are utilized by our general account and institutional clients through direct advisory accounts, insurance company
separate accounts, and private fund structures. A majority of the private placement investments are directly originated by our investment staff.

Commercial Mortgage Origination and Servicing

Our commercial mortgage operations provide mortgage
origination, asset management and servicing for our general account, institutional clients, and government-sponsored entities such as Fannie Mae, the Federal Housing Administration, and Freddie Mac. Through the third quarter of 2008, we had
originated shorter-term interim loans for spread lending that are collateralized by assets generally under renovation or lease up. Due to unfavorable market conditions experienced at that time and the inherent risk of these loans, we suspended the
origination of interim loans. Our interim loans are generally paid off through refinancing or the sale by the borrower of the underlying collateral. These loans are inherently more risky than those collateralized by properties that have already
stabilized. As of December 31, 2010, the principal balance of interim loans totaled $1.3 billion.

Real Estate Asset Management

Our global real estate organization provides asset management services for single-client and commingled private and public real estate
portfolios and manufactures and manages a variety of real estate investment



vehicles investing in private and public real estate, primarily for institutional clients through 20 offices worldwide. Our domestic and international real estate investment vehicles range from
fully diversified open-end funds to specialized closed-end funds that invest in specific types of properties or specific geographic regions or follow other specific investment strategies. Our global real estate organization has an established
presence in the U.S., Europe, Asia and Latin America.

Proprietary Investments

We make proprietary investments to support the creation and management of funds offered to third-party investors in private and public real estate, fixed income and public equities asset classes. The fair
value of these investments was approximately $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For more information on these investments, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division—Asset Management.” Certain of these investments are made primarily for purposes
of co-investment in our managed funds and structured products. Other proprietary investments are made with the intention to sell or syndicate to investors, including our general account, or for placement in funds and structured products that we
offer and manage (seed investments). We also make loans to, and guarantee obligations of, our managed funds that are secured by equity commitments from investors or assets of the funds.

Mutual Funds and Other Retail Services

We manufacture, distribute and service investment management products primarily utilizing proprietary asset
management expertise in the U.S. retail market. Our products are designed to be sold primarily by financial professionals including both Prudential Agents and third party advisors. We offer a family of retail investment products consisting of 41
mutual funds as of December 31, 2010. These products cover a wide array of investment styles and objectives designed to attract and retain assets of individuals with varying objectives and to accommodate investors’ changing financial
needs.

Additionally, we offer banks and other
financial services organizations a wealth management platform, which permits such banks and organizations to provide their retail clients with services including asset allocation, investment manager research and access, clearing, trading services,
and performance reporting.

Marketing and Distribution

We provide investment management
services for our institutional customers through a proprietary sales force organized by asset management business. Each asset management business has an independent marketing and client service team working with clients. Institutional asset
management services are also offered through the Retirement segment of the U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management division.

Most of the retail customer assets under management are invested in our mutual funds and our variable annuities and variable life
insurance products. These assets are gathered by the U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance division, the International Insurance and Investments division, the Individual Annuities segment and third party networks. Additionally, we work with third
party product manufacturers and distributors to include our investment options in their products and platforms.

We also provide investment management services across a broad array of asset classes for our general account, as described under
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—General Account Investments.”

U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance Division

The U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance
division conducts its business through the Individual Life and Group Insurance segments.



Individual Life

Our Individual Life segment manufactures and distributes
individual variable life, term life and universal life insurance products primarily to the U.S. mass middle, mass affluent and affluent markets. In general, we consider households with investable assets or annual income in excess of $100,000 to be
mass affluent and households with investable assets in excess of $250,000 to be affluent in the U.S. market. Our life products are distributed through independent third party distributors and Prudential Agents.

Certain fixed expenses are allocated between the Individual
Life segment and the Closed Block Business based upon allocation methodologies consistent with U.S. GAAP reporting. However, as policies in force within the Closed Block Business continue to mature or terminate, the level of expenses to be allocated
to the Closed Block Business will decrease, potentially increasing the expense allocations to the Individual Life segment.

Competition

The Individual Life segment competes with large, well-established life insurance companies. We compete primarily based on price, service,
distribution channel relationships, brand recognition and financial stability. Due to the large number of competitors, price competition is strong. Factors that could influence our ability to competitively price products while achieving targeted
returns include: the cost and availability of financing for statutory reserves required for certain term and universal life insurance policies, the timing of and our ability to utilize tax deductions associated with statutory reserves, product
designs which impact the amount of statutory reserves and the associated tax deductions, and the level of and pace of changes in interest rates. The current environment of low interest rates and volatile equity markets has resulted in a greater
demand for dividend-paying whole life products across the industry which we no longer offer.

Products

Our primary insurance products are variable life, term life and universal life and represent 42%, 49% and 8%, respectively, of our face amount of individual life insurance, net of reinsurance, in force at
the end of 2010. In recent years, as term life insurance sales have increased and variable life insurance sales have decreased, we have seen term life insurance become a larger percentage of our net in force.

Across all of our products we offer a living benefits option
that allows insureds who are diagnosed with a terminal illness, or permanently confined to a nursing home, to receive a portion of their insurance benefit upon diagnosis, in advance of death, to use as needed.

We have a variety of settlement and payment options for the
settlement of life insurance claims in addition to lump sum checks, including placing benefits in retained asset accounts, which earn interest and are subject to withdrawal in whole or in part at any time by the beneficiaries.

Variable Life Insurance

We offer a number of individual variable life insurance
products that provide a return linked to an underlying investment portfolio selected by the policyholder while providing the policyholder with the flexibility to change both the death benefit and premium payments. The policyholder generally has the
option of investing premiums in a fixed rate option that is part of our general account and/or investing in separate account investment options consisting of equity and fixed income funds. Funds invested in the fixed rate option will accrue interest
at rates we determine that vary periodically based on our portfolio rate. In the separate accounts, the policyholder bears the fund performance risk. Each product provides for the deduction of charges and expenses from the customer’s contract
fund. We also offer a variable product that has the same basic features as our variable universal life product but also allows for a more flexible guarantee against lapse where policyholders can select the guarantee period. In the affluent market,
we offer a private placement variable universal life product, which also utilizes investment options consisting of equity and fixed income funds. While variable life insurance continues to be an important product, marketplace demand continues to
favor term and universal life insurance.



A significant portion of our Individual Life insurance segment’s profits are associated
with our large in force block of variable policies. Profit patterns on these policies are not level and as the policies age, insureds generally begin paying reduced policy charges. This, coupled with net policy count and insurance in force runoff
over time, reduces our expected future profits from this product line. Asset management fees and mortality and expense fees are a key component of variable life product profitability and vary based on the average daily net asset value. Due to
policyholder options under some of the variable life contracts, lapses driven by unfavorable equity market performance may occur on a quarter lag with the market risk during this period being borne by the Company.

Term Life Insurance

We offer a variety of term life insurance products that
provide coverage for a specified time period. Most term products include a conversion feature that allows the policyholder to convert the policy into permanent life insurance coverage. We also offer term life insurance that provides for a return of
premium if the insured is alive at the end of the level premium period. There continues to be significant demand for term life insurance protection.

Individual Life profits from term insurance are not expected to directly correlate, from a timing perspective, with the increase in term
insurance in force. This results from uneven product profitability patterns, as well as varying costs of our ongoing capital management activities related to a portion of the statutory reserves associated with these products, which may vary with
each year of business issued.

Universal Life
Insurance

We offer universal life insurance
products that feature a fixed crediting rate that varies periodically based on portfolio returns, flexible premiums and a choice of guarantees against lapse. Universal life policies provide for the deduction of charges and expenses from the
policyholders’ contract fund. Individual Life profits from universal life insurance are impacted by mortality and expense margins and net interest spread.

Marketing and Distribution

Third Party Distribution

Our individual life products are offered through a variety of third party channels, including independent brokers, general agencies and
producer groups. We focus on sales through independent intermediaries who provide life insurance solutions to protect individuals, families and businesses and support estate and wealth transfer planning. The life insurance products offered are
generally the same as those available through Prudential Agents. Our third party efforts are supported by a network of internal and external wholesalers. We also offer a simplified-issue term life insurance policy and a single-premium universal life
insurance policy available to customers of select banks and other financial institutions.

Prudential Agents

Our Prudential Agents distribute Prudential variable, term and universal life insurance, variable and fixed annuities, long-term care, and investment and other protection products with proprietary and
non-proprietary investment options as well as selected insurance and investment products manufactured by others. The number of Prudential Agents was 2,471, 2,447 and 2,360 at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Over the same period,
average agent productivity, based upon average commissions on new sales of all products by Prudential Agents, has decreased to $52,739 for 2010 from $57,700 for 2008 due to unstable market conditions and the shift of the agent population toward new
and less experienced agents, which tends to temporarily depress overall productivity.

Prudential Agent product sales are primarily to customers in the U.S. mass and mass affluent markets, as well as small business owners. Other than certain training allowances or salary paid at the
beginning of their employment, we pay Prudential Agents on a commission basis for the products they sell. In addition to commissions, Prudential Agents receive employee benefits, including medical and disability insurance, an employee savings
program and qualified retirement plans.



Prior to the sale of our property and casualty insurance operations in 2003, the Individual
Life segment had been compensated for property and casualty insurance products sold through Prudential Agents. Following the sale, Prudential Agents have continued access to non-proprietary property and casualty products under distribution
agreements entered into with the purchasers of these businesses, as well as other non-proprietary product providers; therefore, the Individual Life segment continues to be compensated for sales of these products.

The compensation arrangements for certain non-proprietary
products provide an opportunity for additional compensation to the Individual Life segment based on multi-year profitability of the products sold. This additional compensation is not predictable since the multi-year profitability of the products is
subject to substantial variability and, additionally, the compensation arrangements are periodically renegotiated which will affect the amount of additional compensation we are eligible to receive. The largest of these arrangements was revised
effective in late 2008 and the profit opportunities were significantly reduced in 2010 and beyond.

As mentioned above, the Individual Life segment distributes products offered by the Annuities, Group Insurance and Asset Management segments and is paid a market rate by these businesses to distribute
their products. These payments may be more or less than the associated distribution costs, and any profit or loss is included in the results of the Individual Life segment.

Underwriting and Pricing

For our fully underwritten life insurance, underwriters
follow detailed and uniform policies and procedures to assess and quantify the risk of our individual life insurance products. Depending on the age of the applicant and amount of insurance requested, we require the applicant to take a variety of
underwriting tests, such as medical examinations, electrocardiograms, blood tests, urine tests, and gather information such as physician records and investigative reports. We base premiums and policy charges for individual life insurance on expected
death benefits, surrender benefits, expenses and required reserves. We use assumptions for mortality, interest, expenses, policy persistency, and premium payment pattern in pricing policies. Some of our policies are fully guaranteed. Others have
current premiums/charges and interest credits that we can change subject to contractual guarantees.

Our operating results are impacted by changes in interest rates. We routinely update the interest crediting rates that we credit to policyholder accounts on our universal life policies and on the fixed
account of our variable life policies, which are both subject to contractual minimum rates. In resetting these rates, we consider the returns on our portfolios supporting these policies, current interest rates, the competitive environment and our
profit objectives. We seek to maintain a spread between the return on our general account invested assets and the interest we credit on our policyholder accounts. We seek to mitigate interest rate risks, including those associated with the current
low interest rate environment, with active asset/liability matching portfolio management. For term life products, interest rate assumptions used to calculate reserves are fixed at the policy issue date and subsequent declines in portfolio yields
have an immediate impact on product profitability.

Our operating results are also impacted by differences between actual separate account fund performance, mortality and persistency
experience and the assumptions used in pricing these policies and, as a result, can fluctuate from period to period. Our Individual Life segment employs capital management activities, including the financing of tax deductible statutory reserves
required for certain term and universal life insurance policies, to maximize product returns and enable competitive pricing. Capital management activities are impacted by the cost of financing and our ability to access the capital markets, and
insurance regulations. For a more detailed discussion of our capital management activities see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Financing
Activities.”

Reserves

We establish and carry as liabilities actuarially-determined
reserves for future policy benefits that we believe will meet our future obligations for in force life policies. We base these reserves on assumptions we believe to be appropriate for investment yield, persistency, expenses, mortality and morbidity
rates, as well as margins for adverse deviation. For certain products, such as term and universal life, we are required to hold statutory reserves in excess of these liabilities. In these circumstances we engage in capital management activities



to reduce the financial and pricing impact of carrying a portion of these excess statutory reserves. For variable and interest-sensitive life insurance contracts, we establish liabilities for
policyholders’ account balances that represent cumulative gross premium payments plus credited interest and/or fund performance, less withdrawals, expenses and cost of insurance charges.

Reinsurance

The Individual Life segment uses reinsurance as a means of managing mortality volatility and risk capacity, which can impact product
profitability. Since 2000, we have reinsured a significant portion of the mortality risk we assume under our newly-sold individual life insurance policies. The maximum exposure we retain is $30 million on a single life and $35 million on a
second-to-die policy. In some instances, lower limits apply. If a third party reinsurer is, for some reason, unable to meet its obligations, we remain liable. On a Company wide basis, we evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and monitor the
concentration of credit risk to mitigate this exposure.

Group
Insurance

Our Group Insurance segment
manufactures and distributes a full range of group life, long-term and short-term group disability, long-term care, and group corporate-, bank- and trust-owned life insurance in the U.S. primarily to institutional clients for use in connection with
employee and membership benefits plans. Group Insurance also sells accidental death and dismemberment, preferred provider and indemnity dental and other ancillary coverages, and provides plan administrative services in connection with its insurance
coverages.

Competition

The Group Insurance segment competes with other large,
well-established life and health insurance providers in the U.S. markets, and is a top provider of both group life and disability insurance. The markets in which we compete are mature markets, hence we compete primarily based on strong brand
recognition, service capabilities, customer relationships, financial stability and range of product offerings. Due to the large number of competitors, price competition is strong. The majority of our premiums are derived from large corporations,
affinity groups or other organizations, such as those with over 10,000 insured individuals. We have a strong portfolio of products and the ability to meet complex needs of the large clients, providing opportunities for continuing stabilized premiums
and growth. Employee-pay (voluntary) coverage has become increasingly important in today’s environment as employers attempt to control costs and shift benefit decisions/funding to employees who continue to value benefits offered at the
workplace.

Products

Group Life Insurance

We offer group life insurance products including
employer-pay (basic) and voluntary coverages. This portfolio of products includes basic and supplemental term life insurance for employees, optional term life insurance for dependents of employees and group universal life insurance. We also offer
group variable universal life insurance, basic and voluntary accidental death and dismemberment insurance and business travel accident insurance. Many of our employee-pay coverages include a portability feature, allowing employees to retain their
coverage when they change employers or retire. We also offer a living benefits option that allows insureds that are diagnosed with a terminal illness to receive a portion of their life insurance benefit upon diagnosis, in advance of death, to use as
needed.

We have a variety of settlement and
payment options for the settlement of life insurance claims in addition to lump sum checks, including placing benefits in retained asset accounts, which earn interest and are subject to withdrawal in whole or in part at any time by the
beneficiaries.

Group Disability Insurance

We offer short- and long-term group
disability insurance, which protects against loss of wages due to illness or injury. Short-term disability generally provides a weekly benefit amount (typically 50% - 70% of the

insured’s earned income up to a specified maximum benefit) for three to six months, and long-term disability



covers the period after short-term disability ends. Long-term disability insureds may receive total or partial disability benefits. Most long-term disability policies begin providing benefits
following a 90- or 180-day waiting period (during which short-term disability may be provided) and generally continue providing benefits until the insured reaches normal retirement age. Long-term disability benefits are paid monthly and are limited
to a portion, generally 50% - 70%, of the insured’s earned income up to a specified maximum benefit. Our approach to disability claims management incorporates a focus on early intervention, return-to-work programs and successful rehabilitation
of claimants. We also offer absence management services which assist employers in managing employee absences and workplace productivity including administrative tracking and management for certain employee absence events. The absence management
services we provide can also be integrated with our short- and long-term disability management services.

Other

We offer individual and group long-term care insurance, group corporate-, bank- and trust-owned life insurance and preferred provider
organization (PPO) and indemnity dental plans. Long-term care insurance protects the insured from the costs of an adult day care center, a nursing home or similar live-in care situation or a home health or a personal care aide. Group corporate- and
trust-owned life insurance are group variable life insurance contracts typically used by large corporations to fund deferred compensation plans and benefit plans for retired employees. PPO and indemnity dental products, as well as voluntary dental
plans, are sold to groups with between 25 and 1,000 employees with no benefit waiting periods.

Marketing and Distribution

Group Insurance has its own dedicated sales force that is organized around products and market segments and distributes primarily through employee benefits brokers and consultants. Group Insurance also
distributes individual long-term care products through Prudential Agents as well as third party brokers and agents.

Underwriting and Pricing

We have developed standard rating systems for each product line in the Group Insurance segment based on our past experience and relevant industry experience. For our earlier generation long-term care
products, experience data was very limited. As the long-term care industry is maturing, the information available, both our own and industry experience, for use in underwriting has improved. We are not obligated to accept any application for a
policy or group of policies from any distributor. We follow standard underwriting practices and procedures. If the coverage amount exceeds certain prescribed age and amount limits, we may require a prospective insured to submit evidence of
insurability.

We determine premiums on some of
our policies on a retrospective experience-rated basis, in which case the policyholder bears some of the risk or receives some of the benefit associated with claim experience fluctuations during the policy period. We base product pricing of group
insurance products on the expected pay-out of benefits that we calculate using assumptions for mortality, morbidity, interest, expenses and persistency, depending upon the specific product features.

Some policies are not eligible to receive experience-based
refunds. The adequacy of our pricing of these policies determines their profitability during the rate guarantee period. In addition, our profitability is subject to fluctuation period to period, based on the differences between actual mortality and
morbidity experience and the assumptions used in pricing our policies. However, we anticipate that over the rate guarantee period we will achieve mortality and morbidity levels more closely aligned with the assumptions used in pricing our policies.
Market demand for multiple year rate guarantees for new policies increases the risk associated with unanticipated changes in experience patterns as well as deviations from expense and interest rate assumptions. We seek to mitigate interest rate
risks, including those associated with the current low interest rate environment, with thorough underwriting, pricing and active asset/liability matching portfolio management.

We routinely make pricing adjustments, when contractually
permitted that take into account the emerging experience on our group insurance products. While there can be no assurance, we expect these actions, as well as pricing discipline in writing new business, will allow us over time to achieve benefits
ratios that are consistent with our profit objectives.



Reserves

We establish and carry as liabilities actuarially-determined
reserves for future policy benefits that we believe will meet our future obligations. We base these reserves on actuarially-recognized methods using morbidity and mortality tables in general use in the U.S., which we modify to reflect our actual
experience when appropriate. Reserves also include claims reported but not yet paid, and claims incurred but not yet reported. We also establish a liability for policyholders’ account balances that represent cumulative deposits plus credited
interest and/or fund performance, less withdrawals, expenses and cost of insurance charges, as applicable.

Reinsurance

The Group Insurance segment uses reinsurance to limit losses from large exposures, and in response to client requests. To a smaller extent, we also assume risk through reinsurance in certain situations.
If a third party reinsurer is, for some reason, unable to meet its obligations, we remain liable. On a Company wide basis, we evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and monitor concentration of counterparty risk to mitigate this exposure.

International Insurance and Investments
Division

The International Insurance and
Investments division conducts its business through the International Insurance and International Investments segments.

International Insurance

Our International Insurance segment manufactures and distributes individual life insurance, retirement and related products, including
certain health riders with fixed benefits, to the mass affluent and affluent markets in Japan, Korea and other countries outside the U.S. through its Life Planner operations. In addition, we offer similar products to the broad middle income market
across Japan through Life Advisors, who are associated with our separately-operated Gibraltar Life Insurance Company, Ltd., or Gibraltar Life, operation, which we acquired in April 2001. We commenced sales in non-U.S. markets through our Life
Planner operations, as follows: Japan, 1988; Taiwan, 1990; Italy, 1990; Korea, 1991; Brazil, 1998; Argentina, 1999; Poland, 2000; and Mexico, 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our Life Planner operations in Japan and Korea, and our
Gibraltar Life operations represented 48%, 10% and 37%, respectively, of the net premiums, policy charges and fee income of the International Insurance segment, and in aggregate, represented 48% of the net premiums, policy charges and fee income of
the Financial Services Businesses, translated on the basis of weighted average monthly exchange rates. We continue to explore opportunities for a more diverse mix of business including an increased focus on the international retirement market.

We continue to seek opportunities for expansion
into high-growth markets in targeted countries, such as in China and India. During 2007, we entered into a joint venture in India where we have a 26% interest, the maximum currently allowed by regulation in India. The joint venture received its
insurance license in June 2008 and commenced sales of life insurance products shortly thereafter. In addition, we also have an investment in China, through a consortium of investors that holds a minority interest in China Pacific Insurance (Group)
Co., Ltd. In December 2009, China Pacific Insurance (Group) Co., Ltd. listed its shares on the Hong Kong exchange, and the consortium of investors agreed not to sell its shares before one year from the listing. In December 2010, the consortium of
investors sold 16% of its holdings, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $66 million to Prudential, and sold approximately 40% of its remaining holdings in the first quarter of 2011, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $153 million to Prudential.

We manage each operation on a stand-alone basis with local
management and sales teams, with oversight by senior executives based in Asia and Newark, New Jersey. Each operation has its own marketing, underwriting and claims, investment management, and actuarial functions. In addition, large portions of the
general account investment portfolios are managed by our International Investments segment. Operations generally invest in local currency securities, typically bonds issued by the local government or its agencies. In our larger operations, we have
more diversified portfolios that also include investments in U.S. dollar denominated securities.



Acquisition of AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd. AIG Edison Life Insurance Company and Related
Entities

On February 1, 2011,
Prudential Financial completed the acquisition from American International Group, Inc., or AIG, of AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd., or Star, AIG Edison Life Insurance Company, or Edison, and certain other AIG subsidiaries (collectively, the
“Star and Edison Businesses”) pursuant to the stock purchase agreement dated September 30, 2010 between Prudential Financial and AIG. The total purchase price was approximately $4.8 billion, comprised of approximately $4.2 billion in
cash and $0.6 billion in assumed third party debt, substantially all of which is expected to be repaid, over time, with excess capital of the acquired entities. All acquired entities are Japanese corporations and their businesses are in Japan.
Prudential Financial intends to make a Section 338 election under the Internal Revenue Code with respect to the acquisition resulting in the acquired entities being treated for U.S. tax purposes as newly-incorporated companies.

The acquired businesses distribute individual life insurance,
group life insurance, group annuities, medical insurance, and fixed annuities primarily through captive agents, independent agents, and banks. As of December 31, 2010, these businesses had approximately $174 billion face amount of in force
individual insurance and approximately 7,490 captive agents. The addition of these operations to our existing businesses will increase our scale in the Japanese insurance market and provide complementary distribution opportunities. Star and
Edison’s bank channel distribution will be transferred and integrated with Prudential Gibraltar Financial Life Insurance Company, Ltd., or Prudential Gibraltar Financial. In addition, we expect to integrate the core operations of Star and
Edison, excluding their bank channel distribution, with our Gibraltar Life operations by early 2012, subject to local regulatory approvals.

Acquisition of Yamato Life

On May 1, 2009, our Gibraltar Life operations acquired Yamato Life, a Japanese life insurance company that declared bankruptcy in
October 2008. Gibraltar Life served as the reorganization sponsor for Yamato and, under the reorganization agreement, acquired Yamato by contributing $72 million of capital to Yamato. Concurrent with our acquisition, substantially all of
Yamato’s insurance liabilities were restructured under a plan of reorganization to include special surrender penalties on existing policies. These surrender charges are 20% in the first year and will decline by 2% each year thereafter.
Subsequent to the acquisition, we renamed the acquired company The Prudential Gibraltar Financial Life Insurance Company, Ltd.

Competition

The life insurance markets in Japan and Korea are quite mature and highly penetrated. Private-sector life insurance companies also compete
with life insurance cooperatives and postal insurance entities in these markets. Generally, the cooperatives and postal insurance entities are not subject to the stringent insurance regulations that are effective for private-sector life insurers. We
generally compete more on service provided to the customers than on price. In our operations other than Gibraltar Life and our joint venture in India, we compete by focusing primarily on a limited market using our Life Planner model to offer high
quality service and needs-based protection products. The success of our model in some markets makes us vulnerable to imitation and targeted recruitment of our sales force; thus the loss of highly-skilled and productive Life Planners to competitors
is a significant competitive risk. We direct substantial efforts to recruit and retain our Life Planners by continuously evaluating and adjusting our training and compensation programs, where appropriate, to positively impact retention.

Products

We currently offer various traditional whole life, term
life, and endowment policies, which provide for payment on the earlier of death or maturity, as well as retirement income life insurance products that combine an insurance protection element similar to that of term life policies with a retirement
income feature. In 2010, Gibraltar Life introduced a cancer whole life product which appeals to the business market because of its favorable tax treatment. In some of our operations we also offer certain health riders with fixed benefits, as well as
annuity products, which are primarily represented by U.S. dollar denominated fixed annuities in Gibraltar Life and variable annuities in Korea. In 2009, Gibraltar Life expanded its fixed annuity products, which now includes Australian dollar, Euro,
and Yen denominated products. These contracts impose a market value adjustment if the



invested amount is not held to maturity. The market value adjustment can be positive, resulting in an additional amount for the contractholder, or negative, resulting in a deduction from the
contractholder’s account value or redemption proceeds. We also offer variable life products in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Poland and interest-sensitive life products in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Argentina. Generally, our international insurance
products are non-participating and denominated in local currency. Certain of our operations also offer U.S. dollar denominated products. Where non-local currency products are offered, both the premiums and benefits are guaranteed in the currency of
the product offered.

Marketing and Distribution

The following table sets forth the
number of Life Planners and Life Advisors for the periods indicated.

(1)

In 2010, 2009 and 2008, 92, 152 and 70 Life Planners, respectively, were transferred to Gibraltar Life. Of the transferred Life Planners, 45, 54 and 43, in 2010, 2009
and 2008, respectively, were transferred to support our efforts to expand our bank channel distribution. The remainder have joined either as Gibraltar Life Advisors or as an associate in the agency branch discussed below. The Life Planners
transferred to support bank channel distribution and the agency branch are not included in the Life Advisor counts above.

Life Planner Model

Our Life Planner model is significantly different from the way traditional industry participants offer life insurance in Japan and in most
of the other countries where we do business. It also differs from the way we market through the Life Advisors of Gibraltar Life. We believe that our selection standards, training, supervision and compensation package are key to the Life Planner
model and have helped our Life Planner operations achieve higher rates of agent retention, agent productivity and policy persistency than our local competitors. In general, we recruit Life Planners with:

•

university degrees, so that the Life Planner will have the same educational background and outlook as the target customer;

•

a minimum of two years of sales or sales management experience;

•

no prior life insurance sales experience; and

•

a pattern of job stability and success.

The Life Planner’s primary objective is to sell protection-oriented life insurance products on a needs basis to mass affluent and
affluent customers.

The number of Life Planners
in our Japanese operation was stable, from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010. This includes the impact of the transfer of 92 Life Planners to Gibraltar Life during this period, primarily in support of our efforts to expand the bank
channel distribution and to service orphaned policyholders discussed below. This also reflects the Company’s efforts to further improve retention and the quality of Life Planners by selective screening. The decrease in Life Planners in all
other countries, from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010, was driven by decreases of 76, 53 and 31, in Taiwan, Poland, and Argentina, respectively, and was partially offset by increases of 43 in Italy and 36 in Brazil.

Life Advisors

Our Life Advisors are the proprietary distribution force for
products offered by Gibraltar Life. Their focus is to provide individual protection products to the broad middle income market in Japan, particularly through relationships with affinity groups. Our Life Advisor operation is based on a variable
compensation plan designed



to improve productivity and persistency that is similar to compensation plans in our Life Planner operations. The number of Life Advisors decreased in 2010 primarily reflecting disciplined hiring
standards intended to enhance retention and productivity.

During 2008, a new agency branch was created in Gibraltar Life that focuses on servicing our Japanese Life Planner policyholders that are not actively serviced by a Life Planner (i.e., orphaned
policyholders). In addition to servicing orphaned policyholders, the agency branch promotes Gibraltar Life’s products with a focus on retirement and medical insurance products.

Bank Distribution Channel

In 2006, Gibraltar Life commenced sales, primarily of U.S.
dollar denominated fixed annuity products, through banks to supplement its core Life Advisor distribution channel. During 2009, the fixed annuity product offering was expanded to include Australian dollar, Euro, and Yen denominated products.
Beginning in early 2008, Gibraltar Life began selling protection products, both Yen- and U.S. dollar denominated, as a result of the liberalization of banking regulations allowing for the sale of additional insurance products. Sales of products
primarily intended to provide premature death protection comprised a major portion of bank channel sales for 2010. As of December 31, 2010, most of the bank channel distribution for Japan is placed through Prudential Gibraltar Financial. As of
December 31, 2010, there were distribution agreements with thirty-one banks; however, a significant amount of our sales in Japan through our bank channel distribution is derived through a single Japanese mega-bank. We recently initiated a
distribution relationship with a second large Japanese bank and will continue to explore other opportunities to expand our distribution capabilities through the bank channel, as well as other complementary distribution channels.

Underwriting and Pricing

Our International Insurance segment is subject to
substantial local regulation that is generally more restrictive for product offerings, pricing and structure than U.S. insurance regulation. Each International Insurance operation has its own underwriting department that employs variations of U.S.
practices in underwriting individual policy risks. In setting underwriting limits, we also consider local industry standards to prevent adverse selection and to stay abreast of industry trends. In addition, we set underwriting limits together with
each operation’s reinsurers.

Pricing of our
products, particularly individual life insurance in Japan and Korea, is more regulated than in the U.S. Generally, premiums in each country are different for participating and non-participating products, but within each product type they are
generally similar for all companies. Interest rates guaranteed under our insurance contracts may exceed the rates of return we earn on our investments, and, as a result, we may experience negative spreads between the rate we guarantee and the rate
we earn on investments. The profitability on our products from these operations results primarily from margins on mortality, morbidity and expense charges. In addition, the profitability of our products is impacted by differences between actual
mortality experience and the assumptions used in pricing these policies and, as a result, can fluctuate from period to period. However, we anticipate over the long-term to achieve the aggregate mortality levels reflected in the assumptions used in
pricing.

Reserves

We establish and carry as liabilities actuarially-determined
reserves for future policy benefits that we believe will meet our future obligations. We base these reserves on assumptions we believe to be appropriate for investment yield, persistency, expenses, mortality and morbidity rates, as well as margins
for adverse deviation. For variable and interest-sensitive life products, as well as annuity products, we establish liabilities for policyholders’ account balances that represent cumulative gross premiums collected plus interest or investment
results credited less surrenders, and charges for cost of insurance and administration fees.

In some of the markets in which we operate, it is difficult to find appropriate long-duration assets to match the characteristics of our long-duration product liabilities. Due to the long-term nature of
many of the products we sell in Japan, we have historically sought to increase the duration of our Japanese yen investment portfolio by employing various strategies, including investing in longer-term securities or, by entering into long-duration



floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. These strategies better support the characteristics of our long-dated product liabilities, and have resulted in higher portfolio yields. We continue to
manage the interest rate risk profile of our businesses in the context of market conditions and relative opportunities, and will implement these hedging strategies to lengthen the duration of our Japanese investment portfolio as our assessment of
market conditions dictates. As we do so, the impact to our portfolio yields upon the resumption of these strategies will depend on the then current interest rate environment.

Reinsurance

International Insurance reinsures portions of its insurance
risks, primarily mortality, with both selected third party reinsurers and Prudential Insurance. International Insurance also buys catastrophe reinsurance that covers multiple deaths from a single occurrence in our Life Planner operations in Japan,
Taiwan and Brazil. We also have coinsurance agreements with Prudential Insurance for the U.S. dollar denominated business in our Japanese Life Planner insurance operations. If a third party reinsurer is, for some reason, unable to meet its
obligations, we remain liable. On a Company wide basis, we evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and monitor the concentration of credit risk to mitigate this exposure.

International Investments

Our International Investments segment offers proprietary and
non-proprietary asset management, investment advice and services to retail and institutional clients in selected international markets. These services are marketed through proprietary, third party and bank distribution networks and encompass the
businesses of our international investments operations and our global commodities group, which are described in more detail below.

Our international investments operations include manufacturing of proprietary products and distribution of both proprietary and
non-proprietary products, tailored to meet client needs. In this business, we invest in asset management and distribution businesses in targeted countries, including through investments in operating joint ventures, to expand our mass affluent
customer base outside the U.S. and to increase our global assets under management. We seek to establish long-term relationships with our clients through third party channels as well as our proprietary distribution networks. Additionally, this
business manages large portions of the general account investment portfolios of our international insurance operations.

Our global commodities group provides advice, sales and trading on a global basis covering a wide variety of commodity, financial and
foreign exchange futures, swap and forward contracts, including agricultural commodities, base and precious metals, major currencies, interest rate and stock indices primarily to an institutional client base. We conduct these operations through
offices in the U.S., Europe and Asia, and are members of most major futures exchanges. Our global commodities group primarily serves as an intermediary between its customers and, therefore, assumes minimal market risk, except counterparty credit
risk related to its customers. We conduct futures transactions on margin according to the regulations of the different futures exchanges. To the extent clients are unable to meet their commitments and margin deposits are insufficient to cover
outstanding liabilities, we may be required to purchase or sell financial instruments at prevailing market prices in order to fulfill the client’s obligations.

On July 12, 2007, our international investments
operations sold its 50% interest in the operating joint ventures Oppenheim Pramerica Fonds Trust GmbH and Oppenheim Pramerica Asset Management S.a.r.l., which were accounted for under the equity method, to our partner Oppenheim S.C.A. for $121
million. These businesses establish, package and distribute mutual fund products to German and other European retail investors. We recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of $37 million in 2007.

On January 18, 2008, we made an additional investment of $154 million in our UBI Pramerica operating joint
venture in Italy, which we account for under the equity method. This additional investment was necessary to maintain our ownership interest at 35% and was a result of the merger of our joint venture partner with another Italian bank, and their
subsequent consolidation of their asset management companies into the UBI Pramerica joint venture.



On July 1, 2008, we acquired a 40 percent interest in GAP Asset Management of Brazil,
which we account for under the equity method as an operating joint venture.

On October 6, 2009, we sold our mutual fund and banking operations in Mexico. This transaction did not include our insurance business, our pension fund business or our real estate investments that
are located in Mexico.

On June 1, 2010, we
sold Prudential Investment & Securities Co., Ltd. and Prudential Asset Management Co., Ltd, which together comprised our Korean asset management operations.

In the third quarter of 2010, we reached an agreement with
our Everbright joint venture partner to purchase an additional 12% stake in the company. This additional investment, which is pending approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission, would increase our ownership interest to 45%.

Corporate and Other

Corporate and Other includes corporate operations, after
allocations to our business segments and the real estate and relocation services business, as well as divested businesses except for those that qualify for “discontinued operations” accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP.

Corporate Operations

Corporate operations consist primarily of:
(1) investment returns on capital that is not deployed in any business segments; (2) returns from investments not allocated to business segments, including debt-financed investment portfolios, as well as tax credit investments and other
tax enhanced investments financed by business segments; (3) capital debt that is used or will be used to meet the capital requirements of the Company and the related interest expense; (4) income and expense from qualified pension and other
employee benefit plans, after allocations to business segments; (5) corporate-level income and expense, after allocations to business segments, including corporate governance, corporate advertising, philanthropic activities and deferred
compensation; (6) certain retained obligations relating to pre-demutualization policyholders whom we had previously agreed to provide insurance for reduced or no premium in accordance with contractual settlements related to prior individual
life insurance sales practices remediation; (7) businesses that we have placed in wind-down status but have not divested; (8) results of our capital protection strategies; and (9) the impact of transactions with other segments.

The wind-down businesses, which are included in
the results of our corporate operations, consist of the following:

•

We have not actively engaged in the assumed life reinsurance market since the early 1990s; however, we remain subject to mortality risk for certain
assumed individual life insurance policies under the terms of the reinsurance treaties.

•

We ceased writing individual disability income policies in 1992, and a year later ceased writing hospital expense and major medical policies. Most of
our individual disability income policies are non-cancelable; however, we reinsured all of these policies as of July 1999. For our hospital expense and major medical policies, the 1997 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act guarantees
renewal. Under certain circumstances, with appropriate approvals from state regulatory authorities, we are permitted to change the premiums charged for these policies if we can demonstrate the premiums have not been sufficient to pay claims and
expenses.

Our capital hedge
program within corporate operations includes the following:

•

We include in corporate operations the results of our capital hedge program which broadly addresses the equity market exposure of the statutory capital
of the Company as a whole, under stress scenarios, as described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Liquidity and Capital Resources of
Subsidiaries—Domestic Insurance Subsidiaries.”

We manage certain risks associated with our variable annuity products through our living benefit hedging program, which is described under
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division—Individual Annuities.” Consistent with sound risk management practices, we
evaluate hedge levels versus our target given overall capital considerations of the Company and prevailing capital market conditions and may decide to temporarily hedge to an amount that differs from our hedge target definition. Because this
decision is based on the overall capital considerations of the Company as a whole, the impact on results from temporarily hedging to an amount that differs from our target hedge definition is reported through corporate operations. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Liquidity and Capital Resources of Subsidiaries—Domestic Insurance Subsidiaries” for additional
discussion.

Consistent with the
amendment of our definition of adjusted operating income in the third quarter of 2010, adjusted operating income excludes market value changes of derivatives used in our capital hedge program, as well as the net impact of embedded derivatives
related to our living benefit features and related hedge positions, including the impact of hedging to an amount that differs from our target hedge definition. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Consolidated Results of Operations—Segment Measures” for additional information and an explanation of adjusted operating income.

We assess the composition of these hedging programs on an ongoing basis, and we may change it from time to time based on our evaluation of
the Company’s risk position or other factors.

Residential
Real Estate Brokerage Franchise and Relocation Services

Prudential Real Estate and Relocation Services is our integrated real estate brokerage franchise and relocation services business. The real estate group markets franchises primarily to existing real
estate companies. Our franchise agreements grant the franchisee the right to use the Prudential name and real estate service marks in return for royalty payments on gross commissions generated by the franchisees. The franchises generally are
independently owned and operated. This business also has a finance subsidiary that makes debt and equity investments in a limited number of franchisees.

Our relocation group offers institutional clients and government agencies a variety of services in connection with the relocation of their
employees. These services include: coordination of appraisal; inspection, purchase and sale of relocating employees’ homes; equity advances to relocating employees; assistance in locating homes at the relocating employee’s destination;
household goods moving services; client cost-tracking and a variety of relocation policy and group move consulting services. Generally the client is responsible for carrying costs and any loss on sale with respect to a relocating employee’s
home that is purchased by us. Our government clients and certain corporate clients utilize a fixed price program under which we assume the benefits and burdens of ownership, including carrying costs and any loss on sale.

Divested Businesses

The following operations are businesses that have been or
will be sold or exited that did not qualify for “discontinued operations” accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP. We include the results of these divested businesses in our income from continuing operations, but we exclude these results from
our adjusted operating income. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Consolidated Results of Operations—Segment Measures” for an explanation of adjusted operating income.

Financial Advisory

In 2008, we classified our Financial Advisory business as a
divested business, reflecting our intention to exit this business. This business consists of our former investment in the Wachovia Securities joint venture described below, which was sold on December 31, 2009, in addition to expenses relating
to obligations and costs we retained in connection with the businesses we contributed to the joint venture, primarily for litigation and regulatory matters.



On July 1, 2003, we combined our retail securities brokerage and clearing operations
with those of Wachovia Corporation (“Wachovia”) and formed Wachovia Securities Financial Holdings, LLC (“Wachovia Securities”). On December 31, 2008, Wachovia merged with and into Wells Fargo & Company (“Wells
Fargo”), which succeeded to Wachovia’s rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements. On December 31, 2009, we completed the sale of our minority joint venture interest in Wachovia Securities, which includes Wells Fargo
Advisors, to Wells Fargo. For more information on our former investment in the Wachovia Securities joint venture see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Commercial Mortgage Securitization Operations

In 2008, we classified our commercial mortgage
securitization operations as a divested business, reflecting our decision to exit this business. These operations, which involved the origination and purchase of commercial mortgage loans that we in turn would aggregate and sell into commercial
mortgage-backed securitization transactions, together with related hedging activities, were previously reported within the Asset Management segment. We retained and continue the remainder of our commercial mortgage origination, servicing and other
commercial mortgage related activities, which remain a part of our Asset Management segment.

Property and Casualty Insurance

In 2003, we sold our property and casualty insurance companies, which included Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Company (“Prupac”) that operated nationally in 48 states outside of New
Jersey, and the District of Columbia, to Liberty Mutual Group, or Liberty Mutual. We have agreed not to compete with the buyers. A non-compete agreement is effective until the termination of our distribution agreement with Liberty Mutual. We have
reinsured Liberty Mutual for adverse loss development for specific property and casualty risks that Liberty Mutual did not want to retain. We believe that we have adequately reserved for our remaining property and casualty obligations under these
reinsurance contracts based on the current information available; however, we may be required to take additional charges in the future that could be material to our results of operations in a particular quarterly or annual period.

In connection with the sale, Liberty Mutual has the right to
sell Prupac back to us. This right became exercisable by Liberty Mutual as of October 31, 2010. Under the terms of the put right, the business transferring to us would be the business we already reinsure, as described in the preceding
paragraph. Any business written after the 2003 sale and prior to a put closing would also transfer to us but would be fully reinsured by Liberty Mutual.

Prudential Securities Capital Markets

In 2000, we announced a restructuring of Prudential Securities’ activities to implement a fundamental shift in our business strategy.
We subsequently exited the lead-managed equity underwriting business for corporate issuers and the institutional fixed income business. As of December 31, 2010 we had remaining assets amounting to $74 million related to Prudential
Securities’ institutional fixed income activities.

Other

In 2007, we exited the equity sales, trading and research operations of the Prudential Equity Group, and retained certain securities
relating to trading exchange memberships of these former operations. These securities were received in 2006 in connection with the commencement of public trading of stock exchange shares, and were fully disposed of in 2008.

We previously marketed individual life insurance in Canada
through Prudential of America Life Insurance Company, or PALIC. In 2000, we sold our interest in PALIC and indemnified the purchaser for certain liabilities with respect to claims related to sales practices or market conduct issues arising from
operations prior to the sale. We also remain subject to mortality risk for certain assumed individual life insurance policies sold by PALIC under the terms of the reinsurance treaties.



Discontinued Operations

Discontinued operations reflect the results of the following businesses which qualified for “discontinued
operations” accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP:

•

We sold substantially all of the assets and liabilities of our group managed and indemnity healthcare business to Aetna Inc. in 1999.

•

We discontinued certain branches of our international securities operations in the fourth quarter of 2002. In the fourth quarter of 2004 we
discontinued the remaining branches of our international securities operations.

•

We discontinued our Philippine insurance operations in the second quarter of 2006 and subsequently sold these operations in the third quarter of 2006.

•

In the third quarter of 2006, we entered into a reinsurance transaction related to the Canadian Intermediate Weekly Premium and Individual Health
operations, which resulted in these operations being accounted for as “discontinued operations.”

•

We discontinued the equity sales, trading and research operations of the Prudential Equity Group in the second quarter of 2007.

•

We discontinued our Mexican asset management operations in the second quarter of 2009 and subsequently sold these operations in the fourth quarter of
2009.

•

We discontinued our Korean asset management operations in the first quarter of 2010 and subsequently sold these operations in the second quarter of
2010.

In addition, direct real
estate investments that are sold or held for sale may require “discontinued operations” accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP.

Closed Block Business

In connection with the demutualization, we ceased offering domestic participating individual life insurance and annuity products, under
which policyholders are eligible to receive policyholder dividends reflecting experience. The liabilities for our individual in force participating products were segregated, together with assets that will be used exclusively for the payment of
benefits and policyholder dividends, expenses and taxes with respect to these products, in the Closed Block. We selected the amount of Closed Block Assets that we expect will generate sufficient cash flow, together with anticipated revenues from the
Closed Block Policies, over the life of the Closed Block to fund payments of all expenses, taxes, and policyholder benefits and to provide for the continuation of the policyholder dividend scales in effect in 2000, assuming experience underlying
such scales continues. For accounting purposes, we also segregated the Surplus and Related Assets that we needed to hold outside the Closed Block to meet capital requirements related to the policies included within the Closed Block at the time of
demutualization. No policies sold after demutualization will be added to the Closed Block, and its in force business is expected to decline as we pay policyholder benefits in full. We also expect the proportion of our business represented by the
Closed Block to decline as we grow other businesses. The Closed Block forms the principal component of the Closed Block Business. As of December 31, 2010, total attributed equity of the Closed Block Business represented 5% of the Company’s
total attributed equity. For additional discussion of the Closed Block Business, see “—Demutualization and Separation of the Businesses—Separation of the Businesses.”

Our strategy for the Closed Block Business is to maintain the Closed Block as required by our Plan of
Reorganization over the time period of its gradual diminishment as policyholder benefits are paid in full. We are permitted under the Plan of Reorganization, with the prior consent of the New Jersey Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, to enter
into agreements to transfer to a third party all or any part of the risks under the Closed Block policies. The Closed Block is 90% reinsured, including 17% by a wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial. See Note 13 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional discussion on the accounting of these modified coinsurance arrangements.



As discussed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, if the performance of the
Closed Block is more or less favorable than we originally assumed in funding, total dividends paid to Closed Block policyholders in the future may be greater or less than the total dividends that would have been paid to these policyholders if the
policyholder dividend scales in effect in 2000 had been continued. Any cash flows in excess of amounts assumed will be available for distribution over time to Closed Block policyholders as part of policyholder dividends, and it will not be available
to shareholders. A policyholder dividend obligation liability is established for these excess cash flows. Each year, the Board of Directors of Prudential Insurance determines the dividends payable on participating policies for the following year
based on the experience of the Closed Block, including investment income, net realized and unrealized investment gains, mortality experience and other factors. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for revenues, income and loss, and
total assets of the Closed Block Business.

Intangible and Intellectual Property

We use numerous federal, state, common law and foreign servicemarks and trademarks. We believe that the goodwill
associated with many of our servicemarks and trademarks, particularly “Prudential

®

,” “Prudential
Financial

®

,” “Growing and Protecting Your Wealth

®

,” the Prudential logo and our “Rock” symbol, are significant competitive assets in the U.S.

On April 20, 2004, we entered into a servicemark and trademark agreement with Prudential plc of the United
Kingdom, with whom we have no affiliation, concerning the parties’ respective rights worldwide to use the names “Prudential” and “Pru.” The agreement is intended to avoid customer confusion in areas where both companies
compete. Under the agreement, there are restrictions on our use of the “Prudential” name and mark in a number of countries outside the Americas, including Europe and most parts of Asia. Where these limitations apply, we combine our
“Rock” symbol with alternative word marks. We believe that these limitations do not materially affect our ability to operate or expand internationally.

Competition

In each of our businesses we face intense competition from
U.S. and international insurance companies, asset managers and diversified financial institutions. Many of our competitors are large and well-established and some have greater market share or breadth of distribution, offer a broader range of
products, services or features, assume a greater level of risk, have lower profitability expectations or have higher claims-paying or credit ratings than we do. We compete in our businesses based on a number of factors including brand recognition,
reputation, quality of service, quality of investment advice, investment performance of our products, product features, scope of distribution and distribution arrangements, price, risk management capabilities, capital management capabilities,
perceived financial strength, and claims-paying and credit ratings. The relative importance of these factors varies across our products, services and the markets we serve.

The adverse market and economic conditions that began in the
second half of 2007 resulted, and may continue to result, in changes in the competitive landscape. For example, the financial distress experienced by certain financial services industry participants as a result of such conditions, including
government mandated sales of certain businesses, may lead to additional favorable acquisition opportunities, although our ability or that of our competitors to pursue such opportunities may be limited due to lower earnings, reserve increases, and a
lack of access to debt capital markets and other sources of financing. Such conditions have led and may in the future lead to changes by us or our competitors in product offerings, product pricing and business mix that could affect our and their
relative sales volumes, market shares and profitability. It is also possible that such conditions may put U.S. companies with financial operations in non-U.S. locations at a competitive disadvantage relative to domestic companies operating in those
locations and may impact sales in those locations. Additionally, the competitive landscape may be further affected by the government sponsored programs in the U.S. and similar governmental actions outside of the U.S. in response to the severe
dislocations in financial markets. Competitors receiving governmental financing or other assistance or subsidies, including government guarantees of their obligations, may have or obtain pricing or other competitive advantages. The competitive
landscape may also be impacted by longer term fiscal policies in response to the financial crisis, including tax law changes, and the impacts of such policies on interest rates and economic and market conditions generally and on financial and
insurance products.



Consolidations among companies in the financial services industry may occur and result in
competitors with increased market shares, or the introduction of larger or financially stronger competitors through acquisitions or otherwise, in lines of business in which we compete.

Certain of our products compete on the basis of investment performance. A material decline in the investment
performance of these products could have an adverse effect on our sales, as well as potentially increase the level of withdrawals and customer complaints. Rankings and ratings of investment performance have a significant effect on our ability to
increase our assets under management.

Competition
for personnel in our businesses is intense, including for executive officers and management personnel, Prudential Agents, Life Planners, Life Advisors and other sales personnel, and our investment managers. In the ordinary course of business, we
lose personnel from time to time in whom we have invested significant training. We direct substantial efforts to recruit and retain our insurance agents and employees and to increase their productivity. Competition for desirable non-affiliated
distribution channels is also intense.

Many of
our businesses are in industries where access to multiple sales channels may be a competitive advantage. We currently sell insurance and investment products through both affiliated and non-affiliated distribution channels, including: (1) our
captive sales channel; (2) independent agents, brokers and financial planners; (3) broker-dealers that generally are members of the New York Stock Exchange, including “wirehouse” and regional broker-dealer firms;
(4) broker-dealers affiliated with banks or that specialize in marketing to customers of banks; (5) intermediaries such as retirement plan administrators; and (6) a rapidly growing bank channel in Japan. While we believe that certain
insurance and investment products will continue to be sold primarily through face-to-face sales channels, customers’ desire for objective and not product-related advice may, over time, increase the amount of such insurance and investment
products sold through non-affiliated distributors. In addition, we expect that certain insurance and investment products will increasingly be sold through direct marketing, including through electronic commerce.

Although we distribute our products through a wide variety of
distribution channels, we do maintain relationships with certain key distributors. For example, a significant amount of our sales in Japan through banks is derived through a single Japanese mega-bank and a significant portion of our sales in Japan
through Life Advisors is derived through a single association relationship. We recently initiated a distribution relationship with a second large Japanese bank and will continue to explore other opportunities to expand our distribution capabilities
through the bank channel, as well as other complementary distribution channels. We periodically negotiate the terms of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties.

The proliferation and growth of non-affiliated distribution
channels puts pressure on our captive sales channels to remain competitive with respect to product offerings, compensation, services offered, and recruiting and retention. We continue our efforts to strengthen and broaden our sales channels, but we
cannot assure that we will be successful. We run the risk that our competitors will have more distribution channels, stronger relationships with non-affiliated distribution channels, or will make a more significant or rapid shift to direct
distribution alternatives than we anticipate or are able to achieve ourselves. If this happens, our market share and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our ability to sell certain insurance products, including
traditional guaranteed products depends significantly on our financial strength ratings. A downgrade in our financial strength ratings could adversely affect our ability to sell our insurance products and reduce our profitability. For additional
information on the potential impact on us of ratings downgrades, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Ratings.”

Regulation

Overview

Our businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision. The purpose of these regulations is primarily to protect our
customers and not necessarily our shareholders. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are regularly re-examined, and existing or future laws and regulations may become more



restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations. The recent financial market dislocations produced, and are expected to continue to produce, extensive changes in existing laws and
regulations, and regulatory frameworks, applicable to our businesses in the U.S. and internationally, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act discussed below. U.S. law and regulation of our international businesses,
particularly as it relates to monitoring customer activities, has increased in recent years as a result of terrorist activity in the U.S. and abroad.

Regulation Affecting Prudential Financial

Prudential Financial is the holding company for all of our operations. Prudential Financial itself is not licensed as an insurer,
investment advisor, broker-dealer, bank or other regulated entity. However, because it owns regulated entities, Prudential Financial is subject to regulation as an insurance holding company and, as discussed below, a savings and loan holding
company. As a company with publicly-traded securities, Prudential Financial is subject to legal and regulatory requirements applicable generally to public companies, including the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) and the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) relating to public reporting and disclosure, securities trading, accounting and financial reporting, and corporate governance matters. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules and
regulations adopted in furtherance of that Act have substantially increased the requirements in these and other areas for public companies such as Prudential Financial.

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act

On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”), which effects comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the United States and subjects us to substantial additional federal regulation.
Dodd-Frank directs existing and newly-created government agencies and bodies to conduct certain studies and promulgate regulations implementing the law, a process anticipated to occur over the next few years. We cannot predict with any certainty the
results of the studies or the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted or how Dodd-Frank and such regulations will affect the financial markets generally, impact our business, credit or financial strength ratings, results of operations,
cash flows or financial condition or make it advisable or require us to hold or raise additional capital.

Key aspects we have identified to date of Dodd-Frank’s potential impact on us include:

•

Prudential Financial will become subject, as a savings and loan holding company, to the examination, enforcement and supervisory authority of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”) after the transfer to the FRB of the existing authority of the Office of Thrift Supervision (expected to occur July 21, 2011). The FRB will have authority, among other powers, to
impose capital requirements on the Company after the transfer date. Pursuant to the “Collins Amendment” included in Dodd-Frank, the FRB must establish minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements for savings and loan holding
companies (including Prudential Financial) and other institutions that are not less than those applicable to insured depository institutions. These requirements will become generally applicable to Prudential Financial on July 21, 2015 (five
years after Dodd-Frank’s enactment) except, for purposes of calculating Tier 1 capital, new issuances of debt and equity capital will be immediately subject to the requirements. The risk-based capital requirements currently applicable to
most bank holding companies and insured depository institutions are based on the 1988 Capital Accord (“Basel I”) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”); U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have
also adopted new risk-based capital guidelines for large, internationally active banking organizations based on revisions to Basel I issued by the Basel Committee in 2004 (“Basel II”). In December 2010, the Basel Committee released its
final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation (“Basel III”). Basel III, when implemented by U.S. regulation and fully phased-in, will require bank holding companies and insured depository institutions to
maintain substantially more capital, with a greater emphasis on common equity, and to comply with liquidity coverage and net stable funding standards, including the imposition of a counter-cyclical capital buffer. The “Collins Amendment”
requires the FRB to adopt regulations imposing a continuing “floor” of the Basel I-based capital requirements in cases where the Basel II-based capital requirements and any changes in capital regulations resulting from Basel III otherwise
would permit lower requirements. In December 2010, the



FRB published for comment proposed regulations implementing this requirement, including a proposal to permit flexibility in the application of certain capital requirements imposed by Dodd-Frank
to non-bank financial companies such as Prudential Financial. We cannot predict what capital regulations the FRB will promulgate under these authorizations, either generally or as applicable to insurance-based organizations. We cannot predict how
the FRB will exercise general supervisory authority over us as to the Company’s business practices.

•

Dodd-Frank establishes a Financial Stability Oversight Council (“Council”) which is authorized to subject non-bank financial companies such
as Prudential Financial to stricter prudential standards (a “Designated Financial Company”) if the Council determines that material financial distress at the company or the scope of the company’s activities could pose a threat to
financial stability of the U.S. If so designated, we would become subject to unspecified stricter prudential standards, including stricter requirements and limitations relating to risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity and credit exposure, as well
as overall risk management requirements, management interlock prohibitions and a requirement to maintain a plan for rapid and orderly dissolution in the event of severe financial distress. The “Collins Amendment” capital requirements
referred to above would apply when adopted by the FRB (i.e., the 5-year grandfathering would no longer be available). The FRB could also require the issuance of capital securities automatically convertible to equity in the event of financial
distress, require enhanced public disclosures to support market evaluation of risk profile and impose short-term debt limits. If Prudential Financial or a subsidiary were so designated, failure to meet defined measures of financial condition could
result in: limits on capital distributions, acquisitions and/or asset growth; requirements for a capital restoration plan and capital raising; limitations on transactions with affiliates; management changes and asset sales; and, if the FRB and the
Council determined Prudential Financial (or the designated subsidiary) posed a grave threat to the financial stability of the U.S., further limits on acquisitions or combinations, restrictions on product offerings and/or requirements to sell assets.
In January 2011, the Council published for comment proposed regulations setting forth the criteria by which it will determine Designated Financial Companies. The proposed criteria, which may differ among industries, include size, lack of substitutes
for the financial services and products provided, interconnectedness with other financial firms, leverage, liquidity risk and maturity mismatch, and existing regulatory scrutiny. We cannot predict whether Prudential Financial or a subsidiary will be
designated as a Designated Financial Company.

•

We will become, as a savings and loan holding company (and if designated as a Designated Financial Company), subject to stress tests to be promulgated
by the FRB in consultation with the newly-created Federal Insurance Office (discussed below) to determine whether, on a consolidated basis, we have the capital necessary to absorb losses as a result of adverse economic conditions. We cannot predict
how the stress tests will be designed or conducted or whether the results thereof will cause us to alter our business practices or affect the perceptions of regulators, rating agencies, customers, counterparties or investors of our financial
strength.

•

The Council may recommend that state insurance regulators or other regulators apply new or heightened standards and safeguards for activities or
practices we and other insurers or other financial services companies engage in that could create or increase the risk that significant liquidity, credit or other problems spread among financial companies. We cannot predict whether any such
recommendations will be made or their effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

•

As a savings and loan holding company, we will become subject to the “Volcker Rule” provisions of Dodd-Frank prohibiting, subject to the
rule’s exceptions, “proprietary trading” and the sponsorship of, and investment in, funds (referred to in Dodd-Frank as hedge funds or private equity funds) that rely on certain exemptions from the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (collectively, “covered funds”). In January 2011, the Council provided recommendations on the implementation of the Volcker Rule, and the FRB and other agencies are to promulgate regulations thereunder within nine months
thereafter. The rule becomes effective on the earlier of one year after adoption of regulations or July 21, 2012 (two years after Dodd-Frank’s enactment), and activities and investments must be brought into compliance within two years
thereafter, subject to exceptions. We presently believe that the “permitted activities” exceptions to the rule should be interpreted in a manner that does not require our insurance subsidiaries (including our foreign insurance
subsidiaries) to materially alter their securities trading or investing practices, but there can be no assurance that the regulations promulgated will so provide. The



Council recommendations expressly direct the FRB and other agencies to consider whether the “permitted activities” exception should apply to foreign insurance subsidiaries and separate
account investments. Further, the Council stated that the agencies will need to consider a process to assess insurance company investment laws since the Volcker Rule’s “permitted activities” for insurers are conditioned on the banking
agencies, after consultation with the Council and state insurance regulators, not having jointly determined a state’s laws insufficient to protect the insurer’s safety and soundness or the financial stability of the U.S. If the Volcker
Rule were interpreted to prohibit insurance company investments in covered funds, or to apply the aggregate limit of 3% of Tier 1 capital to our coinvestment in covered funds sponsored by our Prudential Real Estate Investors (PREI), Prudential
Investment Management (PIM) or other operations, our insurance subsidiaries could be required to dispose of covered fund investments. Furthermore, our PREI and PIM investment management operations sponsor covered funds in which we coinvest (in both
insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries) which are directly affected by the Volcker Rule prohibitions which, among other things, limit permanent investment by a sponsoring company in any one fund to no more than 3% of fund capital, limit covered
fund marketing except to bona fide trust, fiduciary or investment advisory customers, prohibit covered transactions between a fund and the sponsoring company and prohibit the use of the sponsoring company’s name in the fund’s name. It is
possible that regulations with respect to the foregoing provisions could require us to dispose of covered fund investments, significantly alter our business practices in these operations and/or diminish the attractiveness of our covered fund
products to clients. If we were a Designated Financial Company but not a savings and loan holding company, the foregoing prohibitions would not apply but we could be subject, pursuant to future FRB rulemaking, to additional capital requirements for,
and quantitative limits on, proprietary trading and sponsorship of, and investment in, covered funds. In addition, actions taken by other financial entities in response to the Volcker Rule could potentially negatively affect the market for, returns
from or liquidity of our investments in covered funds affiliated with such other financial entities.

•

Dodd-Frank creates a new framework for regulation of the over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives markets which could impact various activities
of Prudential Global Funding (“PGF”), Prudential Financial and our insurance subsidiaries, which use derivatives for various purposes (including hedging interest rate, foreign currency and equity market exposures). Dodd-Frank generally
requires swaps, subject to a determination by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) or SEC as to which swaps are covered, with all counterparties except non-financial end users to be executed through a centralized exchange or
regulated facility and to be cleared through a regulated clearinghouse. Swap dealers and major swap participants (“MSPs”) are subject to capital and margin (i.e., collateral) requirements that will be imposed by the applicable prudential
regulator or the CFTC or SEC, as well as business conduct rules and reporting requirements. While we believe Prudential Financial, PGF and our insurance subsidiaries should not be considered dealers or MSPs subject to the capital and margin
requirements, the final regulations adopted could provide otherwise, which could substantially increase the cost of hedging and the related operations. A determination by the Secretary of the Treasury not to exclude foreign currency swaps and
forwards from the foregoing requirements also could have that result. PGF intermediates swaps between Prudential entities (other than PFI) and third parties, and it is possible that PGF’s standardized intra-Company transactions might be
required to be executed through an exchange, cleared centrally with posted margin, potentially defeating PGF’s key function; if so, Prudential entities might directly enter into swaps with third parties, potentially increasing the economic
costs of hedging. The SEC and CFTC are required to determine whether and how “stable value contracts” should be treated as swaps and, although we believe otherwise, various other products offered by our insurance subsidiaries might be
treated as swaps; if regulated as swaps, we cannot predict how the rules would be applied to such products or the effect on their profitability or attractiveness to our clients. Finally, the new regulatory scheme imposed on all market participants
may increase the costs of hedging generally and banking institutions (with which we enter into a substantial portion of our derivatives) will be required to conduct at least a portion of their OTC derivatives businesses outside their depositary
institutions. The affiliates through which these institutions will conduct their OTC derivatives businesses might be less creditworthy than the depository institutions themselves, and “netting” of counterparty exposures with non-banks will
not be allowed, potentially affecting the credit risk these counterparties pose to us and the degree to which we are able to enter into transactions with these counterparties. We cannot predict the effect of the foregoing on our hedging costs, our
hedging strategy or implementation thereof or whether we will need or choose to increase and/or change the composition of the risks we do not hedge.



•

Dodd-Frank establishes a Federal Insurance Office within the Department of the Treasury to be headed by a director appointed by the Secretary of the
Treasury. While not having a general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the director of this office will perform various functions with respect to insurance (other than health insurance), including serving as a
non-voting member of the Council and making recommendations to the Council regarding insurers (potentially including the Company) to be designated for stricter regulation. The director is also required to conduct a study on how to modernize and
improve the system of insurance regulation in the United States, including by increased national uniformity through either a federal charter or effective action by the states.

•

Dodd-Frank authorizes the FRB to require a savings and loan holding company or a Designated Financial Company to place its financial activities in an
intermediate holding company separate from non-financial activities (as defined for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act) and imposes restrictions on transactions between the two businesses. While our non-financial activities are relatively
minor, the imposition of such a requirement on us could be burdensome and costly to implement. Dodd-Frank directs the U.S. Government Accountability Office to study and report to Congressional committees within eighteen months of Dodd-Frank’s
enactment regarding the adequacy of the federal regulatory framework which permits savings and loan holding companies to engage in non-financial activities and the consequence of prohibiting such activities.

•

Title II of Dodd-Frank provides that a financial company may be subject to a special orderly liquidation process outside the federal bankruptcy
code, administered by the FDIC as receiver, upon a determination (with the approval of the director of the Federal Insurance Office if—as is true with respect to Prudential Financial—the largest United States subsidiary is an insurer) that
the company is in default or in danger of default and presents a systemic risk to U.S. financial stability. Were Prudential Financial subject to such a proceeding, our U.S. insurance subsidiaries would remain subject to rehabilitation and
liquidation proceedings under state law, although the FDIC has discretion and authority to initiate resolution of an insurer under state law if its state insurance regulator has not filed the appropriate judicial action within 60 days of a
systemic risk determination. However, our non-insurance U.S. subsidiaries engaged in financial activities would be subject to any special orderly liquidation process so commenced. We cannot predict how creditors of Prudential Financial or its
insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries, including the holders of Prudential Financial debt, will evaluate this potential or whether it will impact our financing or hedging costs.

•

Dodd-Frank establishes the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (“CFPB”) as an independent agency within the FRB to regulate consumer
financial products and services offered primarily for personal, family or household purposes, with rule-making and enforcement authority over unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. Insurance products and services are not within the CFPB’s
general jurisdiction, and broker-dealers and investment advisers are not subject to the CFPB’s jurisdiction when acting in their registered capacity. Retirement service providers such as us could become subject to the CFPB’s jurisdiction,
but only if the Department of Labor and the Department of the Treasury agree. Otherwise, we believe we offer a very limited number of products subject to CFPB regulation and the impact of Dodd-Frank on our operations in this regard should not be
material; however, it is possible that the regulations promulgated by the CFPB will assert jurisdiction more expansively than we anticipate.

•

Dodd-Frank includes various securities law reforms that may affect our business practices and the liabilities and/or exposures associated therewith,
including:

•

In January 2011, the SEC staff issued a study that recommends that the SEC adopt a uniform federal fiduciary standard of conduct for registered
broker-dealers and investment advisers that provide retail investors personalized investment advice about securities, consider harmonization of the regulation applicable to investment advisers and broker-dealers functions taking into account the
best elements of each regime and conduct rulemakings or provide guidance to facilitate the implementation of a federal fiduciary standard of care. The SEC staff study acknowledges that Dodd-Frank provides that the offering of proprietary products
would not be a per se violation of any new standard of care and that broker-dealers selling proprietary or a limited range of products could be permitted to make certain disclosures about their limited product offerings and obtain customer consents
or acknowledgements.



•

The SEC and other regulators are required to promulgate regulations requiring the securitizer, and possibly the originator, of certain asset-backed
securities to retain at least 5% of the credit risk of securities sold, which may apply to activities of our investment management segment if the regulations promulgated treat us as a securitizer or an originator.

•

Dodd-Frank imposes various assessments on financial companies, including: ex-post assessments to provide funds necessary to repay any borrowing and to
cover the costs of any special resolution of a financial company conducted under Title II (although the FDIC is to take into account assessments otherwise imposed under state insurance guaranty funds); if we were to become a Designated
Financial Company, assessments to fund a newly-created Office of Financial Research which, among other things, assists the Council; and assessments for the costs of our new regulation by the FRB. We are unable to estimate these costs at this time.

We cannot predict with any
certainty whether these possible outcomes will occur or the effect they may have on the financial markets or on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

International Regulatory Initiatives

In addition to the adoption of Dodd-Frank in the United
States, lawmakers around the world are actively reviewing the causes of the financial crisis and exploring steps to avoid similar problems in the future. In many respects, this work is being led by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), consisting of
representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations. The G20 and the FSB have issued a series of papers and recommendations intended to produce significant changes in how financial companies, particularly companies that are members
of large and complex financial groups, should be regulated. These proposals address such issues as financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards, systemic economic risk, corporate governance including executive compensation, and a host
of related issues associated with responses to the financial crisis. The FSB, for example, has proposed to designate certain companies as systemically significant, similar to the approach the Council may take in connection with Designated Financial
Companies. The lawmakers and regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions in which we do business have already begun introducing legislative and regulatory changes consistent with G20 and FSB recommendations, including proposals governing
consolidated regulation of insurance holdings companies by the Financial Services Agency (FSA) in Japan, proposals governing executive compensation by the financial regulators in Germany (BaFIN) and the United Kingdom (FSA), and proposals to permit
U.S.-style class action litigation in the United Kingdom with respect to financial services claims. In addition, the prudential regulation of insurance and reinsurance companies across the European Economic Area (EEA) is due for significant change
under the Solvency II Directive, which was adopted on November 25, 2009 and is expected to come into force in January 2013. This new regime will replace the Solvency I regime, will effect a full revision of the insurance industry’s
solvency framework and prudential regime (in particular minimum capital and solvency requirements, governance requirements, risk management and public reporting standards) and will impose,

inter alia

, group level supervision mechanisms. In
particular, the Solvency II regime may have significant implications for non-European insurance groups, like ourselves, that have established insurance undertakings (whether branches or subsidiaries) within the EEA. Subsidiaries and branches of
non-European insurance groups will have to comply with local regulations reflecting heightened prudential standards. At the group level, if group supervision in the jurisdiction of the ultimate parent of a non-European insurance group (

i.e.

,
the U.S. in the case of Prudential Financial) is recognized as “equivalent” to the Solvency II regime, EEA member states are required by the Directive to “rely on” the equivalent group supervision exercised by the U.S.
supervisory authorities; however, if group supervision in the U.S. is not regarded as equivalent, European supervisors would have the power to require the establishment of a European holding company to create a sub-group consisting of all
undertakings (branches and subsidiaries) domiciled in Europe, which would then be subject to supervision by a lead European supervisor. Whether the U.S. supervisor will be deemed equivalent at implementation or eligible for inclusion in a
transitional regime, if any, is still under consideration and remains uncertain. The impact of the implementation of Solvency II on Prudential cannot be determined at this time. There can be no assurance that Solvency II will not, at a minimum,
result in increased supervisory, capital and disclosure burdens on Prudential’s EEA operations.

These requirements could impact the manner in which we deploy our capital, structure and manage our businesses, and otherwise operate both
within and outside the U.S. The possibility of inconsistent and conflicting regulation of the Prudential “group” of companies also exists as law makers and regulators in multiple jurisdictions simultaneously pursue these initiatives.



Other U.S. Federal Regulation

U.S. Tax Legislation

Current U.S. federal income tax laws generally permit
certain holders to defer taxation on the build-up of value of annuities and life insurance products until payments are actually made to the policyholder or other beneficiary and to exclude from taxation the death benefit paid under a life insurance
contract. Congress from time to time considers legislation that could make our products less attractive to consumers, including legislation that would reduce or eliminate the benefit of this deferral on some annuities and insurance products, as well
as other types of changes that could reduce or eliminate the attractiveness of annuities and life insurance products to consumers such as changes to estate tax. The estate tax was completely eliminated for 2010, but modified carryover basis rules
applied for property acquired from decedent’s dying in that year. The estate tax has been reinstated through 2012 with a $5 million individual exemption, a 35% maximum rate and step-up in basis rules for property acquired from a decedent.
Estates of decedents who died in 2010 can choose between the rules that were in effect in 2010 or the new rules. It is unclear what Congress will do with respect to the estate tax after 2012.

Legislative or regulatory changes could also impact the amount of taxes that we pay, thereby affecting our
consolidated net income. For example, the U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service intend to address through regulations the methodology to be followed in determining the dividends received deduction, or DRD, related to variable
life insurance and annuity contracts. The DRD reduces the amount of dividend income subject to U.S. tax and is a significant component of the difference between our actual tax expense and expected tax amount determined using the federal statutory
tax rate of 35%. On February 14, 2011, the Obama Administration released the “General Explanations of the Administration’s Revenue Proposals.” Although the Administration has not released proposed statutory language, one proposal
would change the method used to determine the amount of the DRD. A change in the DRD, including the possible retroactive or prospective elimination of this deduction through regulation or legislation, could increase actual tax expense and reduce our
consolidated net income.

There is generally
uncertainty regarding U.S. taxes both for individuals and corporations in light of the fact that many tax provisions recently enacted or extended will sunset by the end of 2012. In addition, the recommendations made by the President’s
bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform and other deficit reduction panels suggest the need to reform the U.S. Tax Code. In addition, Congress plans to hold a number of hearings during 2011 devoted to tax reform. It is
unclear whether or when Congress may take up overall tax reform and what would be the impact of reform on the Company and its products.

For additional discussion of possible tax legislative and regulatory risks that could affect our business, see “Risk Factors.”

Proposed Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee

On February 14, 2011, the Obama
Administration released the “General Explanations of the Administration’s Revenue Proposals,” which includes a proposal that would impose a Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee, or FCRF, on certain financial institutions with over $50
billion in consolidated assets. As proposed, the FCRF would apply to insurance companies or other companies that own insured depositories as of January 14, 2010, which would include the Company. The FCRF would be imposed at a rate of 7.5 basis
points on the “covered liabilities” of companies subject to the FCRF. Covered liabilities are generally the consolidated risk-weighted assets of a company with a few exceptions. Certain policy-related liabilities of insurance companies
would also be excluded. The FCRF would be imposed effective as of January 1, 2013. The amount of the FCRF that would be imposed upon the Company under this proposal, in the event it is enacted into law, is unclear, but could be substantial.

ERISA

ERISA is a comprehensive federal statute that applies to
U.S. employee benefit plans sponsored by private employers and labor unions. Plans subject to ERISA include pension and profit sharing plans and welfare plans, including health, life and disability plans. ERISA provisions include reporting and
disclosure rules, standards of conduct that apply to plan fiduciaries and prohibitions on transactions known as “prohibited transactions,” such as conflict-of-interest transactions and certain transactions between a benefit plan and a
party in interest. ERISA



also provides for a scheme of civil and criminal penalties and enforcement. Our insurance, asset management and retirement businesses provide services to employee benefit plans subject to ERISA,
including services where we may act as an ERISA fiduciary. In addition to ERISA regulation of businesses providing products and services to ERISA plans, we become subject to ERISA’s prohibited transaction rules for transactions with those
plans, which may affect our ability to enter transactions, or the terms on which transactions may be entered, with those plans, even in businesses unrelated to those giving rise to party in interest status.

USA Patriot Act

The USA Patriot Act of 2001, enacted in response to the
terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws applicable to broker-dealers and other financial services companies, including insurance companies. The Patriot Act seeks to promote
cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. Anti-money laundering laws outside of the U.S. contain provisions that may be different,
conflicting or more rigorous. The increased obligations of financial institutions to identify their customers, watch for and report suspicious transactions, respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies,
and share information with other financial institutions require the implementation and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls.

Holding Company Regulation

Prudential Financial is subject to the insurance holding company laws in the states where our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, which
currently include New Jersey, Arizona, Connecticut, Indiana and Iowa, or are treated as commercially domiciled, such as New York. These laws generally require each insurance company directly or indirectly owned by the holding company to register
with the insurance department in the insurance company’s state of domicile and to furnish annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company system. Generally, all transactions affecting the
insurers in the holding company system must be fair and reasonable and, if material, require prior notice and approval or non-disapproval by the state’s insurance department.

Most states, including the states in which our U.S. insurance
companies are domiciled, have insurance laws that require regulatory approval of a direct or indirect change of control of an insurer or an insurer’s holding company. Laws such as these that apply to us prevent any person from acquiring control
of Prudential Financial or of our insurance subsidiaries unless that person has filed a statement with specified information with the insurance regulators and has obtained their prior approval. Under most states’ statutes, acquiring 10% or more
of the voting stock of an insurance company or its parent company is presumptively considered a change of control, although such presumption may be rebutted. Accordingly, any person who acquires 10% or more of the voting securities of Prudential
Financial without the prior approval of the insurance regulators of the states in which our U.S. insurance companies are domiciled will be in violation of these states’ laws and may be subject to injunctive action requiring the disposition or
seizure of those securities by the relevant insurance regulator or prohibiting the voting of those securities and to other actions determined by the relevant insurance regulator.

Currently, there are several proposals to amend state
insurance holding company laws to increase the scope of regulation of insurance holding companies (such as Prudential Financial). The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (the “IAIS) and the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners (the “NAIC”) have promulgated model laws for adoption internationally and in the United States that would provide for “group wide” supervision of Prudential Financial as an insurance holding company in addition to
the current regulation of Prudential Financial’s insurance subsidiaries. While the timing of their adoption and content will vary by jurisdiction, we have identified the following areas of focus in these model laws: (1) uniform standards
for insurer corporate governance; (2) group-wide supervision of insurance holding companies; (3) adjustments to risk-based capital calculations to account for group-wide risks; and (4) additional regulatory and disclosure requirements
for insurance holding companies. At this time, we cannot predict with any degree of certainty what additional capital requirements, compliance costs or other burdens these requirements may impose on Prudential Financial.

In addition, many state insurance laws require prior
notification of state insurance departments of a change in control of a non-domiciliary insurance company doing business in that state. While these pre-notification



statutes do not authorize the state insurance departments to disapprove the change in control, they authorize regulatory action in the affected state if particular conditions exist such as undue
market concentration. Any future transactions that would constitute a change in control of Prudential Financial may require prior notification in those states that have adopted pre-acquisition notification laws.

As a result of its ownership of Prudential Bank &
Trust, FSB, Prudential Financial and Prudential IBH Holdco, Inc. are considered to be savings and loan holding companies and are subject to annual examination, currently by the Office of Thrift Supervision of the U.S. Department of Treasury
(“OTS”). As discussed above, under Dodd-Frank, we will, among other things, become subject to the examination, enforcement and supervisory authority of the FRB following the transfer to the FRB of the existing authority of the OTS. Federal
and state banking laws generally provide that no person may acquire control of Prudential Financial, and gain indirect control of either Prudential Bank & Trust, FSB or Prudential Trust Company, without prior regulatory approval. Generally,
beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the voting securities of Prudential Financial would be presumed to constitute control. We provide trust services through Prudential Trust Company, a state-chartered trust company incorporated under the laws of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and offer both trust directed services and investment products through Prudential Bank & Trust, FSB. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change
of control of Prudential Financial, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some shareholders of Prudential Financial might consider desirable.

Insurance Operations

State insurance laws regulate all aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and state insurance departments in the fifty states, the
District of Columbia and various U.S. territories and possessions monitor our insurance operations. Prudential Insurance is domiciled in New Jersey and its principal insurance regulatory authority is the New Jersey Department of Banking and
Insurance. Our other U.S. insurance companies are principally regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled. Generally, our insurance products must be approved by the insurance regulators in the state in which they
are sold. Our insurance products are substantially affected by federal and state tax laws. Products in the U.S. that also constitute “securities,” such as variable life insurance and variable annuities, are also subject to federal and some
state securities laws and regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, and some state securities commissions regulate and supervise these products.

State Insurance Regulation

State insurance authorities have broad administrative powers
with respect to all aspects of the insurance business including:

•

licensing to transact business;

•

licensing agents;

•

admittance of assets to statutory surplus;

•

regulating premium rates for certain insurance products;

•

approving policy forms;

•

regulating unfair trade and claims practices;

•

establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards;

•

fixing maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans and minimum accumulation or surrender values; and

•

regulating the type, amounts and valuations of investments permitted and other matters.

State insurance laws and regulations require our U.S.
insurance companies to file financial statements with state insurance departments everywhere they do business, and the operations of our U.S. insurance companies and accounts are subject to examination by those departments at any time. Our U.S.
insurance companies prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by



these departments. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or the NAIC, has approved a series of statutory accounting principles that have been adopted, in some cases with minor
modifications, by all state insurance departments.

Effective with the annual reporting period ending December 31, 2010, the NAIC adopted revisions to the Annual Financial Reporting
Model Regulation, or the Model Audit Rule, related to auditor independence, corporate governance and internal control over financial reporting. The adopted revisions require that we file reports with state insurance departments regarding our
assessment of internal control over financial reporting.

State insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the books and records, financial reporting, policy filings and market conduct of insurance companies domiciled in their states, generally once
every three to five years. Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the NAIC. In May 2007, the Connecticut insurance regulator completed a routine financial
examination of American Skandia Life Assurance Corporation (now Prudential Annuities Life Assurance Corporation) for the five year period ended December 31, 2005, and found no material deficiencies. In February 2008, the New Jersey insurance
regulator, along with the insurance regulators of Arizona and Connecticut, completed a coordinated financial examination for the five year period ended December 31, 2006 for all of our U.S. life insurance companies as part of the normal five
year examination cycle and found no material deficiencies. In December 2008, the Indiana insurance regulator completed a routine financial examination of Vantage Casualty Insurance Company for the five year period ended December 31, 2007 and
found no material deficiencies.

Financial
Regulation

Dividend Payment
Limitations.

The New Jersey insurance law and the insurance laws of the other states in which our insurance companies are domiciled regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid by Prudential Insurance and our other
U.S. insurance companies. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information.

Risk-Based Capital.

In order to
enhance the regulation of insurers’ solvency, the NAIC adopted a model law to implement risk-based capital requirements for life, health and property and casualty insurance companies. All states have adopted the NAIC’s model law or a
substantially similar law. The risk-based capital, or RBC, calculation, which regulators use to assess the sufficiency of an insurer’s statutory capital, measures the risk characteristics of a company’s assets, liabilities and certain
off-balance sheet items. In general, RBC is calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and reserve items. Within a given risk category, these factors are higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for
items with lower underlying risk. Insurers that have less statutory capital than the RBC calculation requires are considered to have inadequate capital and are subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending upon the level of capital
inadequacy. The RBC ratios for each of our U.S. insurance companies currently are above the ranges that would require any regulatory or corrective action.

Insurance Reserves and Regulatory Capital.

State insurance laws require us to analyze the adequacy of our
reserves annually. The respective appointed actuaries for each of our life insurance companies must each submit an opinion that our reserves, when considered in light of the assets we hold with respect to those reserves, make adequate provision for
our contractual obligations and related expenses.

Insurance regulators have begun to implement significant changes in the way in which industry participants must determine statutory
reserves and statutory capital, particularly for products with embedded options and guarantees such as variable annuities, and are considering further potentially significant changes in these requirements. Regulatory capital requirements based on
scenario testing have already gone into effect for variable annuity and certain fixed annuity products and products with similar features, and new reserving requirements for these products were implemented as of the end of 2009. The timing and
extent of further changes to the statutory reporting framework are uncertain.

Solvency Modernization Initiative.

State insurance regulators have focused attention on U.S. insurance solvency regulation pursuant to the NAIC’s “Solvency
Modernization Initiative.” The Solvency Modernization Initiative focuses on the entire U.S. financial regulatory system and all aspects of financial regulation affecting



insurance companies. Though broad in scope, the NAIC has stated that the Solvency Modernization Initiative will focus on: (1) capital requirements; (2) corporate governance and risk
management; (3) group supervision; (4) statutory accounting and financial reporting; and (5) reinsurance.

IRIS Tests.

The NAIC has developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the Insurance
Regulatory Information System, or IRIS, to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of U.S. insurance companies and identifying companies that require special attention or action by insurance regulatory authorities. Insurance
companies generally submit data annually to the NAIC, which in turn analyzes the data using prescribed financial data ratios, each with defined “usual ranges.” Generally, regulators will begin to investigate or monitor an insurance company
if its ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios. If an insurance company has insufficient capital, regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance it can issue. None of our U.S. insurance companies is currently
subject to regulatory scrutiny based on these ratios.

Market Conduct Regulation

State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing the marketplace activities of insurers, including provisions governing the form and content of disclosure to consumers,
illustrations, advertising, sales practices and complaint handling. State regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations.

Insurance Guaranty Association Assessments

Each state has insurance guaranty association laws under
which insurers doing business in the state are members and may be assessed by state insurance guaranty associations for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Typically, states assess each member insurer
in an amount related to the member insurer’s proportionate share of the business written by all member insurers in the state. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we paid approximately $0.8 million, $4.5 million and $1.7
million, respectively, in assessments pursuant to state insurance guaranty association laws. In addition, in 2009, we received $9.3 million of refunds for assessments paid in prior years. While we cannot predict the amount and timing of any future
assessments on our U.S. insurance companies under these laws, we have established reserves that we believe are adequate for future assessments relating to insurance companies that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings.

Federal and State Securities Regulation Affecting Insurance Operations

Our variable life insurance products, as
well as our variable annuity and mutual fund products, generally are “securities” within the meaning of federal securities laws, registered under the federal securities laws and subject to regulation by the SEC and FINRA. Federal and some
state securities regulation similar to that discussed below under “—Investment Products and Asset Management Operations” and “—Securities Operations” affect investment advice, sales and related activities with respect
to these products.

Our mutual funds, and in
certain states our variable life insurance and variable annuity products, are “securities” within the meaning of state securities laws. As securities, these products are subject to filing and certain other requirements. Also, sales
activities with respect to these products generally are subject to state securities regulation. Such regulation may affect investment advice, sales and related activities for these products

.

Investment and Retirement Products and Asset Management Operations

Our investment products and services are
subject to federal and state securities, fiduciary, including the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, and other laws and regulations. The SEC, FINRA, CFTC, state securities commissions, state banking and insurance departments and the
United States Department of Labor are the principal U.S. regulators that regulate our asset management operations. For a discussion of Dodd-Frank’s impact on our investment products and asset management operations, see “— Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act” above.



Some of the separate account, mutual fund and other pooled investment products offered by
our businesses, in addition to being registered under the Securities Act, are registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the shares of certain of these entities are qualified for sale in some states
and the District of Columbia. Separate account investment products are also subject to state insurance regulation as described above. We also have several subsidiaries that are registered as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, or the Exchange Act, and are subject to federal and state regulation, including but not limited to the SEC’s Uniform Net Capital Rule, described under “—Securities Operations” below. In addition, we have several
subsidiaries that are investment advisors registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Our Prudential Agents and other employees, insofar as they sell products that are securities, are subject to the Exchange Act and to
examination requirements and regulation by the SEC, FINRA and state securities commissioners. Regulation and examination requirements also extend to various Prudential entities that employ or control those individuals. The federal securities laws
could also require re-approval by customers of our investment advisory contracts to manage mutual funds, including mutual funds included in annuity products, upon a change in control.

Congress from time to time considers pension reform legislation that could decrease or increase the
attractiveness of certain of our retirement products and services to retirement plan sponsors and administrators, or have an unfavorable or favorable effect on our ability to earn revenues from these products and services. In this regard, the
Pension Protection Act of 2006 (“PPA”) made significant changes in employer pension funding obligations associated with defined benefit pension plans which are likely to increase sponsors’ costs of maintaining these plans. Over time,
these changes could hinder our sales of defined benefit pension products and services and cause sponsors to discontinue existing plans for which we provide asset management, administrative, or other services, but could increase the attractiveness of
certain products we offer in connection with terminating pension plans. The Worker, Retiree and Employer Recovery Act (the “Employer Recovery Act”) was passed in December 2008 in response to the financial crisis that began in the last half
of 2007. The Employer Recovery Act modifies the method of calculating a plan’s assets for purposes of satisfying the minimum funding rules set forth in the PPA, and ameliorates the financial impact of a plan not meeting its current funding
target. As a result, the Employer Recovery Act may have the effect of delaying some of the positive and negative impacts of the PPA on our business.

For a discussion of potential federal tax legislation and other federal regulation affecting our variable annuity products, see
“—Insurance Operations—Federal Regulation” above.

Securities Operations

Our securities operations, principally conducted by a number of SEC-registered broker-dealers are subject to federal and state securities, commodities and related laws. The SEC, the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, or the CFTC, state securities authorities, FINRA, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, and similar authorities are the principal regulators of our securities operations. For a discussion of Dodd-Frank’s impact on our
securities operations, see “—Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act” above.

A number of our subsidiaries are registered as broker-dealers with the SEC and with some or all of the 50 states and the District of
Columbia. In addition, a number of our subsidiaries are also registered as investment advisors with the SEC. Our broker-dealer affiliates are members of, and are subject to regulation by, “self-regulatory organizations,” including FINRA.
Self-regulatory organizations such as FINRA conduct examinations of, and have adopted rules governing, their member broker-dealers. In addition, state securities and certain other regulators have regulatory and oversight authority over our
registered broker-dealers.

Broker-dealers and
their sales forces in the U.S. and in certain other jurisdictions are subject to regulations that cover many aspects of the securities business, including sales methods and trading practices. The regulations cover the suitability of investments for
individual customers, use and safekeeping of customers’ funds and securities, capital adequacy, recordkeeping, financial reporting and the conduct of directors, officers and employees.

The commodity futures and commodity options industry in the U.S. is subject to regulation under the Commodity
Exchange Act, as amended. The CFTC is the federal agency charged with the administration of the



Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations adopted under that Act. A number of our subsidiaries are registered with the CFTC as futures commission merchants, commodity pool operators or commodity
trading advisors. Our futures business in our global commodities group is also regulated in the U.S. by the National Futures Association and in the United Kingdom by the Financial Services Authority, or the FSA.

The SEC and other governmental agencies and self-regulatory
organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S., have the power to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or suspension, termination or limitation of the
activities of a broker-dealer or an investment advisor or its employees.

As registered broker-dealers and members of various self-regulatory organizations, our U.S. registered broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the SEC’s Uniform Net Capital Rule. The Uniform Net
Capital Rule sets the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that at least a minimum part of a broker-dealer’s assets be kept in relatively liquid form. These net capital requirements are designed to
measure the financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. Our broker-dealers are also subject to the net capital requirements of the CFTC and the various securities and commodities exchanges of which they are members. Compliance with the net
capital requirements could limit those operations that require the intensive use of capital, such as underwriting and trading activities, and may limit the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends to Prudential Financial.

Privacy Regulation

Federal and state law and regulation require financial
institutions and other businesses to protect the security and confidentiality of personal information, including health-related and customer information, and to notify customers and other individuals about their policies and practices relating to
their collection and disclosure of health-related and customer information and their practices relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. State laws regulate use and disclosure of social security numbers. Federal
and state laws require notice to affected individuals, law enforcement, regulators and others if there is a breach of the security of certain personal information, including social security numbers, and require holders of certain personal
information to protect the security of the data. Federal regulations require financial institutions and creditors to implement effective programs to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft. Federal and state laws and regulations regulate the
ability of financial institutions to make telemarketing calls and to send unsolicited e-mail or fax messages to consumers and customers. Federal law and regulation regulate the permissible uses of certain personal information, including consumer
report information. Federal and state governments and regulatory bodies may be expected to consider additional or more detailed regulation regarding these subjects and the privacy and security of personal information.

Environmental Considerations

Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations
apply to our ownership and operation of real property. Inherent in owning and operating real property are the risks of hidden environmental liabilities and the costs of any required clean-up. Under the laws of certain states, contamination of a
property may give rise to a lien on the property to secure recovery of the costs of clean-up, which could adversely affect our commercial mortgage lending business. In several states, this lien has priority over the lien of an existing mortgage
against such property. In addition, in some states and under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, we may be liable, in certain circumstances, as an “owner” or
“operator,” for costs of cleaning-up releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at a property mortgaged to us. We also risk environmental liability when we foreclose on a property mortgaged to us, although Federal legislation
provides for a safe harbor from CERCLA liability for secured lenders that foreclose and sell the mortgaged real estate, provided that certain requirements are met. However, there are circumstances in which actions taken could still expose us to
CERCLA liability. Application of various other federal and state environmental laws could also result in the imposition of liability on us for costs associated with environmental hazards.

We routinely conduct environmental assessments prior to taking title to real estate, whether through
acquisition for investment, or through foreclosure on real estate collateralizing mortgages that we hold. Although unexpected environmental liabilities can always arise, we seek to minimize this risk by undertaking these



environmental assessments and complying with our internal procedures, and as a result, we believe that any costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations or any clean-up
of properties would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Other

The sale of real estate franchises by our real estate brokerage franchise operation is regulated by various state laws and the Federal Trade Commission. The federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act
and state real estate brokerage and unfair trade practice laws regulate payments among participants in the sale or financing of residences or the provision of settlement services such as mortgages, homeowner’s insurance and title insurance.

We are subject to the laws and regulations of
states and other jurisdictions concerning the identification, reporting and escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned funds, and we are subject to audit and examination for compliance with these requirements. We are currently being examined by a third
party auditor on behalf of 30 U.S. jurisdictions for compliance with the unclaimed property laws of these jurisdictions.

Regulation of our International Businesses

Our international businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision. As in the U.S., the purpose of these regulations is
primarily to protect our customers and not necessarily our shareholders. Many of the laws and regulations to which our international businesses are subject are regularly re-examined, in some instances resulting in comprehensive restatements of
applicable laws, regulations and reorganization of supervising authorities. Existing or future laws or regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations. It is also becoming increasingly common for regulatory
developments originating in the U.S., such as those discussed above, to be studied and adopted in some form in other jurisdictions in which we do business and for regulatory proposals developed in other jurisdictions (including the European Union)
or by international standard setting bodies to have cross-border impact on how our businesses are regulated. For example, the insurance regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, including Japan and Korea, have introduced Sarbanes-Oxley type
financial control requirements as well, and solvency regulatory approaches developed in Europe are being considered in jurisdictions such as Japan and Mexico. It is likely that the recent financial market dislocations will lead to changes in
existing laws and regulations, and regulatory frameworks, affecting our international business. Changes such as these can increase compliance costs and potential regulatory exposure. In some instances, such jurisdictions may also impose different,
conflicting or more rigorous laws and requirements, including regulations governing privacy, consumer protection, employee protection, corporate governance and capital adequacy.

In addition, our international operations face political,
legal, operational and other risks that we do not face in the U.S., including the risk of discriminatory regulation, labor issues in connection with workers’ associations and trade unions, nationalization or expropriation of assets, dividend
limitations, price controls and currency exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which they operate or converting local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or
other currencies. Some jurisdictions in which we operate joint ventures restrict our maximum percentage of ownership, which exposes us to joint venture partner risks and limits our array of potential remedies.

Our international insurance operations are principally
supervised by regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate, including the Japanese Ministry of Finance and Financial Services Agency. We operate insurance companies in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Italy and
Poland and have insurance operations in India through a joint venture in which we have a minority interest. We also have an application pending to operate a life insurance joint venture in China. The insurance regulatory bodies for these businesses
typically oversee such issues as company licensing, the licensing of insurance sales staff, insurance product approvals, sales practices, claims payment practices, permissible investments, solvency and capital adequacy, and insurance reserves, among
other items. In some jurisdictions for certain products regulators will also mandate premium rates (or components of pricing) or minimum guaranteed interest rates. Periodic examinations of insurance company books and records, financial reporting
requirements, market conduct examinations and policy filing requirements are among the techniques used by these regulators to supervise our non-U.S. insurance businesses.



In order to monitor insurers’ solvency, regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in
which we operate outside the U.S. generally establish some form of minimum solvency margin requirements for insurance companies, similar in concept to the RBC ratios that are employed by U.S. insurance regulators. These solvency margins are used by
regulators to assess the sufficiency of an insurer’s capital and claims-paying ability and include the impact of transactions with affiliated entities. The solvency margin ratios in certain jurisdictions are required to be disclosed to the
public. Insurers that have less solvency margin than the regulators require are considered to have inadequate capital and are subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending upon the level of capital inadequacy. The solvency margin ratios
for each of our international insurance operations currently are above the ranges that would require any regulatory or corrective action.

The Financial Services Agency, the insurance regulator in Japan, has implemented revisions to the solvency margin requirements that will
revise risk charges for certain assets and change the manner in which an insurance company’s core capital is calculated. Under the proposals, certain financial assets will now be excluded from the core capital calculation and certain investment
risk factors, including derivatives and foreign exchange, will be revised. These changes are effective for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012; however, it is anticipated that companies may begin to publicly disclose prior to that date both
their old and new solvency margin calculations. While we believe that the solvency margins of our Japanese insurance subsidiaries would continue to satisfy regulatory requirements and our internal targets, it is possible that a reduction in the
reported ratios arising from changes in the calculation requirements could affect customer perception of our financial strength. The capital requirements in Korea and Taiwan are also undergoing changes. We anticipate further changes in solvency
regulation from jurisdiction to jurisdiction based on regulatory developments in the U.S., the European Union, and recommendations by an international standard setting body for the insurance industry, as well as regulatory requirements for those
companies deemed to be systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs, in the U.S. or abroad. It is unclear what criteria will be used to determine which companies will be deemed to be SIFIs or whether we will be so treated.

The insurance regulatory bodies in some of the countries
where our international insurance businesses are located regulate the amount of dividends that they can pay to shareholders. The Prudential Life Insurance Company, Ltd., or Prudential of Japan, began paying dividends in 2006. Pursuant to Gibraltar
Life’s reorganization, in addition to regulatory restrictions, there are certain restrictions on Gibraltar Life’s ability to pay dividends and we anticipate that it will be several years before these restrictions will allow Gibraltar Life
to pay dividends. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information.

Our international investment operations are also supervised primarily by regulatory authorities in the
countries in which they operate. We operate investment related businesses in, among other jurisdictions, Japan, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, India, Germany and Singapore, and participate in investment-related joint ventures in Brazil,
Italy, Mexico and China. These businesses may provide investment-related products such as investment management products and services, mutual funds, brokerage, separately managed accounts, as well as commodities and derivatives products. The
regulatory authorities for these businesses typically oversee such issues as company licensing, the licensing of investment product sales staff, sales practices, solvency and capital adequacy, mutual fund product approvals and related disclosures,
securities, commodities and related laws, among other items.

In some cases, our international investment businesses are also subject to U.S. securities laws and regulations. One is regulated as a broker-dealer in the U.S. under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, and others are registered investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Our international insurance and investment businesses may also be subject to other U.S. laws governing businesses controlled by U.S.
companies such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and certain regulations issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Asset Controls. In addition, under current U.S. law and regulations we may be prohibited from dealing with certain individuals or
entities in certain circumstances and we may be required to monitor customer activities, which may affect our ability to attract and retain customers.

Certain of our international insurance operations, including those in Japan, may be subject to assessments, generally based on their
proportionate share of business written in the relevant jurisdiction, for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. As we cannot predict the timing of future assessments, they may materially affect the
results of operations of our international insurance operations in



particular quarterly or annual periods. In addition, in some jurisdictions, some of our insurance products are considered “securities” under local law. In those instances, we may also
be subject to local securities regulations and oversight by local securities regulators.

Under the Japanese insurance guaranty law, substantially similar to such laws in the U.S., all licensed life insurers in Japan are required to be members and are assessed, on a pre-funded basis, by the
Japan Policyholders Protection Corporation, or PPC. These assessments generate a collective fund which is used to satisfy certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. The PPC assesses each member in an amount
related to its proportionate share of new business written by all member insurers. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we paid approximately $16 million, $15 million and $15 million, respectively, in assessments pursuant to
Japanese insurance guaranty association laws.

Our
international businesses are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the countries in which they are organized and in which they operate. Foreign governments from time to time consider legislation that could impact the amount of taxes that we pay
or impact the sales of our products. In 2008, the National Tax Authority in Japan, or NTA, released a revised tax circular that reduced, but did not eliminate, the corporate tax deductibility of insurance premiums paid with respect to Increasing
Term insurance products sold after February 28, 2008. In 2008, Korea enacted a corporate income tax rate reduction from 27.5% to 24.2% for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2009 and to 22% for fiscal years beginning on or after
January 1, 2012. In 2009, Taiwan enacted a corporate income tax rate decrease from 25% to 20% effective January 1, 2010. Also in 2009, Mexico enacted a corporate income tax rate increase effective in 2010. In 2010, Taiwan further reduced
the corporate tax rate from 20% to 17% for tax years beginning in or after 2010. In December 2010, the Japanese Prime Minister announced a plan to reduce the Japanese corporate tax rate from 36.2% to 31.2% and change the tax loss carryforward rules
from 7 to 9 years, but tax losses may then only offset 80% of a company’s taxable income. It is uncertain if this proposal will be enacted, but if it is it would likely be enacted in March 2011 and become effective for the next Japanese tax
year, which generally begins on April 1, 2011.

Our international operations are regulated in the jurisdictions in which they are located or operate. These regulations may apply
heightened scrutiny to non-domestic companies, which can reduce our flexibility as to intercompany transactions, investments and other aspects of business operations and adversely affect our liquidity and profitability.

As discussed under “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—International Insurance and Investments Division—International Insurance,” on February 1, 2011, we
completed the acquisition from AIG of the Star and Edison Businesses for a total purchase price of approximately $4.8 billion, comprised of approximately $4.2 billion in cash and $0.6 billion in the assumption of third-party debt. All acquired
entities are Japanese corporations and their businesses are in Japan. The acquisition significantly expands the scope of our operations subject to regulation in Japan.

Employees

As of December 31, 2010, we had 41,044 employees and
sales associates, including 21,008 located outside of the U.S. We believe our relations with our employees and sales associates are satisfactory.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the following risks. These risks could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial
condition, cause the trading price of our Common Stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. These risks
are not exclusive, and additional risks to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, the factors mentioned under “Forward-Looking Statements” above and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Market fluctuations and general economic,
market and political conditions may adversely affect our business and profitability.

Some of our businesses and our results of operations were materially adversely affected by adverse conditions in the global financial markets and adverse economic conditions generally that began in the
second half of 2007. While conditions in the global financial markets have improved, with favorable results for many of our businesses, our businesses, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected, possibly materially, if
these conditions recur.

Even under relatively
favorable market conditions, our insurance and annuities products and certain of our investment products, as well as our investment returns and our access to and cost of financing, are sensitive to fixed income, equity, real estate and other market
fluctuations and general economic, market and political conditions. These fluctuations and conditions could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity, including in the following respects:

•

The profitability of many of our insurance and annuities products depends in part on the value of the separate accounts supporting these products,
which fluctuate substantially depending on the foregoing conditions.

•

Market conditions resulting in reductions in the value of assets we manage or lower transaction volume have an adverse effect on the revenues and
profitability of our asset management services, which depend on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management or transaction volume, and could further decrease the value of our proprietary investments.

•

A change in market conditions, including prolonged periods of high inflation, could cause a change in consumer sentiment adversely affecting sales and
persistency of our long-term savings and protection products. A prolonged period of low interest rates could cause persistency of these products to vary from that anticipated and adversely affect profitability (as further described below).
Similarly, changing economic conditions and unfavorable public perception of financial institutions can influence customer behavior, including but not limited to increasing claims or surrenders in certain product lines.

•

Sales of our investment-based and asset management products and services may decline, and lapses and surrenders of variable life and annuity products
and withdrawals of assets from other investment products may increase if a market downturn, increased market volatility or other market conditions result in customers becoming dissatisfied with their investments or products.

•

A market decline could further result in guaranteed minimum benefits contained in many of our variable annuity products being higher than current
account values or our pricing assumptions would support, requiring us to materially increase reserves for such products, and may cause customers to retain contracts in force in order to benefit from the guarantees, thereby increasing their cost to
us. Any increased cost may or may not be more than offset by the favorable impact of greater persistency from prolonged fee streams. Our valuation of the liabilities for the minimum benefits contained in many of our variable annuity products
requires us to consider the market perception of our risk of non-performance, and a



decrease in our own credit spreads resulting from ratings upgrades or other events or market conditions could cause the recorded value of these liabilities to increase, which in turn could
adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.

•

Market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase. Accordingly, we may be forced to incur additional
expenses for reinsurance or may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms which could adversely affect the profitability of future business or our willingness to write future business.

•

Hedging instruments we hold to manage foreign exchange, product, and other risks might not perform as intended or expected resulting in higher realized
losses and unforeseen cash needs. Market conditions can limit availability of hedging instruments and also further increase the cost of executing product related hedges and such costs may not be recovered in the pricing of the underlying products
being hedged. Our hedging strategies rely on the performance of counterparties to such hedges. These counterparties may fail to perform for various reasons resulting in unhedged exposures and losses on uncollateralized positions.

•

We have significant investment and derivative portfolios, including but not limited to corporate and asset-backed securities, equities and commercial
real estate. Economic conditions as well as adverse capital market conditions, including but not limited to a lack of buyers in the marketplace, volatility, credit spread changes, benchmark interest rate changes, changes in foreign currency exchange
rates and declines in value of underlying collateral will impact the credit quality, liquidity and value of our investments and derivatives, potentially resulting in higher capital charges and unrealized or realized losses, the latter especially if
we were to need to sell a significant amount of investments under such conditions. For example, a widening of credit spreads increases the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio and may ultimately result in increased realized
losses. Values of our investments and derivatives can also be impacted by reductions in price transparency, changes in assumptions or inputs we use in estimating fair value and changes in investor confidence and preferences, potentially resulting in
higher realized or unrealized losses. Volatility can make it difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent. Valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may have significant period to period changes which
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition, and in certain cases under U.S. GAAP such period to period changes in the value of investments are not recognized in our results of operations or consolidated
statements of financial condition.

•

Opportunities for investment of available funds at appropriate returns may be limited, including due to the current low interest rate environment, a
diminished securitization market or other factors, with a possible negative impact on our overall results. The consequences of holding cash for long periods of time may result in increased purchase of derivatives for duration management purposes.
The increased use of derivatives may increase the volatility of our U.S. GAAP results and our statutory capital.

•

Regardless of market conditions, certain investments we hold, including private bonds and commercial mortgages, are relatively illiquid. If we needed
to sell these investments, we may have difficulty doing so in a timely manner at a price that we could otherwise realize.

•

Fluctuations in our operating results and the impact on our investment portfolio may impact the Company’s tax profile and its ability to optimally
utilize tax attributes.

Adverse capital
market conditions have in the past, and could in the future, significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, our access to capital and our cost of capital, including capital that may be required by our subsidiaries. Under such conditions,
we may seek additional debt or equity capital but be unable to obtain such.

Adverse capital market conditions have affected and may affect in the future the availability and cost of borrowed funds and could impact our ability to refinance existing borrowings, thereby ultimately
impacting our profitability and ability to support or grow our businesses. We need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, interest on our debt and dividends on our capital stock and replace certain maturing debt obligations. Without sufficient
liquidity, we could be forced to curtail certain of our operations, and our business could suffer. The principal sources of our liquidity are insurance premiums, annuity considerations, deposit funds and cash flow



from our investment portfolio and assets, consisting mainly of cash or assets that are readily convertible into cash. Sources of liquidity in normal markets also include a variety of short- and
long-term instruments, including securities lending and repurchase agreements, commercial paper, medium and long-term debt and capital securities.

Disruptions, uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets limited and, to the extent they persist or recur, may limit in the future
our access to capital required to operate our business, most significantly our insurance and annuities operations. These market conditions may in the future limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing debt obligations and access the
capital necessary to grow our business, replace capital withdrawn by customers or raise new capital required by our subsidiaries as a result of volatility in the markets. As a result, under such conditions we may be forced to delay raising capital,
issue shorter tenor securities than would be optimal, bear an unattractive cost of capital or be unable to raise capital at any price, which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. Actions we might take
to access financing may in turn cause rating agencies to reevaluate our ratings. Our ability to borrow under our commercial paper programs is also dependent upon market conditions. Future deterioration of our capital position at a time when we are
unable to access the long-term debt or commercial paper markets could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient.

We may seek additional debt or equity financing to satisfy our needs. The availability of additional financing
will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, and our credit ratings and credit capacity. We may not be able to successfully
obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. Further, any future equity offerings would dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders.

The Risk Based Capital, or RBC, ratio is a primary measure by which we and state insurance regulators evaluate the capital adequacy of
Prudential Insurance and our other domestic life insurance subsidiaries, which includes businesses in both the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. We manage Prudential Insurance and our other domestic life insurance
subsidiaries’ RBC ratios to a level consistent with their ratings objectives; however, rating agencies take into account a variety of factors in assigning ratings to our insurance subsidiaries in addition to RBC levels. RBC is determined by
statutory rules that consider risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets, insurance-related risks associated with Prudential Insurance’s products, interest rate risks and general business risks. The RBC ratio calculations are
intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring the adequacy of Prudential Insurance’s statutory capitalization. Adverse financial performance in the Closed Block Business in Prudential Insurance, including adverse investment performance,
will adversely affect Prudential Insurance’s RBC ratios, although dividends to Closed Block policyholders may be subsequently adjusted to reflect such performance. The failure of Prudential Insurance and our other domestic insurance
subsidiaries to meet applicable RBC requirements or minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements could subject those subsidiaries to further examination or corrective action by state insurance regulators. The failure to maintain the RBC ratios
of Prudential Insurance and our other domestic insurance subsidiaries at desired levels could also adversely impact our competitive position. In addition, RBC ratios may impact our credit and claims paying ratings. Our international insurance
companies are subject to conceptually similar measures of capital adequacy, including solvency margins for our Japanese insurance companies, and we face similar risks as those described for our domestic companies in the event that we are unable to
maintain these measures at adequate levels. U.S. and international insurance regulators may change capital requirements, as described herein.

Disruptions in the capital markets could adversely affect Prudential Financial’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to access sources
of liquidity, as well as threaten to reduce our capital below a level that is consistent with our existing ratings objectives. Therefore, we may need to take actions, which may include but are not limited to: (1) further access external sources
of capital, including the debt or equity markets; (2) reduce or eliminate future shareholder dividends on our Common Stock; (3) undertake additional capital management activities, including reinsurance transactions; (4) limit or
curtail sales of certain products and/or restructure existing products; (5) undertake further asset sales or internal asset transfers; (6) seek temporary or permanent changes to regulatory rules; and (7) maintain greater levels of
cash balances or for longer periods thereby reducing investment returns. Certain of these actions may require regulatory approval and/or agreement of counterparties which are outside of our control or have economic costs associated with them.



Our asset management operations include real estate held in Prudential Insurance separate
accounts, for the benefit of clients, which enter into forward commitments which typically are funded from separate account assets and cash flows and related separate account funding sources. Adverse credit and real estate capital market conditions
affecting fund liquidity and the availability of funding could produce challenges in funding commitments in the normal course. In such cases, Prudential Insurance might be called upon or required to provide interim funding solutions, which could
affect the availability of liquidity for other purposes.

An
inability to access our credit facilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

We maintain committed unsecured revolving credit facilities that, as of December 31, 2010, totaled $4.108 billion. We rely on these
credit facilities as a potential source of liquidity which could be critical in enabling us to meet our obligations as they come due, particularly during periods when alternative sources of liquidity are limited. Our ability to borrow under these
facilities is conditioned on our satisfaction of covenants and other requirements contained in the facilities, such as Prudential Insurance’s maintenance of a prescribed minimum level of total adjusted capital based on statutory accounting
principles under New Jersey law and Prudential Financial’s maintenance of a prescribed minimum level of consolidated net worth calculated in accordance with the applicable credit agreement. Our failure to satisfy these and other requirements
contained in the credit facilities would restrict our access to the facilities when needed and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

We have experienced and may experience additional downgrades in our
financial strength or credit ratings. A downgrade or potential downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered, increase our borrowing costs
and/or hurt our relationships with creditors, trading counterparties or reinsurers and restrict our access to alternative sources of liquidity.

Financial strength ratings, which are sometimes referred to as “claims-paying” ratings, represent the opinions of rating
agencies regarding the financial ability of an insurance company to meet its obligations under an insurance policy, and are important factors affecting public confidence in an insurer and its competitive position in marketing products, including
Prudential Insurance and our other insurance company subsidiaries. Credit ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding an entity’s ability to repay its indebtedness, and Prudential Financial’s credit ratings are important to
our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt and to the cost of such financing. A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could potentially, among other things, limit our ability to market products, reduce our
competitiveness, increase the number or value of policy surrenders and withdrawals, increase our borrowing costs and potentially make it more difficult to borrow funds, adversely affect the availability of financial guarantees, such as letters of
credit, cause additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements, allow counterparties to terminate derivative agreements, and/or hurt our relationships with creditors, distributors, reinsurers or trading
counterparties thereby potentially negatively affecting our profitability, liquidity and/or capital. In addition, we consider our own risk of non-performance in determining the fair value of our liabilities, including insurance liabilities that are
classified as embedded derivatives under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, changes in our credit or financial strength ratings may affect the fair value of our liabilities. For a description of material rating actions that have occurred from the beginning of
2010 through the date of this filing, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Ratings.”

Prudential Insurance has been a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, or FHLBNY, since June 2008. Membership allows Prudential
Insurance access to FHLBNY’s financial services, including the ability to obtain collateralized loans, and to issue collateralized funding agreements that can be used as an alternative source of liquidity. Under FHLBNY guidelines, if Prudential
Insurance’s financial strength ratings decline below A/A2/A Stable by S&P, Moody’s and Fitch, respectively, and the FHLBNY does not receive written assurances from the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance regarding Prudential
Insurance’s solvency, new borrowings from the FHLBNY would be limited to a term of 90 days or less. Although Prudential Insurance’s ratings are currently at or above the required minimum levels, there can be no assurance that the ratings
will remain at these levels in the future.



We cannot predict what additional actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may
take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which could adversely affect our business. As with other companies in the financial services industry, our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without notice by any rating agency.

In addition, agreements in connection with
capital management activities for our universal life insurance products would require us to post cash collateral based on tests that consider the level of 10-year credit default swap spreads on Prudential Financial’s senior debt. As of
December 31, 2010, no collateral amounts were required to be paid.

Ratings downgrades and changes in credit spreads may require us to post collateral, thereby affecting our liquidity, and we may be unable to effectively implement certain capital management activities
as a result, or for other reasons.

A
downgrade in the credit or financial strength ratings of Prudential Financial or its rated subsidiaries could result in additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements, including derivative agreements, which
are eligible to be satisfied in cash or by posting securities held by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements. A ratings downgrade of three ratings levels from the ratings levels at December 31, 2010 (relating to financial strength ratings
in certain cases and credit ratings in other cases) would result in estimated collateral posting requirements or payments under such agreements of approximately $198 million as of December 31, 2010. In addition, a ratings downgrade by A.M. Best
to “A-” for our domestic life insurance companies would require Prudential Insurance to post a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $1.7 billion, based on the level of statutory reserves related to the variable annuity business
acquired from Allstate, that we estimate would result in annual cash outflows of approximately $14 million, or collateral posting in the form of cash or securities to be held in a trust.

Interest rate fluctuations or prolonged periods of low interest rates could adversely affect our businesses and
profitability and require us to increase reserves and statutory capital.

Our insurance and annuities products and certain of our investment products, and our investment returns, are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, and changes in interest rates could adversely affect
our investment returns and results of operations, including in the following respects:

•

Some of our products expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce the spread between the amounts that we are required to pay under
the contracts and the rate of return we are able to earn on our general account investments supporting the contracts. When interest rates decline, we have to reinvest the cash income from our investments in lower yielding instruments, potentially
reducing net investment income. Since many of our policies and contracts have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates or limit the resetting of interest rates, the spreads could decrease and potentially become negative. When interest rates
rise, we may not be able to replace the assets in our general account as quickly with the higher yielding assets needed to fund the higher crediting rates necessary to keep these products and contracts competitive.

•

Changes in interest rates can also result in potential losses in our investment activities in which we borrow funds and purchase investments to earn
additional spread income on the borrowed funds.

•

When interest rates rise, policy loans and surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts may increase as policyholders
seek to buy products with perceived higher returns, requiring us to sell investment assets potentially resulting in realized investment losses, or requiring us to accelerate the amortization of DAC, DSI or VOBA (each defined below). In addition,
increasing interest rates could cause capital strain for Japanese statutory reporting because the carrying value of bonds classified as available for sale would decline while the value of liabilities would generally remain unchanged.

•

A decline in interest rates accompanied by unexpected prepayments of certain investments could result in reduced investments and a decline in our
profitability. An increase in interest rates accompanied by unexpected extensions of certain lower yielding investments could result in a decline in our profitability.

•

Changes in the relationship between long-term and short-term interest rates could adversely affect the profitability of some of our products.



•

Changes in interest rates could increase our costs of financing.

•

Our mitigation efforts with respect to interest rate risk are primarily focused on maintaining an investment portfolio with diversified maturities that
has a weighted average duration that is approximately equal to the duration of our estimated liability cash flow profile. However, our estimate of the liability cash flow profile may turn out to be inaccurate. In addition, there are practical and
capital market limitations on our ability to accomplish this matching, especially in some of our Asian operations. Due to these and other factors we may need to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a loss in order to satisfy liabilities or be
forced to reinvest funds in a lower rate environment. Although we take measures to manage the economic risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, we may not be able to effectively mitigate, and we may sometimes choose based on
economic considerations and other factors not to fully mitigate, the interest rate risk of our assets relative to our liabilities.

•

For certain of our products, a delay between the time we make changes in interest rate and other assumptions used for product pricing and the time we
are able to reflect these assumptions in products available for sale could negatively impact the long-term profitability of products sold during the intervening period.

Recent periods have been characterized by low interest rates. A prolonged period during which interest rates
remain at levels lower than those anticipated may result in greater costs associated with certain of our product features which guarantee death benefits or income streams for stated periods or for life; higher costs for derivative instruments used
to hedge certain of our product risks; or shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting policy obligations, each of which may require us to record charges to increase reserves. In addition to compressing spreads and reducing net investment
income, such an environment may cause policies to remain in force for longer periods than we anticipated in our pricing, potentially resulting in greater claims costs than we expected and resulting in lower overall returns on business in force. In
addition, certain statutory capital requirements are based on formulas or models that consider interest rates, and a prolonged period of low interest rates may increase the statutory capital we are required to hold as well as the amount of assets we
must maintain to support statutory reserves.

Our ability to
pay shareholder dividends, to engage in share repurchases and to meet obligations may be adversely affected by limitations imposed on inter-affiliate distributions and transfers by Prudential Insurance and our other subsidiaries.

Prudential Financial is the holding company for all our
operations, and dividends, returns of capital and interest income from its subsidiaries are the principal source of funds available to Prudential Financial to pay shareholder dividends, to make share repurchases and to meet its other obligations.
These sources of funds may be complemented by Prudential Financial’s access, if available, to the financial markets and bank facilities. As described under “Business—Regulation” and in “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources,” our domestic and foreign insurance and various other subsidiary companies, including Prudential Insurance, are subject to regulatory limitations on
the payment of dividends and on other transfers of funds to Prudential Financial. In addition to these regulatory limitations, the terms of the IHC debt contain restrictions potentially limiting dividends by Prudential Insurance applicable to the
Financial Services Businesses in the event the Closed Block Business is in financial distress and under other circumstances. Finally, our management of Prudential Insurance and other subsidiaries to have capitalization consistent with their ratings
objectives itself may constrain their payment of dividends. These restrictions on Prudential Financial’s subsidiaries may limit or prevent such subsidiaries from making dividend payments to Prudential Financial in an amount sufficient to fund
Prudential Financial’s cash requirements and shareholder dividends. From time to time, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, and various state and foreign insurance regulators have considered, and may in the future
consider, proposals to further limit dividend payments that an insurance company may make without regulatory approval.

Difficult market conditions could also affect our ability to pay shareholder dividends. Our practice is to declare and pay dividends
annually and the decision concerning Common Stock dividends is ordinarily made in the fourth quarter of the year.



Losses due to defaults by others, including issuers of investment securities or reinsurance, bond
insurers and derivative instrument counterparties, downgrades in the ratings of securities we hold or of bond insurers, insolvencies of insurers in jurisdictions where we write business and other factors affecting our counterparties or the value of
their securities could adversely affect the value of our investments, the realization of amounts contractually owed to us, result in assessments or additional statutory capital requirements or reduce our profitability or sources of liquidity.

Issuers and borrowers whose securities or
loans we hold, customers, vendors, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts, reinsurers, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries and guarantors, including bond insurers,
may default on their obligations to us or be unable to perform service functions that are significant to our business due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud or other reasons. Such
defaults, instances of which have occurred in recent periods, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. A downgrade in the ratings of bond insurers could also result in declines in the value of our fixed
maturity investments supported by guarantees from bond insurers.

In addition, we use derivative instruments to hedge various risks, including certain guaranteed minimum benefits contained in many of our variable annuity products. We enter into a variety of derivative
instruments, including options, forwards, interest rate, credit default and currency swaps with a number of counterparties. Amounts that we expect to collect under current and future contracts, including, but not limited to reinsurance contracts,
are subject to counterparty risk. Our obligations under our products are not changed by our hedging activities and we are liable for our obligations even if our derivative counterparties, including reinsurers, do not pay us. This is a more
pronounced risk to us in view of the recent stresses suffered by financial institutions. Such defaults could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Under state insurance guaranty association laws and similar
laws in international jurisdictions, we are subject to assessments, based on the share of business we write in the relevant jurisdiction, for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants.

We use reinsurance as part of our capital management with
respect to our Closed Block Business. Ratings downgrades or financial difficulties of reinsurers may require us to utilize additional capital with respect to the business.

The eligible collateral that Prudential Insurance is required
to pledge to the FHLBNY in support of its borrowings includes qualifying mortgage-related assets, such as commercial mortgage-backed securities. The major rating agencies have downgraded the credit ratings of certain commercial mortgage-backed
securities and may continue to do so. If future downgrades affect the commercial mortgage-backed securities pledged by Prudential Insurance to the FHLBNY, those securities would no longer constitute eligible collateral under FHLBNY guidelines. This
could require Prudential Insurance to repay outstanding borrowings or to pledge replacement collateral to the FHLBNY, which could materially reduce the Company’s borrowing capacity from the FHLBNY and/or prevent use of that replacement
collateral for asset-based financing transactions.

Guarantees
within certain of our products that protect policyholders may decrease our earnings or increase the volatility of our results of operations or financial position under U.S. GAAP if our hedging or risk management strategies prove ineffective or
insufficient.

Certain of our products,
including especially our variable annuity products, include guarantees of income streams for stated periods or for life. Downturns in equity markets, increased equity volatility, or (as discussed above) reduced interest rates could result in an
increase in the valuation of liabilities associated with such products, resulting in increases in reserves and reductions in net income. We use a variety of hedging and risk management strategies, including product features, to mitigate these risks
in part. These strategies may, however, not be fully effective. We may also choose not to fully hedge these risks. Hedging instruments may not effectively offset the costs of guarantees or may otherwise be insufficient in relation to our
obligations. Hedging instruments also may not change in value correspondingly with associated liabilities due to equity market or interest rate conditions or other reasons. We sometimes choose to hedge these risks on a basis that does not correspond
to their anticipated or actual impact upon our results of operations or financial position under U.S. GAAP. For example, as discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and



Results of Operations—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division—Individual Annuities,”
during the third quarter of 2010 we have begun to hedge certain risks associated with our variable annuity products on a basis that does not fully correspond to the associated U.S. GAAP liability. Changes from period to period in the valuation of
these policy benefits, and in the amount of our obligations effectively hedged, will result in volatility in our results of operations and financial position under U.S. GAAP. Estimates and assumptions we make in connection with hedging activities
may fail to reflect or correspond to our actual long-term exposure in respect of our guarantees. Further, the risk of increases in the costs of our guarantees not covered by our hedging and other capital and risk management strategies may become
more significant due to changes in policyholder behavior driven by market conditions or other factors. The above factors, individually or collectively, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or
liquidity.

Our profitability may decline if mortality rates,
morbidity rates or persistency rates differ significantly from our pricing expectations.

We set prices for many of our insurance and annuity products based upon expected claims and payment patterns, using assumptions for mortality rates, or likelihood of death, and morbidity rates, or
likelihood of sickness, of our policyholders. In addition to the potential effect of natural or man-made disasters, significant changes in mortality or morbidity could emerge gradually over time, due to changes in the natural environment, the health
habits of the insured population, treatment patterns and technologies for disease or disability, the economic environment, or other factors. Pricing of our insurance and deferred annuity products are also based in part upon expected persistency of
these products, which is the probability that a policy or contract will remain in force from one period to the next. Persistency within our Individual Annuities business may be significantly impacted by the value of guaranteed minimum benefits
contained in many of our variable annuity products being higher than current account values in light of poor equity market performance or extended periods of low interest rates as well as other factors. Persistency could be adversely affected
generally by developments affecting client perception of us, including perceptions arising from adverse publicity. Results may also vary based on differences between actual and expected premium deposits and withdrawals for these products. The
development of a secondary market for life insurance, including life settlements or “viaticals” and investor owned life insurance, and third-party investor strategies in the annuities business, could adversely affect the profitability of
existing business and our pricing assumptions for new business. Significant deviations in actual experience from our pricing assumptions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our products. Although some of our products permit us to
increase premiums or adjust other charges and credits during the life of the policy or contract, the adjustments permitted under the terms of the policies or contracts may not be sufficient to maintain profitability. Many of our products do not
permit us to increase premiums or adjust other charges and credits or limit those adjustments during the life of the policy or contract. Even if permitted under the policy or contract, we may not be able or willing to raise premiums or adjust other
charges sufficiently, or at all, for regulatory or competitive reasons.

If our reserves for future policyholder benefits and claims are inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserves, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We establish and carry reserves to pay
future policyholder benefits and claims. Our reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but rather are actuarial or statistical estimates based on data and models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently
uncertain and involve the exercise of significant judgment, including as to the levels of and/or timing of receipt or payment of premiums, benefits, claims, expenses, interest credits, investment results (including equity market returns),
retirement, mortality, morbidity and persistency. We cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts that we will pay for, or the timing of payment of, actual benefits, claims and expenses or whether the assets supporting our policy
liabilities, together with future premiums, will be sufficient for payment of benefits and claims. If we conclude that our reserves, together with future premiums, are insufficient to cover future policy benefits and claims, we would be required to
increase our reserves and incur income statement charges for the period in which we make the determination, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

For certain of our products, market performance and interest rates (as well as the regulatory environment, as
discussed further below) impact the level of statutory reserves and statutory capital we are required to hold, and may have an adverse effect on returns on capital associated with these products. For example, equity market



declines in the fourth quarter of 2008 caused a significant increase in the level of statutory reserves and statutory capital we were required to hold in relation to our Individual Annuities
business. We finance uneconomic reserves associated with our Individual Life business. Marketplace capacity for reserve funding structures may be limited as a result of market conditions generally. Our ability to efficiently manage capital and
economic reserve levels may be impacted, thereby impacting profitability and return on capital.

We may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC, deferred sales inducements, or DSI, or valuation of business acquired, or VOBA, or recognize impairment
in the value of our goodwill or certain investments, or be required to establish a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC, represent the
costs that vary with and are related primarily to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance and annuity contracts, and we amortize these costs over the expected lives of the contracts. Deferred sales inducements, or DSI, represent amounts that
are credited to a policyholder’s account balance as an inducement to purchase the contract, and we amortize these costs over the expected lives of the contracts. Valuation of business acquired, or VOBA, represents the present value of future
profits embedded in acquired insurance, annuity and investment-type contracts and is amortized over the expected effective lives of the acquired contracts. Management, on an ongoing basis, tests the DAC, DSI and VOBA recorded on our balance sheet to
determine if these amounts are recoverable under current assumptions. In addition, we regularly review the estimates and assumptions underlying DAC, DSI and VOBA for those products for which we amortize DAC, DSI and VOBA in proportion to gross
profits or gross margins. Given changes in facts and circumstances, these tests and reviews could lead to reductions in DAC, DSI and/or VOBA that could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations and our financial condition. Significant
or sustained equity market declines as well as investment losses could result in acceleration of amortization of the DAC, DSI and VOBA related to variable annuity and variable universal life contracts, resulting in a charge to income. As discussed
earlier, the amortization of DAC, DSI and VOBA are also sensitive to changes in interest rates.

Goodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is assessed annually for
potential impairment, or more frequently if conditions warrant, by comparing the carrying value (equity attributed to a business to support its risk) of a business to its estimated fair value at that date. As of December 31, 2010, we had a
goodwill balance of $707 million, including $444 million related to our Retirement reporting unit, $239 million related to our Asset Management reporting unit and $24 million related to our International Insurance reporting unit. Market declines or
other events impacting the fair value of these businesses, or increases in the level of equity required to support these businesses, could result in goodwill impairments, resulting in a charge to income.

As of December 31, 2010, we had operating equity method
investments within our International Investments business, of $318 million. Declines in the fair value of these investments may require that we review the remaining carrying value of these investments for potential impairment, and such review could
result in impairments and charges to income.

Deferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax
assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if they are realizable. Factors in management’s determination include the performance of the business including the geographic and legal entity source of our income, the ability to
generate capital gains from a variety of sources, and tax planning strategies. If based on available information, it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized then a valuation allowance must be established with
a corresponding charge to net income. Such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.

Changes in our discount rate, expected rate of return and expected compensation increase assumptions for our pension and other postretirement benefit
plans may result in increased expenses and reduce our profitability.

We determine our pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs based on assumed discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and expected increases in compensation levels and trends in
health care costs. Changes in these assumptions, including from the impact of a sustained low interest rate environment, may result in increased expenses and reduce our profitability.



Our valuation of fixed maturity, equity and trading securities may include methodologies, estimations and
assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.

During periods of market disruption, it may be difficult to
value certain of our securities, such as sub-prime mortgage-backed securities, if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be cases where certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant
observable data become inactive or for which data becomes unobservable due to the current financial environment or market conditions. As a result, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation
and judgment as well as valuation methods which are more complex. These values may not be ultimately realizable in a market transaction, and such values may change very rapidly as market conditions change and valuation assumptions are modified.
Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

The decision on whether to record an other-than-temporary impairment or write-down is determined in part by management’s assessment
of the financial condition and prospects of a particular issuer, projections of future cash flows and recoverability of the particular security. Management’s conclusions on such assessments are highly judgmental and include assumptions and
projections of future cash flows which may ultimately prove to be incorrect as assumptions, facts and circumstances change.

For a discussion of certain fixed maturity securities where the estimated fair value has declined and remained below amortized cost by 20%
or more, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—Unrealized Losses from Fixed Maturity Securities.”

We may not be able to mitigate the reserve strain associated
with Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX, potentially resulting in a negative impact on our capital position or in a need to increase prices and/or reduce sales of term or universal life products.

The states of domicile of our domestic insurance
subsidiaries have in place a regulation entitled “Valuation of Life Insurance Policies,” commonly known as “Regulation XXX,” and a supporting Guideline entitled “The Application of the Valuation of Life Insurance
Policies,” commonly known as “Guideline AXXX.” The Regulation and supporting Guideline require insurers to establish statutory reserves for term and universal life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees that are
consistent with the statutory reserves required for other individual life insurance policies with similar guarantees. Many market participants believe that this level of reserves is excessive, and we have implemented reinsurance and capital
management actions to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX on our term and universal life insurance business. As we continue to underwrite term and universal life business, we expect to have borrowing needs to finance statutory
reserves required under Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX. Based on current sales expectations, we believe our 2011 reserve growth could be up to $600 million. We are evaluating both internal and external solutions to fund this growth. If we are
unsuccessful in executing these solutions as a result of market conditions or otherwise, this could require us to increase prices and or/reduce our sales of term or universal life products and/or have a negative impact on our capital position.

We have substantial international operations and our
international operations face political, legal, operational and other risks that could adversely affect those operations or our profitability.

A substantial portion of our revenues and income from continuing operations is derived from our operations outside the U.S., primarily
Japan and Korea. These operations are subject to restrictions on transferring funds out of the countries in which these operations are located. Some of our foreign insurance and investment management operations are, and are likely to continue to be,
in emerging markets where this risk as well as risks of discriminatory regulation, labor issues in connection with workers’ associations and trade unions, price controls, currency exchange controls, nationalization or expropriation of assets,
are heightened. If our business model is not successful in a particular country, we may lose all or most of our investment in building and training our sales force in that country.



Many of our insurance products sold in international markets provide for the buildup of cash
values for the policyholder at contractually fixed guaranteed interest rates, including in Japan. Actual returns on the underlying investments do not necessarily match the guaranteed interest rates and there may be times when the spread between the
actual investment returns and these guaranteed rates of return to the policyholder is negative and in which this negative spread may not be offset by the mortality, morbidity and expense charges we earn on the products.

Our international businesses are subject to the tax laws and
regulations of the countries in which they are organized and in which they operate. Foreign governments from time to time consider legislation that could increase the amount of taxes that we pay or impact the sales of our products.

Our international operations are regulated in the
jurisdictions in which they are located or operate. These regulations may apply heightened scrutiny to non-domestic companies, which can reduce our flexibility as to intercompany transactions, investments and other aspects of business operations and
adversely affect our liquidity, profitability, and regulatory capital.

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our profitability and cash flow.

As a U.S.-based company with significant business operations outside the U.S., particularly in Japan, we are exposed to foreign currency
exchange risks that could reduce U.S. dollar equivalent earnings and equity of these operations as well as negatively impact our general account and other proprietary investment portfolios. We seek to mitigate these risks by employing various
hedging strategies including entering into derivative contracts and holding U.S. dollar denominated assets within our Japanese subsidiaries. Currency fluctuations, including the effect of changes in the value of U.S. dollar investments that vary
from the amounts ultimately needed to hedge our exposure to changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent of earnings and equity of these operations, may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Additionally, U.S.
dollar denominated investments held in our Japanese subsidiaries could result, in the event of a significant strengthening of the yen, in additional liquidity or capital needs for our International Insurance operations.

Intense competition, including the impact of government sponsored programs
and other actions on us and our competitors, could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability.

In each of our businesses we face intense competition from domestic and foreign insurance companies, asset managers and diversified
financial institutions, both for the ultimate customers for our products and, in many businesses, for distribution through non-affiliated distribution channels. We compete based on a number of factors including brand recognition, reputation, quality
of service, quality of investment advice, investment performance of our products, product features, scope of distribution and distribution arrangements, price, perceived financial strength and claims-paying and credit ratings. A decline in our
competitive position as to one or more of these factors could adversely affect our profitability and assets under management. Many of our competitors are large and well-established and some have greater market share or breadth of distribution, offer
a broader range of products, services or features, assume a greater level of risk, have lower profitability expectations or have higher claims-paying or credit ratings than we do. The proliferation and growth of non-affiliated distribution channels
puts pressure on our captive sales channels to increase their productivity and reduce their costs in order to remain competitive, and we run the risk that the marketplace will make a more significant or rapid shift to non-affiliated or direct
distribution alternatives than we anticipate or are able to achieve ourselves, potentially adversely affecting our market share and results of operations. In certain countries in which we operate internationally, we face competition from government
owned entities that benefit from pricing or other competitive advantages. The competitive landscape in which we operate may be further affected by the government sponsored programs in the U.S. and similar governmental actions outside of the U.S. in
response to the dislocations in financial markets. Competitors that receive governmental financing or other assistance or subsidies, including governmental guarantees of their obligations, or that are not subject to the same regulatory constraints,
may have or obtain pricing or other competitive advantages.

Competition for personnel in all of our businesses is intense, including for executive officers and management personnel, Prudential Agents, Life Planners, Life Advisors and other sales personnel, and our
investment managers. We devote significant efforts to talent management and development and are subject to the



risk that executive, management and other personnel will be hired or recruited by competitors. Competition for desirable non-affiliated distribution channels is also intense. The loss of key
personnel or non-affiliated distribution channels could have an adverse effect on our business and profitability.

We may experience difficulty in marketing and distributing products through our current and future distribution channels.

Although we distribute our products through a wide variety
of distribution channels, we do maintain relationships with certain key distributors. For example, a significant amount of our sales in Japan through banks is derived through a single Japanese mega-bank and a significant portion of our sales in
Japan through Life Advisors is derived through a single association relationship. We recently initiated a distribution relationship with a second large Japanese bank and will continue to explore other opportunities to expand our distribution
capabilities through the bank channel, as well as other complementary distribution channels. We periodically negotiate the terms of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third
parties. An interruption in certain key relationships could materially affect our ability to market our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Distributors may elect to reduce or
terminate their distribution relationships with us, including for such reasons as adverse developments in our business, adverse rating agency actions or concerns about market-related risks. We are also at risk that key distribution partners may
merge, change their business models in ways that affect how our products are sold, or terminate their distribution contracts with us. An increase in bank and broker-dealer consolidation activity could increase competition for access to distributors,
result in greater distribution expenses and impair our ability to market products through these channels. Consolidation of distributors and/or other industry changes may also increase the likelihood that distributors will try to renegotiate the
terms of any existing selling agreements to terms less favorable to us.

When our products are distributed through unaffiliated firms, we may not be able to monitor or control the manner of their distribution despite our training and compliance programs. If our products are
distributed by such firms in an inappropriate manner, or to customers for whom they are unsuitable, we may suffer reputational and other harms to our business.

Our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability.

Our businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and
supervision. The purpose of this regulation is primarily to protect our customers and not necessarily our shareholders. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject, including those to which our international businesses are subject, are
regularly re-examined, and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations. The financial market dislocations we have experienced have produced, and are expected to continue to
produce, extensive changes in existing laws and regulations, and regulatory frameworks, applicable to our businesses in the U.S. and internationally.

Prudential Financial is subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE relating to public reporting and disclosure,
securities trading, accounting and financial reporting, and corporate governance matters. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules and regulations adopted in furtherance of that Act have substantially increased the requirements in these and other
areas for public companies such as Prudential Financial.

Many insurance regulatory and other governmental or self-regulatory bodies have the authority to review our products and business practices and those of our agents and employees and to bring regulatory or
other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our agents or employees, are improper. These actions can result in substantial fines, penalties or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could
adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations or financial condition. For a discussion of material pending litigation and regulatory matters, see “Commitments and Guarantees, Contingent Liabilities and Litigation and
Regulatory Matters” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Congress from time to time considers pension reform legislation that could decrease the attractiveness of certain of our retirement
products and services to retirement plan sponsors and administrators, or have an



unfavorable effect on our ability to earn revenues from these products and services. In this regard, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (“PPA”) made significant changes in employer
pension funding obligations associated with defined benefit pension plans which are likely to increase sponsors’ costs of maintaining these plans. Over time, these changes could hinder our sales of defined benefit pension products and services
and cause sponsors to discontinue existing plans for which we provide asset management, administrative, or other services, but could increase the attractiveness of certain group annuity products we offer in connection with terminating pension plans.
Certain tax-favored savings initiatives that have been proposed could hinder sales and persistency of our products and services that support employment based retirement plans

Insurance regulators have begun to implement significant
changes in the way in which industry participants must determine statutory reserves and statutory capital, particularly for products with embedded options and guarantees such as variable annuities, and are considering further potentially significant
changes in these requirements. Regulatory capital requirements based on scenario testing have already gone into effect for variable annuity and certain fixed annuity products and products with similar features, and new reserving requirements for
these products were implemented as of the end of 2009. The timing and extent of further changes to the statutory reporting framework are uncertain.

Currently, there are several proposals to amend state insurance holding company laws to increase the scope of the regulation of insurance
holding companies (such as Prudential Financial). These proposals include imposing standards for insurer corporate governance, group-wide supervision of insurance holding companies, adjustments to risk-based capital calculations to account for
group-wide risks, and additional regulatory and disclosure requirements for insurance holding companies. In addition, state insurance regulators have focused attention on U.S. insurance solvency regulation pursuant to the NAIC’s “Solvency
Modernization Initiative.” At this time, we cannot predict with any degree of certainty what additional capital requirements, compliance costs or other burdens these requirements may impose on Prudential Financial.

The Financial Services Agency, the insurance regulator in
Japan, has implemented revisions to the solvency margin requirements that will revise risk charges for certain assets and change the manner in which an insurance company’s core capital is calculated. These changes are effective for the fiscal
year ending March 31, 2012; however, it is anticipated that companies may begin to publicly disclose prior to that date both the old and new solvency margin calculations. While we believe that the solvency margins of our Japanese insurance
subsidiaries would continue to satisfy regulatory requirements and our internal targets, it is possible that a reduction in our reported ratios arising from changes in the calculation requirements could affect customer perception of our financial
strength. The capital requirements in Korea and Taiwan are also undergoing change.

Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance and other
expenses of doing business, thus having a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

See “Business—Regulation” for further discussion of the impact of regulations on our businesses.

The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act will subject us to substantial additional federal regulation and we cannot predict the effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”), which effects comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the United States and subjects us to substantial additional federal regulation.
Dodd-Frank directs existing and newly-created government agencies and bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law, a process anticipated to occur over the next few years. We cannot predict with any certainty the requirements of the
regulations ultimately adopted or how Dodd-Frank and such regulations will affect the financial markets generally, impact our business, credit or financial strength ratings, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition or advise or
require us to hold or raise additional capital. Key aspects we have identified to date of Dodd-Frank’s potential impact on us include:

•

Prudential Financial will become subject, as a savings and loan holding company, to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
(“FRB”), which will have authority, among other



powers, to impose capital requirements on the Company. We cannot predict what capital regulations the FRB will promulgate or how the FRB will exercise general supervisory authority over us.

•

If designated by the newly established Financial Stability Oversight Council (“Council”) as a systemically significant company, we would
become subject to unspecified stricter prudential standards, including stricter requirements and limitations relating to risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity and credit exposure, as well as overall risk management requirements, management
interlock prohibitions and a requirement to maintain a plan for rapid and orderly dissolution in the event of severe financial distress. Failure to meet defined measures of financial condition could result in substantial restrictions on our
business. We cannot predict whether Prudential Financial or a subsidiary will be so designated.

•

We will become subject, as a savings and loan holding company (and if designated as a systemically significant company) to stress tests to be
promulgated by the FRB which could cause us to alter our business practices or affect the perceptions of regulators, rating agencies, customers, counterparties or investors of our financial strength.

•

The Council could recommend new or heightened standards and safeguards for activities or practices we and other financial services companies engage in.
We cannot predict whether any such recommendations will be made or their effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

•

As a savings and loan holding company, we will become subject to the “Volcker Rule” provisions of Dodd-Frank prohibiting, subject to the
rule’s exceptions, “proprietary trading” and the sponsorship of, and investment in, funds (referred to in Dodd-Frank as hedge funds or private equity funds) that rely on certain exemptions from the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (collectively, “covered funds”). It is possible that regulations could require us to dispose of covered fund investments, significantly alter our business practices in these operations and/or diminish the attractiveness of our
covered fund products to clients. In addition, actions taken by other financial entities in response to the Volcker Rule could potentially negatively affect the market for, returns from or liquidity of our investments in covered funds affiliated
with such other financial entities.

•

Dodd-Frank creates a new framework for regulation of the over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives markets which could impact various activities
of Prudential Global Funding (“PGF”), Prudential Financial and our insurance subsidiaries, which use derivatives for various purposes (including hedging interest rate, foreign currency and equity market exposures). Final regulations
adopted could substantially increase the cost of hedging and related operations, affect the profitability of our products or their attractiveness to our clients or cause us to alter our hedging strategy or implementation thereof or increase and/or
change the composition of the risks we do not hedge.

•

Dodd-Frank establishes a Federal Insurance Office within the Department of the Treasury which will perform various functions with respect to insurance
and will conduct a study on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the United States, including by increased national uniformity through either a federal charter or effective action by the states.

•

The FRB could require us to legally separate our financial and non-financial activities. While our non-financial activities are relatively minor, the
imposition of such a requirement on us could be burdensome and costly to implement.

•

Title II of Dodd-Frank provides that a financial company such as Prudential Financial may be subject to a special orderly liquidation process outside
the federal bankruptcy code, administered by the FDIC as receiver, upon a determination that the company is in default or in danger of default and presents a systemic risk to U.S. financial stability. We cannot predict how creditors of Prudential
Financial or its insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries, including the holders of Prudential Financial debt, will evaluate this potential or whether it will impact our financing or hedging costs.

•

Dodd-Frank includes various securities law reforms that may affect our business practices and the liabilities and/or exposures associated therewith.

•

Dodd-Frank will and could impose various assessments on us, which we are unable to estimate at this time.

See “Business—Regulation” for further
discussion of the impact of Dodd-Frank on our businesses.



Foreign governmental actions in response to the recent financial crisis could subject us to substantial
additional regulation.

In addition to the
adoption of Dodd-Frank in the United States, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), consisting of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations, and the G20 have issued a series of papers and recommendations intended to produce
significant changes in how financial companies, particularly companies that are members of large and complex financial groups, should be regulated. The lawmakers and regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions in which we do business have
already begun introducing legislative and regulatory changes consistent with G20 and FSB recommendations, including proposals governing consolidated regulation of insurance holdings companies by the Financial Services Agency (FSA) in Japan,
proposals governing executive compensation by the financial regulators in Germany (BaFIN) and the United Kingdom (FSA), and proposals to permit U.S.-style class action litigation in the United Kingdom with respect to financial services claims. In
addition, the prudential regulation of insurance and reinsurance companies across the European Economic Area (EEA) is due for significant change under the Solvency II Directive, which was adopted on November 25, 2009 and is expected to come
into force in January 2013. This new regime will effect a full revision of the insurance industry’s solvency framework and prudential regime and may have significant implications for non-European insurance groups, like ourselves, that have
established insurance undertakings (whether branches or subsidiaries) within the EEA.

We cannot predict with any certainty the effect these initiatives may have on the financial markets or on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Changes in accounting requirements could negatively impact our reported
results of operations and our reported financial position.

Accounting standards are continuously evolving and subject to change. For example, it has been proposed that companies like Prudential Financial be required to report financial results in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board rather than U.S. GAAP. Regardless of whether the SEC requires IFRS, it is expected that U.S. GAAP will undergo extensive changes
as a result of current standard setting initiatives of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. These and other changes in accounting standards may impose special demands on issuers in areas such as corporate governance, internal controls and
disclosure. Changes in accounting standards, or their interpretation, may negatively effect our reported results of operations and our reported financial condition.

Changes in U.S. federal income tax law or in the income tax laws of other
jurisdictions in which we operate could make some of our products less attractive to consumers and increase our tax costs.

Current U.S. federal income tax laws generally permit certain holders to defer taxation on the build-up of value of annuities and life
insurance products until payments are actually made to the policyholder or other beneficiary and to exclude from taxation the death benefit paid under a life insurance contract. Congress from time to time considers legislation that could make our
products less attractive to consumers, including legislation that would reduce or eliminate the benefit of this deferral on some annuities and insurance products, such as a reduction in income tax rates, as well as other types of changes that could
reduce or eliminate the attractiveness of annuities and life insurance products to consumers, such as changes to the estate tax. Tax laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions also impact the relative attractiveness of our products.

For example, the estate tax was completely eliminated for
2010, but modified carryover basis rules applied for property acquired from decedent’s dying in that year. The estate tax has been reinstated through 2012 with a $5 million individual exemption, a 35% maximum rate and step-up in basis rules for
property acquired from a decedent. Estates of decedents who died in 2010 can choose between the rules that were in effect in 2010 or the new rules. It is unclear what Congress will do with respect to the estate tax after 2012. This uncertainty makes
estate planning difficult and may impact sales of our products.

Congress, as well as state and local governments, also considers from time to time legislation that could increase the amount of corporate taxes we pay. For example, changes in the law relating to tax
reserving methodologies for term life or universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees or other products could result in higher current taxes.



The U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service have indicated that they
intend to address through regulations the methodology to be followed in determining the dividends received deduction, or DRD, related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts. The DRD reduces the amount of dividend income subject to tax and
is a significant component of the difference between our actual tax expense and the expected tax amount determined using the federal statutory tax rate of 35%. A change in the DRD, including the possible retroactive or prospective elimination of
this deduction through regulations or legislation, could increase our actual tax expense and reduce our consolidated net income.

On February 14, 2011, the Obama Administration released the “General Explanations of the Administration’s Revenue
Proposals,” or Revenue Proposals. Although the Administration has not released proposed statutory language, the Revenue Proposals include proposals which, if enacted, would affect the taxation of life insurance companies and certain life
insurance products. In particular, the proposals would affect the treatment of corporate owned life insurance policies, or COLI, by limiting the availability of certain interest deductions for companies that purchase those policies. The proposals
would also change the method used to determine the amount of dividend income received by a life insurance company on assets held in separate accounts used to support products, including variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts that are
eligible for the DRD. If proposals of this type were enacted, the Company’s sale of COLI, variable annuities, and variable life insurance products could be adversely affected and the Company’s actual tax expense could increase, thereby
reducing earnings.

The Revenue Proposals also
includes proposals that would change the method by which multinational corporations could claim credits for the foreign taxes they pay and that would change the timing of the deduction for interest expense that is allocable to foreign-source income.
More specifically, it is likely that the proposals would impose additional restrictions on the Company’s ability to claim foreign tax credits on un-repatriated earnings. The proposals would also require U.S. multinationals to defer the
deduction for interest expense that is allocable to foreign source income until that income is subject to U.S. tax. Unused deductions would be carried forward to future years. If proposals of this type were enacted, the Company’s actual tax
expense could increase, thereby reducing earnings.

There is generally uncertainty regarding U.S. taxes both for individuals and corporations in light of the fact that many tax provisions
recently enacted or extended will sunset by the end of 2012. In addition, the recommendations made by the President’s bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform and other deficit reduction panels suggest the need to
reform the U.S. Tax Code. In addition, Congress plans to hold a number of hearings during 2011 devoted to tax reform. It is unclear whether or when Congress may take up overall tax reform and what would be the impact of reform on the Company and its
products. However even in the absence of overall tax reform, the large federal deficit, as well as the budget constraints faced by many states and localities, increases the likelihood that Congress and state and local governments will raise revenue
by enacting legislation increasing the taxes paid by individuals and corporations. This can be accomplished either by raising rates or otherwise changing the tax rules. While higher tax rates increase the benefits of tax deferral on the build-up of
value of annuities and life insurance, making our products more attractive to consumers, legislation that reduces or eliminates deferral would have a potential negative effect on our products. In addition, changes in the tax rules that result in
higher corporate taxes will increase the Company’s actual tax expense, thereby reducing earnings.

The products we sell have different tax characteristics, in some cases generating tax deductions. The level of profitability of certain of
our products is significantly dependent on these characteristics and our ability to continue to generate taxable income, which is taken into consideration when pricing products and is a component of our capital management strategies. Accordingly,
changes in tax law, our ability to generate taxable income, or other factors impacting the availability or value of the tax characteristics generated by our products, could impact product pricing and returns or require us to reduce our sales of
these products or implement other actions that could be disruptive to our businesses.

Legal and regulatory actions are inherent in our businesses and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial position or harm our businesses or reputation.

We are, and in the future may be, subject to legal and
regulatory actions in the ordinary course of our businesses, including in businesses that we have divested or placed in wind-down status. Some of these



proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants. In certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive
or exemplary damages. Legal liability or adverse publicity in respect of these or future legal or regulatory actions could have an adverse affect on us or cause us reputational harm, which in turn could harm our business prospects.

Material pending litigation and regulatory matters affecting
us, and certain risks to our businesses presented by such matters, are discussed under “Commitments and Guarantees, Contingent Liabilities and Litigation and Regulatory Matters” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our litigation and regulatory matters are subject to many uncertainties, and given their complexity and scope, their outcome cannot be predicted. Our reserves for litigation and regulatory matters may prove to be
inadequate. It is possible that our results of operations or cash flow in a particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of pending litigation and regulatory matters depending, in part,
upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period. In light of the unpredictability of the Company’s litigation and regulatory matters, it is also possible that in certain cases an ultimate unfavorable resolution of one or more
pending litigation or regulatory matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position.

We may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims.

We rely on a combination of contractual rights with third
parties and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. Although we endeavor to protect our rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. We may have to
litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability. This would represent a diversion of resources that may be significant and our efforts may not
prove successful. The inability to secure or protect our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete.

We may be subject to claims by third parties for
(i) patent, trademark or copyright infringement, (ii) breach of copyright, trademark or license usage rights, or (iii) misappropriation of trade secrets. Any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant expense
and liability for damages. If we were found to have infringed or misappropriated a third-party patent or other intellectual property right, we could in some circumstances be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or
from utilizing and benefiting from certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses. Alternatively, we could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties or implement a costly work around.
Any of these scenarios could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

The occurrence of natural disasters, including hurricanes,
floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, fires, explosions, pandemic disease and man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism and military actions, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition, including in the following
respects:

•

Catastrophic loss of life due to natural or man-made disasters could cause us to pay benefits at higher levels and/or materially earlier than
anticipated and could lead to unexpected changes in persistency rates.

•

A natural or man-made disaster could result in losses in our investment portfolio or the failure of our counterparties to perform, or cause significant
volatility in global financial markets.

•

A terrorist attack affecting financial institutions in the United States or elsewhere could negatively impact the financial services industry in
general and our business operations, investment portfolio and profitability in particular. In August 2004, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security identified our Newark, New Jersey facilities, along with those of several other financial
institutions in New York and Washington, D.C., as possible targets of a terrorist attack.

•

Pandemic disease, caused by a virus such as H5N1, the “avian flu” virus, or H1N1, the “swine flu” virus, could have a severe
adverse effect on Prudential Financial’s business. The potential impact of such a



pandemic on Prudential Financial’s results of operations and financial position is highly speculative, and would depend on numerous factors, including: in the case of the avian flu virus,
the probability of the virus mutating to a form that can be passed easily from human to human; the effectiveness of vaccines and the rate of contagion; the regions of the world most affected; the effectiveness of treatment for the infected
population; the rates of mortality and morbidity among various segments of the insured versus the uninsured population; the collectability of reinsurance; the possible macroeconomic effects of a pandemic on the Company’s asset portfolio; the
effect on lapses and surrenders of existing policies, as well as sales of new policies; and many other variables.

There can be no assurance that our business continuation plans and insurance coverages would be effective in mitigating any negative
effects on our operations or profitability in the event of a terrorist attack or other disaster.

Climate change, and its regulation, may affect the prospects of companies and other entities whose securities we hold and other counterparties, including reinsurers, and affect the value of investments,
including real estate investments we hold or manage for others. Our current evaluation is that the near term effects of climate change and climate change regulation on the Company are not material, but we cannot predict the long term impacts on us
from climate change or its regulation.

Our risk management
policies and procedures and our minority investments in joint ventures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could adversely affect our businesses or result in losses.

Our policies, procedures and controls to monitor and manage
risks, including hedging programs that utilize derivative financial instruments, may not be fully effective in achieving their purposes and may leave us exposed to unidentified and unanticipated risks. The Company uses models in its hedging programs
and many other aspects of its operations, including but not limited to the estimation of actuarial reserves, the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and the valuation of business acquired, and the valuation of certain other assets and
liabilities. These models rely on assumptions and projections that are inherently uncertain. Management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies, procedures and controls to record properly and verify a large
number of transactions and events, and these policies, procedures and controls may not be fully effective.

Past or future misconduct by our employees or employees of our vendors could result in violations of law by us, regulatory sanctions
and/or serious reputational or financial harm and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Although we employ controls and procedures designed to monitor associates’ business decisions and
prevent us from taking excessive or inappropriate risks, there can be no assurance that these controls and procedures are or may be effective. We review our compensation policies and practices as part of our overall risk management program, but it
is possible that our compensation policies and practices could inadvertently incentivize excessive or inappropriate risk taking. If our associates take excessive or inappropriate risks, those risks could harm our reputation and have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

In our investments in which we hold a minority interest, we lack management and operational control over operations, which may prevent us from taking or causing to be taken actions to protect or increase
the value of those investments. In those jurisdictions where we are constrained by law from owning a majority interest in jointly owned operations, our remedies in the event of a breach by a joint venture partner may be limited (e.g., we may have no
ability to exercise a “call” option).

Interruption
in telecommunication, information technology and other operational systems, or a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems, could harm our business.

We depend heavily on our telecommunication, information
technology and other operational systems and on the integrity and timeliness of data we use to run our businesses and service our customers. These systems may



fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events or circumstances wholly or partly beyond our control. Further, we face the risk of operational and technology failures by others,
including clearing agents, exchanges and other financial intermediaries and of vendors and parties to which we outsource the provision of services or business operations. If these parties do not perform as anticipated, we may experience operational
difficulties, increased costs and other adverse effects on our business. These risks are heightened by our offering of increasingly complex products, such as those that feature automatic asset transfer or re-allocation strategies, and by our
employment of complex investment, trading and hedging programs.

Despite our implementation of a variety of security measures, our information technology and other systems could be subject to physical or electronic break-ins, unauthorized tampering or other security
breaches, resulting in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information relating to customers.

Interruption in telecommunication, information technology and other operational systems, or a failure to maintain the security,
confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems, whether due to actions by us or others, could delay or disrupt our ability to do business and service our customers, harm our reputation, subject us to regulatory sanctions and
other claims, lead to a loss of customers and revenues and otherwise adversely affect our business.

We face risks arising from acquisitions, divestitures and restructurings, including client losses, surrenders and withdrawals, difficulties in integrating and realizing the projected results of
acquisitions and contingent liabilities with respect to dispositions.

We face a number of risks arising from acquisition transactions, including the risk that, following the acquisition or reorganization of a business, we could experience client losses, surrenders or
withdrawals or other results materially different from those we anticipate, as well as difficulties in integrating and realizing the projected results of acquisitions and restructurings and managing the litigation and regulatory matters to which
acquired entities are party. We have retained insurance or reinsurance obligations and other contingent liabilities in connection with our divestiture or winding down of various businesses, and our reserves for these obligations and liabilities may
prove to be inadequate. These risks may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.

We are subject to risks relating to the acquisition, and post-acquisition operations, of the Star and Edison businesses in Japan.

On February 1, 2011, we completed the acquisition from American International Group, Inc.
(“AIG”) of AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (“Star”) and AIG Edison Life Insurance Company (“Edison”) and certain other AIG subsidiaries in Japan (the “Acquisition”). For a description of the acquired
businesses (collectively, the “Star and Edison Businesses”) and the Acquisition, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under “Results of Operations for Financial
Services Businesses by Segment—International Insurance and Investments Division” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources.” We are subject to certain risks relating to the Acquisition and the Star and Edison Businesses, which risks
could adversely affect, possibly materially, our business, results of operations, financial position or liquidity or prevent us from realizing the expected benefits from the Acquisition. These risks include the following:

•

We may experience difficulties in integrating the Star and Edison Businesses and the process of integration may take longer than expected. Our ability
to achieve the benefits we anticipate from the Acquisition will depend upon whether we are able to integrate the Star and Edison Businesses into our existing Japanese business in an efficient and effective manner. The integration of certain
operations will require the dedication of significant management resources over a long period, which may distract management’s attention from day-to-day business operations.

•

We expect to incur significant one-time costs in connection with the Acquisition and the related integration of the Star and Edison Businesses. The
costs and liabilities actually incurred in connection with the Acquisition and subsequent integration process may exceed those anticipated. We may not realize cost savings, efficiencies or synergies that we anticipate.



•

We intend to reposition the existing investment portfolios of the Star and Edison Businesses to reflect our desired lower risk profile, including a
re-allocation among investment asset classes. The terms at which this repositioning is implemented are dependent on market conditions, including the level of interest rates, and such repositioning may lower yields and net investment income relative
to our expectations. We may not be successful in carrying out this repositioning as intended, or we may experience delays in effecting the repositioning, in which case the portfolios may be subject to a level of investment risk that is greater than
we plan or believe to be optimal.

•

There is the risk that we will be exposed to obligations and liabilities of Star and Edison that are not adequately covered, in amount, scope or
duration, by the indemnification provisions in the stock purchase agreement or reflected or reserved for in the historical financial statements of the Star and Edison Businesses, and there is the risk that such historical financial statements may
contain errors.

•

The publicized financial difficulties involving AIG have negatively affected the Star and Edison Businesses. Any perception of additional instability
surrounding AIG or other events relating to AIG may adversely impact the reputation of the Star and Edison Businesses or of the Company and adversely affect the ability of the Star and Edison Businesses to retain employees, customers and
distributors. Furthermore, following the completion of the Acquisition, the Star and Edison Businesses will continue to have relationships with and rely upon AIG, including for the receipt of transition services.

The Star and Edison Businesses are also subject to many of
the other risks described in this section to which our existing businesses, particularly those in Japan, are subject, including but not limited to risks associated with economic, market and political conditions, capital and liquidity, foreign
exchange fluctuations and regulatory and legal matters.

Regulatory requirements, provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and our shareholder rights plan could delay, deter or prevent a
takeover attempt that shareholders might consider in their best interests.

Various states in which our insurance companies are domiciled, including New Jersey, must approve any direct or indirect change of control of insurance companies organized in those states. Under most
states’ statutes, an entity is presumed to have control of an insurance company if it owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting stock of that insurance company or its parent company. Federal, and in some cases, state, banking
authorities would also have to approve the indirect change of control of our banking operations. The federal securities laws could also require reapproval by customers of our investment advisory contracts to manage mutual funds, including mutual
funds included in annuity products, upon a change in control. In addition, the New Jersey Business Corporation Act prohibits certain business combinations with interested shareholders. These regulatory and other restrictions may delay a potential
merger or sale of Prudential Financial, even if the Board of Directors decides that it is in the best interests of shareholders to merge or be sold.

Prudential Financial’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws also contain provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a takeover
attempt that shareholders might consider in their best interests. These provisions may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Common Stock and include: a restriction on the filling of vacancies on the Board of Directors by shareholders;
restrictions on the calling of special meetings by shareholders; a requirement that shareholders may take action without a meeting only by unanimous written consent; advance notice procedures for the nomination of candidates to the Board of
Directors and shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholder meetings; and supermajority voting requirements for the amendment of certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws. Prudential Financial’s shareholders
rights plan also creates obstacles that may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider in their best interests.



Holders of our Common Stock are subject to risks due to the issuance of our Class B Stock, a second class
of common stock.

The businesses of
Prudential Financial are separated into the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, and our Common Stock reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Class B Stock reflects the performance of the Closed
Block Business. There are a number of risks to holders of our Common Stock by virtue of this dual common stock structure, including:

•

Even though we allocate all our consolidated assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flow between the Financial Services Businesses and the
Closed Block Business for financial statement purposes, there is no legal separation between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. Holders of Common Stock have no interest in a separate legal entity representing the
Financial Services Businesses; holders of the Class B Stock have no interest in a separate legal entity representing the Closed Block Business; and therefore holders of each class of common stock are subject to all of the risks associated with an
investment in the Company.

•

The financial results of the Closed Block Business, including debt service on the IHC debt, will affect Prudential Financial’s consolidated
results of operations, financial position and borrowing costs.

•

The market value of our Common Stock may not reflect solely the performance of the Financial Services Businesses.

•

We cannot pay cash dividends on our Common Stock for any period if we choose not to pay dividends on the Class B Stock in an aggregate amount at least
equal to the lesser of the CB Distributable Cash Flow or the Target Dividend Amount on the Class B Stock for that period. See “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity
Securities—Convertibility” for the definition of these terms. Any net losses of the Closed Block Business, and any dividends or distributions on, or repurchases of the Class B Stock, would reduce the assets of Prudential Financial legally
available for dividends on the Common Stock.

•

Net income for the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business includes general and administrative expenses charged to each of the
respective Businesses based on the Company’s methodology for the allocation of such expenses. Cash flows to the Financial Services Businesses from the Closed Block Business related to administrative expenses are determined by a policy servicing
fee arrangement that is based upon insurance and policies in force and statutory cash premiums. The difference between the administrative expenses allocated to the Closed Block Business and these cash flow amounts are recorded, on an after tax
basis, as direct equity adjustments to the equity balances of the businesses and included in the determination of earnings per share for each Business. A change in cash flow amounts between the Businesses that is inconsistent with changes in general
and administrative expenses we incur will affect the earnings per share of the Common Stock and Class B Stock.

•

Holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock vote together as a single class of common stock under New Jersey law, except as otherwise required by law and
except that the holders of the Class B Stock have class voting or consent rights with respect to specified matters directly affecting the Class B Stock.

•

Shares of Class B Stock are entitled to a higher proportionate amount upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Prudential Financial, than
shares of Common Stock.

•

We may exchange the Class B Stock for shares of Common Stock at any time, and the Class B Stock is mandatorily exchangeable in the event of a sale of
all or substantially all of the Closed Block Business or a “change of control” of Prudential Financial. Under these circumstances, shares of Class B Stock would be exchanged for shares of Common Stock with an aggregate average market value
equal to 120% of the then appraised “Fair Market Value” of the Class B Stock. For a description of “change of control” and “Fair Market Value,” see “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder
Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—Convertibility.” Holders of Class B Stock may at their discretion, beginning in 2016, and at any time in the event of specified regulatory events, convert their shares of Class B Stock into
shares of Common Stock with an aggregate average market value equal to 100% of the then appraised Fair Market Value of the Class B Stock. Any exchange or conversion could occur at a time when either or both of the Common Stock and Class B Stock may
be considered overvalued or undervalued. Accordingly, any such exchange or conversion may be disadvantageous to holders of Common Stock.



•

Our Board of Directors has adopted certain policies regarding inter-business transfers and accounting and tax matters, including the allocation of
earnings, with respect to the Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business. Although the Board of Directors may change any of these policies, any such decision is subject to the Board of Directors’ general fiduciary duties, and we
have agreed with investors in the Class B Stock and the insurer of the IHC debt that, in most cases, the Board of Directors may not change these policies without their consent.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

We own our headquarters building located at 751 Broad Street, Newark, New Jersey, which comprises approximately 0.6 million square
feet. Excluding our headquarters building and properties used by the International Insurance and Investments division and Asset Management segment, which are discussed below,



we own eight and lease 10 other principal properties throughout the U.S., some of which are used for home office functions. Our domestic operations also lease approximately 210 other locations
throughout the U.S.

For our International
Insurance segment, we own five home offices located in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Brazil and Argentina, and lease five home offices located in China, Italy, Mexico, India and Poland. We also own approximately 170 and lease approximately 440 other
properties, primarily field offices, located throughout these same countries. For our International Investments segment, we own one head office and lease approximately 20 other properties, primarily field and branch offices throughout India, Taiwan,
Hong Kong, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom. For our Asset Management segment, we lease nine international principal properties located in Brazil, Mexico, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Germany and the United Kingdom, in addition to approximately
10 other branch offices within Europe and Asia.

We believe our properties are adequate and suitable for our business as currently conducted and are adequately maintained. The above
properties do not include properties we own for investment only.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are subject to legal and regulatory actions in the ordinary course of our businesses, including class action lawsuits. Our pending
legal and regulatory actions include proceedings specific to us and proceedings generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which we operate, including in both cases businesses that have either been divested or placed in
wind-down status. In our insurance operations, we are subject to class action lawsuits and individual lawsuits involving a variety of issues, including sales practices, underwriting practices, claims payment and procedures, additional premium
charges for premiums paid on a periodic basis, denial or delay of benefits, return of premiums or excessive premium charges and breaching fiduciary duties to customers. In our investment-related operations, we are subject to litigation involving
commercial disputes with counterparties or partners and class action lawsuits and other litigation alleging, among other things, that we made improper or inadequate disclosures in connection with the sale of assets and annuity and investment
products or charged excessive or impermissible fees on these products, recommended unsuitable products to customers, mishandled customer accounts or breached fiduciary duties to customers. In our securities operations, we are subject to class action
lawsuits, arbitrations and other actions arising out of our former retail securities brokerage, account management, underwriting, former investment banking and other activities, including claims of improper or inadequate disclosure regarding
investments or charges, recommending investments or products that were unsuitable for tax advantaged accounts, assessing impermissible fees or charges, engaging in excessive or unauthorized trading, making improper underwriting allocations,
breaching alleged duties to non-customer third parties and breaching fiduciary duties to customers. We may be a defendant in, or be contractually responsible to third parties for, class action lawsuits and individual litigation arising from our
other operations, including claims for breach of contract. We are also subject to litigation arising out of our general business activities, such as our investments, contracts, leases and labor and employment relationships, including claims of
discrimination and harassment and could be exposed to claims or litigation concerning certain business or process patents. Regulatory authorities from time to time make inquiries and conduct investigations and examinations relating particularly to
us and our businesses and products. In addition, we, along with other participants in the businesses in which we engage, may be subject from time to time to investigations, examinations and inquiries, in some cases industry-wide, concerning issues
or matters upon which such regulators have determined to focus. In some of our pending legal and regulatory actions, parties are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. The outcome of a litigation or
regulatory matter, and the amount or range of potential loss at any particular time, is often inherently uncertain.

Material pending litigation and regulatory matters affecting us, and certain risks to our businesses presented by such matters, are
discussed within Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under “—Litigation and Regulatory Matters.”

Our litigation and regulatory matters are subject to many
uncertainties, and given their complexity and scope, their outcome cannot be predicted. It is possible that our results of operations or cash flow in a particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable
resolution of pending litigation or regulatory matters depending, in part, upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period. In light of the unpredictability of the Company’s litigation and regulatory matters, it is also possible
that in certain



cases an ultimate unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or regulatory matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. Management believes, however,
that, based on information currently known to it, the ultimate outcome of all pending litigation and regulatory matters, after consideration of applicable reserves and rights to indemnification, is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our
financial position.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

General

Prudential Financial’s Common Stock was issued to
eligible policyholders in Prudential Insurance’s demutualization and sold to investors in Prudential Financial’s initial public offering. The Common Stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “PRU” on
December 13, 2001. The following table presents the high and low closing prices for the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange during the periods indicated and the dividends declared per share during such periods:

On January 31, 2011, there were 2,059,447 registered holders of record for the Common Stock and 484 million shares outstanding.

The Class B Stock was issued to institutional
investors (two subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. and Pacific Life Corp.) in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 on the date of demutualization. There is no established public trading
market for the Class B Stock. During the fourth quarter of 2010 and 2009, Prudential Financial paid an annual dividend of $9.625 per share of Class B Stock. On January 31, 2011, there were three holders of record for the Class B Stock and
2 million shares outstanding.

Prudential
Financial’s Board of Directors currently intends to continue to declare and pay annual dividends on the Common Stock and Class B Stock. Future dividend decisions will be based on, and affected by, a number of factors including the financial
performance of the Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business; our overall financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements and future prospects; regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by Prudential
Financial’s subsidiaries; and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant. Dividends payable by Prudential Financial are limited to the amount that would be legally available for payment under New Jersey corporate law. For
additional information on dividends and related regulatory restrictions, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” and Note 15 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



In December 2006, Prudential Financial issued in a private placement $2.0 billion of
floating rate convertible senior notes, convertible by the holders at any time after issuance into cash and shares of the Company’s Common Stock. The Company used the majority of the offering proceeds initially to invest in an investment grade
fixed income investment portfolio, while the remainder of the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and to repurchase shares of its Common Stock under the 2006 share repurchase authorization. On December 12, 2007, $117 million of
senior notes were repurchased by Prudential Financial at the request of the holders and prior to this event we liquidated the investment portfolio. On December 12, 2008 and December 14, 2009, Prudential Financial repurchased $1.879 billion
and $2 million of senior notes, respectively, at the request of the holders. As of December 31, 2010, $0.4 million of these notes remain outstanding.

In September 2009, Prudential Insurance issued in a private placement $500 million of surplus notes due September 2019 with an
interest rate of 5.36% per annum. The surplus notes are exchangeable at the option of the holder, in whole but not in part, for shares of Prudential Financial Common Stock beginning in September 2014, or earlier upon a fundamental business
combination involving Prudential Financial or a continuing payment default. The initial exchange rate for the surplus notes is 10.1235 shares of Common Stock per each $1,000 principal amount of surplus notes, which represents an initial exchange
price per share of Common Stock of $98.78; however, the exchange rate is subject to customary anti-dilution and other adjustments.

For additional information about our convertible senior notes and exchangeable surplus notes see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

See Item 12 for information
about our equity compensation plans.

Common
Stock and Class B Stock

The Common Stock and
the Class B Stock are separate classes of common stock under New Jersey corporate law.

Holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock will be entitled to dividends if and when declared by Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors out of funds legally available to pay those dividends. To the
extent dividends are paid on the Class B Stock, shares of Class B Stock are repurchased or the Closed Block Business has net losses, the amount legally available for dividends on the Common Stock will be reduced. In addition, payment of dividends
will be subject to the following additional conditions:

•

Common Stock will be entitled to receive dividends, if and when declared by Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors, only out of assets of the
Financial Services Businesses legally available for the payment of dividends under the New Jersey Business Corporation Act as if the Financial Services Businesses were a separate New Jersey corporation; and

•

Class B Stock will be entitled to receive dividends, if and when declared by Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors, only out of assets of the
Closed Block Business legally available for the payment of dividends under the New Jersey Business Corporation Act, as if the Closed Block Business were a separate New Jersey corporation.

Dividends declared and paid on the Common Stock will depend
upon the financial performance of the Financial Services Businesses. Dividends declared and paid on the Class B Stock will depend upon the financial performance of the Closed Block Business and, as the Closed Block matures, the holders of the Class
B Stock will receive the surplus of the Closed Block Business no longer required to support the Closed Block for regulatory purposes. Dividends on the Class B Stock will be payable in an aggregate amount per year at least equal to the lesser of
(1) a “Target Dividend Amount” of $19.25 million or (2) the “CB Distributable Cash Flow,” as defined below in “—Convertibility,” for such year, which is a measure of the net cash flows of the Closed Block
Business. Notwithstanding this formula, as with any common stock, we will retain the flexibility to suspend dividends on the Class B Stock; however, if CB Distributable Cash Flow exists for any period and Prudential Financial chooses not to pay
dividends on the Class B Stock in an aggregate amount at least equal to the lesser of the CB Distributable Cash Flow or the Target Dividend Amount for that period, then cash dividends cannot be paid on the Common Stock with respect to such period.
The principal component of “CB Distributable



Cash Flow” will be the amount by which Surplus and Related Assets, determined according to statutory accounting principles, exceed surplus that would be required for the Closed Block
Business considered as a separate insurer; provided, however, that “CB Distributable Cash Flow” counts such excess only to the extent distributable as a dividend by Prudential Insurance under specified, but not all, provisions of New
Jersey insurance law. Subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors of Prudential Financial, we currently anticipate paying dividends on the Class B Stock at the Target Dividend Amount for the foreseeable future.

The shares of Common Stock will vote together with the shares
of Class B Stock on all matters (one share, one vote) except as otherwise required by law and except that holders of the Class B Stock will have class voting or consent rights with respect to specified matters directly affecting the Class B Stock.

If shares of Class B Stock are outstanding at the
time of a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Prudential Financial, each share of Common Stock and Class B Stock will be entitled to a share of net liquidation proceeds in proportion to the respective liquidation units of such class. Each
share of Common Stock will have one liquidation unit, and each share of Class B Stock will have 2.83215 liquidation units.

On December 18, 2001, Prudential Financial’s shareholder rights agreement became effective. Under the shareholder rights
agreement, one shareholder protection right is attached to each share of Common Stock but not to any share of Class B Stock. Each right initially entitles the holder to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of a series of Prudential Financial
preferred stock upon payment of the exercise price. At the time of the demutualization, the Board of Directors of Prudential Financial determined that the initial exercise price per right is $110, subject to adjustment from time to time as provided
in the shareholder rights agreement. The shareholders rights agreement will expire by its terms on December 18, 2011.

Convertibility

The Common Stock is not convertible.

Prudential Financial may, at its option, at any time, exchange all outstanding shares of Class B Stock into such number of shares of
Common Stock as have an aggregate average market value (discussed below) equal to 120% of the appraised “Fair Market Value” (discussed below) of the outstanding shares of Class B Stock.

In addition, if (1) Prudential Financial sells or
otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of the Closed Block Business or (2) a “change of control” of Prudential Financial occurs, Prudential Financial must exchange all outstanding shares of Class B Stock into such number of
shares of Common Stock as have an aggregate average market value of 120% of the appraised Fair Market Value of such shares of Class B Stock. For this purpose, “change of control” means the occurrence of any of the following events (whether
or not approved by the Board of Directors of Prudential Financial): (a)(i) any person(s) (as defined) (excluding Prudential Financial and specified related entities) is or becomes the beneficial owner (as defined), directly or indirectly, of more
than 50% of the total voting power of the then outstanding equity securities of Prudential Financial; or (ii) Prudential Financial merges with, or consolidates with, another person or disposes of all or substantially all of its assets to any
person, other than, in the case of either clause (i) or (ii), any transaction where immediately after such transaction the persons that beneficially owned immediately prior to the transaction the then outstanding voting equity securities of
Prudential Financial beneficially own more than 50% of the total voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the surviving person; or (b) during any year or any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of
such period constituted the Board of Directors of Prudential Financial (together with any new directors whose election by such Board of Directors or whose nomination for election by the shareholders of Prudential Financial was approved by a vote of
a majority of the directors of Prudential Financial then still in office who were either directors at the beginning of such period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved) cease for any reason, other than pursuant to
(x) a proposal or request that the Board of Directors be changed as to which the holder of the Class B Stock seeking the conversion has participated or assisted or is participating or assisting or (y) retirements in the ordinary course (as
defined), to constitute a majority of the Board of Directors then in office.

Holders of Class B Stock will be permitted to convert their shares of Class B Stock into such number of shares of Common Stock as have an aggregate average market value equal to 100% of the appraised Fair
Market



Value of the outstanding shares of Class B Stock (1) in the holder’s sole discretion, in the year 2016 or at any time thereafter, and (2) at any time in the event that (a) the
Class B Stock will no longer be treated as equity of Prudential Financial for federal income tax purposes or (b) the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance amends, alters, changes or modifies the regulation of the Closed Block, the
Closed Block Business, the Class B Stock or the IHC debt in a manner that materially adversely affects the CB Distributable Cash Flow (as defined below); provided, however, that in no event may a holder of Class B Stock convert shares of Class B
Stock to the extent such holder immediately upon such conversion, together with its affiliates, would be the “beneficial owner,” as defined under the Exchange Act, of in excess of 9.9% of the total outstanding voting power of Prudential
Financial’s voting securities. In the event a holder of shares of Class B Stock requests to convert shares pursuant to clause (2)(a) in the preceding sentence, Prudential Financial may elect, instead of effecting such conversion, to
increase the Target Dividend Amount to $12.6875 per share per annum retroactively from the time of issuance of the Class B Stock.

“CB Distributable Cash Flow” means, for any quarterly or annual period, the sum of (i) the excess of (a) the Surplus
and Related Assets over (b) the “Required Surplus” applicable to the Closed Block Business within Prudential Insurance, to the extent that Prudential Insurance is able to distribute such excess as a dividend to Prudential Holdings,
LLC (“PHLLC”) under New Jersey law without giving effect, directly or indirectly, to the “earned surplus” requirement of Section 17:27A-4c.(3) of the New Jersey Insurance Holding Company Systems Law, plus (ii) any
amount held by PHLLC allocated to the Closed Block Business in excess of remaining debt service payments on the IHC debt. For purposes of the foregoing, “Required Surplus” means the amount of surplus applicable to the Closed Block Business
within Prudential Insurance that would be required to maintain a quotient (expressed as a percentage) of (i) the “Total Adjusted Capital” applicable to the Closed Block Business within Prudential Insurance (including any applicable
dividend reserves) divided by (ii) the “Company Action Level RBC” applicable to the Closed Block Business within Prudential Insurance, equal to 100%, where “Total Adjusted Capital” and “Company Action Level RBC”
are as defined in the regulations promulgated under the New Jersey Dynamic Capital and Surplus Act of 1993. These amounts are determined according to statutory accounting principles.

In the event of any reclassification, recapitalization or exchange of, or any tender offer or exchange offer
for, the outstanding shares of Common Stock, including by merger, consolidation or other business combination, as a result of which shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or converted into another security which is both registered under the
Exchange Act and publicly traded, then the Class B Stock will remain outstanding (unless exchanged by virtue of a “change of control” occurring or otherwise, or otherwise converted) and, in the event 50% or more of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock are so exchanged or converted, holders of outstanding Class B Stock will be entitled to receive, in the event of any subsequent exchange or conversion, the securities into which the Common Stock has been exchanged or converted by
virtue of such reclassification, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer or other business combination. If, in the event of any reclassification, recapitalization or exchange, or any tender or exchange offer for, the
outstanding shares of Common Stock, including by merger, consolidation or other business combination, as a result of which a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock are converted into or exchanged or purchased for either cash or
securities which are not public securities, or a combination thereof, the Class B Stock will be entitled to receive cash and/or securities of the type and in the proportion that such holders of Class B Stock would have received if an exchange or
conversion of the Class B Stock had occurred immediately prior to the conversion, exchange or purchase of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock and the holders of Class B Stock had participated as holders of Common Stock in such
conversion, exchange or purchase. The amount of cash and/or securities payable upon such exchange or conversion will be calculated based upon the Fair Market Value of the Class B Stock as of the date on which the Common Stock was exchanged,
converted or purchased and will be multiplied by 120%.

For purposes of all exchanges and conversions, the “average market value” of the Common Stock will be determined during a specified 20 trading day period preceding the time of the exchange or
conversion. “Fair Market Value” of the Class B Stock means the fair market value of all of the outstanding shares of Class B Stock as determined by appraisal by a nationally recognized actuarial or other competent firm independent of and
selected by the Board of Directors of Prudential Financial and approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B Stock. Fair Market Value will be the present value of expected future cash flows to holders of the Class B
Stock, reduced by any payables to the Financial Services Businesses. Future cash flows



will be projected consistent with the policy, as described in the Plan of Reorganization, for the Board of Directors of Prudential Insurance to declare policyholder dividends based on actual
experience in the Closed Block. Following the repayment in full of the IHC debt, these cash flows shall be the excess of statutory surplus applicable to the Closed Block Business over Required Surplus (as defined in the definition of “CB
Distributable Cash Flow”) for each period that would be distributable as a dividend under New Jersey law if the Closed Block Business were a separate insurer. These cash flows will be discounted at an equity rate of return, to be estimated as a
risk-free rate plus an equity risk premium. The risk-free rate will be an appropriate ten-year U.S. Treasury rate reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The equity risk premium will be eight and one quarter percent initially, declining
evenly to four percent over the following 21 years and remaining constant thereafter. Fair Market Value will be determined by appraisal as of a specified date preceding the time of the exchange or conversion.

Any exchange or conversion of Class B Stock into Common Stock
could occur at a time when either or both of the Common Stock and Class B Stock may be considered to be overvalued or undervalued. In the future, if the Class B Stock is exchanged for or converted into Common Stock, the number of shares of Common
Stock then obtainable by the Class B Stockholders might constitute a higher proportion of the total shares of Common Stock then outstanding than the proportion represented by (x) the number of shares of Class B Stock initially issued divided by
(y) the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding upon completion of the demutualization. The degree of any such proportionate increase would depend principally on: the performance of the Closed Block Business over time and the
valuation of the Closed Block Business at the time of exchange or conversion; whether the exchange or conversion implemented involves a premium; the number of any new shares of Common Stock we issue after the demutualization for financing,
acquisition or other purposes or any repurchases of Common Stock that we may make; and the market value of our Common Stock at the time of exchange or conversion.

This selected consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein.



(1)

For purposes of this computation, earnings are defined as income from continuing operations before income taxes excluding undistributed income (loss) from equity method
investments, fixed charges and interest capitalized. Also excludes earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. Fixed charges are the sum of gross interest expense, interest credited to policyholders’ account balances and an estimated
interest component of rent expense. Due to the Company’s loss for the year ended December 31, 2008, the ratio coverage was less than 1:1 and is therefore not presented. Additional earnings of $859 million would have been required for the
year ended December 31, 2008 to achieve a ratio of 1:1.

(2)

The Company adopted the authoritative guidance for employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans effective December 31,
2006, which amended previous guidance, and resulted in a reduction of Prudential Financial, Inc. equity of $556 million upon adoption.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

You should read the following analysis of our
consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the Forward-Looking Statements included below the Table of Contents, “Risk Factors,” “Selected Financial Data” and the Consolidated Financial
Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Overview

Prudential Financial has two classes of common stock outstanding. The Common Stock, which is publicly traded (NYSE:PRU), reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses, while the Class B
Stock, which was issued through a private placement and does not trade on any exchange, reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business. The Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business are discussed below.

Financial Services Businesses

Our Financial Services Businesses consist of three operating
divisions, which together encompass seven segments, and our Corporate and Other operations. The U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management division consists of our Individual Annuities, Retirement and Asset Management segments. The U.S.
Individual Life and Group Insurance division consists of our Individual Life and Group Insurance segments. The International Insurance and Investments division consists of our International Insurance and International Investments segments. Our
Corporate and Other operations include our real estate and relocation services business, as well as corporate items and initiatives that are not allocated to business segments. Corporate and Other operations also include businesses that have been or
will be divested and businesses that we have placed in wind-down status.

We attribute financing costs to each segment based on the amount of financing used by each segment, excluding financing costs associated with corporate debt which are reflected in Corporate and Other
operations. The net investment income of each segment includes earnings on the amount of capital that management believes is necessary to support the risks of that segment.



We seek growth internally and through acquisitions, joint ventures or other forms of
business combinations or investments. Our principal acquisition focus is in our current business lines, both domestic and international.

Closed Block Business

In connection with the demutualization, we ceased offering domestic participating products. The liabilities for our traditional domestic
in force participating products were segregated, together with assets, in a regulatory mechanism referred to as the “Closed Block.” The Closed Block is designed generally to provide for the reasonable expectations for future policy
dividends after demutualization of holders of participating individual life insurance policies and annuities included in the Closed Block by allocating assets that will be used exclusively for payment of benefits, including policyholder dividends,
expenses and taxes with respect to these products. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Closed Block. At the time of demutualization, we determined the amount of Closed Block assets so that the Closed
Block assets initially had a lower book value than the Closed Block liabilities. We expect that the Closed Block assets will generate sufficient cash flow, together with anticipated revenues from the Closed Block policies, over the life of the
Closed Block to fund payments of all expenses, taxes, and policyholder benefits to be paid to, and the reasonable dividend expectations of, holders of the Closed Block policies. We also segregated for accounting purposes the assets that we need to
hold outside the Closed Block to meet capital requirements related to the Closed Block policies. No policies sold after demutualization will be added to the Closed Block, and its in force business is expected to ultimately decline as we pay
policyholder benefits in full. We also expect the proportion of our business represented by the Closed Block to decline as we grow other businesses.

Concurrently with our demutualization, Prudential Holdings, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial that owns the capital
stock of Prudential Insurance, issued $1.75 billion in senior secured notes, which we refer to as the IHC debt. The net proceeds from the issuances of the Class B Stock and IHC debt, except for $72 million used to purchase a guaranteed investment
contract to fund a portion of the bond insurance cost associated with that debt, were allocated to the Financial Services Businesses. However, we expect that the IHC debt will be serviced by the net cash flows of the Closed Block Business over time,
and we include interest expenses associated with the IHC debt when we report results of the Closed Block Business.

The Closed Block Business consists principally of the Closed Block, assets that we must hold outside the Closed Block to meet capital
requirements related to the Closed Block policies, invested assets held outside the Closed Block that represent the difference between the Closed Block assets and Closed Block liabilities and the interest maintenance reserve, deferred policy
acquisition costs related to Closed Block policies, the principal amount of the IHC debt and related hedging activities, and certain other related assets and liabilities.

The Closed Block Business is not a separate legal entity from
the Financial Services Businesses; however, they are operated as separate entities and are separated for financial reporting purposes. The Financial Services Businesses are not obligated to pay dividends on Closed Block policies. Dividends on Closed
Block policies reflect the experience of the Closed Block over time and are subject to adjustment by Prudential Insurance’s Board of Directors. Further, our plan of demutualization provides that we are not required to pay dividends on policies
within the Closed Block from assets that are not within the Closed Block and that the establishment of the Closed Block does not represent a guarantee that any certain level of dividends will be maintained.

Revenues and Expenses

We earn our revenues principally from insurance premiums;
mortality, expense, and asset management and administrative fees from insurance and investment products; and investment of general account and other funds. We earn premiums primarily from the sale of individual life insurance and group life and
disability insurance. We earn mortality, expense, and asset management fees from the sale and servicing of separate account products including variable life insurance and variable annuities. We also earn asset management and administrative fees from
the distribution, servicing and management of mutual funds, retirement products and other asset management products and services. Our operating expenses principally consist of insurance benefits provided, general business expenses, dividends to
policyholders, commissions and other costs of selling and servicing the various products we sell and interest credited on general account liabilities.



Profitability

Our profitability depends principally on our ability to
price and manage risk on insurance products, our ability to attract and retain customer assets and our ability to manage expenses. Specific drivers of our profitability include:

•

our ability to manufacture and distribute products and services and to introduce new products that gain market acceptance on a timely basis;

•

our ability to price our insurance products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the expense of
acquiring customers and administering those products;

•

our mortality and morbidity experience on individual and group life insurance, annuity and group disability insurance products, which can fluctuate
significantly from period to period;

•

our persistency experience, which affects our ability to recover the cost of acquiring new business over the lives of the contracts;

•

our cost of administering insurance contracts and providing asset management products and services;

•

our ability to manage and control our operating expenses, including overhead expenses;

•

our returns on invested assets, including the impact of credit losses, net of the amounts we credit to policyholders’ accounts;

•

the amount of our assets under management and changes in their fair value, which affect the amount of asset management fees we receive;

•

our ability to generate favorable investment results through asset/liability management and strategic and tactical asset allocation;

•

our credit and financial strength ratings;

•

our ability to effectively utilize our tax capacity;

•

our returns on proprietary investments we make;

•

our ability to manage risk and exposures, including the degree to which, and the effectiveness of, hedging these risks and exposures;

•

our ability to effectively deploy capital; and

•

our ability to attract and retain talent.

In addition, factors such as credit and real estate market conditions, regulation, competition, interest rates, taxes, foreign exchange
rates, market fluctuations and general economic, market and political conditions affect our profitability. In some of our product lines, particularly those in the Closed Block Business, we share experience on mortality, morbidity, persistency and
investment results with our customers, which can offset the impact of these factors on our profitability from those products.

Historically, the participating products included in the Closed Block have yielded lower returns on capital invested than many of our
other businesses. As we have ceased offering domestic participating products, we expect that the proportion of the traditional participating products in our in force business will gradually diminish as these older policies age, and we grow other
businesses. However, the relatively lower returns to us on this existing block of business will continue to affect our consolidated results of operations for many years. Our Common Stock reflects the performance of our Financial Services Businesses,
but there can be no assurance that the market value of the Common Stock will reflect solely the performance of these businesses.

See “Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks that have affected and may affect in the future our business, results of operations
or financial condition, cause the trading price of our Common Stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.



Executive Summary

Prudential Financial, a financial services leader with
approximately $784 billion of assets under management as of December 31, 2010, has operations in the United States, Asia, Europe and Latin America. Through our subsidiaries and affiliates, we offer a wide array of financial products and
services, including life insurance, annuities, retirement-related services, mutual funds, investment management, and real estate services. We offer these products and services to individual and institutional customers through one of the largest
distribution networks in the financial services industry.

Industry Trends

Our U.S. and international businesses are impacted by financial markets, economic conditions, regulatory oversight, and a variety of
trends that affect the industries where we compete.

U.S.
Businesses

Financial and Economic
Environment

.    Our businesses and results of operations are impacted by general economic and market conditions and are sensitive to changes in equity markets, interest rates and real estate valuations. The adverse market and
economic conditions that began in the second half of 2007 have improved. The equity and fixed income markets continue to recover while the real estate markets stabilize and begin to show signs of recovery. Interest rates and the pace and extent of
changes in rates have impacted the profitability of certain products we offer as well as returns on the investment portfolio backing our insurance liabilities and equity. Disruptions in the credit markets in recent years have also limited sales
opportunities for certain products we offer.

Regulatory Environment

.    Our businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision. The
financial market dislocations we have experienced have produced, and are expected to continue to produce, extensive changes in existing laws and regulations, and regulatory frameworks applicable to our businesses. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act signed into law on July 21, 2010 made comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the U.S. and subjects us to substantial additional federal regulation. In addition, state insurance
laws regulate all aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses and our insurance products are substantially affected by federal and state tax laws. Insurance regulators have begun to implement significant changes in the way in which industry
participants must determine statutory reserves and statutory capital, particularly for products with embedded options and guarantees such as variable annuities, and are considering further potentially significant changes in these requirements. In
addition, Congress from time to time considers legislation impacting U.S. federal income tax laws, such as the possible elimination of the dividends received deduction, which could adversely impact profitability or make our products less attractive
to consumers.

Demographics.

Income protection, wealth accumulation and the needs of retiring baby boomers continue to
shape the insurance industry. Retirement security is one of the most critical issues in the U.S. for individuals and the investment professionals and institutions that support them. The risk and responsibility of retirement savings continues to
shift to employees, away from the government and employers. Life insurance ownership among U.S. households has reached its lowest point in fifty years, with consumers citing other financial priorities and cost of insurance as reasons for the lack of
coverage.

Competitive
Environment

.    Our annuities, retirement and asset management businesses operate in a highly competitive environment. For the annuities business, market volatility in recent years has led many companies within the industry
to reduce risks in product features and increase costs. In addition, some peer companies have either exited the variable annuity marketplace or substantially reduced product features. We believe our innovative product offerings have increased our
competitiveness, thus increasing our sales. All of our new variable annuity sales, as well as a significant portion of our in force business, where an optional living benefit has been elected, include an automatic rebalancing feature, which is
valued in the marketplace. Our retirement and asset management businesses compete on price, service and investment performance. The full service retirement markets are mature, with few dominant players. We have seen a trend toward unbundling of the



purchase decision related to the recordkeeping and investment offerings, where the variety of available funds and their performance are the key selection criteria of plan sponsors and
intermediaries. Market disruption and rating agency downgrades have caused some of our institutional investment product competitors to withdraw from the market, creating significant growth opportunities for us in certain markets, including the
investment-only stable value market. The continued recovery of the equity, fixed income, and real estate markets in 2010 have positively impacted asset managers by increasing assets and therefore fee levels. In addition, institutional fixed income
managers have generally experienced positive flows as investors have re-allocated assets into fixed income to reduce risk, including the reduction of risk in pension plans.

The individual life and group life and disability markets are
mature and, due to the large number of competitors, competition is driven mainly by price and service. The economy has exacerbated pressure on pricing, creating an even greater challenge of maintaining pricing discipline. This has negatively
impacted our individual life sales, in an industry which has shifted toward non-proprietary distribution channels, which are more price sensitive than proprietary distribution channels. For group products, rate guarantees have become the industry
norm, with rate guarantee durations trending upward as a general industry practice. There is also an increased demand from clients for bundling of products and services to streamline administration and save costs by dealing with fewer carriers. As
employers are attempting to control costs and shift benefit decisions and funding to employees, who continue to value benefits offered in the workplace, employee-pay (voluntary) product offerings and services are becoming increasingly important in
the group market. Industry sales of voluntary products, as well as our own, were up again in 2010 despite the economic downturn.

International Businesses

Financial and Economic Environment

.    Our international businesses and the financial results of these
operations are impacted by the global economy as well as the financial and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate. Recent periods have been characterized by low interest rates. Similar to our U.S. businesses, interest rates and the
pace and extent of changes in rates have impacted the profitability of certain products we offer as well as returns on the investment portfolio backing our insurance liabilities and equity. Our Japanese operations have operated in this environment
for an extended period. We are also subject to financial impacts associated with movements in foreign currency rates, particularly the Japanese Yen.

Regulatory Environment

.    Our international insurance and investments operations are subject to comprehensive
local regulation and supervision. It is likely that the recent financial market dislocations will lead to changes in existing laws and regulations, and regulatory frameworks affecting our international businesses. The Financial Services Agency
(FSA), the insurance regulator in Japan, has proposed revisions to the solvency margin requirements that will revise risk charges for certain assets and change the manner in which an insurance company’s core capital is calculated. These changes
are expected to become effective for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012. The capital requirements in Korea and Taiwan are also undergoing changes. The FSA in Japan has introduced other measures to prevent, in the future, similar problems to
those experienced during the recent financial crisis, including a new regulatory framework for credit rating agencies, strengthened disclosure requirements and increased oversight of financial institutions. In addition, local regulations, primarily
in Japan, may apply heightened scrutiny to non-domestic companies. Our international investments businesses are also impacted by regulatory changes implemented or proposed in many of the countries in which we operate.

Competitive Environment

.    The
life insurance markets in Japan and Korea are mature. We generally compete more on service provided to the customers than on price. The aging of Japan’s population creates an increasing need for product innovation, introducing insurance
products which allow for savings and income as the population transitions to retirement. In addition, several competitors have exited the life insurance business, creating greater opportunities for us to penetrate this market. For our international
investments operations, the competitive landscape is influenced by implemented or planned regulatory changes, particularly in Mexico, Taiwan and China.

Current Developments

On February 1, 2011, Prudential Financial completed the acquisition from American International Group, Inc., or AIG, of AIG Star Life
Insurance Co., Ltd., or Star, AIG Edison Life Insurance Company, or Edison, and certain other AIG subsidiaries pursuant to the stock purchase agreement dated September 30, 2010 between



Prudential Financial and AIG. The total purchase price was approximately $4.8 billion, comprised of approximately $4.2 billion in cash and $0.6 billion in assumed third party debt, substantially
all of which is expected to be repaid, over time, with excess capital of the acquired entities. To partially fund the acquisition purchase price, in November 2010, Prudential Financial completed a public offering and sale of 18,348,624 shares of
Common Stock and $1.0 billion of medium-term notes, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $2.0 billion. The remainder of the purchase price was funded with approximately $2.2 billion of cash and short-term investments. See
“—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—International Insurance and Investments Division—International Insurance” and “—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for more information on
this acquisition.

On July 21, 2010, the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law and could result in the imposition of new capital, liquidity and other requirements on Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries. See “Business—Regulation”
for information regarding the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the Company.

Our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 reflect the following:

•

Net income of our Financial Services Businesses attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $2.714 billion
compared to $3.411 billion for 2009, which included a $1.457 billion after-tax gain from the sale of our minority joint venture interest in Wachovia Securities.

•

Pre-tax net realized investment losses and related charges and adjustments of the Financial Services Businesses in 2010 were $72 million, primarily
reflecting other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturities partially offset by net realized investment gains from increases in the market value of derivatives primarily related to interest rate derivatives used to manage investment portfolio
duration and net gains related to the embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with certain of our variable annuity contracts partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.

•

Net unrealized gains on general account fixed maturity investments of the Financial Services Businesses amounted to $5.726 billion as of
December 31, 2010, compared to net unrealized gains of $998 million as of December 31, 2009. Gross unrealized gains increased from $5.387 billion as of December 31, 2009 to $8.826 billion as of December 31, 2010 and gross
unrealized losses decreased from $4.389 billion to $3.100 billion for the same periods primarily due to a net decrease in interest rates, mainly the result of risk free rates. Net unrealized gains on general account fixed maturity investments of the
Closed Block Business amounted to $1.671 billion as of December 31, 2010, compared to net unrealized gains of $7 million as of December 31, 2009.

•

Individual Annuity total account values of $106.2 billion and gross sales of $21.8 billion in 2010 represented record highs. Individual Annuity net
sales also reached a record high in 2010 of $14.6 billion, an increase from $10.3 billion in the prior year.

•

Full Service Retirement account values reached a record high of $141.3 billion at December 31, 2010. Total account values for the Retirement
segment also reached a record high of $205.5 billion.

•

Asset Management reached record high institutional net flows of $28.6 billion in 2010 and $537 billion in assets under management as of
December 31, 2010.

•

International Insurance constant dollar basis annualized new business premiums were $1.8 billion in 2010, an increase from $1.4 billion in the prior
year.

•

Individual Life annualized new business premiums were $260 million in 2010, compared to $359 million in 2009. Group Insurance annualized new business
premiums were $607 million in 2010, compared to $577 million in 2009.

•

As of December 31, 2010, Prudential Financial, the parent holding company, had cash and short-term investments of $6.672 billion.

On November 9, 2010,
Prudential Financial declared an annual dividend for 2010 of $1.15 per share of Common Stock, reflecting an increase of approximately 64% from the 2009 Common Stock dividend.



Outlook

Management expects that results in 2011 will continue to reflect the quality of our individual businesses and their prospects, as well as
our overall business mix and effective capital management. In 2011, we continue to focus on long-term strategic positioning and growth opportunities, including the following:

•

U.S. Retirement and Investment Management Market.

We look to capitalize on the growing need of baby boomers for products
that provide guaranteed income for longer retirement periods. In addition, we continue to focus on our clients’ increasing needs for retirement income security given volatility in the financial markets. We also look to provide products that
respond to the needs of plan sponsors to manage risk and stretch their benefit dollars.

•

U.S. Insurance Market.

We continue to focus on writing high-quality business and expect to continue to benefit from
expansion of our distribution channels and deepening our relationships with third-party distributors. We also look to capitalize on opportunities for additional optional life purchases in the group insurance market, as institutional clients are
focused on stretching their benefit dollars.

•

International Markets.

We continue to concentrate on deepening our presence in the markets in which we currently operate,
such as Japan, and expanding our distribution capabilities, including through the integration of the recently acquired Star and Edison Businesses. We look to capitalize on opportunities arising in international markets as changing demographics and
public policy have resulted in a growing demand for retirement income and protection products similar to those offered in the U.S.



Results of Operations

We analyze performance of the segments and Corporate and
Other operations of the Financial Services Businesses using a measure called adjusted operating income. See “—Consolidated Results of Operations—Segment Measures” for a discussion of adjusted operating income, including the
change we made to this measure in the third quarter of 2010, and its use as a measure of segment operating performance.

Shown below are the contributions of each segment and Corporate and Other operations to our adjusted operating income for the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 and a reconciliation of adjusted operating income of our segments and Corporate and Other operations to income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures.

Results for 2010 presented above
reflect the following:

•

Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures for the Financial Services Businesses
for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $3,697 million, compared to $2,032 million for 2009. Adjusted operating income before income taxes for the Financial Services Businesses for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $4,052 million,
compared to $3,274 million for 2009.

•

Individual Annuities segment results for 2010 increased in comparison to 2009 primarily reflecting higher fee income resulting from the impact of
positive net flows and market appreciation on variable annuity account values during 2010.

•

Retirement segment results for 2010 increased in comparison to 2009 primarily driven by higher asset-based fees due to an increase in average full
service fee-based retirement account values resulting from market appreciation and net additions during 2010, and improved net investment spread results.



•

Asset Management segment results improved in 2010 in comparison to 2009 primarily from improved results from the segment’s commercial mortgage and
proprietary investing activities and increased asset management fees.

•

Individual Life segment results declined in 2010 compared to 2009 including $33 million from changes in mortality experience compared to expected
levels. The current year included slightly unfavorable mortality experience, net of reinsurance relative to expected levels, compared to favorable mortality experience in the prior year. Results in 2010 also reflect an increase in amortization of
deferred policy acquisition costs net of related amortization of unearned revenue reserves, reflecting the impact of equity markets on separate account fund performance in the respective periods, partially offset by the favorable impact of variable
life policyholder persistency. Also contributing to the decline was a $30 million benefit in 2009 from compensation received based on multi-year profitability of third-party products we distribute, compared to a benefit of less than $1 million in
2010.

•

Group Insurance segment results declined in 2010, compared to 2009. Results in 2010 reflect the net benefit from reserve refinements in both the group
life and group disability businesses, including the impact from annual reviews, compared to a net benefit of zero in 2009. Excluding this item, the decrease in adjusted operating income primarily reflects less favorable group life underwriting
results due largely to the lapse of certain business and repricing of other business up for renewal with favorable claims experience in the prior year, reflecting the competitive market, as well as an increase in the number and severity of claims.
Results in 2010 also reflect less favorable long-term disability claims experience consistent with the economic downturn. In addition, operating expenses increased, including higher costs to support disability operations and expansion into the group
dental market.

•

International Insurance segment results for 2010 improved from 2009. Results from the segment’s Life Planner operations improved in 2010,
reflecting the continued growth of our Japanese Life Planner operation, partially offset by the comparative impact of a net charge in 2010 and a net benefit to results in 2009 from refinements due to implementation of a new policy valuation system.
Results from the segment’s Gibraltar Life operation included a pre-tax gain of $66 million related to shares sold by a consortium of investors that holds a minority interest in China Pacific Insurance (Group) Co., Ltd. The remainder of the
improvements in results in 2010 came primarily from continued growth in our fixed annuity products, which are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, and from business growth in protection products reflecting expanding bank channel distribution, as
well as a greater contribution from non-coupon investments.

•

International Investments segment results for 2010 improved from 2009 primarily reflecting more favorable sales and trading results in the
segment’s global commodities operations.

•

Corporate and Other operations resulted in an increased loss for 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to increased interest expense, reflecting a
greater level of capital debt, as well as less favorable results from corporate hedging activities and a higher level of expenses in other corporate activities, partially offset by improved results in our real estate and relocation services
business.

•

Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related charges and adjustments for the Financial Services Businesses in 2010 amounted to a loss of $72
million, primarily reflecting other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturities partially offset by net realized investment gains from increases in the market value of derivatives primarily related to interest rate derivatives used to manage
investment portfolio duration and net gains related to the embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with certain of our variable annuity contracts partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates.

•

Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes in the Closed Block Business increased $1,205 million in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily
reflecting net realized investment gains in 2010, compared to losses in 2009, as well as an increase in net investment income, which were partially offset by an increase in the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation expense.



Accounting Policies & Pronouncements

Application of Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. Management, on an ongoing basis, reviews estimates and
assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements. If management determines that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate given current facts and circumstances, results of operations and financial position as reported in
the Consolidated Financial Statements could change significantly.

The following sections discuss the accounting policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions and require
management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.

Deferred Policy Acquisition and Other Costs

We capitalize costs that vary with and are related primarily to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance
and annuity contracts. These costs primarily include commissions, costs of policy issuance and underwriting, and variable field office expenses that are incurred in producing new business. In addition, we also defer costs associated with sales
inducements related to our variable and fixed annuity contracts primarily within our Individual Annuities segment. Sales inducements are amounts that are credited to the policyholder’s account balance as an inducement to purchase the contract.
For additional information about sales inducements, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We amortize these deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC, and deferred sales inducements, or DSI, over the expected lives of the contracts,
based on our estimates of the level and timing of gross margins, gross profits, or gross premiums, depending on the type of contract. As described in more detail below, in calculating DAC and DSI amortization, we are required to make assumptions
about investment returns, mortality, persistency, and other items that impact our estimates of the level and timing of gross margins, gross profits, or gross premiums. As of December 31, 2010, DAC and DSI in our Financial Services Businesses
were $15.7 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, and DAC in our Closed Block Business was $763 million.

Amortization methodologies

DAC associated with the traditional participating products of our Closed Block Business is amortized over the expected lives of those
contracts in proportion to estimated gross margins. Gross margins consider premiums, investment returns, benefit claims, costs for policy administration, changes in reserves, and dividends to policyholders. We evaluate our estimates of future gross
margins and adjust the related DAC balance with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the effects of actual gross margins and changes in our expected future gross margins. We also evaluate the recoverability of the DAC
balance at the end of each reporting period. Many of the factors that affect gross margins are included in the determination of our dividends to these policyholders. DAC adjustments generally have not created significant volatility in our results of
operations since, during most years, the Closed Block has recognized a cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense in “Policyholders’ dividends,” for the excess of actual cumulative earnings over expected cumulative earnings
as determined at the time of demutualization. However, if actual cumulative earnings fall below expected cumulative earnings in future periods, thereby eliminating the cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense, changes in gross margins and
DAC amortization could result in greater volatility in the Closed Block Business results of operations. As of December 31, 2010, the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was $126 million.

DAC associated with the non-participating whole life and term
life policies of our Individual Life segment and the non-participating whole life, term life, endowment and health policies of our International Insurance segment is amortized in proportion to gross premiums. We evaluate the recoverability of our
DAC related to these policies as part of our premium deficiency testing. If a premium deficiency exists, we reduce DAC by the amount of the deficiency or to zero through a charge to current period earnings. If the deficiency is more than the DAC
balance, we then increase the reserve for future policy benefits by the excess, by means of a charge to current period earnings. Generally, we do not expect significant deterioration in future experience, and therefore do not expect significant
writedowns to the related DAC.



DAC and DSI associated with the variable and universal life policies of our Individual Life
and International Insurance segments and the variable and fixed annuity contracts of our Individual Annuities and International Insurance segments are amortized over the expected life of these policies in proportion to gross profits. DAC and DSI are
also subject to recoverability testing which we perform at the end of each reporting period to ensure that each balance does not exceed the present value of estimated gross profits. In calculating gross profits, we consider mortality, persistency,
and other elements as well as rates of return on investments associated with these contracts and the costs related to our guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefits. Total gross profits include both actual experience and
estimates of gross profits for future periods. We regularly evaluate and adjust the related DAC and DSI balances with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the effects of our actual gross profits and changes in our
assumptions regarding estimated future gross profits. Adjustments to the DAC and DSI balances include the impact to our estimate of total gross profits of the annual review of assumptions, our quarterly adjustments for current period experience, and
our quarterly adjustments for market performance. Each of these adjustments is further discussed below in “—Annual assumptions review and quarterly adjustments.”

In addition to the gross profit components mentioned above,
we also include the impact of the embedded derivatives associated with certain of the optional living benefit features of our variable annuity contracts and related hedging activities in actual gross profits used as the basis for calculating current
period amortization. Historically, we also included the impact of these embedded derivatives and related hedging activities, excluding the impact of the market-perceived risk of our own non-performance, in our estimate of total gross profits used to
determine the DAC and DSI amortization rates. In the third quarter of 2010, we revised our hedging strategy, which resulted in a change in how certain gross profit components are used to determine the DAC and DSI amortization rates. Historically, as
part of our hedging strategy, we sought to generally match the sensitivities of the embedded derivative liability as defined by GAAP, excluding the impact of the market-perceived risk of our own non-performance, with capital market derivatives and
options. Under our new hedging strategy, our hedge target continues to be grounded in a GAAP/capital markets valuation framework but incorporates modifications to the risk-free return assumption to account for the fact that the underlying customer
separate account funds which support these living benefits are invested in assets that contain risk. The modifications include the removal of a volatility risk margin embedded in the valuation technique used to fair value the embedded derivative
liability under GAAP, and the inclusion of a credit spread over the risk-free rate used to estimate future growth of bond investments in the customer separate account funds. For a discussion of the change in our hedging strategy and the results of
our hedging program, see “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division—Individual Annuities—Net impact of embedded derivatives related to
our living benefit features and related hedge positions.”

As mentioned above, this change in our hedging strategy also led to a change in the components included in our estimate of total gross profits used to determine the DAC and DSI amortization rates. As of
the third quarter of 2010, management’s best estimate of the total gross profits associated with these optional living benefit features and related hedge positions is based on the updated hedge target definition as described above. However,
total gross profits for these purposes includes the difference between the value of the hedge target liability and asset value only to the extent this net amount is determined by management to be other than temporary, as well as the impact of
assumption updates on the valuation of the hedge target liability. The determination of whether the difference between the value of the hedge target liability and asset value is other-than-temporary is based on an evaluation of the effectiveness of
the hedge program. Management generally expects differences between the value of the hedge target liability and asset value to be temporary and to reverse over time. Such differences would not be included in total gross profits for purposes of
determining the amortization rates. However, based on the effectiveness of the hedge program, management may determine that the difference between the value of the hedge target liability and the asset value is other-than-temporary and would include
that amount in management’s best estimate of total gross profits for setting the DAC and DSI amortization rates. Management may also decide to temporarily hedge to an amount that differs from the target hedge definition, given overall capital
considerations of the Company and prevailing market conditions. The impact from temporarily hedging to an amount that differs from the hedge target definition, as well as the results of the capital hedge program we began in the second quarter of
2009 and modified in 2010, are not considered in calculating total gross profits used to determine amortization rates nor included in actual gross profits used in calculating current period amortization.



Annual assumptions review and quarterly adjustments

Annually, during the third quarter, we perform a
comprehensive review of the assumptions used in estimating gross profits for future periods. Although we review these assumptions on an ongoing basis throughout the year, we generally only update these assumptions and adjust the DAC and DSI balances
during the third quarter, unless a material change that we feel is indicative of a long term trend is observed in an interim period. Over the last several years, the Company’s most significant assumption updates resulting in a change to
expected future gross profits and the amortization of DAC and DSI have been related to lapse experience and other contractholder behavior assumptions, mortality, and revisions to expected future rates of returns on investments. We expect these
assumptions to be the ones most likely to cause potential significant changes in the future. The impact on our results of operations of changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact
over time.

The quarterly adjustments for current
period experience referred to above reflect the impact of differences between actual gross profits for a given period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for that period. To the extent each period’s actual experience differs
from the previous estimate for that period, the assumed level of total gross profits may change. In these cases, we recognize a cumulative adjustment to all previous periods’ amortization, also referred to as an experience true-up adjustment.

The quarterly adjustments for market performance
referred to above reflect the impact of changes to our estimate of total gross profits to reflect actual fund performance. A significant portion of gross profits for our variable annuity contracts and, to a lesser degree, our variable life policies
are dependent upon the total rate of return on assets held in separate account investment options. This rate of return influences the fees we earn, costs we incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit
features related to our variable annuity contracts, as well as other sources of profit. Returns that are higher than our expectations for a given period produce higher than expected account balances, which increase the fees we earn and decrease the
costs we incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit features related to our variable annuity contracts, resulting in higher expected future gross profits and lower DAC and DSI amortization for the
period. The opposite occurs when returns are lower than our expectations.

The near-term future rate of return assumptions used in evaluating DAC and DSI for our domestic variable annuity and variable life insurance products are derived using a reversion to the mean approach, a
common industry practice. Under this approach, we consider actual returns over a period of time and initially adjust future projected returns over a four year period so that the assets grow at the long-term expected rate of return for the entire
period. If the projected future rate of return over the four year period is greater than our maximum future rate of return, we use our maximum future rate of return. As of December 31, 2010, our long-term expected rates of return across all
asset types for variable annuity contracts and variable life policies range from 7.4% to 7.8% per annum, depending on the specific block of business, and reflect, among other assumptions, an expected rate of return of 9.3% per annum for
equity type assets and a 5.7% annual weighted average rate of return on fixed income investments. Unless there is a sustained interim deviation, our long-term expected rate of return assumptions generally are not impacted by short-term market
fluctuations. As of December 31, 2010, our near-term maximum future rate of return under the reversion to the mean approach for variable annuity contracts and variable life policies was 9.6% and 9.8% per annum, respectively. Included in
this blended maximum future rate are assumptions for returns on various asset classes, including a 13% annual maximum rate of return on equity investments and a 5.7% annual weighted average rate of return on fixed income investments.

We update the projected future rate of return and our
estimate of total gross profits each quarter to reflect the result of the reversion to the mean approach. These market performance related adjustments to our estimate of total gross profits result in cumulative adjustments to prior amortization,
reflecting the application of the new required rate of amortization to all prior periods’ gross profits. The new required rate of amortization is also applied prospectively to future gross profits in calculating amortization in future periods.
For domestic variable annuities contracts and domestic variable life policies, as of December 31, 2010, our expected rate of return for the next four years across all asset types is 7.1% and 8.6% per annum, respectively. These rates
represent a weighted average of our expected rates of return across all contract groups. For some contract groups, our expected rate of return for the next four years equals our current maximum future rates of return, as the near-term



projected future rate of return under the reversion to the mean approach is greater than our maximum future rate of return. For certain contract groups relating to variable annuities issued in
2009 and 2010, the expected rate of return over the next four years is under 7.1% per annum, reflecting the impact of more favorable markets in 2009 and 2010 and the reversion to the mean approach.

Sensitivity

For the variable and universal life policies of our
Individual Life segment, a significant portion of our gross profits is derived from mortality margins. As a result, our estimates of future gross profits are significantly influenced by our mortality assumptions. Our mortality assumptions represent
our expected claims experience over the life of these policies and are developed based on Company experience or standard industry tables. Unless a material change in mortality experience that we feel is indicative of a long term trend is observed in
an interim period, we generally update our mortality assumptions annually in the third quarter. Updates to our mortality assumptions in future periods could have a significant adverse or favorable effect on the results of our operations in the
Individual Life segment. For the variable and universal life policies in our International Insurance segment, mortality assumptions impact to a lesser extent our estimates of future gross profits due to differences in policyholder demographics, the
overall age of this block of business, the amount of mortality margins and our actual mortality experience.

The DAC balance associated with the variable and universal life policies of our Individual Life segment as of December 31, 2010 was
$2.7 billion. The following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of that DAC balance relative to our future mortality assumptions by quantifying the adjustments that would be required, assuming both an increase and decrease in our
future mortality rate by 1%. While the information below is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future mortality assumptions, it is a near-term, reasonably likely hypothetical change that illustrates the
potential impact of such a change. This information considers only the direct effect of changes in our mortality assumptions on the DAC balance and not changes in any other assumptions such as persistency, future rate of return, or expenses included
in our evaluation of DAC, and does not reflect changes in reserves, such as the unearned revenue reserve, which would partially offset the adjustments to the DAC balance reflected below. The impact of the unearned revenue reserve is discussed in
more detail below in “—Policyholder Liabilities.”

For a discussion of DAC adjustments related to our Individual Life segment for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, see “—Results of Operations for Financial Services
Businesses by Segment—U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance Division—Individual Life.”

For variable annuity contracts, DAC and DSI are more sensitive to changes in our future rate of return assumptions due primarily to the
significant portion of our gross profits that is dependent upon the total rate of return on assets held in separate account investment options, and the shorter average life of the contracts. The DAC and DSI balances associated with our domestic
variable annuity contracts were $3.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2010. The following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of each of these balances relative to our future rate of return assumptions by
quantifying the adjustments to each balance that would be required assuming both an increase and decrease in our future rate of return by 100 basis points. The sensitivity includes an increase and decrease of 100 basis points to both the near-term
future rate of return assumptions used over the next four years, and the long-term expected rate of return used thereafter. While the information below is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future rate of
return assumptions, it is a near-term, reasonably likely hypothetical change that illustrates the potential impact of such a change. This information considers only the direct effect of changes in our future rate of return on the DAC and DSI
balances and not changes in any other assumptions such as persistency, mortality, or expenses included in our evaluation of DAC and DSI. Further, this information does not reflect changes in reserves, such



as the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and optional living benefit features of our variable annuity products, or the impact that changes in such reserves may have on the DAC and DSI
balances.

For a discussion of DAC and DSI adjustments related to our Individual Annuities segment for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, see “—Results of Operations for Financial
Services Businesses by Segment—U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division—Individual Annuities.”

Valuation of Business Acquired

In addition to DAC and DSI, we also recognize an asset for valuation of business acquired, or VOBA. As of December 31, 2010, VOBA was
$484 million, all within our Financial Services Businesses. VOBA represents the present value of future profits embedded in acquired businesses, and is determined by estimating the net present value of future cash flows from the contracts in force
at the date of acquisition. We have established a VOBA asset primarily for our acquired traditional life, deferred annuity, defined contribution and defined benefit businesses. VOBA is amortized over the effective life of the acquired contracts. For
additional information about VOBA including details on items included in our estimates of future cash flows for the various acquired businesses and its bases for amortization, see Note 2 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. VOBA is
also subject to recoverability testing at the end of each reporting period to ensure that the balance does not exceed the present value of anticipated gross profits. Based on this recoverability testing, in 2009 we impaired the entire remaining VOBA
asset related to the variable annuity contracts acquired from Allstate. For additional information regarding this charge, see “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—U.S. Retirement Solutions and
Investment Management Division—Individual Annuities.”

Goodwill

We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of December 31 of each year and more frequently if events occur or
circumstances change that would indicate the potential for impairment is more likely than not. The test is performed at the reporting unit level which is equal to or one level below our operating segments. Reporting units that had goodwill subject
to testing as of December 31, 2010 were the Asset Management segment, the International Insurance segment’s Life Planners business and the Retirement segment’s Full Service business.

As required by accounting guidance, the impairment testing
process consists of two steps. Step 1 requires that the fair value of the reporting unit be calculated and compared to the reporting unit’s carrying value. If the fair value is greater than the carrying value, it is concluded there is no
impairment and the analysis is complete. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, Step 2 of the process is completed to determine the amount of impairment, if any.

Step 2 utilizes business combination purchase accounting
guidance and requires the fair value calculation of all individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit (excluding goodwill, but including any unrecognized intangible assets). The net fair value of assets less liabilities is then compared to
the reporting unit’s total fair value as calculated in Step 1. The excess of fair value over the net asset value equals the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill to
determine the reporting unit’s goodwill impairment loss, if any.

The fair value of reporting units calculated in Step 1 was determined using either an earnings multiple approach or a discounted cash flow approach. The earnings multiple approach was the primary approach
for the Asset Management and International Insurance reporting units. The discounted cash flow approach was primarily utilized by the Retirement reporting unit. Earnings multiples used ranged from 6.3 to 13.2 times earnings while the discount rate
used was 12%.

The earnings multiple approach
indicates the value of a business based on comparison to publicly-traded comparable companies in similar lines of business. Each comparable company is analyzed based on various



factors, including, but not limited to, financial risk, size, geographic diversification, profitability, adequate financial data, and an actively traded stock price. A multiple of price to
earnings is developed for the comparable companies using independent analysts’ consensus estimates for each company’s 2011 forecasted earnings. The multiple is then applied to the 2011 forecasted earnings of the reporting unit to develop a
value. A control premium is then added to determine a total estimated fair value for the reporting unit.

The discounted cash flow approach calculates the value of a business by applying a discount rate reflecting the market expected weighted
average rate of return to the projected future cash flows of the reporting unit. The weighted average rate of return, or WARR, represents the required rate of return on total capitalization. It is comprised of a required rate of return on equity of
a company and the current tax-affected cost of debt, which are then weighted by the relative percentages of equity and debt in the capital structure. To estimate the return on equity, we applied the Capital Asset Pricing Model, or CAPM. The CAPM is
a generally accepted method for estimating an equity investor’s return requirement, and hence a company’s cost of equity capital. CAPM is determined by beginning with the long-term risk free rate of return then applying adjustments that
consider the equity risk premium required for large company common stock investments as well as company specific adjustments to address volatility, small company premiums and other risks particular to a specific company. The WARR calculation is
applied to a group of companies considered peers of the reporting unit to develop a weighted average rate of return for the peer group which is then used to estimate the market expected weighted average rate of return for the reporting unit.

After completion of Step 1 of the analysis, it
was determined that fair value exceeded the carrying value for each of the three reporting units and it was concluded there was no impairment as of December 31, 2010. The Asset Management and International Insurance Life Planner businesses had
estimated fair values that exceeded their carrying values by 437% and 13%, respectively. The fair value of the Retirement Full Service business, which was calculated based upon application of the discounted cash flow approach utilizing a discount
rate of 12%, exceeded the carrying value by 24%. As of December 31, 2010, we had a total goodwill balance of $707 million, including $444 million related to our Retirement reporting unit, $239 million related to our Asset Management reporting
unit, and $24 million related to our International Insurance reporting unit. Further market declines or other events impacting the fair value of these businesses, or increases in the level of equity required to support these businesses, could result
in goodwill impairments, resulting in a charge to income.

During 2008, we recorded a total impairment charge for goodwill of $337 million, which was included in “General and administrative expenses.” These impairments reflected the deterioration of
financial conditions in 2008 and the impact of this deterioration on expected future earnings of these businesses, including: (1) for our Individual Annuities reporting unit, equity market declines and resulting additional market depreciation
within separate account assets and corresponding decreases in our anticipated future fee income; (2) for our International Investments reporting unit, significant market deterioration resulting in both a reduction in value and an outflow of
assets under management which contributed to lower asset management fees earned in the fourth quarter of 2008 and expected in future periods and (3) for our Prudential Real Estate and Relocation reporting unit, further deterioration of the U.S.
housing market, including the number of transactions and the national average home sale price which both declined in the fourth quarter of 2008, and the impact of this decline on future anticipated revenues of this business.

Valuation of Investments, Including Derivatives, and the Recognition of
Other-than-Temporary Impairments

Our
investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans, equity securities, other invested assets, and derivative financial instruments. Derivatives are financial instruments whose values
are derived from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices or the values of securities or commodities. Derivative financial instruments we generally use include swaps, futures, forwards and options and may be exchange-traded or
contracted in the over-the-counter market. We are also party to financial instruments that contain derivative instruments that are “embedded” in the financial instruments. Management believes the following accounting policies related to
investments, including derivatives, are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. Each of these policies is discussed further within other relevant disclosures related to the investments and derivatives, as referenced below.

Valuation of investments, including derivatives



•

Recognition of other-than-temporary impairments

•

Determination of the valuation allowance for losses on commercial mortgage and other loans

We present our investments classified as available for sale,
including fixed maturity and equity securities, our investments classified as trading, such as our trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities, our derivatives, and our embedded derivatives at fair value in the statements of financial
position. For additional information regarding the key estimates and assumptions surrounding the determination of fair value of fixed maturity and equity securities, as well as derivative instruments, embedded derivatives and other investments, see
Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “—Valuation of Assets and Liabilities—Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities.”

For our investments classified as available for sale, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in
“Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net,” a separate component of equity. For our investments classified as trading, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded within “Asset management fees and other income.” In
addition, investments classified as available for sale, as well as those classified as held to maturity, are subject to impairment reviews to identify when a decline in value is other-than-temporary. For a discussion of our policies regarding
other-than-temporary declines in investment value and the related methodology for recording other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturity and equity securities, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “—Realized
Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—General Account Investments—Fixed Maturity Securities—Other-than-Temporary Impairments of Fixed Maturity Securities” and “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses
and General Account Investments—General Account Investments—Equity Securities—Other-than-Temporary Impairments of Equity Securities.”

Commercial mortgage and other loans are carried primarily at unpaid principal balances, net of unamortized premiums or discounts and a
valuation allowance for losses. For a discussion of our policies regarding the valuation allowance for commercial mortgage and other loans see “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—General Account
Investments—Commercial Mortgage and Other Loans—Commercial Mortgage and Other Loan Quality.”

For a discussion of our investment portfolio, including the gross unrealized gains and losses as of December 31, 2010, related to the

Losses and General Account Investments—General Account Investments.” For a discussion of the effects of impairments and changes to the valuation allowance for commercial mortgage and other loans on our operating results for the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, see “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—Realized Investment Gains and Losses.”

Policyholder Liabilities

Future Policy Benefit Reserves, other than Unpaid Claims
and Claim Adjustment Expenses

We establish
reserves for future policy benefits to or on behalf of policyholders in the same period in which the policy is issued. These reserves relate primarily to the traditional participating whole life policies of our Closed Block Business and the
non-participating whole life, term life, and life contingent structured settlement and group annuity products of our Financial Services Businesses.

The future policy benefit reserves for the traditional participating life insurance products of our Closed Block Business, which as of
December 31, 2010, represented 39% of our total future policy benefit reserves are determined using the net level premium method as prescribed by U.S. GAAP. Under this method, the future policy benefit reserves are accrued as a level proportion
of the premium paid by the policyholder. In applying this method, we use mortality assumptions to determine our expected future benefits and expected future premiums, and apply an interest rate to determine the present value of both the expected
future benefit payments and the expected future premiums. The mortality assumptions used are based on data from the standard industry mortality tables that were used to determine the cash surrender value of the policies, and the interest rates used



are the contractually guaranteed interest rates used to calculate the cash surrender value of the policy. Gains or losses in our results of operations resulting from deviations in actual
experience compared to the experience assumed in establishing our reserves for this business are recognized in the determination of our annual dividends to these policyholders. These gains or losses generally have not created significant volatility
in our results of operations since, during most years, the Closed Block has recognized a cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense in “Policyholders’ dividends,” for the excess of actual cumulative earnings over expected
cumulative earnings as determined at the time of demutualization. However, if actual cumulative earnings fall below expected cumulative earnings in future periods, thereby eliminating the cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense, these
gains or losses could result in greater volatility in the Closed Block Business results of operations. As of December 31, 2010, the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was $126 million.

The future policy benefit reserves for our International
Insurance segment and Individual Life segment, which as of December 31, 2010, represented 45% of our total future policy benefit reserves combined, relate primarily to non-participating whole life and term life products and are determined in
accordance with U.S. GAAP as the present value of expected future benefits to or on behalf of policyholders plus the present value of future maintenance expenses less the present value of future net premiums. The expected future benefits and
expenses are determined using assumptions as to mortality, lapse, and maintenance expense. Reserve assumptions are based on best estimate assumptions as of the date the policy is issued with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation. After our
reserves are initially established, we perform premium deficiency tests using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date without provisions for adverse deviation. If reserves determined based on these best estimate assumptions are greater than
the net U.S. GAAP liabilities (i.e., reserves net of any DAC asset), the existing net U.S. GAAP liabilities are adjusted to the greater amount. Our best estimate assumptions are determined by product group. Mortality assumptions are generally based
on the Company’s historical experience or standard industry tables, as applicable; our expense assumptions are based on current levels of maintenance costs, adjusted for the effects of inflation; and our interest rate assumptions are based on
current and expected net investment returns. Unless a material change in mortality experience is observed in an interim period that we feel is indicative of a long term trend, we generally update our mortality assumptions annually in the third
quarter of each year. Generally, we do not expect our mortality trends to change significantly in the short-term and to the extent these trends may change we expect such changes to be gradual over the long-term.

The reserves for future policy benefits of our Retirement
segment, which as of December 31, 2010 represented 11% of our total future policy benefit reserves, relate to our non-participating life contingent group annuity and structured settlement products. These reserves are generally determined as the
present value of expected future benefits and expenses based on assumptions as to mortality, retirement, maintenance expense, and interest rates. Reserves are based on best estimate assumptions as of the date the contract is issued with provisions
for the risk of adverse deviation. After our reserves are initially established, we perform premium deficiency testing by product group using best estimate assumptions as of the testing date without provisions for adverse deviation. If reserves
determined based on these assumptions are greater than the existing reserves, the existing reserves are adjusted to the greater amount. Our best estimate assumptions are determined by product group. Our mortality and retirement assumptions are based
on Company or industry experience; our expense assumptions are based on current levels of maintenance costs, adjusted for the effects of inflation; and our interest rate assumptions are based on current and expected net investment returns. Although
we review our mortality and retirement assumptions on an ongoing basis throughout the year, we generally only updates these assumptions annually during the third quarter unless a material change in mortality or retirement experience is observed in
an interim period that we feel is indicative of a long term trend. Generally, we do not expect our actual mortality or retirement trends to change significantly in the short-term and to the extent these trends may change we expect such changes to be
gradual over the long-term.

The remaining 5% of
the reserves for future policy benefits as of December 31, 2010 represented reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and optional living benefit features of the variable annuity products in our Individual Annuities segment, and group life and
disability and long-term care benefits in our Group Insurance segment. The optional living benefits are primarily accounted for as embedded derivatives, with fair values calculated as the present value of future expected benefit payments to
customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature. For additional information regarding the valuation of these optional living benefit features, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements and “—Valuation of Assets and Liabilities—Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities—Variable Annuity Optional Living Benefit Features.”



In establishing reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits related to
variable annuity contracts, we must make estimates and assumptions about the timing of annuitization, contract lapses and contractholder mortality, as well as interest rates and equity market returns. Assumptions relating to contractholder behavior,
such as the timing of annuitization and contract lapses, are based on our experience by contract group, and vary by product type and year of issuance. Our dynamic lapse rate assumption applies a different lapse rate on a contract by contract basis
based on a comparison of the guaranteed minimum death or income benefit and the current policyholder account value as well as other factors such as the applicability of any surrender charges. In-the-money contracts are those with a guaranteed
minimum benefit in excess of the current policyholder account value. Since in-the-money contracts are less likely to lapse, we apply a lower lapse rate assumption to these contracts. As an example, the lapse rate assumptions for contracts that are
not in-the-money and are out of their surrender charge period average between 8% and 20% per year, and the lapse rate assumptions for contracts that are in-the-money and are out of their surrender charge period average between 0% and
20% per year. Mortality assumptions are generally based on our historical experience or standard industry tables, and also vary by contract group. Unless a material change in contractholder behavior or mortality experience that we feel is
indicative of a long term trend is observed in an interim period, we generally update assumptions related to contractholder behavior and mortality in the third quarter of each year by considering the actual results that have occurred during the
period from the most recent update to the expected amounts. Over the last several years, the Company’s most significant assumption updates that have resulted in changes to our reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits have been
related to lapse experience and other contractholder behavior assumptions and revisions to expected future rates of returns on investments. The Company expects these assumptions to be the ones most likely to cause significant changes in the future.
Changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and can also impact our DAC and other balances as discussed above. Generally, we do not expect our actual mortality trends to change significantly in the short-term, and to the extent these trends may
change we expect such changes to be gradual over the long-term.

The future rate of return assumptions used in establishing reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits related to variable annuity contracts are derived using a reversion to the mean
approach, a common industry practice. For additional information regarding our future expected rate of return assumptions and our reversion to the mean approach see, “—Deferred Policy Acquisition and Other Costs.” The following table
provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of the reserves for guaranteed minimum death benefit and guaranteed minimum income benefit, or GMDB and GMIB, related to variable annuity contracts relative to our future rate of return assumptions by
quantifying the adjustments to these reserves that would be required assuming both a 100 basis point increase and decrease in our future rate of return. The sensitivity includes an increase and decrease of 100 basis points to both the near-term
future rate of return assumptions used over the next four years, and the long-term expected rate of return used thereafter. While the information below is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future rate of
return assumptions, it is a near-term, reasonably likely change that illustrates the potential impact of such a change. This information considers only the direct effect of changes in our future rate of return on operating results due to the change
in the reserve balance and not changes in any other assumptions such as persistency, mortality, or expenses included in our evaluation of the reserves, or any changes on DAC or other balances, discussed above in “—Deferred Policy
Acquisition and Other Costs.”

For a discussion of adjustments to the reserves for guaranteed minimum death and income benefits related to our Individual Annuities segment for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, see
“—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division—Individual Annuities.”



Unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses

Our liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment
expenses of $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2010 is reported as a component of “Future policy benefits” and relates primarily to the group long-term disability products of our Group Insurance segment. This liability represents our
estimate of future disability claim payments and expenses as well as estimates of claims that we believe have been incurred, but have not yet been reported as of the balance sheet date. We do not establish loss liabilities until a loss has occurred.
As prescribed by U.S. GAAP, our liability is determined as the present value of expected future claim payments and expenses. Expected future claims payments are estimated using assumed mortality and claim termination factors and an assumed interest
rate. The mortality and claim termination factors are based on standard industry tables and the Company’s historical experience. Our interest rate assumptions are based on factors such as market conditions and expected investment returns. Of
these assumptions, our claim termination assumptions have historically had the most significant effect on our level of liability. We review our claim termination assumptions compared to actual terminations annually. These studies review actual claim
termination experience over a number of years with more weight placed on the actual experience in the more recent years. Recently, our claim termination experience has been impacted by increased volatility driven by the economic downturn. If actual
experience results in a different assumption, we adjust our liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses accordingly with a charge or credit to current period earnings.

Unearned revenue reserves for universal life and investment contracts

Our unearned revenue reserve, or URR, reported as a
component of “Policyholders’ account balances,” is $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2010. This reserve primarily relates to variable and universal life products within our Individual Life segment and represents policy charges for
services to be provided in future periods. The charges are deferred as unearned revenue and amortized over the expected life of the contract in proportion to the product’s estimated gross profits, similar to DAC as discussed above.

For the variable and universal life policies of our
Individual Life segment, a significant portion of our gross profits is derived from mortality margins. As a result, our estimates of future gross profits are significantly influenced by our mortality assumptions. Our mortality assumptions represent
our expected claims experience over the life of these policies and are developed based on Company experience or standard industry tables. Unless a material change in mortality experience that we feel is indicative of a long term trend is observed in
an interim period, we generally update our mortality assumptions annually in the third quarter. Updates to our mortality assumptions in future periods could have a significant adverse or favorable effect on the results of our operations in the
Individual Life segment.

The URR balance
associated with the variable and universal life policies of our Individual Life segment as of December 31, 2010 was $1.1 billion. The following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of that URR balance relative to our future
mortality assumptions by quantifying the adjustments that would be required, assuming both an increase and decrease in our future mortality rate by 1%. While the information below is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our
expectations regarding future mortality assumptions, it is a near-term, reasonably likely hypothetical change that illustrates the potential impact of such a change on the URR balance and does not reflect the offsetting impact of such a change on
the DAC balance as discussed above in “—Deferred Policy Acquisition and Other Costs.” This information considers only the direct effect of changes in our mortality assumptions on the URR balance and not changes in any other
assumptions such as persistency, future rate of return, or expenses included in our evaluation of URR.

For a discussion of URR adjustments related to our Individual Life segment for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, see “—Results of Operations for Financial Services
Businesses by Segment—U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance Division—Individual Life.”



Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

We sponsor pension and other postretirement benefit plans
covering employees who meet specific eligibility requirements. Our net periodic costs for these plans consider an assumed discount (interest) rate, an expected rate of return on plan assets and expected increases in compensation levels and trends in
health care costs. Of these assumptions, our expected rate of return assumptions, and to a lesser extent our discount rate assumptions, have historically had the most significant effect on our net period costs associated with these plans.

We determine our expected rate of return on plan
assets based upon a building block approach that considers inflation, real return, term premium, credit spreads, equity risk premium and capital appreciation as well as expenses, expected asset manager performance and the effect of rebalancing for
the equity, debt and real estate asset mix applied on a weighted average basis to our pension asset portfolio. See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for our actual asset allocations by asset category and the asset allocation ranges
prescribed by our investment policy guidelines for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Our assumed long-term rate of return for 2010 was 7.50% for our pension plans and 7.50% for our other postretirement benefit plans. Given the
amount of plan assets as of December 31, 2009, the beginning of the measurement year, if we had assumed an expected rate of return for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans that was 100 basis points higher or 100 basis points
lower than the rates we assumed, the change in our net periodic costs would have been as shown in the table below. The information provided in the table below considers only changes in our assumed long-term rate of return given the level and mix of
invested assets at the beginning of the measurement year, without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed long-term rate of return.

We determine our discount rate, used to value the pension and postretirement benefit obligations, based upon rates commensurate with current yields on high quality corporate bonds. See Note 18 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the December 31, 2009 methodology we employed to determine our discount rate for 2010. Our assumed discount rate for 2010 was 5.75% for our pension plans and 5.50% for our other
postretirement benefit plans. Given the amount of pensions and postretirement obligation as of December 31, 2009, the beginning of the measurement year, if we had assumed a discount rate for both our pension and other postretirement benefit
plans that was 100 basis points higher or 100 basis points lower than the rates we assumed, the change in our net periodic costs would have been as shown in the table below. The information provided in the table below considers only changes in our
assumed discount rate without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed discount rate.

Given the application of the authoritative guidance for accounting for pensions, and the deferral and amortization of actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in our assumed discount rate, the
change in net periodic pension cost arising from an increase in the assumed discount rate by 100 basis points would not be expected to equal the change in net periodic pension cost arising from a decrease in the assumed discount rate by 100 basis
points.



At December 31, 2010, we changed our method for determining the discount rate from a
yield curve cashflow matching approach to a bond selection/settlement approach. See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the December 31, 2010 methodology.

For a discussion of our expected rate of return on plan
assets and discount rate for our qualified pension plan in 2011, see “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—Corporate and Other.”

In addition to the effect of changes in our assumptions, the
net periodic cost or benefit from our pension and other postretirement benefit plans may change due to factors such as actual experience being different from our assumptions, special benefits to terminated employees, or changes in benefits provided
under the plans.

At December 31, 2010, the
sensitivity of our pension and postretirement obligations to a 100 basis point change in discount rate was as follows:

Taxes on Income

Our effective tax rate is based on income, non-taxable and non-deductible items, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Inherent in
determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes.

Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times from the items reflected in the financial statements. As
a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than the actual rate applied on the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some
differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as valuation of insurance reserves. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in
future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expenditures for which
we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized in our financial statements.

The application of U.S. GAAP requires us to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if
necessary to reduce our deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, and if so, the amount of such valuation allowance. In
evaluating the need for a valuation allowance we consider many factors, including: (1) the nature of the deferred tax assets and liabilities; (2) whether they are ordinary or capital; (3) in which tax jurisdictions they were generated
and the timing of their reversal; (4) taxable income in prior carryback years as well as projected taxable earnings exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards; (5) the length of time that carryovers can be utilized in
the various taxing jurisdictions; (6) any unique tax rules that would impact the utilization of the deferred tax assets; and (7) any tax planning strategies that we would employ to avoid a tax benefit from expiring unused. Although
realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.

In 2010, the Company increased the valuation allowance against the state and local deferred tax assets for certain non-insurance
subsidiaries. The increase of $29 million to the valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets established in 2010 and prior years.



Our accounting represents management’s best estimate of future events that can be
appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates. Certain changes or future events, such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings and completion of tax audits could have an impact on our estimates and effective tax rate. For
example, the dividends received deduction, or DRD, reduces the amount of dividend income subject to tax and is a significant component of the difference between our actual tax expense and the expected amount determined using the federal statutory
tax rate of 35%. The U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, intend to address through regulations the methodology to be followed in determining the DRD related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts. On
February 14, 2011, the Obama Administration released the “General Explanations of the Administration’s Revenue Proposals.” Although the Administration has not released proposed statutory language, one proposal would change the
method used to determine the amount of the DRD. A change in the DRD, including the possible retroactive or prospective elimination of this deduction through regulation or legislation, could increase our actual tax expense and reduce our consolidated
net income.

U.S. GAAP prescribes a comprehensive
model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on tax returns. The application of this guidance is a two-step process, the
first step being recognition. We determine whether it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the tax position will be sustained upon examination. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold,
the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. We measure the tax position as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate
resolution with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. This measurement considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement using the facts, circumstances, and
information available at the reporting date.

An
increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by one percent of income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures, would have resulted in an increase or decrease in our consolidated
income from continuing operations before equity in earnings of operating joint ventures in 2010 of $44 million.

Our liability for income taxes includes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties which relate to tax years
still subject to review by the IRS or other taxing authorities. Audit periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed. Generally, for tax years which produce net operating losses, capital losses or tax credit
carryforwards, or tax attributes, the statute of limitations does not close, to the extent of these tax attributes, until the expiration of the statute of limitations for the tax year in which they are fully utilized. The completion of review or the
expiration of the statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to our liability for income taxes. The statute of limitations for the 2002 tax year expired on April 30, 2009. The statute of limitations for the
2003 tax year expired on July 31, 2009. The statute of limitations for the 2004 through 2007 tax years will expire in February 2012, unless extended. Tax years 2008 and 2009 are still open for IRS examination. See Note 19 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for a discussion of the impact in 2009 of changes to our total unrecognized tax benefits related to tax years for which the statute of limitations has expired.

The Company’s affiliates in Japan as well as Korea file
separate tax returns and are subject to audits by the local taxing authority. The general statute of limitations for Japan and Korea are five years from when the return is filed.

We do not anticipate any significant changes within the next
12 months to our total unrecognized tax benefits related to tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired.

In addition, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of the status of our tax audits, including
those of our international affiliates that file separate tax returns and are subject to the audits of the local taxing authority.



Reserves for Contingencies

A contingency is an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved
upon the occurrence of future events. Under U.S. GAAP, reserves for contingencies are required to be established when the future event is probable and its impact can be reasonably estimated. An example is the establishment of a reserve for losses in
connection with an unresolved legal matter. The initial reserve reflects management’s best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and, ultimately, when the
matter is brought to closure.

Adoption of New Accounting
Pronouncements

See Note 2 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements, including the adoption of updated authoritative guidance for disclosures related to the allowance for credit losses and the credit quality of a
company’s financing receivable portfolio, fair value disclosures, consolidation of variable interest entities, and accounting for the transfer of financial assets.

Consolidated Results of Operations

The following table summarizes net income (loss) for the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block
Business for the periods presented.



Results of Operations—Financial Services Businesses

2010 to 2009 Annual
Comparison.

Income from continuing operations for the Financial Services Businesses decreased $700 million, from $3,416 million in 2009 to $2,716 million in 2010. Results in 2009 include a $1,457 million after tax gain on
the sale of our minority joint venture interest in Wachovia Securities to Wells Fargo. Absent the effect of this item, income from continuing operations for the Financial Services Businesses for 2010 increased $757 million from 2009. Results in 2010
include net pre-tax gains associated with our general account portfolio and hedging programs, as compared to net pre-tax losses in 2009, reflecting the impact of financial market conditions in each period. In addition, results in the current year
include a net increase in premiums and policy charges and fee income, largely offset by an increase in policyholders’ benefits, including changes in reserves, reflecting business growth, as well as the impact of currency fluctuations, in our
International Insurance operations and higher life-contingent structured settlement and single premium annuity sales in our retirement business. Results in 2010 and 2009 also reflect increases in other income and benefits and expenses due to changes
in value of recorded assets and liabilities that are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. On a diluted per share basis, income from continuing operations attributable to the Financial Services Businesses for 2010 of $5.73 per share of
Common Stock decreased from $7.72 per share of Common Stock for 2009. We analyze the operating performance of the segments included in the Financial Services Businesses using “adjusted operating income” as described in “—Segment
Measures,” below. For a discussion of our segment results on this basis, see “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment,” below. In addition, for a discussion of the realized investment gains (losses),
net attributable to the Financial Services Businesses, see “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—Realized Investment Gains and Losses,” below. For additional information regarding investment
income, excluding realized investment gains (losses) see “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—General Account Investments,” below.

The direct equity adjustment increased income from continuing operations available to holders of the Common
Stock for earnings per share purposes by $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. As described more fully in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the
direct equity adjustment modifies earnings available to holders of the Common Stock and the Class B Stock for earnings per share purposes. The holders of the Common Stock will benefit from the direct equity adjustment as long as reported
administrative expenses of the Closed Block Business are less than the cash flows for administrative expenses determined by the policy servicing fee arrangement that is based upon insurance and policies in force and statutory cash premiums.
Generally, as statutory cash premiums and policies in force in the Closed Block Business decline, we expect the benefit to the Common Stock holders from the direct equity adjustment to decline accordingly. If the reported administrative expenses of
the Closed Block Business exceed the cash flows for administrative expenses determined by the policy servicing fee arrangement, the direct equity adjustment will reduce income available to holders of the Common Stock for earnings per share purposes.

2009 to 2008 Annual
Comparison.

Income (loss) from continuing operations for the Financial Services Businesses increased $4,595 million, from a loss of $1,179 million in 2008 to income of $3,416 million in 2009. Results in 2009 include a
$1,457 million after tax gain on the sale of our minority joint venture interest in Wachovia Securities to Wells Fargo. Also contributing to the increase in income was a favorable variance related to adjustments to the amortization of deferred
policy acquisition and other costs and the reserves for our variable annuity products, largely reflecting improved market conditions in 2009. In addition, income reflects an increase in other revenues, partially offset by an increase in benefits and
expenses, due to changes in value of recorded assets and recorded liabilities that are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. Results for the current year include a favorable variance in the mark-to-market of embedded derivatives and
related hedge positions associated with certain variable annuity products. This variance was largely driven by changes in our adjustment to the embedded derivative liabilities for market-perceived non-performance risk, and resulted in a related
increase in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs. Income also includes a net increase in premiums and policy charges and fee income, largely offset by an increase in policyholders’ benefits, including changes in
reserves, reflecting business growth, as well as the impact of currency fluctuations, in our International Insurance operations. On a diluted per share basis, income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to the Financial Services Businesses
for the year ended December 31, 2009 of $7.72 per share of Common Stock increased from a loss of $(2.70) per share of Common Stock for the year ended December 31, 2008. We analyze the operating performance of the segments included in the
Financial Services Businesses using

The direct equity adjustment, as described above, increased income from continuing operations available to holders of the Common Stock for earnings per share purposes by $43 million for the year ended
December 31, 2009, compared to $55 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Results of Operations—Closed Block Business

Segment Measures

In managing our business, we analyze operating performance separately for our Financial Services Businesses and our Closed Block Business.
For the Financial Services Businesses, we analyze our segments’ operating performance using “adjusted operating income.” Results of the Closed Block Business for all periods are evaluated and presented only in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. Adjusted operating income does not equate to “income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures” or “net income” as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP but
is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources, and consistent with authoritative guidance, is our measure of segment performance. The adjustments to derive adjusted operating income are
important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other
companies. However, we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying
profitability of the Financial Services Businesses.

See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the presentation of segment results and our definition of
adjusted operating income.

Effective with the
third quarter of 2010, we amended our definition of adjusted operating income as it relates to certain variable annuity contracts and defined contribution accounts that contain optional guaranteed living benefit features. Changes in the fair value
of these optional living benefit features, which are accounted for as embedded derivatives, are primarily driven by changes in the policyholders’ account balance and changes in the capital market and policyholder behavior assumptions used in
the valuation of the embedded derivatives, including equity market returns, interest rates, market volatility, benefit utilization, contract lapses, contractholder mortality, and withdrawal rates. The changes in fair value of the embedded derivative
liabilities



also reflect an increase or decrease in the market-perceived risk of our non-performance. We hedge or limit our exposure to certain risks associated with these living benefit features through a
combination of product design elements and externally purchased hedging instruments. In addition, beginning in the second quarter of 2009, we expanded our hedging program to include a portion of the market exposure related to the overall capital
position of the variable annuity business. During the second quarter of 2010, the equity component of the capital hedge within the variable annuity business was replaced with a new capital hedge program that more broadly addressed equity market
exposure of the statutory capital within the Financial Services Businesses as a whole. Changes in the value of the embedded derivatives inclusive of the market-perceived risk of our non-performance, and the related hedge positions are reported in
“Realized investment gains (losses), net.” Historically, adjusted operating income included the changes in fair value of these embedded derivatives and related hedge positions, in the period they occurred, and also included the related
impact to amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs.

Adjusted operating income under the amended definition excludes any amounts related to changes in the market value of the embedded derivatives and related hedge positions, and the related impact to
amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs. Adjusted operating income for all periods presented has been revised to conform to the amended definition. We view adjusted operating income under the amended definition as a more
meaningful presentation of our results for purposes of analyzing the operating performance of, and allocating resources to, our business segments, as the amended definition presents results on a basis more consistent with the economics of the
businesses. The accounting for these products and associated derivatives under U.S. GAAP has not changed.

Adjusted operating income under the amended definition excludes net gains of $312 million, net gains of $2 million, and net losses of $216
million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to changes in the market value of the embedded derivatives and related hedge positions, and the related impact to amortization of deferred policy acquisition
and other costs. Of the $312 million in net gains for the year ended December 31, 2010, net gains of $12 million and $2 million are reflected within the U.S. GAAP results of the Individual Annuities and Retirement segments, respectively, and
net gains of $298 million are reflected within our Corporate and Other operations.

Individual Annuities

Operating Results

The following table sets forth the Individual Annuities
segment’s operating results for the periods indicated.

(1)

Revenues exclude Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related charges and adjustments. Realized investment gains (losses), net and related adjustments include
the net impact of embedded derivatives related to our living benefit features and related hedge positions as described below. The related charges represent payments related to the market value adjustment features of certain of our annuity products.
See “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—Realized Investment Gains and Losses.”



(2)

Benefits and expenses exclude related charges which represent the unfavorable (favorable) impact of Realized investment gains (losses), net, on change in reserves and
the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements and valuation of business acquired.

In the third quarter of 2010, we amended our definition of adjusted operating income to exclude the net impact of embedded derivatives
related to our living benefit features and related hedge positions as well as market value changes of derivatives used in our capital hedge program. Adjusted operating income for all periods presented has been revised to conform with the amended
definition. See “—Consolidated Results of Operations—Segment Measures” for additional information. See “—Net impact of embedded derivatives related to our living benefit features and related hedge positions” below
for a discussion of the results of these living benefit features and related hedge positions and see “—Capital hedge program” below for a discussion of the results of the capital hedge program included in Individual Annuities results.

Adjusted Operating Income

2010 to 2009 Annual
Comparison.

Adjusted operating income increased $289 million, from $757 million in 2009 to $1,046 million in 2010. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to an increase in fee income, net of higher
distribution costs, driven by higher average variable annuity asset balances invested in separate accounts due to positive net flows and net market appreciation.

Partially offsetting the increase in adjusted operating
income was a $31 million lower benefit related to adjustments to the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products and to our estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing
deferred policy acquisition and other costs. As shown in the following table, adjusted operating income for 2010 included $348 million of benefits from these adjustments, compared to $379 million of benefits included in 2009. This variance is
discussed in more detail below.

(1)

Amounts reflect (charges) or benefits for (increases) or decreases, respectively, in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC, and other costs.

(2)

Amounts reflect (charges) or benefits for reserve (increases) or decreases, respectively, related to the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit, or GMDB / GMIB,
features of our variable annuity products.

The $103 million of benefits for 2010 relating to the quarterly market performance adjustments shown in the table above are attributable to changes to our estimate of total gross profits to reflect actual
fund performance. The following table shows the actual quarterly rate of return on variable annuity account values for the four quarters of 2010 compared to our previously expected quarterly rate of return used in our estimate of total gross
profits.

Actual returns exceeded our expected returns for 2010 which increased our estimates of total gross profits and decreased our estimate of future expected claims costs associated with the guaranteed minimum
death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products, by establishing a new, higher starting point for the



variable annuity account values used in estimating those items for future periods. The expected rates of return in 2010 for some contract groups were based upon our maximum future rate of return
under the reversion to the mean approach, as discussed below. The overall increase in our estimate of total gross profits and decrease in our estimate of future expected claims costs results in a lower required rate of amortization and lower
required reserve provisions, which are applied to all prior periods. The resulting cumulative adjustment to prior amortization and reserve provisions was a $103 million benefit for 2010 as shown in the table above.

The $331 million of benefits for 2009 relating to the
quarterly market performance adjustments is attributable to a similar impact on gross profits of market value increases in the underlying assets associated with our variable annuity products, reflecting financial market conditions during the period.
The benefit in 2009 is higher than that in 2010 due to a greater difference in 2009 between the actual rates of return and the expected rates of return, which are detailed further below. Also, the $54 million decrease in amortization of deferred
policy acquisition and other costs in 2009 is net of a $73 million charge to impair the entire remaining balance of valuation of business acquired, or VOBA, related to the variable annuity contracts acquired from Allstate in the second quarter of
2006. The additional charge was required in the first quarter of 2009, as the declines in estimated future gross profits related to market performance caused the present value of estimated gross profits for these contracts to fall below zero. Since
the VOBA balance was completely amortized for these contracts, it cannot be reestablished for market value appreciation in subsequent periods.

As discussed and shown in the table above, results for both periods also include the impact of the annual reviews of the assumptions used
in the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products and in our estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs. 2010 included $177
million of benefits from these annual reviews, primarily related to reductions in lapse rate assumptions and more favorable assumptions relating to fee income. 2009 included $49 million of charges from these annual reviews, primarily related to
reductions in the future rate of return assumptions applied to the underlying assets associated with our variable annuity products. Partially offsetting the impact of the updated future rate of return assumptions for 2009 were benefits related to
the impact of lower mortality and higher investment spread assumptions.

As mentioned above, we derive our near-term future rate of return assumptions using a reversion to the mean approach, a common industry practice. Under this approach, we consider actual returns over a
period of time and initially adjust future projected returns over a four year period so that the assets are projected to grow at the long-term expected rate of return for the entire period. The near-term future projected return across all contract
groups is 7.1% per annum as of December 31, 2010, or 1.8% per quarter. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continuing through the fourth quarter of 2010, the projected near-term future annual rate of return calculated using
the reversion to the mean approach for some contract groups was greater than our maximum future rate of return assumption across all asset types for this business. In those cases, we utilize the maximum future rate of return over the four year
period, thereby limiting the impact of the reversion to the mean on our estimate of total gross profits. The near-term blended maximum future rate of return, for these impacted contract groups, under the reversion to the mean approach is 9.6% at the
end of 2010. Included in the blended maximum future rate are assumptions for returns on various asset classes, including a 5.7% annual weighted average rate of return on fixed income investments and a 13% annual maximum rate of return on equity
investments. Further or continued market volatility could result in additional market value changes within our separate account assets and corresponding changes to our gross profits, as well as additional adjustments to the amortization of deferred
policy acquisition and other costs, and the costs relating to the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products. Given that the estimates of future gross profits are based upon our maximum
future rate of return assumption for some contract groups, all else being equal, future rates of return higher than the above mentioned future projected four year return of 7.1%, but less than the maximum future rate of return of 9.6%, may still
result in increases in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs, and the costs relating to the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products.

The $68 million benefit for 2010 and the $97 million benefit
for 2009 for the quarterly adjustments for current period experience and other updates shown in the table above primarily reflect the impact of differences between actual gross profits for the period and the previously estimated expected gross
profits for the period, as well as an update for current and future expected claims costs associated with the guaranteed minimum death and



income benefit features of our variable annuity products. To the extent each period’s actual experience differs from the previous estimate for that period, the assumed level of total gross
profits may change, and a cumulative adjustment to previous periods’ amortization, also referred to as an experience true-up adjustment, may be required in the current period. This adjustment to previous periods’ amortization is in
addition to the direct impact of actual gross profits on current period amortization and the market performance related adjustment to our estimates of gross profits for future periods. The experience true-up adjustments for deferred policy
acquisition and other costs for 2010 reflect a reduction in amortization due to better than expected gross profits, resulting primarily from higher than expected fee income. The adjustment for the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income
benefit features of our variable annuity products in 2010 primarily reflects a reserve decrease driven by lower than expected actual contract guarantee claim costs, more favorable lapse experience, and higher than expected fee income. The experience
true-up adjustments for deferred policy acquisition and other costs for 2009 reflect a reduction in amortization due to better than expected gross profits. The adjustment for the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features
of our variable annuity products in 2009 primarily reflects higher than expected fee income due to market value increases, partially offset by higher than expected actual contract guarantee claims costs due to lower than expected lapses.

2009 to 2008 Annual
Comparison.

Adjusted operating income increased $1,647 million, from a loss of $890 million in 2008 to income of $757 million in 2009. As shown in the following table, adjusted operating income for 2009 included $379
million of benefits related to adjustments to the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products and to our estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy
acquisition and other costs, compared to $1,334 million of charges included in 2008, resulting in a $1,713 million favorable variance.

(1)

Amounts reflect (charges) or benefits for (increases) or decreases, respectively, in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition, or DAC, and other costs.

(2)

Amounts reflect (charges) or benefits for reserve (increases) or decreases, respectively, related to the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit, or GMDB / GMIB,
features of our variable annuity products.

These adjustments primarily reflect the market conditions that existed in the respective periods, and the estimated impact of those market conditions on contractholder behavior, and are discussed
individually in more detail below. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in fee income, driven by lower average variable annuity asset balances invested in separate accounts. The declines in average separate account assets were due to
market depreciation and transfers of balances to the general account. The transfer of balances to our general account relates to an automatic rebalancing element, also known as an asset transfer feature, in some of our optional living benefit
features, which, as part of the overall product design, transferred approximately $10.5 billion out of the separate accounts and into the fixed-rate account in our general account from January 1, 2008 through March 31, 2009, due to equity
market declines. Subsequently, in the remainder of 2009, approximately $3.5 billion was returned from the fixed-rate account in our general account to the separate accounts by operation of the automatic rebalancing element due to market
improvements. Higher average annuity account values in investments backed by our general account resulting from these transfers also led to improved investment results, which offset the decrease in fee income.



The $331 million of benefits in 2009 relating to the quarterly market performance
adjustments shown in the table above are attributable to changes to our estimate of total gross profits to reflect actual fund performance in 2009. The following table shows the actual quarterly rate of return on variable annuity account values for
each of the quarters in 2009 compared to our previously expected quarterly rate of return used in our estimate of total gross profits.

Actual returns exceeded our expected returns for 2009 which increased our estimates of total gross profits and decreased our estimate of future expected claims costs associated with the guaranteed minimum
death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products, by establishing a new, higher starting point for the variable annuity account values used in estimating those items for future periods. The previously expected rate of return for
2009, for most contract groups, was based upon our maximum future rate of return assumption under the reversion to the mean approach. The increase in our estimate of total gross profits and decrease in our estimate of future expected claims costs
results in a lower required rate of amortization and lower required reserve provisions, which are applied to all prior periods. The resulting cumulative adjustment to prior amortization and reserve provisions are recognized in the current period.
The $1,060 million charge in 2008 is attributable to a similar but opposite impact on gross profits of market value decreases in the underlying assets associated with our variable annuity products, reflecting financial market conditions during the
period.

Included within the $576 million of
increased amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs for 2008 is a $234 million loss recognition charge to further reduce the balance of valuation of business acquired, or VOBA, related to the variable annuity contracts acquired
from Allstate. The additional charge was required in 2008 as the VOBA balance for those contracts otherwise would have been in excess of the present value of estimated future gross profits. In addition, the $54 million decrease in amortization of
deferred policy acquisition and other costs for 2009 is net of a $73 million charge to impair the entire remaining VOBA balance related to the variable annuity contracts acquired from Allstate. The additional charge was required in the first quarter
of 2009, as the declines in estimated future gross profits related to market performance caused the present value of estimated gross profits for these contracts to fall below zero. Since the VOBA balance was completely impaired for these contracts,
it cannot be reestablished for market value appreciation in subsequent periods.

As shown in the table above, results for both periods include the impact of the annual reviews of the assumptions used in the reserve for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our
variable annuity products and in our estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs. 2009 included $49 million of charges from these annual reviews, primarily related to reductions in the
future rate of return assumptions applied to the underlying assets associated with our variable annuity products. Partially offsetting the impact of the updated future rate of return assumptions were benefits related to the impact of lower mortality
and higher investment spread assumptions. Adjusted operating income for 2008 included $100 million of charges from these annual reviews, primarily reflecting increased cost of expected income and death benefit claims due to lower expected lapse
rates for policies where the current policyholder account value is below the guaranteed minimum death benefit.

The quarterly adjustments for current period experience shown in the table above reflect the impact of differences between actual gross
profits for the period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for the period, as well as an update for current and future expected claims costs associated with the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable
annuity products. To the extent each period’s actual experience differs from the previous estimate for that period, the assumed level of total gross profits may change, and a cumulative adjustment to previous periods’ amortization, also
referred to as an experience true-up adjustment, may be required in the current period. This adjustment to previous periods’ amortization is in addition to the direct impact of actual gross profits on current period amortization and the market
performance related adjustment to our estimates of gross profits for future periods. The experience true-up adjustments for deferred policy acquisition and other costs in 2009 reflect a reduction in amortization due to better than expected gross
profits. The experience true-up adjustment for the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit



features of our variable annuity products in 2009 primarily reflects higher than expected fee income due to market value increases, partially offset by higher than expected actual contract
guarantee claims costs due to lower than expected lapses. Less favorable than expected gross profits in 2008 were primarily due to lower than expected fee income and higher actual contract guarantee claims costs in 2008, primarily driven by
unfavorable financial market conditions.

Revenues

2010 to 2009 Annual Comparison.

Revenues, as shown in the table above under “—Operating
Results,” increased $680 million, from $2,515 million in 2009 to $3,195 million in 2010. Policy charges and fees and asset management fees and other income increased $703 million primarily due to higher average variable annuity asset balances
invested in separate accounts. The increase in average separate account asset balances was due to positive net flows, net market appreciation, and net transfers of balances from the general account to the separate accounts during 2010. The transfer
of balances from the general account relates to both transfers from a customer elected dollar cost averaging program of approximately $2.2 billion and approximately $0.4 billion of net transfers primarily from the automatic rebalancing element, also
referred to as an asset transfer feature, in some of our optional living benefit features. The automatic rebalancing element is part of the overall product design, and as a result of market improvements, transferred balances out of the fixed-rate
account in our general account to the separate accounts during 2010. Premiums also increased $78 million driven by an increase in annuitizations primarily from contracts with the guaranteed minimum income benefit feature. Partially offsetting the
increase in revenues was a decrease in net investment income of $101 million, reflecting lower average annuity account values in the general account also resulting from transfers from the fixed-rate account in the general account to the separate
accounts as discussed above.

2009 to
2008 Annual Comparison.

Revenues increased $78 million, from $2,437 million in 2008 to $2,515 million in 2009. Net investment income increased $179 million, reflecting higher average annuity account values in the general
account, resulting from the transfer of balances to the fixed-rate account in our general account relating to the automatic rebalancing element in some of our optional living benefit features. Partially offsetting the increase in net investment
income was a decrease of $125 million in policy charges and fees and asset management fees and other income driven by a decrease in fee income reflecting lower average variable annuity asset balances invested in separate accounts. The decline in
average separate account asset balances was due to net market depreciation and the transfer of balances to the fixed-rate account in our general account as mentioned above.

Benefits and Expenses

2010 to 2009 Annual
Comparison.

Benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased $391 million, from $1,758 million in 2009 to $2,149 million in 2010. Absent the net $31 million increase
related to the adjustments to the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products and to our estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other
costs, benefits and expenses increased $360 million. Excluding these adjustments, general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, increased $240 million primarily driven by higher distribution and asset management costs, reflecting
higher average variable annuity asset balances invested in separate accounts and higher variable annuity sales. Interest expense also increased $53 million driven by higher intercompany borrowings to fund operating costs and new business sales. The
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, excluding the adjustments noted above, increased $36 million reflecting the impact of higher gross profits used as a basis for amortization driven by higher fee income. Excluding the adjustments
noted above, insurance and annuity benefits increased $34 million driven by an increase in annuitizations primarily from contracts with the guaranteed minimum income benefit feature partially offset by lower reserves on the guaranteed minimum death
and income benefit features due to the impact of favorable markets on account values during 2010. Lower interest credited to policyholders’ account balances driven by lower average annuity account values in the fixed-rate accounts of the
general account was mostly offset by higher amortization of deferred sales inducements, reflecting the impact of higher gross profits primarily from fee income.



2009 to 2008 Annual Comparison

Benefits and expenses decreased
$1,569 million, from $3,327 million in 2008 to $1,758 million in 2009. Absent the net $1,713 million decrease related to the adjustments to the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products
and to our estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs, benefits and expenses increased $144 million. Excluding these adjustments, interest credited to policyholders’ account
balances increased $130 million primarily reflecting higher average annuity account values in our general account, resulting from transfers relating to an automatic rebalancing element in some of our optional living benefit features, and higher
amortization of deferred sales inducements, reflecting the higher rate of amortization applied to gross profits in calculating amortization for 2009, due to the negative market performance adjustments recognized during 2008. Excluding the
adjustments noted above, policyholders’ benefits, including changes in reserves, increased $129 million primarily reflecting higher actual and expected contract guarantee claims costs related to the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and
income benefit features of our variable annuity products. The amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased $82 million, excluding the adjustments noted above, also reflecting the higher rate of amortization for 2009, as discussed
above. Partially offsetting these increases was a $152 million decrease in general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, absent the effect of the items mentioned above, and a $45 million decrease in interest expense. The decrease in
general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, excluding the adjustments noted above, reflects a favorable variance related to the $97 million goodwill impairment recognized in 2008, and lower amortization of VOBA subsequent to the
complete impairment in the first quarter of 2009 of balances related to the variable annuity contracts acquired from Allstate, as discussed above. The decrease in interest expense reflects paydowns of intercompany debt, which were funded with
affiliated capital contributions.

Account Values

The following table sets forth changes in account values for the individual annuity business, for the periods indicated. For our
individual annuity business, assets are reported at account value, and net sales (redemptions) are gross sales minus redemptions or surrenders and withdrawals, as applicable. Gross sales do not correspond to revenues under U.S. GAAP, but are used as
a relevant measure of business activity.

Variable annuities include only those sold as retail investment products. Investments sold through defined contribution plan products are included with such products
within the Retirement segment.



(2)

Includes cumulative reclassifications of $267 million in 2010 and $259 million in 2009 from variable annuity to fixed annuity account values to conform presentation of
certain contracts in annuitization status to current reporting practices.

(3)

As of December 31, 2010, variable annuity account values are invested in equity funds ($56 billion or 55%), bond funds ($29 billion or 28%), market value adjusted
or fixed-rate accounts ($9 billion or 9%), and other ($8 billion or 8%).

2010 to 2009 Annual Comparison

Total account values for fixed and variable annuities amounted to $106.2 billion as of December 31, 2010, representing an increase of
$22.2 billion from December 31, 2009. The increase was driven by positive variable annuity net flows and increases in the market value of customers’ variable annuities due to favorable equity markets for 2010. Individual variable annuity
gross sales momentum continued in 2010 as sales increased by $5.5 billion, from $16.1 billion in 2009 to $21.6 billion in 2010. The increase reflects our product strength, customer value proposition, and position as the primary provider of living
benefit guarantees based on highest daily customer account value as well as the further expansion of our distribution networks. Additionally, we have benefited from some of our competitors implementing product modifications to increase pricing and
scale back product features due to market disruptions in late 2008 and the first half of 2009. Although we have implemented similar modifications, we believe that our product offerings have remained competitively positioned and expect our living
benefit features will provide us an attractive risk and profitability profile, as all of our currently-offered optional living benefit features include the automatic rebalancing element described below. Individual variable annuity surrenders and
withdrawals increased by $1.1 billion, from $5.8 billion in 2009 to $6.9 billion in 2010, reflecting the overall impact of higher account values in the current year due to market appreciation over the past twelve months.

2009 to 2008 Annual
Comparison

Total account values for fixed and variable annuities amounted to $84.0 billion as of December 31, 2009, an increase of $20.7 billion from December 31, 2008. The increase came primarily from increases
in the market value of customers’ variable annuities due to equity market appreciation and from positive variable annuity net flows. Individual variable annuity gross sales increased by $5.9 billion, from $10.2 billion in 2008 to $16.1 billion
in 2009. The increase reflects a benefit from the impact of market disruptions on some of our competitors, certain of which implemented product modifications to increase pricing and scale back product features in the second and third quarters of
2009. We also experienced increased sales in the third quarter of 2009 related to certain optional living benefit features which we previously announced would be discontinued during the third quarter of 2009. Individual variable annuity surrenders
and withdrawals decreased by $2.2 billion, from $8.0 billion in 2008 to $5.8 billion in 2009, reflecting the overall impact of lower account values in the first half of 2009 due to market depreciation and lower lapses for policies where the current
policyholder account value is below the guaranteed minimum death or living benefit value.

Variable Annuity Net Amount at Risk

As a result of the volatility and disruption in the global financial markets, in recent years we have seen significant volatility in the net amounts at risk embedded in our variable annuity products with
riders that include optional living and guaranteed minimum death benefit features. The net amount at risk is generally defined as the present value of the guaranteed minimum benefit amount in excess of the contractholder’s current account
balance. As part of our risk management strategy, we hedge or limit our exposure to certain of the risks associated with our variable annuity products primarily through a combination of product design elements, such as an automatic rebalancing
element, and externally purchased hedging instruments. Our hedging programs are discussed below in “—Net impact of embedded derivatives related to our living benefit features and related hedge positions” and “—Capital hedge
program.” The rate of return we realize from our variable annuity contracts can vary by contract based on our risk management strategy, including the impact on any capital markets movements that we may hedge, the impact on that portion of our
variable annuity contracts that benefit from the automatic rebalancing element, and the impact of risks that are not able to be hedged.

The automatic rebalancing element, included in the design of certain optional living benefits, transfers assets between the variable
investments selected by the annuity contractholder and, depending on the benefit feature, the fixed-rate account in the general account or a bond portfolio within the separate account. The transfers are based on the static mathematical formula used
with the particular optional benefit which considers a number of factors, including the impact of investment performance on the contractholder’s total account value. In general, negative investment performance may result in transfers to either
the fixed-rate account in the general account or a bond portfolio within the separate account, and positive investment performance may result in transfers back to



contractholder-selected investments. Overall, the automatic rebalancing element is designed to help mitigate our exposure to equity market risk and market volatility. Beginning in 2009, our
offerings of optional living benefit features associated with currently-sold variable annuity products all include an automatic rebalancing element, and in 2009 we discontinued any new sales of optional living benefit features without an automatic
rebalancing element.

Variable annuity account
values with living benefit features were $75.1 billion, $52.5 billion and $33.1 billion as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The following table sets forth the account values of our variable annuities with living benefit
features and the net amounts at risk of the living benefit features split between those that include an automatic rebalancing element and those that do not, as of the dates indicated.

(1)

As of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, asset values that have rebalanced to the general account or a separate account bond portfolio due to the automatic
rebalancing element represent 12% or $6.7 billion of the $57.3 billion total account value, 23% or $8.2 billion of the $34.9 billion total account value, and 78% or $13.8 billion of the $17.7 billion total account value, respectively.

The increase in account values that
included an automatic rebalancing element in 2010 compared to the prior years, reflects sales of our latest product offerings which include this feature, as well as the impact on account values of overall favorable equity markets since the prior
periods. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 76% of variable annuity account values with living benefit features included an automatic rebalancing element in the product design, compared to 67% and 53% as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.

Favorable market conditions for the
year ended December 31, 2010 drove the decrease in total net amount at risk compared to the prior years. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 40% of the net amount at risk associated with variable annuity account values with living
benefit features included an automatic rebalancing element in the product design, compared to 28% as of December 31, 2009 and 21% as of December 31, 2008.

Our guaranteed minimum death benefits guarantee a minimum
return on the contract value or an enhanced value, if applicable, to be used solely for purposes of determining benefits payable in the event of death. All of the $75.1 billion, $52.5 billion and $33.1 billion of variable annuity account values with
living benefit features as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, also contain guaranteed minimum death benefits. An additional $24.0 billion, $24.4 billion and $23.3 billion of variable annuity account values, respectively, contain
guaranteed minimum death benefits, but no living benefit features. Certain account values with guaranteed minimum death benefits are affected by an automatic rebalancing element because the contractholder selected a living benefit feature which
includes an automatic rebalancing element. The following table sets forth the account values of our variable annuities with guaranteed minimum death benefits and the net amount at risk of the guaranteed minimum death benefits split between those
that are affected by an automatic rebalancing element and those that are not, as of the dates indicated.



As of December 31, 2010 approximately 58% of variable annuity account values with
guaranteed minimum death benefits were affected by an automatic rebalancing element because the contractholder selected a living benefit feature which includes an automatic rebalancing element as part of the living benefit feature design, compared
to 45% and 31% as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of December 31, 2010 approximately 11% of the net amount at risk associated with variable annuity account values with guaranteed minimum death benefits were affected by an
automatic rebalancing element in the product design, compared to 9% and 11% as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Net impact of embedded derivatives related to our living benefit features and related hedge positions

As mentioned above, in addition to our automatic rebalancing
element, we also manage certain risks associated with our variable annuity products through our hedging programs. In our living benefit hedging program, we purchase equity options and futures as well as interest rate derivatives to hedge certain
living benefit features accounted for as embedded derivatives against changes in equity markets, interest rates, and market volatility. Historically, our hedging strategy sought to generally match the sensitivities of the embedded derivative
liability as defined by GAAP, excluding the impact of the market-perceived risk of our own non-performance, with capital market derivatives and options. In the third quarter of 2010, we revised our hedging strategy as, in the low interest rate
environment, we do not believe the GAAP value of the embedded derivative liability to be an appropriate measure for determining the hedge target. Our new hedge target continues to be grounded in a GAAP/capital markets valuation framework but
incorporates modifications to the risk-free return assumption to account for the fact that the underlying customer separate account funds which support these living benefits are invested in assets that contain risk. The modifications include the
removal of a volatility risk margin embedded in the valuation technique used to fair value the embedded derivative liability under GAAP, and the inclusion of a credit spread over the risk-free rate used to estimate future growth of bond investments
in the customer separate account funds. This new strategy will result in differences each period between the change in the value of the embedded derivative liability as defined by GAAP and the change in the value of the hedge positions, potentially
increasing volatility in GAAP earnings. In addition, consistent with sound risk management practices, we evaluate hedge levels versus our target given overall capital considerations of the Company and prevailing capital market conditions and may
decide to temporarily hedge to an amount that differs from our hedge target definition. Because this decision is based on the overall capital considerations of the Company as a whole, the impact on results from temporarily hedging to an amount that
differs from our hedge target definition is reported through Corporate and Other operations.

Historically, adjusted operating income included the net impact of both the change in fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities associated with our living benefit features and the change in fair
value of the related derivative hedge positions, as well as the related impact to the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs. In light of management’s decision to change the hedge target, as discussed above, in the third
quarter of 2010, we amended our definition of adjusted operating income to exclude changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities and the related derivative hedge positions, as well as the related amortization of deferred policy
acquisition and other costs. The net impact of both the change in fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities associated with our living benefit features and the change in fair value of the related derivative hedge positions are included in
“Realized investment gains (losses), net and related adjustments” and the related impact to the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs is included in “Related charges.” See “—Consolidated Results of
Operations—Segment Measures” for additional information.



The following table shows the net impact of changes in the embedded derivative liabilities,
as defined by GAAP, and hedge positions, as well as the related amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 for the Individual Annuities segment.

(1)

Represents the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative liability as defined by GAAP, excluding the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative
liabilities due to updates to the assumptions used in the valuation of the liability and the impact of the market-perceived risk of our own non-performance.

(2)

Represents the impact from temporarily hedging to an amount that differs from our hedge target definition.

(3)

As of December 31, 2010, our adjustment for the market’s perception of our own risk of non-performance resulted in a $723 million decrease to the embedded
derivative liability.

(4)

Net benefit/(charge) from the mark-to-market of embedded derivatives and related hedge positions are excluded from adjusted operating income and included in operating
results in “Realized investment gains (losses), net and related adjustments.”

(5)

Related benefit/(charge) to amortization of DAC and other costs is excluded from adjusted operating income and included in operating results in “Related
charges.”

In 2010, the net
impact from the mark-to-market of our embedded derivatives and related hedge positions for the Individual Annuities segment was a benefit of $37 million partially offset by a $4 million increase in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and
other costs resulting from the corresponding impact to current period gross profits. Excluding the updates of the assumptions used in the valuation of the embedded derivatives, which are discussed below, and excluding the related amortization of
deferred policy acquisition and other costs, the hedging activities resulted in a $527 million net benefit in 2010 for the Individual Annuities segment. $387 million of the $527 million net benefit in 2010 is attributable to the difference between
the change in the target hedge liability and the change in the fair value of the liability as defined by GAAP. As described above, because the value of our new hedge target does not equal the value of embedded derivative liability as defined by
GAAP, our net hedging results will be impacted each period by the difference between the changes in the two values. The remaining $140 million of the $527 million net benefit is primarily driven by results prior to the implementation of our new
hedging strategy related to differences in the actual performance of the underlying separate account funds relative to the performance of the market indices we utilized as a basis for developing our hedging strategy. Given the sensitivity of the
fair value of the embedded derivative to current financial market conditions as well as the new hedging strategy which targets a liability different from that defined by GAAP, differences between the fair value of the embedded derivative as defined
by GAAP and related hedge positions for a given period will be largely dependent on the financial market conditions throughout the period. For additional information regarding the methodology used in determining the fair value of the embedded
derivatives associated with our living benefit features, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “—Valuation of Assets and Liabilities—Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities—Variable Annuity Optional Living Benefit
Features.”

As shown above, the net impact
from the mark-to-market of our embedded derivatives and related hedge positions for 2010 also includes the impact of updates to the assumptions used in the valuation of the embedded derivative liabilities resulting in a $902 million charge. This
charge represents an increase to the embedded



derivative liability primarily driven by reductions in the expected lapse rate assumption based on evolving experience. Additionally, beginning in 2009, we include an adjustment to the embedded
derivative liability to reflect the market’s perception of our own risk of non-performance. To reflect the market’s perception of our own risk of non-performance, we incorporate an additional spread over LIBOR into the discount rate used
in the valuation of the embedded derivative liabilities. This additional spread is applied at an individual contract level and only to those embedded derivatives in a liability position and not to those in a contra-liability position. For additional
information regarding the methodology for calculating the impact of the market-perceived risk of our non-performance, see “—Valuation of Assets and Liabilities—Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities—Variable Annuity Optional Living
Benefit Features.” As shown in the table above, 2010 includes a $412 million benefit related to this adjustment primarily resulting from an increase in the fair value of embedded derivatives in a liability position reflecting an increase in the
present value of future expected benefit payments driven by lower interest rates as well as a reduction in the expected lapse rate assumption.

In 2009 and 2008, the net impact from the mark-to-market of our embedded derivatives and related hedge positions was a benefit of $536
million and a net charge of $438 million, respectively. A corresponding impact to current period gross profits related to these impacts led to an offsetting increase in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs of $410 million
in 2009 and a decrease in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs of $251 million in 2008. Excluding the updates of the assumptions used in the valuation of the embedded derivatives, which are discussed below and excluding
the related amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs, the hedging activities resulted in a $334 million benefit in 2009 and a $524 million charge in 2008. Variances for both periods are primarily driven by differences in the
actual performance of the underlying separate account funds relative to the performance of the market indices we utilize as a basis for developing our hedging strategy.

As shown above, the net impact from the mark-to-market of our
embedded derivatives and related hedge positions for 2009 and 2008 also includes the impact of updates to the assumptions used in the valuation of the embedded derivative liabilities. The charge of $110 million for 2009 represents an increase to the
embedded derivative liability primarily driven by reductions in the expected lapse rate assumption based on evolving experience partially offset by a decrease in the liability driven by an update of the equity volatility assumption to better match
the actual equity indices referenced. The benefit of $86 million in 2008 represents a decrease to the embedded derivative liability primarily driven by an update of the equity volatility assumption to better match the actual equity indices
referenced. Additionally, beginning in 2009, we included an adjustment to the embedded derivative liability to reflect the market’s perception of our own risk of non-performance, as described above. 2009 includes a $312 million benefit related
to this update.

Capital hedge program

In the second quarter of 2009, we began the
expansion of our hedging program to include a portion of the market exposure related to the overall capital position of our variable annuity business, including the impact of certain statutory reserve exposures. These capital hedges, which primarily
consisted of equity-based total return swaps, were designed to partially offset changes in our capital position resulting from market driven changes in certain living and death benefit features of our variable annuity products. During the second
quarter of 2010, we removed the equity component of our capital hedge within the Individual Annuities segment by terminating the equity-based total return swaps, as part of a new program to more broadly address the equity market exposure of the
statutory capital of the Company as a whole, under stress scenarios. Since the new program incorporates capital implications across a number of businesses, the results of that program are reported within Corporate and Other operations. Consequently,
see “—Corporate and Other” for a discussion of the results of the current program. See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Liquidity and Capital Resources of Subsidiaries—Domestic Insurance Subsidiaries” for a
further discussion of the capital hedge program. The results of the Individual Annuities segment for 2010 included $21 million of mark-to-market losses on these capital hedges prior to their termination. The results of the Individual Annuities
segment for 2009 included $180 million of mark-to-market losses on these capital hedges driven by favorable market conditions during the year which resulted in an increase in our capital position. The results of these hedges are included in
“Realized investment gains (losses), net and related adjustments” and have been excluded from adjusted operating income. See “—Consolidated Results of Operations—Segment Measures” for additional information. We continue
to assess the composition of the hedging program on an ongoing basis.

See “—Investment Gains and Losses on Trading Account Assets Supporting Insurance Liabilities and Changes in Experience-Rated Contractholder Liabilities Due to Asset Value Changes.”

On October 10, 2008, we acquired MullinTBG Insurance
Agency Services, LLC and related entities, or MullinTBG, a provider of executive benefit solutions and financing strategies, including nonqualified executive deferred compensation plans. The acquisition included $8.9 billion of nonqualified full
service retirement account values that we administer, which are not reported on our balance sheet.

In the third quarter of 2010, we amended our definition of adjusted operating income to exclude the net impact of embedded derivatives related to our living benefit features and related hedge positions as
well as market value changes of derivatives used in our capital hedge program. Adjusted operating income for all periods presented has been revised to conform with the amended definition. See “—Consolidated Results of
Operations—Segment Measures” for additional information.

Adjusted Operating Income

2010 to 2009 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income increased $78 million, from $494 million in 2009 to $572 million in 2010, primarily reflecting higher asset-based
fee income and improved net investment spread results partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, and a less favorable benefit from reserve refinements. Each item is further discussed below.

Higher asset-based fees were driven by an
increase in average full service fee-based retirement account values and higher fee-based investment-only stable value account values in our institutional investment products business. The increase in average full service fee-based retirement
account values was driven by market appreciation and net additions. Higher fee-based investment-only stable value account values in our institutional investment products business were driven by net additions due to our market positioning.

Improved net investment spread results were
driven by lower crediting rates on general account liabilities in our full service business and increased income from equity method investments driven by mark-to-market gains



in 2010 compared to mark-to-market losses in 2009. Lower crediting rates on general account liabilities in our full service business resulted from rate resets in the third quarter of 2009 and
first quarter of 2010. Our ability to maintain current net spreads in our full service business in future periods is impacted by the levels of interest rates, the pace and extent of changes in interest rates, competitor pricing, and the minimum
guaranteed crediting rates on our general account stable value products. Also contributing to the increase in net investment spread results were increased net settlements on floating rate to fixed rate interest rate swaps used to manage the duration
of the investment portfolio. The increase in net swap settlements resulted from the generally favorable impact of lower interest rates on the swaps used to manage the duration of the investment portfolio primarily for our institutional investment
products business. As we continued to manage the duration gap between assets and liabilities within our risk management framework, the use of interest rate swaps to increase the duration of the investment portfolio, primarily in our institutional
investment products business, grew in 2009 as the duration of the investment portfolio excluding the impact of swaps declined during 2009, relative to the liabilities, as a result of purchases of fixed income securities with shorter durations than
the durations of our liabilities and higher levels of cash and short-term investments. Although the notional amounts of these swaps on average for 2010 are relatively unchanged from 2009, the amounts have declined in the latter half of 2010 as lower
levels of cash and short-term investments and purchases of fixed income securities with durations more closely matched to our liabilities reduced the duration gap between our assets and liabilities. Future net investment spread results could be
impacted if interest rates or the notional amounts of these swaps change. Partially offsetting the improvement in net investment spread results was the negative impact of a lower base of invested assets in our general account reflecting scheduled
withdrawals from guaranteed investment products in our institutional investment products business partially offset by the positive impact of net additions in our structured settlement product and increases in balances in our full service general
account stable value products. If we are unable to replace scheduled withdrawals of guaranteed investment products, including GICs, funding agreements, retail notes, and institutional notes, with new additions, net investment spread results in
future periods may be negatively impacted. For further discussion of our sales, see “—Sales Results and Account Values.”

Partially offsetting these increases in adjusted operating income was an increase in general and administrative expenses, net of
capitalization, driven by expenses incurred in 2010 related to certain cost reduction initiatives. Also partially offsetting these increases in adjusted operating income was a less favorable benefit from reserve refinements, primarily due to a
benefit in 2009 related to updates of client census data on our group annuity blocks of business.

Results for both 2010 and 2009 also include the impact of an annual review of the assumptions used in our estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs
and valuation of business acquired, as well as the impact of our quarterly adjustments to total gross profits for current period experience. Adjusted operating income for 2010 and 2009 included charges of $18 million and $3 million, respectively,
from the annual reviews. The quarterly adjustments for current period experience resulted in an $11 million benefit in 2010 compared to a $5 million charge in 2009, reflecting the cumulative impact on amortization of differences between actual gross
profits for the period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for the period. Together, these items resulted in net charges included in adjusted operating income of $7 million for 2010 and $8 million in 2009. The net charge of $7
million in 2010 was driven by changes in lapse rate and fee-based profit margin assumptions which both decreased expected future gross profits.

2009 to 2008 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income decreased $51 million, from $545 million in 2008
to $494 million in 2009. Results for both periods include the impact of an annual review of the assumptions used in our estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs and valuation of business
acquired, as well as the impact of our quarterly adjustments to total gross profits for current period experience. Adjusted operating income for 2009 included a $3 million charge from the annual review, compared to a $21 million charge in 2008. The
charge in 2008 primarily reflected a decrease in our estimate of future gross profits, including a decline in our asset-based profit assumptions and an increase in our expense assumptions. The quarterly updates for actual experience resulted in a $5
million of charge in 2009 and a $23 million benefit in 2008, reflecting the cumulative impact on amortization of differences between actual gross profits for the period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for the period. In addition,
2008 included a $29 million benefit from a reduction in the amortization of valuation of business acquired due to a cumulative adjustment relating to the calculation of actual and expected gross profits. Together, these items resulted in a net
charge of $8 million in 2009 and a net benefit of $31 million in 2008.



Excluding the items discussed above, adjusted operating income decreased $12 million
compared to 2008 reflecting a decrease in adjusted operating income for our institutional investment products business and relatively unchanged adjusted operating income in our full service business. The decrease in our institutional investment
products business primarily reflects a less favorable benefit from reserve refinements of $44 million, primarily due to a smaller benefit in 2009 related to updates of client census data on our group annuity blocks of business, as well as less
favorable case experience related to our group annuity blocks of business. Partially offsetting this decrease were improved net investment spread results and a favorable variance in the mark-to-market of equity investments required in certain of our
separate account products. The increase in net investment spread results was primarily due to increased net settlements on interest rate swaps used to manage the duration of the investment portfolio, and the impact of the maturity of a single large
guaranteed investment contract which had an interest crediting rate substantially in excess of our general account invested asset yield. The increase in net swap settlements resulted from a higher notional amount of swaps used to manage the duration
of the investment portfolio and the generally favorable impact of lower interest rates on those swaps. As we continued to manage the duration gap between assets and liabilities within our risk management framework, the use of interest rate swaps to
increase the duration of the investment portfolio grew in 2009 as the duration of the investment portfolio excluding the impact of swaps declined. The investment portfolio duration had generally declined relative to the liabilities as a result of
purchases of fixed income securities with shorter duration than the duration of our liabilities and higher levels of short-term investments discussed below. Partially offsetting these increases in investment results was a lower benefit from the
accretion into net investment income of fixed maturity other-than-temporary impairments recognized in previous periods. Such accretion did not contribute to results for 2009 due to our adoption of new authoritative guidance related to fixed maturity
other-than-temporary impairments on January 1, 2009. Also serving as partial offsets were a lower base of invested assets in our general account reflecting scheduled withdrawals of our guaranteed investment products and lower yields, including
the impact of declining short-term interest rates and a higher balance of investments in lower yielding assets, such as cash and short-term investments, for liquidity purposes. Higher levels of short-term liquidity were maintained in 2009 to provide
additional capacity to address changing cash needs in light of market conditions during that period.

Results of our full service business in 2009 compared to 2008 benefited from improved net investment spread results, driven by higher net
yields due to the impact of lower crediting rates on general account liabilities, resulting from rate resets, as well as higher average invested assets in our general account reflecting full service participant transfers from our equity based
separate account and mutual fund products to our general account stable value products. Serving to mostly offset these increases were lower asset-based fees, due to a decrease in average full service fee-based retirement account values, primarily
resulting from equity market depreciation and full service participant transfers from our equity based separate account and mutual fund products to our general account stable value products, as well as fee concessions made to certain existing
clients. Although account value declines in 2008 and early 2009 due to equity market depreciation were partially offset by large plan sales, in some instances these cases provide for more limited product offerings than existing business, and
consequently a lower contribution to asset-based fees.

Revenues

2010 to 2009 Annual Comparison.

Revenues, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased $524 million, from $4,659 million in 2009 to $5,183
million in 2010. Premiums increased $464 million, driven by higher life-contingent structured settlement and single premium annuity sales which resulted in a corresponding increase in policyholders’ benefits, including the change in policy
reserves, as discussed below. Policy charges and fee income and asset management fees and other income increased $131 million, primarily driven by an increase in asset-based fees due to an increase in average full service fee-based retirement
account values and an increase in fee-based investment-only stable value account values in our institutional investment products business, as well as increased income from net settlements on interest rate swaps, as discussed above.

Partially offsetting these increases was a $71 million
decrease in net investment income, primarily reflecting a smaller base of invested assets resulting from scheduled withdrawals of our general account guaranteed investment products in our institutional investment products business, and lower
portfolio yields, including lower interest rates on floating rate investments due to rate resets. Partially offsetting these declines were increases in net investment income from an increase in income on equity method investments as discussed above.



2009 to 2008 Annual Comparison.

Revenues decreased $200
million, from $4,859 million in 2008 to $4,659 million in 2009. Net investment income decreased $255 million, primarily reflecting lower portfolio yields, including lower interest rates on floating rate investments due to rate resets and the impact
of a higher balance of investments in lower yielding assets, such as cash and short-term investments, for liquidity purposes, as discussed above. Also contributing to the decline in net investment income was a smaller base of invested assets related
to our guaranteed investment products, due to maturities, and a lower benefit from the accretion into net investment income of fixed maturity other-than-temporary impairments recognized in previous periods, as discussed above. Partially offsetting
these declines were increases in net investment income from a larger base of invested assets in our full service business, primarily driven by participant transfers from our equity based separate account and mutual fund products to our general
account stable value products, and a favorable variance in the mark-to-market of equity investments required in certain of our separate account products.

Partially offsetting the decline in net investment income was a $43 million increase in policy charges and fee income and asset management
fees and other income, primarily relating to higher net settlements on interest rate swaps used to manage the duration of the investment portfolio, as discussed above. Also contributing to the increase in policy charges and fee income and asset
management fees and other income was a $35 million increase in revenues associated with the acquired operations of MullinTBG. Partially offsetting these increases in policy charges and fee income and asset management fees and other income was a
decline in asset-based fees in our full service business driven by a decrease in average full service fee-based retirement account values, primarily resulting from equity market depreciation and full service participant transfers from our equity
based separate account and mutual fund products to our general account stable value products, as well as fee concessions made to certain existing clients, partially offset by large plan sales, as discussed above. In addition, premiums increased $12
million, driven by higher life-contingent structured settlement sales, partially offset by lower single premium group annuity sales, which resulted in a corresponding increase in policyholders’ benefits, including the change in policy reserves,
as discussed below.

Benefits and Expenses

2010 to 2009 Annual
Comparison.

Benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased $446 million, from $4,165 million in 2009 to $4,611 million in 2010. Policyholders’ benefits,
including the change in policy reserves, increased $468 million, primarily reflecting an increase in change in policy reserves associated with the increase in premiums and a less favorable benefit from reserve refinements, as discussed above. Also,
general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, increased $67 million primarily driven by higher commission expenses, net of capitalization, higher asset management costs due to an increase in average full service fee-based retirement
account values, and expenses incurred in 2010 related to certain cost reduction initiatives. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest credited to policyholders’ account balances of $73 million, primarily reflecting a
smaller base of account values resulting from scheduled withdrawals of our general account guaranteed investment products in our institutional investment products business, lower crediting rates on floating rate guaranteed investment products, and
lower crediting rates on full service stable value account values due to rate resets. In addition, interest expense decreased $12 million reflecting lower interest rates and lower borrowings used to support investments.

2009 to 2008 Annual
Comparison.

Benefits and expenses decreased $149 million, from $4,314 million in 2008 to $4,165 million in 2009. Absent the impact of the annual reviews and other adjustments to the amortization of deferred policy
acquisition costs and valuation of business acquired discussed above, which account for a $39 million increase, benefits and expenses decreased $188 million. Interest credited to policyholders’ account balances decreased $237 million, primarily
reflecting lower crediting rates on floating rate guaranteed investment products, the impact of maturities within our guaranteed investment products and lower crediting rates on full service stable value product liabilities due to rate resets,
partially offset by the impact of higher full service general account stable value product account values due to participant transfers from equity based separate account and mutual fund products. In addition, interest expense decreased $60 million,
reflecting lower interest rates and lower borrowings used to support investments. Partially offsetting these decreases, policyholders’ benefits, including the change in policy reserves, increased $59 million, primarily reflecting a less
favorable benefit from reserve refinements, as discussed above, and the increase in reserves associated with the increase in premiums discussed above, partially offset by lower interest on lower general account policy reserves. General and
administrative expenses, net of capitalization, increased $54 million



excluding the impact of the annual reviews and other adjustments mentioned above, driven by a $39 million increase in costs related to the acquired operations of MullinTBG, as well as expenses
incurred to support several large client sales, partially offset by the absence of the costs of an interim service agreement relating to the retirement business acquired from Union Bank of California, N.A. and a $12 million charge for one-time costs
associated with certain cost reduction programs, which were included in 2008.

Sales Results and Account Values

The following table shows the changes in the account values and net additions (withdrawals) of Retirement segment products for the periods indicated. Net additions (withdrawals) are deposits and sales or
additions, as applicable, minus withdrawals and benefits. These concepts do not correspond to revenues under U.S. GAAP, but are used as a relevant measure of business activity.

(1)

Ending total account value for the full service business includes assets of Prudential’s retirement plan of $5.8 billion, $5.4 billion and $4.6 billion as of
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

(2)

On October 10, 2008 we acquired MullinTBG, as discussed above.

(3)

Ending total account value for the institutional investment products business includes assets of Prudential’s retirement plan of $5.4 billion, $5.2 billion and
$5.3 billion as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Ending total account value for the institutional investments products business also includes $1.5 billion as of both December 31, 2010 and 2009 related to collateralized
funding agreements issued to the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (FHLBNY), and $1.0 billion, $1.8 billion and $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to affiliated funding agreements issued using the
proceeds from the sale of Prudential Financial retail medium-term notes. For additional information regarding the FHLBNY and the retail medium-term notes program see, “—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

(4)

Additions include $500 million and $700 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively, representing transfers of externally-managed client balances to accounts we manage.
These additions are offset within Other, as there is no net impact on ending account values for these transfers.

(5)

Withdrawals and benefits include $(752) million and $(488) million for 2010 and 2009, respectively, representing transfers of client balances from accounts we managed
to externally-managed accounts. These withdrawals are offset within Other, as there is no net impact on ending account values for this transfer.

(6)

Other includes transfers from (to) the Asset Management segment of $(164) million, $(11) million and $432 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Other also
includes $752 million, $(12) million and $(700) million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, representing net transfers of externally-managed client balances from/(to) accounts we manage. These transfers are offset within Additions or Withdrawals
and benefits, as there is no net impact on ending account values for this transfer. Other also includes $1,500 million for 2009 representing collateralized funding agreements issued to the FHLBNY and $(1,522) million for 2009 representing
terminations of affiliated funding agreements utilizing proceeds from the issuances to FHLBNY. Remaining amounts for all periods presented primarily represent changes in asset balances for externally-managed accounts.



2010 to 2009 Annual Comparison.

Account values in our full
service business amounted to $141.3 billion as of December 31, 2010, an increase of $15.0 billion from December 31, 2009 primarily driven by an increase in the market value of customer funds due to favorable equity markets and, to a lesser
extent, net additions in 2010. Net additions decreased $6.3 billion, from $8.8 billion in 2009 to $2.5 billion in 2010, primarily reflecting lower new plan sales, as 2009 included significant large plan sales, and, to a lesser extent, higher plan
lapses. New plan sales in 2010 included twelve client sales over $100 million totaling $3.3 billion compared to twelve client sales over $100 million in 2009, which totaled $7.5 billion.

Account values in our institutional investment products business amounted to $64.2 billion as of
December 31, 2010, an increase of $12.3 billion from December 31, 2009. The increase in account values was primarily driven by additions of fee-based investment-only stable value products and increases in the market value of customer
funds, primarily from a decline in fixed income market yields and interest credited on general account liabilities. These increases were partially offset by declines in general account guaranteed investment product account values due to scheduled
withdrawals. Net additions (withdrawals) increased $8.4 billion, from net withdrawals of $31 million in 2009 to net additions of $8.3 billion in 2010 primarily reflecting higher sales of fee-based investment-only stable value products and lower
general account guaranteed investment product scheduled withdrawals. In addition, sales of guaranteed investment products in the institutional and retail markets continue to be negatively impacted by capital market conditions.

2009 to 2008 Annual
Comparison.

Account values in our full service business amounted to $126.3 billion as of December 31, 2009, an increase of $26.6 billion from December 31, 2008. The increase in account values was primarily driven
by an increase in the market value of customer funds due to equity market appreciation and, to a lesser extent, by net additions. Net additions increased $4.9 billion, from $3.9 billion in 2008 to $8.8 billion in 2009, primarily reflecting higher
new plan sales and, to a lesser extent, lower plan lapses. New plan sales in 2009 included twelve client sales over $100 million, totaling $7.5 billion, compared to ten client sales over $100 million in 2008, which totaled $4.5 billion.

Account values in our institutional investment products
business amounted to $51.9 billion as of December 31, 2009, an increase of $1.4 billion from December 31, 2008. The increase in account values was primarily driven by increases in the market value of customer funds, primarily from interest
credited on general account business and credit spread tightening in the fixed income markets, partially offset by net outflows from externally managed accounts. Net withdrawals decreased $1.6 billion, from $1,654 million in 2008 to $31 million in
2009. This decrease primarily reflects higher sales of investment-only, fee-based stable value products, which more than offset lower sales of guaranteed investment products in the institutional and retail markets. Sales of our retail notes and
institutional notes were negatively impacted by unfavorable capital markets conditions, in particular during the second half of 2008 and through 2009, reflecting the extreme stress experienced by global financial markets from the second half of 2007
through the early portion of 2009.

Asset Management

Operating Results

The following table sets forth the Asset Management
segment’s operating results for the periods indicated.

(1)

Revenues exclude Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments. See “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account
Investments—Realized Investment Gains and Losses.”



(2)

Equity in earnings of operating joint ventures are included in adjusted operating income but excluded from income from continuing operations before income taxes and
equity in earnings of operating joint ventures as they are reflected on a U.S. GAAP basis on an after-tax basis as a separate line in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests are excluded from
adjusted operating income but included in income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures as they are reflected on a U.S. GAAP basis as a separate line in our Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests represent the portion of earnings from consolidated entities that relate to the equity interests of minority investors.

Adjusted Operating Income

2010 to 2009 Annual
Comparison.

Adjusted operating income increased $432 million, from $55 million in 2009 to $487 million in 2010 primarily reflecting more favorable results from commercial mortgage activities and more favorable investment
results from proprietary investing activities, as well as increased asset management fees.

Asset management fees increased $224 million, before associated expenses, primarily from retail and institutional customer assets as a result of higher asset values due to market appreciation and positive
net asset flows. Results from the segment’s commercial mortgage activities increased primarily driven by lower credit and valuation-related charges on interim loans. Results in 2010 include $50 million of net credit and valuation-related
charges compared to $240 million in 2009. As of December 31, 2010, the principal balance of interim loans outstanding totaled $1.3 billion, which excludes both $29 million of commitments for future fundings that would need to be disbursed if
the borrowers meet the conditions for these fundings, as well as $69 million of commercial real estate held for sale related to foreclosed interim loans. As of December 31, 2010, these interim loans outstanding had a weighted average
loan-to-value ratio of 108%, indicating that, in aggregate, the loan amount is greater than the collateral value. As of December 31, 2010, for those loans where the loan amount is greater than the collateral value, the excess of the loan amount
over the collateral value is $171 million. The interim loans had a weighted average debt service coverage ratio of 1.24 times. A stabilized value and projected net operating income are used in the calculation of the loan-to-value and debt service
coverage ratios. These loans also had an allowance for losses or credit related market value losses totaling $168 million as of December 31, 2010.

Results from proprietary investing activities increased $103 million, from a loss of $70 million in 2009 to income of $33 million in 2010,
primarily due to improved results in real estate and fixed income investments. Real estate proprietary investing results in 2009 reflect losses of $70 million, compared to income of $16 million in 2010, primarily reflecting the impact of declines in
real estate values on co-investments and seed investments in the prior year. Results in 2009 also reflect losses of $11 million in a fixed income fund compared to zero in 2010. The Asset Management segment redeemed its entire investment in the fixed
income fund as of June 30, 2009. In addition, proprietary investing fixed income investment results in 2009 included impairments of $10 million on collateralized debt obligations, which as of December 31, 2010, have an amortized cost of
zero.

Results in 2010 also reflect an increase in
performance-based incentive fees primarily related to institutional real estate funds. These increases were partially offset by an increase in compensation expenses and lower income related to securities lending activities.

2009 to 2008 Annual
Comparison.

Adjusted operating income decreased $177 million, from $232 million in 2008 to $55 million in 2009. Results of the segment’s commercial mortgage activities decreased reflecting higher credit and
valuation-related charges of $177 million on interim loans. Due to market conditions and the inherent risk of these loans, the underwriting of new interim loans was suspended during the third quarter of 2008. As of December 31, 2009, the
principal balance of interim loans outstanding totaled $1.7 billion, which excludes both $86 million of commitments for future fundings that would need to be disbursed if the borrowers meet the conditions for these fundings, as well as $59 million
of commercial real estate held for sale related to foreclosed interim loans. As of December 31, 2009, these interim loans outstanding had a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 112%, indicating that, in aggregate, the loan amount is greater
than the collateral value. As of December 31, 2009, for those loans where the loan amount is greater than the collateral value, the excess of the loan amount over the collateral value is $264 million. These loans had a weighted average debt
service coverage ratio of 1.16 times. A stabilized value and projected net operating income are used in the calculation of the loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios. These loans also had an allowance for losses or credit related



market value losses totaling $236 million as of December 31, 2009. Results in 2009 also reflect lower transaction and performance based incentive fees, primarily related to institutional
real estate funds reflecting a decline in real estate values, as well as a decrease in asset management fees primarily from retail and institutional customer assets primarily as a result of lower average asset values. In addition, results for 2009
reflect lower income related to mutual fund service fees and securities lending activities.

The decrease in adjusted operating income was partially offset by more favorable results from the segment’s proprietary investing activities which increased $137 million, from a loss of $207 million
in 2008 to a loss of $70 million in 2009, primarily within fixed income investments. Results reflect a reduction of losses in a fixed income fund which included losses of $172 million in 2008, compared to losses of $11 million in 2009. The Asset
Management segment redeemed its entire investment in the fixed income fund as of June 30, 2009. Fixed income investment results in 2008 also included impairments of $40 million on collateralized debt obligations, which as of December 31,
2009 have an amortized cost of zero. Proprietary investing results for equity investments increased $33 million reflecting losses in 2008, compared to gains in 2009. In 2009, we exited several of these equity investment funds. These increases were
partially offset by real estate proprietary investing which decreased $93 million primarily reflecting the impact of lower real estate values on co-investments. Also, results for 2009 reflect a decrease in expenses largely related to compensation.

Revenues

The following tables set forth the Asset Management
segment’s revenues, presented on a basis consistent with the table above under “—Operating Results,” by type, asset management fees by source and assets under management for the periods indicated. In managing our business we
analyze assets under management, which do not correspond to U.S. GAAP assets, because the principal source of revenues are fees based on assets under management.

(1)

Consists of fees from: (a) individual mutual funds and both variable annuities and variable life insurance asset management revenues from our separate accounts;
(b) funds invested in proprietary mutual funds through our defined contribution plan products; and (c) third-party sub-advisory relationships. Revenues from fixed annuities and the fixed rate options of both variable annuities and variable
life insurance are included in the general account.

(2)

Includes mortgage origination and spread lending revenues of our commercial mortgage origination and servicing business.

(3)

Includes payments from Wells Fargo under an agreement dated as of July 30, 2004 implementing arrangements with respect to money market mutual funds in connection
with the combination of our retail securities brokerage and clearing operations with those of Wells Fargo. The agreement extends for ten years after termination of the Wachovia Securities joint venture, which occurred on December 31, 2009. The
revenue from Wells Fargo under this agreement was $66 million in 2010, $61 million in 2009 and $55 million in 2008.



(1)

Consists of third party institutional assets and group insurance contracts.

(2)

Consists of: (a) individual mutual funds and both variable annuities and variable life insurance assets in our separate accounts; (b) funds invested in
proprietary mutual funds through our defined contribution plan products; and (c) third-party sub-advisory relationships. Fixed annuities and the fixed rate options of both variable annuities and variable life insurance are included in the
general account.

The following
table sets forth the proprietary investments of the Asset Management segment at carrying value (including the value of derivative instruments used to mitigate equity market and currency risk) by asset class and source as of the dates indicated.

2010 to 2009 Annual
Comparison.

Revenues, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased $631 million, from $1,257 million in 2009 to $1,888 million in 2010. Asset management fees increased $224 million
primarily from institutional and retail customer assets as a result of higher asset values from market appreciation and positive net asset flows. Commercial mortgage revenues increased $188 million primarily reflecting lower net credit and
valuation-related charges on interim loans, as discussed above. Service, distribution and other revenues increased $111 million primarily from higher mutual fund service fees and assets under management, with a corresponding increase in expense.
Also contributing to the increase were higher revenues in certain consolidated real estate funds, which were fully offset by higher expenses related to noncontrolling interests in these funds. Proprietary investing revenues increased $90 million
reflecting improved results in real estate and fixed income investments, as discussed above. In addition, incentive fees increased $22 million primarily related to institutional real estate funds. A portion of these incentive-based fees are offset
in incentive compensation expense in accordance with the terms of the contractual agreements. Certain of our incentive fees continue to be subject to positive or negative future adjustment based on cumulative fund performance in relation to
specified benchmarks. As of December 31, 2010, $149 million of cumulative incentive fee revenue, net of compensation, is subject to future adjustment, compared to $150 million as of December 31, 2009. Future incentive, transaction,
proprietary investing and commercial mortgage revenues will be impacted by the level and diversification of our proprietary investments, the commercial real estate market, and other domestic and international market conditions.

2009 to 2008 Annual
Comparison.

Revenues decreased $429 million, from $1,686 million in 2008 to $1,257 million in 2009. Service, distribution and other revenues decreased $249 million of which $97 million related to lower revenues in certain
consolidated funds, which were fully offset by lower expenses related to noncontrolling interests in these funds. The remainder of the decrease in service, distribution and other revenues



includes lower mutual fund service fee revenues, partially offset by expenses as discussed below, as well as a decline in revenues related to securities lending activities. Commercial mortgage
revenues decreased $130 million reflecting higher credit and valuation-related charges on interim loans in 2009, as discussed above. Asset management fees decreased $66 million, primarily from the management of retail and institutional customer
assets as a result of lower average asset values. In addition, transaction and incentive fees decreased $71 million primarily reflecting a decline in real estate values due to adverse real estate market conditions. A portion of these incentive-based
fees are offset in incentive compensation expense in accordance with the terms of the contractual agreements. Certain of our incentive fees continue to be subject to positive or negative future adjustment based on cumulative fund performance in
relation to specified benchmarks. As of December, 31, 2009, $150 million of cumulative incentive fee revenue, net of compensation, is subject to future adjustment, compared to $123 million as of December 31, 2008. In 2009, adjustments of $47
million related to previously recognized incentive fees contributed to the decline in incentive fees resulting from fund performance. Proprietary investing revenues increased $87 million reflecting a decline in losses, primarily the result of lower
proprietary investing balances in 2009, including the redemption of a fixed income fund and the exiting of several equity investment funds in 2009, compared to investment losses in these funds in 2008. Real estate proprietary investing revenues
decreased primarily due to the impact of lower real estate values on co-investments.

Expenses

2010 to 2009 Annual Comparison.

Expenses, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased $199 million, from $1,202 million in 2009 to $1,401
million in 2010 primarily driven by increased compensation costs due to higher incentive compensation, in line with increased revenues, as discussed above. In addition, expenses related to revenues associated with certain consolidated real estate
funds and mutual funds services increased, as discussed above.

2009 to 2008 Annual Comparison.

Expenses decreased $252 million, from $1,454 million in 2008 to $1,202 million in 2009. The decrease in expenses was driven by lower revenues,
as discussed above, related to performance based incentive fees, lower revenues associated with certain consolidated funds, the decline in mutual fund service fee revenue, and lower interest costs related to our reduced proprietary investing
activities. In addition, compensation costs decreased primarily due to lower incentive compensation, in line with lower revenues, as well as lower headcount.

U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance Division

Individual Life

Operating Results

The following table sets forth the Individual Life segment’s operating results for the periods indicated.

(1)

Revenues exclude Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments. See “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account
Investments—Realized Investment Gains and Losses.”



Adjusted Operating Income

2010 to 2009 Annual
Comparison.

Adjusted operating income decreased $62 million, from $562 million in 2009 to $500 million in 2010. Results in 2010 included a $52 million benefit from lower amortization of net deferred policy acquisition
costs and unearned revenue reserves, as well as a decrease in reserves for the guaranteed minimum death benefit feature in certain contracts, reflecting updates of our actuarial assumptions based on an annual review, compared to a $55 million
benefit from the annual review in 2009. The annual reviews cover assumptions used in our estimate of total gross profits which forms the basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs and unearned revenue reserves, as well as the reserve for
the guaranteed minimum death benefit feature in certain contracts. Results in 2009 also included a $30 million benefit from compensation received based on multi-year profitability of third-party products we distribute. These compensation
arrangements are subject to renegotiations periodically which will affect the amount of additional compensation we are eligible to receive. The largest of these arrangements was renegotiated in 2008 and the profit opportunities were reduced
significantly in 2010 and beyond resulting in a benefit of less than $1 million in 2010.

Absent the effect of these items, adjusted operating income in 2010 decreased $29 million, including $33 million from mortality experience, net of reinsurance, which was slightly unfavorable relative to
expected levels in the current year, compared to favorable mortality experience in the prior year. The decrease in adjusted operating income also reflects a $17 million increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs net of related
amortization of unearned revenue reserves, reflecting a net expense of $1 million in 2010 compared to a net benefit of $16 million in 2009, resulting from changes in our estimates of total gross profits primarily from variable products arising from
separate account fund performance and policyholder experience, which are described in more detail below. This increase in amortization largely reflects the impact of equity markets on separate account fund performance in the respective periods,
partially offset by the impact of policyholder persistency which in 2010 returned to levels that are more consistent with expectations. The decline in our in force block of variable life business also contributed to the decrease in adjusted
operating income. Partially offsetting the decrease in adjusted operating income was higher net investment income from an increase in assets supporting our term and universal life products, growth in universal life policyholder account balances and
the impact of gains in 2010 on investments in real property separate account funds compared to losses in 2009.

The changes in our estimates of total gross profits arising from separate account fund performance, as discussed above, reflects the
impact on our estimate of total gross profits of the difference between our actual quarterly rate of return on separate accounts compared to our previously expected quarterly rate of return. The following table shows the actual quarterly rate of
return on separate accounts for the four quarters of 2010 compared to our previously expected quarterly rate of return used in our estimate of total gross profits.

The overall actual rate of return on separate account funds for 2010 was higher than our expected rate of return which resulted in a net decrease in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, net
of related amortization of unearned revenue reserves. The overall higher than expected market returns in 2010 resulted in an increase in total future gross profits by establishing a higher starting point for the fund balances used in estimating
those profits in future periods. The increase in our estimate of total gross profits results in a lower required rate of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, partially offset by a lower required rate of amortization of unearned revenue
reserves. The overall actual rate of return on separate account funds for 2009 was also higher than our expected rate of return resulting in a similar impact on gross profits and a net decrease in amortization. The benefit from lower amortization in
2009 was higher compared to 2010 due to a greater difference in 2009 between actual rates of return and expected rates of return. The previously expected separate account fund performance was based on our future rate of return assumption under the
reversion to the mean approach, as discussed below. In addition, the net increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs net of related amortization of unearned revenue reserves, includes the impact of variable product policyholder
persistency that results in differences between actual gross profits for the period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for the period. The current period includes a benefit from lower amortization of deferred



policy acquisition costs, net of related amortization of unearned revenue reserves, reflecting better than expected gross profits driven by policyholder persistency which returned to levels that
are more consistent with expectations, compared to an expense in 2009, reflecting a similar but opposite impact from lower than expected policyholder persistency.

We derive our near-term future rate of return assumptions
using a reversion to the mean approach, a common industry practice. Under this approach, we consider actual returns over a period of time and initially adjust future projected returns over a four year period so that the assets grow at the long-term
expected rate of return for the entire period. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continuing into the fourth quarter of 2010, the projected near-term future annual rate of return calculated using the reversion to the mean approach for most
variable policies was greater than our near-term maximum future rate of return assumption across all asset types for this business. In those cases, we utilized the near-term maximum future rate of return over the four year period, thereby limiting
the impact of the reversion to the mean on our estimate of total gross profits. The near-term blended maximum future rate of return under the reversion to mean approach was 9.8% for 2010. Included in the blended maximum future rate are assumptions
for returns on various asset classes, including a 5.7% annual weighted average rate of return on fixed income investments and a 13% annual maximum rate of return on equity investments. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2010, the projected
near-term future annual rate of return calculated using the reversion to the mean approach for most variable policies was lower than our near-term maximum future rate of return assumption across all asset types for this business. In those cases, we
utilized the projected near-term future rate of return over the four year period which was 8.6% as of December 31, 2010.

2009 to 2008 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income increased $116 million, from $446 million in 2008
to $562 million in 2009. The increase in adjusted operating income reflects improved earnings from variable products, which benefited from lower amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs net of related amortization of unearned revenue
reserves, driven by the impact of more favorable equity markets in 2009 on separate account fund performance. Separate account fund performance above expected levels results in an increase in total future gross profits on which the amortization of
deferred policy acquisition costs and unearned revenue reserves is based, and accordingly, lower amortization in the current period. The prior year period contained higher amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, net of higher amortization
of unearned revenue reserves in comparison to the current year, due to actual separate account performance that was below expected levels. Results in 2009 also benefited from gains on separate account fund liquidations associated with variable
policy lapses and surrenders in 2009 compared to losses on these liquidations in 2008. Due to policyholder options under some of the variable contracts, lapses may occur on a quarter lag with the market risk during this lag being borne by the
Company. Partially offsetting these items was the impact on variable product profitability of a decrease in asset based fees due to lower average separate account asset balances in 2009 reflecting the impact of the unfavorable equity markets in late
2008 and early 2009, as well as expected runoff of older variable policies. More favorable mortality experience, net of reinsurance, in 2009 compared to 2008 as well as higher earnings from growth in term and universal life insurance in force also
contributed to the increase in adjusted operating income.

Adjusted operating income for 2009 also includes a benefit of $55 million from the annual review of the assumptions used in our estimate of total gross profits which forms the basis for amortizing
deferred policy acquisition costs and unearned revenue reserves as well as for establishing reserves for guaranteed minimum death benefit features in certain contracts. Results for 2008 include a benefit of $79 million from the annual assumption
review. In addition, results for 2009 include a $30 million benefit from compensation received based on multi-year profitability of third-party products we distribute, while results for 2008 include a similar benefit of $53 million. These
compensation arrangements are subject to renegotiation periodically which will affect the amount of additional compensation we are eligible to receive. The largest of these arrangements was revised effective in late 2008.

The benefit of $55 million in 2009 related to the annual
review of assumptions reflects higher investment spread assumptions and improved future mortality expectations, partially offset by updates to interest rate assumptions which increased the reserve for the guaranteed minimum death benefit features in
certain contracts. In addition, the review of assumptions in 2009 reflects a reduction in our future rate of return assumption, which reduced the benefit to the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs net of related amortization on
unearned revenue reserves. The benefit of $79 million in 2008 primarily reflects improved future mortality expectations. As mentioned above, we derive our near-term future rate of return assumptions using a reversion to



the mean approach, a common industry practice. The near-term maximum future rate of return under the reversion to mean approach was reduced in third quarter of 2009 from 10.9% to 10.1% as part of
our annual assumption review. Included in this revised blended maximum future rate are assumptions for returns on various asset classes, including a 13% annual maximum rate of return on equity investments.

Revenues

2010 to 2009 Annual Comparison.
Revenues,

as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased $47 million, from $2,768 million in 2009 to $2,815 million in 2010. Net investment income increased $94 million, due to an increase
in assets supporting our term and universal life products and growth in universal life and variable policyholder account balances due to increased policyholder deposits, as well as gains in 2010 on investments in real property separate account funds
compared to losses in 2009. Premiums increased $28 million, primarily due to growth of our in force block of term insurance. Policy charges and fees and asset management fees and other income decreased $75 million including a $31 million decrease in
amortization of unearned revenue reserves due to annual reviews of assumptions, and a $30 million decrease in compensation received based on multi-year profitability of third-party products we distribute, as discussed above. Absent these items
policy charges and fees and asset management fees and other income decreased $14 million, driven by a decrease in amortization of unearned revenue reserves reflecting the impact of policyholder persistency which, in 2010, returned to levels more
consistent with expectations and mortality experience, partially offset by an increase in the amortization of unearned revenue reserves from the impact of less favorable market conditions on separate account fund performance in 2010. The decrease in
policy charges and fees and asset management fees and other income also reflected higher costs on net settlements of interest rate swaps associated with our floating rate debt due to lower interest rates in 2010, offset by lower interest expense, as
discussed below, partially offset by an increase in asset management fees resulting from higher separate account fund balances.

2009 to 2008 Annual Comparison.

Revenues increased $14 million, from $2,754 million in 2008 to $2,768
million in 2009. Premiums increased $73 million, primarily due to growth of our in force block of term insurance. Net investment income increased $60 million, reflecting higher asset balances primarily from the financing of statutory reserves
required for certain term and universal life insurance policies and growth in universal life account balances due to increased policyholder deposits. Policy charges and fees and asset management fees and other income decreased $119 million,
including a $26 million decrease in compensation received based on multi-year profitability of third-party products we distribute and an increase of $11 million related to the amortization of unearned revenue reserves due to the annual review of
assumptions in both periods, as discussed above. Absent these items policy charges and fees and asset management fees and other income decreased $104 million, primarily reflecting lower net settlements on interest rate swaps including those used to
manage duration, lower amortization of unearned revenue reserves reflecting the impact of more favorable equity markets on variable product separate account fund performance, and lower asset based fees due to lower average separate account asset
balances in 2009 reflecting the unfavorable impact of equity market performance in late 2008 and early 2009.

Benefits and Expenses

2010 to 2009 Annual Comparison.

Benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under
“—Operating Results,” increased $109 million, from $2,206 million in 2009 to $2,315 million in 2010. Absent the net $28 million decrease from the impacts of the annual reviews conducted in both periods, benefits and expenses increased
$137 million, from $2,331 million in 2009 to $2,468 million in 2010. Excluding the impact of the annual reviews, policyholders’ benefits, including interest credited to policyholders, increased $141 million due to growth in universal life and
variable policyholder account balances, increases in policyholder reserves, and expected claim costs associated with growth in our in force block of term and universal life business. In addition, mortality experience was slightly unfavorable,
relative to expected levels in 2010, compared to favorable mortality experience in 2009 contributing $33 million to the increase in policyholder benefits. Also excluding the impact of the annual reviews, amortization of deferred policy acquisition
costs increased $23 million primarily due to the less favorable impact of equity markets on separate account fund performance, partially offset by both the impact of policyholder persistency which in 2010 returned to levels more consistent with
expectations, as well as mortality experience. Partially offsetting these items was a decrease in interest expense of $19 million primarily driven by a decline in interest rates on floating rate debt. This floating rate debt is swapped to a fixed
rate using interest rate swaps, as discussed above.



2009 to 2008 Annual Comparison.

Benefits and expenses
decreased $102 million, from $2,308 million in 2008 to $2,206 million in 2009. Absent the impacts of the annual reviews conducted in both periods, as discussed above, benefits and expenses decreased $137 million, from $2,468 million in 2008 to
$2,331 million in 2009. On this basis, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs decreased $203 million, primarily reflecting the impact of more favorable equity markets in the second half of 2009 on variable product separate account fund
performance, which was partially offset by the impact of unfavorable equity markets in late 2008 and early 2009 on variable product policy persistency in early 2009. Also on this basis, policyholders’ benefits, including interest credited to
policyholders’ account balances, increased $85 million, reflecting increased policyholder reserves associated with growth in our in force block of term insurance and an increase in interest credited to policyholders’ account balances due
to growth in universal life account balances from increased policyholder deposits, partially offset by improved mortality experience compared to 2008, relative to expected levels.

Sales Results

The following table sets forth individual life insurance
annualized new business premiums for the periods indicated. In managing our individual life insurance business, we analyze annualized new business premiums, which do not correspond to revenues under U.S. GAAP, because annualized new business
premiums measure the current sales performance of the business, while revenues primarily reflect the renewal persistency and aging of in force policies written in prior years and net investment income, in addition to current sales. Annualized new
business premiums include 10% of first year excess premiums and deposits.

(1)

Annualized scheduled premiums plus 10% of excess (unscheduled) and single premiums from new sales. Excludes corporate-owned life insurance.

2010 to 2009 Annual
Comparison.

Sales of new life insurance, measured as described above, decreased $99 million, from $359 million in 2009 to $260 million in 2010. The decrease in sales is primarily due to a $66 million decrease in term life
product sales and a $36 million decrease in sales of universal life products driven by lower third party distribution sales. Sales from the third party distribution channel were $88 million lower than 2009 due to lower sales of universal life and
term life products, both of which were impacted by price increases implemented in 2009. Sales by Prudential Agents were $11 million lower than 2009 primarily due to lower sales of both universal life products and term life products. The number of
Prudential Agents increased from 2,447 at December 31, 2009 to 2,471 at December 31, 2010.

2009 to 2008 Annual Comparison.

Sales of new life insurance, measured as described above, increased $28
million, from $331 million in 2008 to $359 million in 2009. The increase in sales is primarily due to a $30 million increase in sales of universal life products and a $17 million increase in term life product sales primarily by the third party
distribution channel, partially offset by a $19 million decrease in sales of variable life products primarily by Prudential Agents. Sales from the third party distribution channel were $42 million higher than 2008 due to higher sales of universal
life products reflecting the impact of product repricing in the second half of 2008 as well as higher sales of term life products reflecting market disruptions for some of our competitors. In the second and fourth quarter of 2009 we increased
universal life and term life prices. Sales by Prudential Agents were $14 million lower than 2008 primarily due to lower sales of variable life products which were impacted by the unfavorable market conditions experienced in late 2008 and early 2009.
The number of Prudential Agents increased from 2,360 at December 31, 2008 to 2,447 at December 31, 2009.



Policy Surrender Experience

The following table sets forth the individual life insurance business’ policy surrender experience for
variable and universal life insurance, measured by cash value of surrenders, for the periods indicated. These amounts do not correspond to expenses under U.S. GAAP. In managing this business, we analyze the cash value of surrenders because it is a
measure of the degree to which policyholders are maintaining their in force business with us, a driver of future profitability. Generally, our term life insurance products do not provide for cash surrender values.

2010 to 2009 Annual
Comparison.

The total cash value of surrenders decreased $158 million, from $855 million in 2009 to $697 million in 2010, as surrenders in 2010 returned to levels that are more consistent with expectations compared to
2009. The prior year reflects a greater volume of surrenders, including lapses to extended term, of variable life insurance, due primarily to market conditions at the time and policyholders electing to surrender their policies rather than make
premium payments or the contractually required deposits needed to keep the policies in force. The level of surrenders as a percentage of mean future policy benefit reserves, policyholders’ account balances and separate account balances
decreased from 4.2% in 2009 to 3.0% in 2010, driven by a decrease in the total cash value of surrenders as described above, as well as higher average account balances primarily driven by market appreciation over the past twelve months.

2009 to 2008 Annual
Comparison.

The total cash value of surrenders increased $53 million, from $802 million in 2008 to $855 million in 2009, reflecting a greater volume of surrenders, primarily in the first half of 2009, including lapses to
extended term, of variable life insurance, due primarily to market conditions in late 2008 and into early 2009 and policyholders electing to surrender their policies rather than make premium payments or the contractually required deposits needed to
keep the policies in force. The level of surrenders as a percentage of mean future policy benefit reserves, policyholders’ account balances and separate account balances increased from 3.8% in 2008 to 4.2% in 2009.

Group Insurance

Operating Results

The following table sets forth the Group Insurance
segment’s operating results for the periods indicated.

(1)

Revenues exclude Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments. See “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account
Investments—Realized Investment Gains and Losses.”

(2)

Benefits and expenses exclude related charges which represent the unfavorable (favorable) impact of Realized investment gains (losses), net, on interest credited to
policyholders’ account balances.



Adjusted Operating Income

2010 to 2009 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income decreased $116 million,
from $331 million in 2009 to $215 million in 2010. Results reflected a net benefit of $28 million in 2010, from reserve refinements in both the group life and group disability businesses, including the impact of annual reviews, compared to a net
benefit of zero in 2009. Excluding this item, adjusted operating income decreased $144 million primarily reflecting less favorable underwriting results in 2010 on group life non-retrospectively experience-rated business largely due to the lapse of
certain business and repricing of other business up for renewal with favorable claims experience in 2009, reflecting the competitive market, as well as less favorable claims experience due to an increase in the number and severity of claims. In
addition, underwriting results reflect less favorable long-term disability claims experience in 2010 consistent with the economic downturn. Also contributing to the decrease in adjusted operating income were higher operating expenses primarily to
support disability operations and expansion into the group dental market, and an unfavorable impact from the refinement of a premium tax estimate.

2009 to 2008 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income decreased $9 million, from $340 million in 2008 to
$331 million in 2009. Results for 2008 include a $20 million benefit from a premium adjustment for updated data on a large group life insurance case. Also included in results for 2008 is a $13 million benefit, as compared to a net benefit of zero in
2009, from refinements in group disability reserves as a result of annual reviews. Excluding the benefits in 2008 from the premium adjustment and annual reserve refinements, adjusted operating income increased $24 million due to improved
underwriting results in 2009 in both our group life and group disability businesses primarily related to business growth, which was partially offset by a related increase in operating expenses.

Revenues

2010 to 2009 Annual
Comparison.

Revenues, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased by $173 million, from $5,285 million in 2009 to $5,458 million in 2010. Group life premiums and policy charges and fee
income increased by $125 million, from $3,414 million in 2009 to $3,539 million in 2010, primarily reflecting higher premiums from retrospectively experience-rated group life business resulting from the increase in policyholder benefits on these
contracts as discussed below. Also contributing to the increase were higher premiums from non-retrospectively experience-rated group life business primarily reflecting growth of business in force resulting from new sales, partially offset by a
decrease in premiums associated with the assumption of existing liabilities from third parties, as well as the lapse of certain business and repricing of other business up for renewal, as discussed above. Group disability premiums and policy charges
and fee income, which include long-term care and dental products, increased by $25 million, from $1,121 million in 2009 to $1,146 million in 2010. This increase primarily reflects higher premiums due to growth of business in force resulting from new
sales, and continued strong persistency of 92.1% in 2010 compared to 90.9% in 2009, partially offset by a decrease in premiums associated with the assumption of existing liabilities from third parties.

2009 to 2008 Annual
Comparison.

Revenues increased by $325 million, from $4,960 million in 2008 to $5,285 million in 2009. Group life premiums and policy charges and fee income, increased by $182 million, from $3,232 million in 2008 to $3,414
million in 2009. This increase primarily reflects growth of business in force resulting from new sales, and continued strong persistency of 94.3% in 2009 compared to 93.3% in 2008. Also contributing to this increase were higher premiums from
retrospectively experience-rated group life business resulting from the increase in policyholder benefits on these contracts, as discussed below. Partially offsetting the increase in group life premiums is the premium adjustment recorded in 2008 as
discussed above. Group disability premiums and policy charges and fee income, which include long-term care products, increased by $126 million, from $995 million in 2008 to $1,121 million in 2009. This increase primarily reflects growth of business
in force resulting from new sales, and continued strong persistency of 90.9% in 2009 compared to 85.6% in 2008.



Benefits and Expenses

The following table sets forth the Group Insurance segment’s benefits and administrative operating expense
ratios for the periods indicated.

(1)

Ratio of policyholder benefits to earned premiums, policy charges and fee income. Group disability ratios include long-term care and dental products.

(2)

Ratio of administrative operating expenses (excluding commissions) to gross premiums, policy charges and fee income. Group disability ratios include long-term care and
dental products.

2010 to 2009
Annual Comparison.

Benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased by $289 million, from $4,954 million in 2009 to $5,243 million in 2010. This increase reflects a
$242 million increase in policyholders’ benefits, including the change in policy reserves, from $4,016 million in 2009 to $4,258 million in 2010, reflecting greater benefit costs on both group life and group disability businesses. Our group
life business reflected greater benefit costs from less favorable claims experience, including an increase in benefits on retrospectively experience-rated business that resulted in increased premiums, partially offset by the benefit of reserve
refinements in 2010 and a decrease in policyholder benefits associated with the assumption of existing liabilities from third parties. Our group disability business also reflected less favorable claims experience, partially offset by a decrease in
policyholder benefits associated with the assumption of existing liabilities from third parties. Also contributing to the increase in benefits and expenses were higher operating expenses, as discussed above.

The group life benefits ratio deteriorated 1.3 percentage
points from 2009 to 2010, due to less favorable claims experience due to an increase in the number and severity of claims, as well as the lapse of certain business and repricing of other business up for renewal with favorable claims experience in
2009, reflecting the competitive market, partially offset by the favorable impact of the reserve refinements. The group disability benefits ratio deteriorated 5.8 percentage points from 2009 to 2010, primarily due to less favorable long-term
disability claims experience combined with an unfavorable impact from reserve refinements, including the impact of the annual reviews. The group life administrative operating expense ratio was relatively unchanged from 2009 to 2010. The group
disability administrative operating expense ratio deteriorated 3.0 percentage points from 2009 to 2010, primarily due to higher costs to support disability operations and expansion into the group dental market, lower premiums associated with the
assumption of existing liabilities from third parties, as well as an unfavorable impact from the refinement of a premium tax estimate.

2009 to 2008 Annual Comparison.

Benefits and expenses increased by $334 million, from $4,620 million in 2008
to $4,954 million in 2009. This increase reflects a $283 million increase in policyholders’ benefits, including the change in policy reserves, from $3,733 million in 2008 to $4,016 million in 2009, reflecting growth of business in force and
greater benefits on retrospectively experience-rated group life business that resulted in increased premiums as discussed above. Also contributing to the increase in benefits and expenses were higher operating expenses primarily related to business
growth, as well as a lower benefit in 2009 of the group disability reserve refinements discussed above.

The group life benefits ratio was relatively unchanged from 2008 to 2009. Excluding the impact of the premium adjustment discussed above,
the group life benefits ratio improved approximately 0.8 percentage points due to more favorable mortality experience. The group disability benefits ratio deteriorated 1.7 percentage points from 2008 to 2009, primarily due to the impact of annual
reserve refinements as a result of annual reviews. Excluding the impact of the annual reserve refinements, the group disability benefits ratio was relatively unchanged from 2008 to 2009. The group life administrative operating expense ratio was
relatively unchanged from 2008 to 2009. The group disability administrative operating expense ratio improved from 2008 to 2009, as growth in the business outpaced the related increase in operating expenses.



Sales Results

The following table sets forth the Group Insurance
segment’s annualized new business premiums for the periods indicated. In managing our group insurance business, we analyze annualized new business premiums, which do not correspond to revenues under U.S. GAAP, because annualized new business
premiums measure the current sales performance of the business unit, while revenues primarily reflect the renewal persistency and aging of in force policies written in prior years and net investment income, in addition to current sales.

(1)

Amounts exclude new premiums resulting from rate changes on existing policies, from additional coverage under our Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance contract and
from excess premiums on group universal life insurance that build cash value but do not purchase face amounts, and include premiums from the takeover of claim liabilities.

(2)

Includes long-term care and dental products.

2010 to 2009 Annual Comparison.

Total annualized new business premiums increased $30 million, from $577
million in 2009 to $607 million in 2010. Group life sales increased $107 million driven primarily by increased large case sales to new customers, partially offset by lower premiums associated with the assumption of existing liabilities from third
parties during 2010. Group disability sales decreased $77 million primarily due to lower sales of large case disability products to both new and existing customers, as well as a decrease in long-term care sales.

2009 to 2008 Annual
Comparison.

Total annualized new business premiums increased $85 million, from $492 million in 2008 to $577 million in 2009. Group life sales increased $51 million driven primarily by increased large case sales to both new
and existing customers, partially offset by lower premiums associated with the assumption of existing liabilities from third parties during 2009. Group disability sales increased $34 million primarily due to increased sales to existing customers,
partially offset by lower premiums associated with the assumption of existing liabilities from third parties during 2009.

International Insurance and Investments Division

Impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on earnings

As a U.S.-based company with significant business operations
outside the U.S., we seek to mitigate the risk that future unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements will reduce our U.S. dollar equivalent earnings. The operations of our International Insurance and International Investments segments are
subject to currency fluctuations that can materially affect their U.S. dollar earnings from period to period even if earnings on a local currency basis are relatively constant. As discussed further below, we enter into forward currency derivative
contracts, as well as “dual currency” and “synthetic dual currency” investments, as part of our strategy to effectively fix the currency exchange rates for a portion of our prospective non-U.S. dollar denominated earnings
streams, thereby reducing earnings volatility from foreign currency exchange rate movements.

Forward currency hedging program

The financial results of our International Insurance segment and International Investments segment, excluding the global commodities group, for all periods presented reflect the impact of an intercompany
arrangement with Corporate and Other operations pursuant to which the segments’ non-U.S. dollar denominated earnings in all countries are translated at fixed currency exchange rates. The fixed rates are determined in connection with a currency
income hedging program designed to mitigate the risk that unfavorable exchange rate changes will reduce the segments’ U.S. dollar equivalent earnings. Pursuant to this program, Corporate and Other operations executes forward currency contracts
with third parties to sell the net exposure of projected earnings



from the hedged currency in exchange for U.S. dollars at specified exchange rates. The maturities of these contracts correspond with the future periods in which the identified non-U.S. dollar
denominated earnings are expected to be generated. This program is primarily associated with the International Insurance segment’s businesses in Japan, Korea and Taiwan and the International Investments segment’s businesses in Europe.

During the first quarter of 2010, we discontinued
our currency income hedging program associated with the International Investment segment’s businesses in Korea, a result of our signing of a definitive agreement to sell Prudential Investment & Securities Co., Ltd. and Prudential Asset
Management Co., Ltd, which together comprise our Korean asset management operations. As a result of the agreement, we have reflected results of our Korean asset management operations, including the impact of this program, as discontinued operations
for all periods reported. This transaction closed on June 1, 2010.

The intercompany arrangement with Corporate and Other operations increased (decreased) revenues and adjusted operating income of each segment as follows for the periods indicated:

Results of Corporate and Other
operations include any differences between the translation adjustments recorded by the segments and the gains or losses recorded from the forward currency contracts that settled during the period, which includes the impact of any over or under
hedging of actual earnings as a result of projected earnings differing from actual earnings. The net impact of this program recorded within the Corporate and Other operations were gains of $6 million, $3 million and $5 million for the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The notional amounts of these forward currency contracts were $3.0 billion and $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, of which $2.5 billion and $2.0 billion as of
December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to our Japanese insurance operations.

Dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments

In addition, our Japanese insurance operations also hold dual currency investments in the form of fixed maturities and loans. The
principal of these dual currency investments are yen-denominated while the related interest income is U.S. dollar denominated. These investments are the economic equivalent of exchanging what would otherwise be fixed streams of yen-denominated
interest income for fixed streams of U.S. dollar interest income. Our Japanese insurance operations also hold yen-denominated investments that have been coupled with cross-currency coupon swap agreements, creating synthetic dual currency
investments. The yen/U.S. dollar exchange rate is effectively fixed, as we are obligated in future periods to exchange fixed amounts of Japanese yen interest payments generated by the yen-denominated investments for U.S. dollars at the yen/U.S.
dollar exchange rates specified by the cross-currency coupon swap agreements. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the notional amount of these investments was ¥357 billion, or $3.2 billion, and ¥430 billion, or $3.8 billion, respectively,
based upon the foreign currency exchange rates applicable at the time these investments were acquired. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the weighted average yield generated by these investments was 2.8%, 2.9% and 2.3%,
respectively.



Presented below is the fair value of these instruments as reflected on our balance sheet at
December 31:

The table below presents as of
December 31, 2010, the yen-denominated earnings subject to our dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments and the related weighted average exchange rates resulting from these investments.

(1)

Yen amounts are imputed from the contractual U.S. dollar denominated interest cash flows.

The present value of the earnings reflected in the table above, on a U.S. dollar denominated basis, is $0.9
billion as of December 31, 2010. The table above does not reflect the forward currency income hedging program discussed above. In establishing the level of yen-denominated earnings that will be hedged through the forward currency income hedging
program we take into account the anticipated level of U.S. dollar denominated earnings that will be generated by dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments, as well as the anticipated level of U.S. dollar denominated earnings that will be
generated by U.S. dollar denominated products and investments, which are discussed in greater detail below.

Impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on equity

Hedges of U.S. GAAP equity and available economic capital

We also seek to mitigate the risk that future unfavorable
foreign currency exchange rate movements will reduce our U.S. dollar equivalent equity in foreign subsidiaries through various hedging strategies. We continue to refine our current capital management framework, and as we further develop this
framework, or as other events occur, we may alter this strategy. Available economic capital represents the excess of the fair value of assets over the fair value of liabilities for the current in force block of business. In our Japanese insurance
operations we currently seek to hedge a portion of estimated available economic capital, including the amount attributable to the U.S. GAAP equity of our Japanese insurance operations, which totaled $5.7 billion as of December 31, 2010
excluding “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” components of equity and certain other adjustments. We hedge a portion of the estimated available economic capital in our Japanese insurance operations through a variety of
instruments, including U.S. dollar denominated assets. These assets are financed with yen-denominated liabilities and equity held in our Japanese insurance operations. In addition, we may also hedge estimated available economic capital using
instruments held in our U.S. domiciled entities, such as U.S. dollar denominated debt that has been swapped to yen. In our Taiwan insurance operation, the U.S. GAAP equity exposure is mitigated by holding a variety of instruments, including U.S.
dollar denominated investments. During 2009, we terminated our hedges of the U.S. GAAP equity exposure of our Korean operations due to a variety of considerations, including a desire to limit the potential for cash settlement outflows that would
result from a strengthening Korean won. For the same reasons, during the third quarter of 2010, we also terminated our hedges of the U.S. GAAP equity exposure for all of our other foreign operations, excluding our Japan and Taiwan insurance
operations.



As of December 31, 2010, the aggregate amount of the instruments serving as hedges of
our estimated available economic capital, which includes the $5.7 billion attributable to the U.S. GAAP equity of our Japanese insurance operations discussed above, amounted to $7.0 billion, unchanged from the amount hedged as of December 31,
2009. These instruments were principally comprised of available for sale U.S. dollar denominated investments with an amortized cost of $5.6 billion and held to maturity U.S. dollar denominated investments with an amortized cost of $0.5 billion held
in our Japanese insurance operations, as well as $0.8 billion of net yen-denominated liabilities held in our U.S. domiciled entities, including a portion that has been converted to yen using swaps. The effects of the yen-denominated liabilities are
reported in Corporate and Other operations. These amounts do not reflect the forward currency income hedging program or dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments discussed above, which when added to the $7.0 billion of instruments
serving as an equity hedge of a portion of the estimated available economic capital, results in a total estimated available economic capital hedge of approximately $10.4 billion as of December 31, 2010. In addition, as discussed below, we have
$10.3 billion of U.S. dollar assets supporting U.S. dollar liabilities related to U.S. dollar denominated products issued by our Japanese operations, which when added to the $10.4 billion of total estimated available economic capital hedge, results
in total U.S. dollar instruments of approximately $20.7 billion as of December 31, 2010.

Available for sale investments under U.S. GAAP are carried at fair value with unrealized changes in fair value (except as described below for impairments), including those from changes in foreign currency
exchange rate movements, recorded as unrealized gains or losses in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” Changes in the U.S. GAAP equity of our Japanese insurance operations due to foreign currency exchange rate movements are
also recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” as a “Foreign currency translation adjustments,” and can serve as an offset to the unrealized changes in fair value of the available for sale investments. For the
portion of available for sale investments that support our Japanese insurance operations’ U.S. GAAP equity this offset creates a “natural equity hedge.” For those U.S. dollar denominated investments, including available for sale
investments, that support the portion of estimated available economic capital above our U.S. GAAP equity there is no offsetting impact to equity. In addition, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the U.S. GAAP equity of our
Japanese insurance operations is partially offset by foreign currency exchange related changes in designated Yen-denominated debt and other hedging instruments held in our U.S. domiciled entities and recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss)” as a “Foreign currency translation adjustments.”

The investments designated as held to maturity under U.S. GAAP are recorded at amortized cost on the balance sheet, but are remeasured for foreign currency exchange rate movements, with the related change
in value recorded within “Asset management fees and other income.” The remeasurement related to the change in value for foreign currency exchange rate movements for these investments is excluded from adjusted operating income, as part of
our application of the hedge of available economic capital.

The U.S. dollar denominated investments that hedge a portion of our estimated available economic capital in our Japanese insurance operations pay a coupon, which is reflected within “Net investment
income,” and, therefore, included in adjusted operating income, which is approximately 200 to 300 basis points greater than what a similar yen-based investment would pay. The incremental impact of this higher yield on our U.S. dollar
denominated investments, as well as our dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments discussed above, will vary over time, and is dependent on the duration of the underlying investment, as well as interest rate environments in the U.S. and
Japan at the time of the investment. See “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—General Account Investments—Investment Results” for a discussion of the investment yields generated by our
Japanese insurance operations.

For U.S. dollar
denominated investments recorded on the books of yen-based entities, foreign currency exchange movements, including those reflected in the forward curve at the time of purchase of these investments will impact their value. To the extent the value of
the yen strengthens as compared to the U.S. dollar, the value of these U.S. dollar denominated investments will decrease as a result of changes in the foreign currency exchange rates. Upon the ultimate sale or maturity of the U.S. dollar denominated
investments, any realized change in value related to changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will be included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net” within the income statement and, excluded from adjusted operating income.
Similarly, other-than-temporary impairments on these investments may include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which in certain circumstances will be included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net” within the



income statement, and, as such, excluded from adjusted operating income. See “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—General Account
Investments—Fixed Maturity Securities—Other-than-Temporary Impairments of Fixed Maturity Securities” for a discussion of our policies regarding impairments. We seek to mitigate the risk that future unfavorable foreign currency
exchange rate movements will decrease the value of our U.S. dollar denominated investments and negatively impact the equity of our yen-based entities by employing internal hedging strategies between a subsidiary of Prudential Financial and certain
of our yen-based entities. See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Liquidity and Capital Resources of Subsidiaries—International Insurance and Investments Subsidiaries” for a discussion of our internal hedging strategies.

We also incorporate the impact of foreign
currency exchange rate movements on the remaining U.S. dollar denominated net asset position of our Japanese insurance operations, which primarily relates to accrued investment income, as part of our overall application of the hedge of available
economic capital. These U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities are remeasured for foreign currency exchange rate movements, as they are non-yen denominated items on the books of yen-based entities, and the related change in value is recorded
within “Asset management fees and other income.” As these U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities are included in the determination of the Japanese insurance operations’ level of available economic capital, we exclude all
remeasurement related to these items from adjusted operating income.

In addition, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, our international insurance operations also had $9.7 billion and $7.7 billion, respectively, of foreign currency exposure from U.S. dollar liabilities
for U.S. dollar denominated products issued by these operations. A portion of these liabilities are coinsured to our U.S. domiciled insurance operations and supported by U.S. dollar denominated assets. For the U.S. dollar liabilities retained in
Japan, our Japanese operations hold U.S. dollar denominated investments, including a significant portion that are designated as available for sale, and other related U.S. dollar denominated net assets, primarily accrued investment income, to support
these products. The change in value due to changes in foreign currency exchange rate movements, or remeasurement, of the related U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities associated with these products is excluded from adjusted operating
income.

International Insurance

The results of our International Insurance operations are
translated on the basis of weighted average monthly exchange rates, inclusive of the effects of the intercompany arrangement discussed above. To provide a better understanding of operating performance within the International Insurance segment,
where indicated below, we have analyzed our results of operations excluding the effect of the year over year change in foreign currency exchange rates. Our results of operations excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations were derived by
translating foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at uniform exchange rates for all periods presented, including for constant dollar information discussed below. The exchange rates used were Japanese yen at a rate of 92 yen per U.S. dollar and Korean
won at a rate of 1190 won per U.S. dollar. In addition, for constant dollar information discussed below, activity denominated in U.S. dollars is reported based on the amounts as transacted in U.S. dollars. Annualized new business premiums presented
on a constant exchange rate basis in the “Sales Results” section below reflect translation based on these same uniform exchange rates.



Operating Results

The following table sets forth the International Insurance segment’s operating results for the periods
indicated.

(1)

Revenues exclude Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related charges and adjustments. The related charges represent payments related to the market value
adjustment features of certain of our annuity products and the impact of Realized investment gains (losses), net, on the amortization of unearned revenue reserves. See “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account
Investments—Realized Investment Gains and Losses.”

(2)

Benefits and expenses exclude related charges that represent the element of “Dividends to policyholders” that is based on a portion of certain realized
investment gains required to be paid to policyholders and the impact of Realized investment gains (losses), net, on the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.

(3)

Revenues exclude net investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities. See “—Investment Gains and Losses on Trading
Account Assets Supporting Insurance Liabilities and Changes in Experience-Rated Contractholder Liabilities Due to Asset Value Changes.”

(4)

Benefits and expenses exclude changes in contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes in the pool of investments supporting these experience-rated contracts.
See “—Investment Gains and Losses on Trading Account Assets Supporting Insurance Liabilities and Changes in Experience-Rated Contractholder Liabilities Due to Asset Value Changes.”

(5)

Equity in earnings of operating joint ventures are included in adjusted operating income but excluded from income from continuing operations before income taxes and
equity in earnings of operating joint ventures as they are reflected on a U.S. GAAP basis on an after-tax basis as a separate line in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests are excluded from
adjusted operating income but included in income from continuing operations before taxes and equity earnings of operating joint ventures as they are reflected on a U.S. GAAP basis as a separate line in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests represent the portion of earnings from consolidated entities that relates to the equity interests of minority investors.

Acquisition of AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd., AIG Edison Life Insurance Company and Related Entities

On February 1, 2011, Prudential
Financial completed the acquisition from American International Group, Inc., or AIG, of AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd., or Star, AIG Edison Life Insurance Company, or Edison, and certain other AIG subsidiaries pursuant to the stock purchase
agreement dated September 30, 2010 between Prudential Financial and AIG. The total purchase price was approximately $4.8 billion, comprised of



approximately $4.2 billion in cash and $0.6 billion in assumed third party debt, substantially all of which is expected to be repaid, over time, with excess capital of the acquired entities. All
acquired entities are Japanese corporations and their businesses are in Japan.

The acquired businesses distribute individual life insurance, group life insurance, group annuities, medical insurance, and fixed annuities primarily through captive agents, independent agents, and banks.
As of December 31, 2010, these businesses had approximately $174 billion face amount of in force individual insurance and approximately 7,490 captive agents. We anticipate that the invested assets attributed to these businesses will increase
the invested assets of our Japanese operations by about half. The addition of these operations to our existing businesses will increase our scale in the Japanese insurance market and provide complementary distribution opportunities. We also expect
these businesses to provide attractive returns primarily driven from in force business and cost synergies. Star and Edison’s bank channel distribution will be transferred and integrated with Prudential Gibraltar Financial. In addition, we
expect to integrate the core operations of Star and Edison, excluding their bank channel distribution, with our Gibraltar Life operations by early 2012, subject to local regulatory approvals. We expect pre-tax integration costs of approximately $500
million to be incurred over a five year period, including approximately $400 million during 2011 and 2012. After the integration is completed, we expect annual cost savings of approximately $250 million. Actual integration costs may exceed, and
actual costs savings may fall short of, such expectations.

Acquisition of Yamato Life

On May 1, 2009, our Gibraltar Life operations acquired Yamato Life, a Japanese life insurance company that declared bankruptcy in October 2008. Gibraltar Life served as the reorganization sponsor for
Yamato and under the reorganization agreement acquired Yamato by contributing $72 million of capital to Yamato. Concurrent with our acquisition, substantially all of Yamato’s insurance liabilities were restructured under a plan of
reorganization to include special surrender penalties on existing policies. These surrender charges were 20% in the first year and decline by 2% each year thereafter. Subsequent to the acquisition, we renamed the acquired company The Prudential
Gibraltar Financial Life Insurance Company, Ltd, or Prudential Gibraltar Financial.

Adjusted Operating Income

2010 to 2009 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income from Life Planner operations increased $48 million, from $1,221 million in 2009 to $1,269 million in 2010, including
a net favorable impact of $11 million from currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, adjusted operating income increased $37 million primarily reflecting the growth of business in force and continued strong persistency in
our Japanese Life Planner operation, partially offset by an unfavorable variance of $27 million, reflecting the impact of a $6 million net charge in 2010 and a $21 million net benefit in 2009 from reserve refinements related to the implementation of
a new policy valuation system. Also impacting adjusted operating income is a $6 million lower benefit in the current year from a reduction in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs primarily reflecting improved mortality assumptions,
which benefited both periods, associated with our annual review of estimated gross profits used to amortize deferred policy acquisition costs.

Gibraltar Life’s adjusted operating income increased $166 million, from $622 million in 2009 to $788 million in 2010, including a
favorable impact of $22 million from currency fluctuations. In December 2010, a consortium of investors including Prudential that holds a minority interest in China Pacific Insurance (Group) Co., Ltd sold approximately 16% of its holdings, which
contributed a pre-tax gain of $66 million to results. Prudential’s participation in the consortium is viewed as part of its strategic approach to China. Absent the effect of this item and the impact of currency fluctuations, adjusted operating
income increased $78 million, primarily reflecting the continued growth in our fixed annuity products, which are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, and growth in protection products driven by expanding bank channel distribution, as well as a
higher contribution from non-coupon investments. Results for 2010 also include $11 million of expenses associated with the acquisition of the Star and Edison Businesses which were more than offset by a lower level of benefits and expenses including
the absence of net charges of $5 million related to a 2009 guaranty fund assessment and net charges of $8 million in 2009 from unfavorable reserve refinements related to the implementation of a new policy valuation system.



In the first quarter of 2011, the consortium of investors, discussed above, sold
approximately 40% of its remaining holdings in China Pacific Insurance (Group) Co., Ltd., which will contribute a pre-tax gain of $153 million to our 2011 results.

2009 to 2008 Annual
Comparison.

Adjusted operating income from Life Planner operations increased $96 million, from $1,125 million in 2008 to $1,221 million in 2009, including a net unfavorable impact of $5 million from currency fluctuations.
This increase in adjusted operating income primarily reflects the continued growth of our Japanese Life Planner operation, as well as more favorable mortality experience and improved investment income margins. The improved investment income margins
primarily reflect investment portfolio growth in our U.S. dollar denominated products in Japan. In addition, adjusted operating income benefited by $21 million in 2009 due to the migration to a new policy valuation system that resulted in favorable
refinements in the current year. Partially offsetting these items was increased general and administrative expenses due primarily to $12 million of expenses recorded in 2009 related to an on-going initiative in Japan to enhance our information
processes and technology systems in order to improve efficiency and lower costs.

Gibraltar Life’s adjusted operating income was $622 million in both 2008 and 2009, with no impact from currency fluctuations. Results for 2009 benefited from $36 million of earnings from the acquired
former business of Yamato Life, as discussed above. The earnings from the acquired business include approximately $19 million related to initial surrenders of policies following the restructuring of business, essentially consistent with our overall
expectations. Offsetting these items is a decline in expense and other margins, which reflects higher general and administrative expenses, due primarily to $18 million of expenses recorded in 2009 related to an on-going initiative in Japan to
enhance our information processes and technology systems in order to improve efficiency and lower costs. Results for 2009 also include net charges of $8 million due to the migration to a new policy valuation system that resulted in unfavorable
refinements in the current period. In addition, adjusted operating income benefited in 2009 from higher earnings as a result of growth in our fixed annuity products, which are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, partially offset by a decline in
investment income margins reflecting actions taken to reduce our risk exposure.

Revenues

2010 to 2009 Annual Comparison.

Revenues, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased $1,623 million, from $10,466 million in 2009 to
$12,089 million in 2010, including a net favorable impact of $501 million relating to currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, revenues increased $1,122 million, from $10,764 million in 2009 to $11,886 million in 2010.

Revenues from our Life Planner operations
increased $823 million, from $6,443 million in 2009 to $7,266 million in 2010, including a net favorable impact of $312 million from currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, revenues increased $511 million, from $6,597
million in 2009 to $7,108 million in 2010. This increase in revenues came primarily from increases in premiums and policy charges and fee income of $349 million, from $5,438 million in 2009 to $5,787 million in 2010. Premiums and policy charges and
fee income from our Japanese Life Planner operation increased $263 million, from $4,101 million in 2009 to $4,364 million in 2010, primarily reflecting growth of business in force and continued strong persistency, partially offset by a benefit
recognized in the prior year from the migration to a new policy valuation system discussed above. Net investment income increased $125 million, from $1,091 million in 2009 to $1,216 million in 2010, primarily due to investment portfolio growth,
partially offset by lower yields in our Japanese investment portfolio compared to the prior year.

Revenues from Gibraltar Life increased $800 million, from $4,023 million in 2009 to $4,823 million in 2010, including a favorable impact of $189 million from currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of
currency fluctuations, revenues for Gibraltar Life increased $611 million, from $4,167 million in 2009 to $4,778 million in 2010. This increase reflects a $423 million increase in premiums, from $2,911 million in 2009 to $3,334 million in 2010, as
premiums benefited from $50 million of renewal premiums from the acquisition of Yamato, higher first year premiums of $229 million due to stronger sales of protection products primarily through our bank distribution channels, as well as $173 million
in higher sales of single premium whole life. Partially offsetting these favorable variances in premiums was a decrease of $101 million, reflecting the completion of the special dividend arrangement in the second quarter of 2010 established as part
of Gibraltar Life’s reorganization in 2001.



Substantially all of the premiums recognized as additional face amounts of insurance issued pursuant to the special dividend arrangement were offset by a corresponding charge to increase reserves
for the affected policies. Also contributing to the increase in revenues is favorable investment income reflecting the continued growth of our fixed annuity products and higher other income primarily reflecting the pre-tax gain of $66 million
related to the partial sale of our indirect investment in China Pacific Insurance (Group) Co., Ltd discussed above.

Due to the long-term nature of many of the products we sell in Japan, we have historically sought to increase the duration of our Japanese
yen investment portfolio by employing various strategies, including investing in longer-term securities or, by entering into long-duration floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. These strategies better support the characteristics of our long-dated
product liabilities and have resulted in higher portfolio yields. Based on an evaluation of market conditions, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continuing into the first quarter of 2009, we terminated or offset many of these interest rate
swaps in consideration of, among other things, the interest rate environment. The resulting realized investment gains from terminating or offsetting these interest rate swaps will be recognized in adjusted operating income over periods that
generally approximate the expected terms of the derivatives. For 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized gains of $38 million, gains of $30 million, and losses of $14 million, respectively, in adjusted operating income related to these realized
investment gains (losses). As of December 31, 2010, $712 million of deferred gains remain to be recognized in adjusted operating income over a weighted average period of 30 years. We continue to manage the interest rate risk profile of our
businesses in the context of market conditions and relative opportunities, and will implement these hedging strategies to lengthen the duration of our Japanese investment portfolio as our assessment of market conditions dictates. As we do so, the
impact to our portfolio yields will depend on the then current interest rate environment.

2009 to 2008 Annual Comparison.

Revenues increased $1,281 million, from $9,185 million in 2008 to $10,466 million in 2009, including a net favorable impact of $282 million
relating to currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, revenues increased $999 million, from $9,765 million in 2008 to $10,764 million in 2009.

Revenues from our Life Planner operations increased $421
million, from $6,022 million in 2008 to $6,443 million in 2009, including a net favorable impact of $39 million from currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, revenues increased $382 million, from $6,215 million in 2008
to $6,597 million in 2009. This increase in revenues came primarily from increases in premiums and policy charges and fee income of $237 million, from $5,201 million in 2008 to $5,438 million in 2009. Premiums and policy charges and fee income from
our Japanese Life Planner operation increased $199 million, from $3,902 million in 2008 to $4,101 million in 2009, primarily reflecting growth of business in force from new sales and continued strong persistency. Net investment income also increased
$106 million, from $985 million in 2008 to $1,091 million in 2009, primarily due to investment portfolio growth in our U.S. dollar denominated products in Japan.

Revenues from Gibraltar Life increased $860 million, from
$3,163 million in 2008 to $4,023 million in 2009, including a favorable impact of $243 million from currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, revenues for Gibraltar Life increased $617 million, from $3,550 million in 2008
to $4,167 million in 2009. This increase reflects a $489 million increase in premiums, from $2,422 million in 2008 to $2,911 million in 2009, as premiums benefited $156 million from additional face amounts of insurance issued pursuant to the final
payment under a special dividend arrangement established as part of Gibraltar Life’s reorganization in 2001 for which 2008 includes no such benefit. Substantially all of the premiums recognized pursuant to the special dividend arrangement were
offset by a corresponding charge to increase reserves for the affected policies. Also reflected in premiums is $97 million of renewal premiums from the acquisition of Yamato, as well as higher sales of single premium whole life during 2009.

Benefits and Expenses

2010 to 2009 Annual
Comparison.

Benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased $1,409 million, from $8,623 million in 2009 to $10,032 million in 2010, including a net unfavorable impact
of $468 million related to currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, benefits and expenses increased $941 million, from $8,780 million in 2009 to $9,721 million in 2010.



Benefits and expenses of our Life Planner operations increased $775 million, from $5,222
million in 2009 to $5,997 million in 2010, including a net unfavorable impact of $301 million from currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, benefits and expenses increased $474 million, from $5,338 million in 2009 to
$5,812 million in 2010. Benefits and expenses of our Japanese Life Planner operation increased $340 million, from $3,855 million in 2009 to $4,195 million in 2010, primarily reflecting an increase in policyholder benefits due to changes in reserves,
which was driven by the growth in business in force. Included in general and administrative expenses for the Life Planner operations is $4 million of expenses, a decrease of $8 million from the prior year, related to a recently completed initiative
in Japan to enhance our information processes and technology systems in order to improve efficiency and lower costs.

Gibraltar Life’s benefits and expenses increased $634 million, from $3,401 million in 2009 to $4,035 million in 2010, including an
unfavorable impact of $167 million from currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, benefits and expenses increased $467 million, from $3,442 million in 2009 to $3,909 million in 2010. This increase reflects an increase in
policyholder benefits, including changes in reserves, of $383 million reflecting higher single premium whole life sales in 2010 and the acquisition of Yamato, offset by the effects of the special dividend arrangement discussed above. Also
contributing to the increase in benefits and expenses is higher amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs related to growth of our protection products and the increase in single premium whole life sales, as well as higher general and
administrative expenses including $11 million of expenses associated with the acquisition of the Star and Edison Businesses. Included in general and administrative expenses for Gibraltar Life is $18 million of expenses, unchanged from the prior
year, related to the recently completed information processes and technology systems initiative discussed above.

2009 to 2008 Annual Comparison.

Benefits and expenses increased $1,185 million, from $7,438 million in 2008
to $8,623 million in 2009, including a net unfavorable impact of $287 million related to currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, benefits and expenses increased $898 million, from $7,882 million in 2008 to $8,780
million in 2009.

Benefits and expenses of our
Life Planner operations increased $325 million, from $4,897 million in 2008 to $5,222 million in 2009, including a net unfavorable impact of $44 million from currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, benefits and expenses
increased $281 million, from $5,057 million in 2008 to $5,338 million in 2009. Benefits and expenses of our Japanese Life Planner operation increased $251 million, from $3,604 million in 2008 to $3,855 million in 2009, primarily reflecting an
increase in policyholder benefits, including changes in reserves, which was driven by the growth in business in force. Also contributing to the increase in benefits and expenses was increased amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and
higher general and administrative expenses primarily as a result of business growth. Reflected in the higher general and administrative expenses is $12 million of expenses recorded in 2009 for the Life Planner operations related to an on-going
initiative in Japan to enhance our information processes and technology systems in order to improve efficiency and lower costs.

Gibraltar Life’s benefits and expenses increased $860 million, from $2,541 million in 2008 to $3,401 million in 2009, including an
unfavorable impact of $243 million from currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, benefits and expenses increased $617 million, from $2,825 million in 2008 to $3,442 million in 2009. This increase reflects an increase in
policyholder benefits, including changes in reserves, of $453 million reflecting the effects of the special dividend arrangement discussed above, higher single premium whole life sales in 2009, and the acquisition of Yamato. Also contributing to
this increase is higher amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs related to the continued growth of our fixed annuity products and the increase in single premium whole life sales, as well as higher general and administrative expenses.
Reflected in the higher general and administrative expenses is $18 million of expenses recorded in 2009 related to the on-going initiative in Japan discussed above.

Sales Results

In managing our international insurance business, we analyze
annualized new business premiums, which do not correspond to revenues under U.S. GAAP. Annualized new business premiums measure the current sales performance of the segment, while revenues primarily reflect the renewal persistency of policies
written in prior years and net investment income, in addition to current sales. Annualized new business premiums include 10% of



first year premiums or deposits from single pay products. Annualized new business premiums on an actual and constant exchange rate basis are as follows for the periods indicated.

2010 to 2009 Annual
Comparison.

On a constant exchange rate basis, annualized new business premiums increased $357 million, from $1,430 million in 2009 to $1,787 million in 2010.

Annualized new business premiums, on a constant exchange rate basis, from our Life Planner operations increased
$86 million, primarily due to higher sales of retirement income and cancer whole life products in Japan.

The number of Life Planners decreased by 44, or 1%, from 6,609 as of December 31, 2009 to 6,565 as of December 31, 2010, driven
by decreases of 76 in Taiwan, 53 in Poland, and 31 in Argentina, partially offset by increases of 43 in Italy, 36 in Brazil, and 28 in Japan. Over the past twelve months, we transferred 92 Japanese Life Planners to Gibraltar, primarily in support of
our efforts to expand our bank channel distribution and to service orphaned policyholders. Factoring in these transfers, the number of Japanese Life Planners would have increased by 4%, from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010. Prior to
December 31, 2009, an additional 304 Japanese Life Planners were transferred to Gibraltar.

Annualized new business premiums, on a constant exchange rate basis, from our Gibraltar Life operation increased $271 million, primarily due to higher sales of protection products in our bank distribution
channels and sales related to a recently introduced cancer whole life product, a portion of which were sold through other complementary distribution channels.

The number of Life Advisors decreased by 117, from 6,398 as of December 31, 2009 to 6,281 as of December 31, 2010, as new hires
and 22 Life Planners transferred to Gibraltar as Life Advisors over the last twelve months were offset by resignations and terminations due in part to failure to meet minimum sales production standards. The remaining Life Planners transferred to
Gibraltar, as discussed above, are not considered Life Advisors.

2009 to 2008 Annual Comparison.

On a constant exchange rate basis, annualized new business premiums increased $142 million, from $1,288 million in 2008 to $1,430 million in
2009.

Annualized new business premiums, on a
constant exchange rate basis, from our Life Planner operations increased $46 million, primarily due to higher sales in Korea and Taiwan mostly reflective of the improving economic environment. The increased sales in Korea also reflect higher sales
in the fourth quarter in advance of price increases effective January 1, 2010.

The number of Life Planners increased by 244, or 4%, from 6,365 as of December 31, 2008 to 6,609 as of December 31, 2009, driven by increases of 74 in Brazil, 63 in Taiwan, 59 in Poland, and 31
in Korea. During the same period, the number of Life Planners in Japan increased by 23, reflective of the transfer of 152 Life Planners



to Gibraltar over the last twelve months, primarily in support of our efforts to expand our bank channel distribution and to service orphaned policyholders. Factoring in these transfers, the
number of Japanese Life Planners would have increased 5%, from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009.

Annualized new business premiums, on a constant exchange rate basis, from our Gibraltar Life operation increased $96 million, primarily
due to higher sales of protection products in our bank distribution channels.

The number of Life Advisors increased by 68, from 6,330 as of December 31, 2008 to 6,398 as of December 31, 2009, as new hires and 54 Life Planners transferred to Gibraltar as Life Advisors over
the last twelve months were offset by resignations and terminations due in part to failure to meet minimum sales production standards. The remaining Life Planners transferred to Gibraltar, as discussed above, are not considered Life Advisors.

Investment Margins and Other Profitability
Factors

Many of our insurance products sold
in international markets provide for the buildup of cash values for the policyholder at mandated guaranteed interest rates. Authorities in some jurisdictions regulate interest rates guaranteed in our insurance contracts. The regulated guaranteed
interest rates do not necessarily match the actual returns on the underlying investments. The spread between the actual investment returns and these guaranteed rates of return to the policyholder is an element of the profit or loss that we will
experience on these products. With regulatory approval, guaranteed rates may be changed on new business. While these actions enhance our ability to set rates commensurate with available investment returns, the major sources of profitability on our
products sold in Japan, other than those sold by Gibraltar Life, are margins on mortality, morbidity and expense charges rather than investment spreads.

We base premiums and cash values in most countries in which we operate on mandated mortality and morbidity tables. Our mortality and
morbidity experience in the International Insurance segment on an overall basis in the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was well within our pricing assumptions and below the guaranteed levels reflected in the premiums we charge.

International Investments

Operating Results

The following table sets forth the International Investments
segment’s operating results for the periods indicated.

(1)

Revenues exclude Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments. See “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account
Investments—Realized Investment Gains and Losses.”

(2)

Equity in earnings of operating joint ventures are included in adjusted operating income but excluded from income from continuing operations before
income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures as they are reflected on a U.S. GAAP basis on an after-tax basis as a separate line in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests are
excluded from adjusted operating income but included in income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings



of operating joint ventures as they are reflected on a U.S. GAAP basis as a separate line in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests
represents the portion of earnings from consolidated entities that relates to the equity interests of minority investors.

On January 18, 2008, we made an additional investment of $154 million in our UBI Pramerica operating joint venture in Italy, which we
account for under the equity method. This additional investment was necessary to maintain our ownership interest at 35 percent and was a result of the merger of our joint venture partner with another Italian bank, and their subsequent consolidation
of their asset management companies into the UBI Pramerica joint venture.

On July 1, 2008, we acquired a 40 percent interest in GAP Asset Management of Brazil, which we account for under the equity method as an operating joint venture.

On May 25, 2009, we entered into an agreement with
Mexican financial services group Grupo Actinver SA to sell our mutual fund and banking operations in Mexico. As a result, these operations are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. This transaction closed on October 6,
2009. We recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of $14 million, which is also reflected in discontinued operations. This transaction did not include our insurance business, our pension fund business or our real estate investments that are located in
Mexico.

In February 2010, we signed a definitive
agreement to sell Prudential Investment & Securities Co., Ltd. and Prudential Asset Management Co., Ltd, which together comprised our Korean asset management operations. As a result, we reflected results of our Korean asset management
operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented. This transaction closed on June 1, 2010. We recorded an after-tax loss on the sale of $5 million in 2010, which is also reflected in discontinued operations.

Adjusted Operating Income

2010 to 2009 Annual
Comparison.

Adjusted operating income increased $19 million, from $27 million in 2009 to $46 million in 2010. The increase in adjusted operating income primarily reflects improved results from the segment’s global
commodities operations due to more favorable sales and trading results, partially offset by a write-down of software technology in 2010. Also contributing to the increase in adjusted operating income was higher asset-based fees in 2010 from the
segment’s asset management businesses.

2009 to 2008 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income increased $387 million, from a loss of $360
million in 2008 to income of $27 million in 2009, primarily reflecting impairment charges of $422 million in 2008 related to goodwill and operating joint ventures in Italy, Brazil and Mexico, all associated with the segment’s asset management
businesses, resulting from the significant deterioration in financial market conditions during the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding these impairments, adjusted operating income decreased $39 million from the prior year. The decrease reflects lower
results from the segment’s global commodities operations due to less favorable sales and trading results and a lower benefit from market value changes on securities relating to exchange memberships in 2009. This decrease was partially offset by
a $19 million credit loss related to a brokerage client that was recorded in 2008 and higher results from the segment’s asset management businesses.



Corporate and Other

Corporate and Other includes corporate operations, after
allocations to our business segments, and real estate and relocation services.

(1)

Includes consolidating adjustments.

(2)

Revenues exclude Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments. See “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account
Investments—Realized Investment Gains and Losses.”

(3)

Benefits and expenses exclude related charges which represent consolidating adjustments.

(4)

See “—Divested Businesses.”

(5)

Equity in earnings of operating joint ventures are included in adjusted operating income but excluded from income from continuing operations before income taxes and
equity in earnings of operating joint ventures as they are reflected on a U.S. GAAP basis on an after-tax basis as a separate line in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests are excluded from
adjusted operating income but included in income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures as they are reflected on a U.S. GAAP basis as a separate line in our Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the portion of earnings from consolidated entities that relates to the equity interests of minority investors.

In the third quarter of 2010, we amended our definition of
adjusted operating income to exclude the net impact of embedded derivatives related to our living benefit features and related hedge positions as well as market value changes of derivatives used in our capital hedge program. Adjusted operating
income for all periods presented has been revised to conform with the amended definition. See “—Consolidated Results of Operations—Segment Measures” for additional information.

2010 to 2009 Annual
Comparison.

The loss from Corporate and Other operations, on an adjusted operating income basis, increased $76 million, from $795 million in 2009 to $871 million in 2010. The loss from corporate operations increased $156
million, from $735 million in 2009 to $891 million in 2010. Capital debt interest expense increased $59 million due to a greater level of capital debt, which includes the issuance in September 2009 of $500 million of exchangeable surplus notes, and
reflects the use of a portion of the proceeds from prior sales of retail medium-term notes for general corporate purposes beginning in the second quarter of 2009, as well as the deployment of additional corporate borrowings for capital purposes.
Investment income, net of interest expense, excluding capital debt interest expense, decreased $5 million. Higher levels of short-term liquidity have been maintained throughout 2009 and 2010 to provide additional flexibility to address our cash
needs in view of changing financial market conditions. The need to hold higher levels of short-term liquidity, coupled with a portion of the proceeds from the sale at the end of 2009 of our minority joint venture interest in Wachovia Securities,
will result in higher than historical levels of cash and short-term investments in Corporate and Other until such time as capital is deployed to our business segments or invested longer-term. On February 1, 2011, we used a portion of this cash
and short-term investments to partially fund the purchase price for the acquisition of the Star and Edison Businesses. See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional details.



Net investment income, net of interest expense, excluding capital debt interest expense was also impacted by our repurchase of substantially all of our convertible senior notes during 2009. Also
contributing to the greater loss from corporate operations in 2010 compared to the prior year are greater net charges from other corporate activities, primarily reflecting less favorable results from corporate hedging activities, increased corporate
advertising expenses and other retained corporate expenses.

Results from corporate operations pension income and employee benefits decreased $7 million. The decrease reflects increases in employee benefits costs partially offset by an increase in income from our
qualified pension plan. Income from our qualified pension plan increased $13 million, from $308 million in 2009 to $321 million in 2010.

For purposes of calculating pension income from our own qualified pension plan for the year ended December 31, 2011, we will decrease
the discount rate to 5.60% from 5.75% in 2010. The expected rate of return on plan assets will decrease to 7.00% in 2011 from 7.50% in 2010 and the assumed rate of increase in compensation will remain unchanged at 4.5%. We determined our expected
rate of return on plan assets based upon a building block approach that considers inflation, real return, term premium, credit spreads, equity risk premium and capital appreciation as well as expenses, expected asset manager performance and the
effect of rebalancing for the equity, debt and real estate asset mix applied on a weighted average basis to our pension asset portfolio. Giving effect to the foregoing assumptions and other factors, we expect on a consolidated basis income from our
own qualified pension plan will continue to contribute to adjusted operating income in 2011, but at a level of about $25 million to $35 million lower than that of the year 2010. Other postretirement benefit expenses will increase in a range of $2
million to $5 million. The increase is driven primarily by the change in the expected rate of return on plan assets from 7.50% to 7.00%, demographic updates, and a change in the discount rate from 5.50% to 5.35%. These changes are partially offset
by an increase in actual returns on plan assets. In 2011, pension and other postretirement benefit service costs related to active employees will continue to be allocated to our business segments.

Adjusted operating income of our real estate and relocation
services business increased $80 million, from a loss of $60 million in 2009 to income of $20 million in 2010. The increase in adjusted operating income reflects higher relocation transaction volume and higher real estate average home sale prices, as
well as lower operating expenses in 2010 compared to the prior year. In addition, results include our share of the earnings from equity method investments, which included goodwill impairments recorded in 2009 within these entities.

2009 to 2008 Annual
Comparison.

The loss from corporate and other operations, on an adjusted operating income basis, increased $400 million, from $395 million in 2008 to $795 million in 2009. The loss from corporate operations increased $529
million, from $206 million in 2008 to $735 million in 2009. Investment income, net of interest expense, excluding capital debt interest expense, decreased $272 million, primarily reflecting lower earnings from the investment of proceeds from our
debt issuances, and other borrowings, which are invested in cash and short-term investments, as well as lower yields on cash equivalents. Higher levels of short-term liquidity have been maintained in 2009 to provide additional flexibility to address
changing cash needs in view of volatile financial market conditions. Investment income, net of interest expense, excluding capital debt interest expense was also impacted by our repurchase, since December 2008, of substantially all of our
convertible senior notes, the proceeds of which had been invested primarily in short-term investments, as well as lower earnings on other invested assets. Capital debt interest expense increased $164 million due to a greater level of capital debt,
which includes the issuance in June 2008 of $1.5 billion of junior subordinated notes and reflects the use of a portion of the proceeds from prior sales of retail medium-term notes for general corporate purposes in 2009. Previously, these proceeds
were used to support an asset portfolio within the Retirement segment for which the Company has employed a substitute funding source, as discussed in “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Financing Activities.” Also contributing to
the greater loss from corporate operations in 2009 are increased losses from other corporate activities, which reflects an increase in our deferred compensation liabilities and other retained corporate expenses. The increased losses were partially
offset by a decline in the level of costs related to our retained obligations to certain policyholders with whom we had previously agreed to provide insurance for reduced or no premium in accordance with contractual settlements related to prior
individual life sales practice remediation. Both our deferred compensation liabilities and our retained obligations to certain policyholders are impacted by financial market conditions.



Corporate operations pension income and employee benefits decreased $62 million. The
decrease reflects increased post-retirement benefit costs due to the amortization of prior year losses and lower investment returns due to the lower asset base reflective of market conditions in late 2008 and early 2009, partially offset by an
increase in income from our qualified pension plan. Income from our qualified pension plan increased $18 million, from $290 million in 2008 to $308 million in 2009.

The loss, on an adjusted operating income basis, of our real
estate and relocation services business decreased $129 million, from $189 million in 2008 to $60 million in 2009. Results in 2008 include a goodwill impairment of $117 million recorded during the fourth quarter of 2008. This impairment, which was
all of the goodwill associated with this business, was reflective of the further deterioration of the U.S. housing market that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2008 and our view of the timing of the future recovery of this market, which
resulted in a decrease in the expected future earnings of this business. Excluding this impairment, the loss decreased $12 million, reflecting lower loan loss provisions and lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower royalty fees and lower
relocation revenue from real estate referral fees primarily due to unfavorable residential real estate market conditions. Results for 2009 also include our share of the earnings from equity method investments, which include goodwill impairments
recorded in 2009 within these entities.

Capital hedge program

Corporate and Other operations includes the results of our capital hedge program which broadly addresses the equity market exposure of the
statutory capital of the Company as a whole, under stress scenarios, as described under “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Liquidity and Capital Resources of Subsidiaries—Domestic Insurance Subsidiaries.” For the year ended
December 31, 2010, the result of this hedge was a loss of $15 million, of which $7 million reflects market value changes of derivatives included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net and related adjustments.”

In addition, we manage certain risks associated with our
variable annuity products through our living benefit hedging program, which is described under “—U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division—Individual Annuities.” Consistent with sound risk management practices,
we evaluate hedge levels versus our target given overall capital considerations of the Company and prevailing capital market conditions and may decide to temporarily hedge to an amount that differs from our hedge target definition. Because this
decision is based on the overall capital considerations of the Company as a whole, the impact on results from temporarily hedging to an amount that differs from our target hedge definition is reported through Corporate and Other operations. For the
year ended December 31, 2010, “Realized investment gains (losses), net and related adjustments” includes a gain of $306 million representing the impact of hedging to an amount that differed from our target hedge definition.

We assess the composition of our hedging program
on an ongoing basis, and we may change it from time to time based on our evaluation of the Company’s risk position or other factors.

Results of Operations of Closed Block Business

We established the Closed Block Business effective as of the
date of demutualization. The Closed Block Business includes our in force traditional domestic participating life insurance and annuity products and assets that are used for the payment of benefits and policyholder dividends on these policies, as
well as other assets and equity and related liabilities that support these policies. We no longer offer these traditional domestic participating policies. See “—Overview—Closed Block Business” for additional details.

Each year, the Board of Directors of Prudential Insurance
determines the dividends payable on participating policies for the following year based on the experience of the Closed Block, including investment income, net realized and unrealized investment gains, mortality experience and other factors.
Although Closed Block experience for dividend action decisions is based upon statutory results, at the time the Closed Block was established, we developed, as required by U.S. GAAP, an actuarial calculation of the timing of the maximum future
earnings from the policies included in the Closed Block. If actual cumulative earnings in any given period are greater than the cumulative earnings we expected, we will record this excess as a policyholder dividend



obligation. We will subsequently pay this excess to Closed Block policyholders as an additional dividend unless it is otherwise offset by future Closed Block performance that is less favorable
than we originally expected. The policyholder dividends we charge to expense within the Closed Block Business will include any change in our policyholder dividend obligation that we recognize for the excess of actual cumulative earnings in any given
period over the cumulative earnings we expected in addition to the actual policyholder dividends declared by the Board of Directors of Prudential Insurance.

As of December 31, 2010, the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was $126 million, which was
recorded as a policyholder dividend obligation. Actual cumulative earnings, as required by U.S. GAAP, reflect the recognition of realized investment gains and losses in the current period, as well as changes in assets and related liabilities that
support the Closed Block policies. Additionally, the accumulation of net unrealized investment gains that have arisen subsequent to the establishment of the Closed Block have been reflected as a policyholder dividend obligation of $2,117 million at
December 31, 2010, to be paid to Closed Block policyholders unless offset by future experience, with an offsetting amount reported in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).”

Operating Results

Management does not consider adjusted operating income to
assess the operating performance of the Closed Block Business. Consequently, results of the Closed Block Business for all periods are presented only in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following table sets forth the Closed Block Business U.S. GAAP
results for the periods indicated.

Income (Loss) from Continuing
Operations Before Income Taxes and Equity in Earnings of Operating Joint Ventures

2010 to 2009 Annual Comparison.

Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures increased $1,205 million, from
a loss of $480 million in 2009 to income of $725 million in 2010. Results for 2010 include an increase of $2,079 million in net realized investment gains (losses), from losses of $1,285 million in 2009 to gains of $794 million in 2010, primarily due
to lower impairments and credit losses, as well as a net increase in the market value of derivatives used in duration management programs. For a discussion of Closed Block Business realized investment gains (losses), net, see “—Realized
Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—Realized Investment Gains and Losses.” Net investment income, net of interest expense, increased $67 million, primarily due to an increase in income on joint ventures and limited
partnership investments accounted for under the equity method, partially offset by lower portfolio yields. In addition, dividends paid and accrued to policyholders decreased primarily due to a decrease in the 2010 dividend scale. The impact of these
items contributed to the actual cumulative earnings which, when compared to the expected cumulative earnings, resulted in an increase in the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation expense of $977 million, from 2009 compared to 2010. As
noted above, as of December 31, 2010, the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was $126 million. If actual cumulative earnings fall below expected cumulative earnings in future periods, earnings volatility
in the Closed Block Business, which is primarily due to changes in investment results, may not be offset by changes in the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation.

2009 to 2008 Annual
Comparison.

Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures decreased $496 million, from income of $16 million in 2008 to a



loss of $480 million in 2009. Results for 2009 include a decrease of $1,300 million in net realized investment gains (losses), from gains of $15 million in 2008 to losses of $1,285 million in
2009, primarily due to a net decrease in the market value of derivatives used in duration management programs. For a discussion of Closed Block Business realized investment gains (losses), net, see “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses
and General Account Investments—Realized Investment Gains and Losses.” Net investment income, net of interest expense, decreased $199 million, primarily related to lower portfolio yields, including lower interest rates on floating rate
investments due to rate resets and reinvestments at lower yields, as well as a decrease in income on joint ventures and limited partnership investments accounted for under the equity method. These decreases to income were partially offset by a
decrease of $348 million in dividends paid and accrued to policyholders, primarily due to a decrease in the dividend scales for 2009 and 2010. In addition, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs decreased $46 million reflecting the impact
of investment losses on actual gross margins for the period compared to the previously estimated expected gross margins for the period. During 2009, the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation was reduced from $851 million to zero, and
was a partial offset to the decline in earnings as discussed above. In 2008, the change in the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation of $299 million was an offset to the decline in earnings in the period. As of December 31, 2009,
actual cumulative earnings were below the expected cumulative earnings by $601 million. There will be no cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation until this amount is recovered.

Revenues

2010 to 2009 Annual Comparison.

Revenues, as shown in the table above under “—Operating
Results,” increased $1,841 million, from $5,245 million in 2009 to $7,086 million in 2010, principally driven by the $2,079 million increase in net realized investment gains (losses) and an increase of $69 million in net investment income, as
discussed above. Partially offsetting these items was a decline in premiums, with a related decrease in changes in reserves, primarily due to a lower amount of dividends available for policyholders to purchase additional insurance, as a result of
the 2010 dividend scale reduction, and to a lesser extent, the expected in force decline as policies terminate.

2009 to 2008 Annual Comparison

.    Revenues decreased $1,814 million, from $7,059 million in 2008 to $5,245
million in 2009, principally driven by the $1,300 million decrease in net realized investment gains (losses) and a decrease of $243 million in net investment income, as discussed above. In addition, premiums declined, with a related decrease in
changes in reserves, primarily due to a lower amount of dividends used by policyholders to purchase additional insurance, as a result of the 2009 and 2010 dividend scale reductions, and to a lesser extent, the expected in force decline as policies
terminate.

Benefits and Expenses

2010 to 2009 Annual
Comparison.

Benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased $636 million, from $5,725 million in 2009 to $6,361 million in 2010. This increase included an $849
million increase in dividends to policyholders reflecting an increase in the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation expense of $977 million, representing an $851 million reduction in the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend
obligation in 2009, compared to a $126 million increase in the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation in 2010. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in dividends paid and accrued to policyholders of $128 million, primarily
due to a decrease in the 2010 dividend scale. Policyholders’ benefits, including changes in reserves, decreased $250 million driven by a decline in premiums, as discussed above.

2009 to 2008 Annual Comparison.

Benefits and expenses decreased $1,318 million,
from $7,043 million in 2008 to $5,725 million in 2009. This decline included a $900 million decrease in dividends to policyholders reflecting a decrease in the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation expense of $552 million, as well as
a decrease in dividends paid and accrued to policyholders of $348 million, primarily due to a decrease in the dividend scales. Policyholders’ benefits, including changes in reserves, decreased $325 million driven by a decline in premiums, as
discussed above. In addition, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs decreased reflecting the impact of investment losses on actual gross margins for the period compared to the previously estimated expected gross margins for the period.



Income Taxes

Shown below is our income tax provision for the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, separately reflecting the impact of certain significant items. Also presented below is the income tax provision that would have resulted from application of the statutory 35% federal income tax rate in each of
these periods.

Our income tax provision
amounted to an income tax expense of $1,310 million in 2010 compared to a benefit of $54 million in 2009. The increase in income tax expense primarily reflects the increase in pre-tax income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity
in earnings of operating joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2010. In addition, the 2009 income tax benefit included a reduction to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of $272 million primarily related to
tax years prior to 2002 as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations for the 2002 and 2003 tax years, additional interest on a tax refund received related to the 1997 through 2001 tax years, and changes in estimates. In addition, 2010
income tax expense includes a charge for the reduction of deferred tax assets in the amount of $94 million related to the Medicare Part D subsidy and a charge of $29 million to reflect an increase in valuation allowance related to deferred tax
assets established in 2010 and prior years. The change in valuation allowance in the current year reflects the Company’s reassessment of the likelihood of the realization of state and local deferred tax assets for certain non-insurance
subsidiaries.

We employ various tax strategies,
including strategies to minimize the amount of taxes resulting from realized capital gains.

For additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Discontinued Operations

Included within net income are the results of businesses which are reflected as discontinued operations under U.S. GAAP. Income (loss)
from discontinued operations, net of taxes, was $10 million, $(39) million and $75 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

For additional information regarding discontinued operations
see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Divested Businesses

Our income from continuing operations includes results from several businesses that have been or will be sold
or exited that do not qualify for “discontinued operations” accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP. The results of these divested businesses are reflected in our Corporate and Other operations, but excluded from adjusted operating income. A
summary of the results of these divested businesses that have been excluded from adjusted operating income is as follows for the periods indicated:

(1)

Primarily includes Prudential Securities Capital Markets and exchange shares previously held by Prudential Equity Group.

Financial Advisory

In 2008, we classified our Financial Advisory business as a
divested business, reflecting our intention to exit this business. This business consists of our former investment in the Wachovia Securities joint venture, in addition to expenses relating to obligations and costs we retained in connection with the
businesses we contributed to the joint venture, primarily for litigation and regulatory matters. On December 31, 2009, we completed the sale of our minority joint venture interest in Wachovia Securities, which includes Wells Fargo Advisors, to
Wells Fargo. At the closing, we received $4.5 billion in cash as the purchase price of our joint venture interest and de-recognized the carrying value related to our investment in the joint venture. Results for 2009 include the associated pre-tax
gain on the sale of $2.247 billion, which is reflected in “Equity in earnings of operating joint ventures, net of taxes” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Results for 2009 also include certain one-time costs related to the sale
of the joint venture interest of $104 million, for pre-tax compensation costs and costs related to increased contributions to our charitable foundation. For more information on our former investment in the Wachovia Securities joint venture,
including the “lookback” option, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

On August 15, 2008, Wachovia announced that it had reached an agreement in principle for a global settlement of investigations concerning the underwriting, sale and subsequent auction of certain
auction rate securities by subsidiaries of Wachovia Securities and had recorded an increase to legal reserves. Our recorded share of pre-tax earnings from the joint venture for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $355 million related to
the impact of this item on our share of the equity earnings of the joint venture.

Commercial Mortgage Securitization Operations

In 2008, we classified our commercial mortgage securitization operations as a divested business, reflecting our decision to exit this
business. These operations, which involved the origination and purchase of commercial mortgage loans that we in turn would aggregate and sell into commercial mortgage-backed securitization transactions, together with related hedging activities, were
previously reported within the Asset Management segment. We retained and continue the remainder of our commercial mortgage origination, servicing and other commercial mortgage related activities, which remain a part of our Asset Management segment.



Investment Gains and Losses on Trading Account Assets Supporting Insurance Liabilities and

Changes in Experience-Rated Contractholder Liabilities Due to Asset Value Changes

Certain products included in the Retirement and International
Insurance segments, are experience-rated in that investment results associated with these products are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. The investments supporting these experience-rated products, excluding derivatives and commercial
mortgage and other loans, are classified as trading and are carried at fair value. These trading investments are reflected on the statements of financial position as “Trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities, at fair value.”
Realized and unrealized gains and losses for these investments are reported in “Asset management fees and other income.” Interest and dividend income for these investments is reported in “Net investment income.” Derivatives that
support these experience-rated products are reflected on the statement of financial position as “Other long-term investments” carried at fair value and the realized and unrealized gains and losses are reported in “Realized investment
gains (losses), net.” Commercial mortgage and other loans that support these experience-rated products are carried at unpaid principal, net of unamortized discounts and an allowance for losses, and are reflected on the statements of financial
position as “Commercial mortgage and other loans.”

Adjusted operating income excludes net investment gains and losses on both trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and related derivatives. This is consistent with the exclusion of
realized investment gains and losses with respect to other investments supporting insurance liabilities managed on a consistent basis. In addition, to be consistent with the historical treatment of charges related to realized investment gains and
losses on investments, adjusted operating income also excludes the change in contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes in the pool of investments (including changes in the fair value of commercial mortgage and other loans) supporting
these experience-rated contracts, which are reflected in “Interest credited to policyholders’ account balances.” The result of this approach is that adjusted operating income for these products includes net fee revenue and interest
spread we earn on these experience-rated contracts, and excludes changes in fair value of the pool of investments, both realized and unrealized, that we expect will ultimately accrue to the contractholders.

Results for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
2008 include the recognition of net investment gains of $501 million and $1,601 million, and net investment losses of $1,734 million, respectively, on “Trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities, at fair value.” These net
investment gains and losses primarily represent interest-rate related mark-to-market adjustments, which include the impact of changes in credit spreads on fixed maturity securities. In addition, results for the years ended December 31, 2010,
2009 and 2008 include net investment gains of $50 million, losses of $131 million and gains of $126 million, respectively, related to changes in the fair value of derivatives that support these experience-rated products. Consistent with our
treatment of “Realized investment gains (losses), net,” these gains and losses, which are expected to ultimately accrue to the contractholders, are excluded from adjusted operating income. In addition, results for the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 include increases of $631 million and $899 million, and decreases of $1,163 million, respectively, in contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes in the pool of investments that support these
experience-rated contracts. These liability changes are reflected in “Interest credited to policyholders’ account balances” and are also excluded from adjusted operating income. Net investment gains net of the increase in
contractholder liabilities due to these asset valuation changes resulted in net losses of $80 million in 2010, net gains of $571 million in 2009, and net losses of $445 million in 2008. This primarily reflects timing differences between the
recognition of the interest-rate related mark-to-market adjustments and the recognition of the recovery of these mark-to-market adjustments in future periods through subsequent increases in asset values or reductions in crediting rates on
contractholder liabilities. Decreases to these contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes are limited by certain floors and therefore do not reflect cumulative declines in recorded asset values of $9 million as of December 31, 2010
and $35 million as of December 31, 2009. We have recovered and expect to recover in future periods these declines in recorded asset values through subsequent increases in recorded asset values or reductions in crediting rates on contractholder
liabilities.

In addition, as prescribed by U.S.
GAAP, changes in the fair value of commercial mortgage and other loans held in our general account, other than when associated with impairments, are not recognized in income in the current period, while the impact of these changes in value are
reflected as a change in the liability to fully participating contractholders in the current period. Included in the amounts above related to the change in the liability to contractholders as a result of commercial mortgage and other loans are
increases of $108 million and $105 million, and decreases of $144 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



Valuation of Assets and Liabilities

Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities

The authoritative guidance related to fair value established
a framework for measuring fair value that includes a hierarchy used to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. The level in the fair
value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of these levels.

The tables below present the balances of assets
and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, split between the Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business, by fair value hierarchy level. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis presented on a consolidated basis.

For additional information regarding the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value by hierarchy level see Note 20 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The
determination of fair value, which for certain assets and liabilities is dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, can have a significant impact on our results of operations. As discussed in more detail below, the determination of
fair value for certain assets and liabilities may require the application of a greater degree of judgment depending on market conditions, as the ability to value assets and liabilities can be



significantly impacted by a decrease in market activity or a lack of transactions executed in an orderly manner. For a description of the key estimates and assumptions used in our determination
of fair value, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following sections provide additional information regarding certain assets and liabilities of our Financial Services Businesses and our Closed Block Business which are valued
using Level 3 inputs and could have a significant impact on our results of operations. Information regarding Separate Account Assets is excluded as the risk of assets for these categories is primarily borne by our customers and policyholders.

Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities

Public fixed maturity securities included in Level 3 in our
fair value hierarchy are generally priced based on internally-developed valuations or non-binding broker quotes. Despite the dislocated markets and low levels of liquidity in recent years, except for our asset-backed securities collateralized by
sub-prime mortgages as discussed below, the pricing we received from independent pricing services was not materially different from our internal estimates of current market value for the remainder of our public fixed maturity portfolio. As a result,
for public fixed maturity securities we generally continued to use the price provided by the independent pricing services under our normal pricing protocol. Securities with prices based on validated quotes from pricing services are generally
reflected within Level 2. For certain private fixed maturity and equity securities, the discounted cash flow or other valuation model uses significant unobservable inputs, and accordingly, such securities are included in Level 3 in our fair value
hierarchy.

As of December 31, 2009, our
Level 3 fixed maturity securities included asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages with a fair value of $5,667 million. We reported fair values for these asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages as of
December 31, 2009 based on our determination that the market for these securities for the period was an inactive market. We considered both third-party pricing information and an internally-developed price based on a discounted cash flow model
in determining the fair value of certain of these securities. Based on the unobservable inputs used in the discounted cash flow model and the limited observable market activity, asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages were
included in Level 3 as of December 31, 2009.

Beginning in the second quarter of 2010, we observed an increasingly active market, as evidence of orderly transactions in asset-backed
securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages became more apparent. Additionally, the valuation based on the pricing we received from independent pricing services was not materially different from our internal estimates of current market value
for these securities. As a result, where third party pricing information based on the observable inputs was used to fair value the security, and based on the assessment that the market has been increasingly active, we have reported the fair values
for these asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages in Level 2 since June 30, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, the fair values of these securities included in Level 2 were $4,799 million. Transfers out of Level 3 into
Level 2 totaled $5,196 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 relating to this change.

Excluding these asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, Level 3 fixed maturity securities included approximately $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2010 and $1.1 billion as of
December 31, 2009 of public fixed maturities, with values primarily based on non-binding broker-quotes, and approximately $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2010 and $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2009 of private fixed maturities, with
values primarily based on internally-developed models. Significant unobservable inputs used included: issue specific credit adjustments, material non-public financial information, management judgment, estimation of future earnings and cash flows,
default rate assumptions, liquidity assumptions and non-binding quotes from market makers. These inputs are usually considered unobservable, as not all market participants will have access to this data.

For additional information regarding our holdings of
asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, see, “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—General Account Investments—Fixed Maturity Securities—Asset-Backed Securities.”
While the fair value of these investments is in a significant unrealized loss position due to increased credit spreads and illiquidity in the financial markets, we believe the ultimate value in aggregate that will be realized from these investments
is greater than that reflected by their current fair value.



The impact our determination of fair value for fixed maturity and equity securities has on
our results of operations is dependent on our classification of the security as either trading, available for sale, or held to maturity. For our investments classified as trading, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded within “Asset
management fees and other income.” For our investments classified as available for sale, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate
component of equity. Our investments classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost.

Other Long-Term Investments

The fair value of real estate held in consolidated investment funds is determined through an independent appraisal process. The appraisals generally utilize a discounted cash flow model, following an
income approach that incorporates various assumptions including rental revenue, operating expenses and discount rates. The appraisals also include replacement cost estimates and recent sales data as alternate methods of fair value. These appraisals
and the related assumptions are updated at least annually, and incorporate historical property experience and any observable market data, including any market transactions. Since many of the assumptions utilized are unobservable and are considered
to be significant inputs to the valuation, the real estate investments within other long-term investments have been reflected within Level 3 in our fair value hierarchy. Consolidated real estate investment funds classified as Level 3 totaled
approximately $0.4 billion as of both December 31, 2010 and 2009. Our direct investment in these funds is not material, and the majority of the assets recorded as a result of the consolidation of these funds are offset by a noncontrolling
interest reflected as a separate component of equity. The noncontrolling interest is not considered to be fair valued and therefore is not included in fair value reporting above. The fair value of fund investments, where the fair value option has
been elected, is primarily determined by the fund managers. Since the valuations may be based on unobservable market inputs and cannot be validated by the Company, these investments have also been included within Level 3 in our fair value hierarchy.
Investments in these funds included in Level 3 totaled approximately $0.3 billion as of December 31, 2010.

Derivative Instruments

Derivatives are recorded at fair value either as assets, within “Other trading account assets,” or “Other long-term investments,” or as liabilities, within “Other
liabilities,” except for embedded derivatives which are recorded with the associated host contract. The fair values of derivative contracts are determined based on quoted prices in active exchanges or through the use of valuation models, and
are affected by changes in market factors including non-performance risk. The majority of our derivative positions are traded in the over the counter, or OTC, derivative market and are classified within Level 2 in our fair value hierarchy since they
have bid and ask prices that are actively quoted or can be readily obtained from external market data providers. Our policy is to use mid-market pricing consistent with our best estimate of fair value.

The bid-ask spreads for OTC derivatives classified within
Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are generally wider than derivatives classified within Level 2 thus requiring more judgment in estimating the mid-market price of such derivatives. Derivatives classified as Level 3 include first-to-default credit
basket swaps, look-back equity options and other structured products. These derivatives are valued based upon models with some significant unobservable market inputs or inputs from less actively traded markets. OTC derivatives classified within
Level 3 are validated through periodic comparison of our fair values to broker-dealer values. The fair values of OTC derivative assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 totaled approximately $126 million and $3 million, respectively, as of
December 31, 2010 and $288 million and $6 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2009, without giving consideration to the impact of netting.

For additional information regarding embedded derivatives in our annuity and retirement products classified as Level 3, see
“—Variable Annuity Optional Living Benefit Features” below.

All realized and unrealized changes in fair value of dealer and non-dealer related derivatives, with the exception of the effective portion of qualifying cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in
foreign operations, are recorded in current earnings. Generally, the changes in fair value of non-dealer related derivatives, excluding those that qualify for hedge accounting, are recorded in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” For
additional information regarding the impact of changes in fair value of derivative instruments on our results of operations see “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—Realized Investment Gains and
Losses” below.



Variable Annuity Optional Living Benefit Features

Our liability for future policy benefits includes general
account liabilities for guarantees on variable annuity contracts, including guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (“GMAB”), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (“GMWB”) and guaranteed minimum income and withdrawal benefits
(“GMIWB”). While these guarantees primarily relate to the optional living benefit features of our Individual Annuities segment, they are also included in certain variable annuities in our International Insurance segment and certain
retirement account based group variable annuities in our Retirement segment. These benefits are accounted for as embedded derivatives and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in “Realized investment gains (losses),
net.”

The fair values of the GMAB, GMWB and
GMIWB liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefit payments to customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature. This methodology could result in either a liability
or contra-liability balance, given changing capital market conditions and various policyholder behavior assumptions. Since there is no observable active market for the transfer of these obligations, the valuations are calculated using
internally-developed models with option pricing techniques. Because there are significant assumptions utilized in the valuation of the embedded derivatives associated with our optional living benefit features that are primarily unobservable, the
liability included in future policy benefits has been reflected within Level 3 in our fair value hierarchy.

We are also required to incorporate the market perceived risk of our own non-performance in the valuation of the embedded derivatives
associated with our optional living benefit features. Since insurance liabilities are senior to debt, we believe that reflecting the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries in the valuation of the liability appropriately takes into
consideration our own risk of non-performance. To reflect the market’s perception of our own risk of non-performance, we incorporate an additional spread over LIBOR into the discount rate used in the valuations of the embedded derivative
liabilities. The additional spread over LIBOR rates incorporated into the discount rate as of December 31, 2010 generally ranged from 50 to 150 basis points for the portion of the interest rate curve most relevant to these liabilities. This
additional spread is applied at an individual contract level and only to those embedded derivatives in a liability position and not to those in a contra-liability position. As of December 31, 2010, the fair value of the embedded derivatives
associated with the optional living benefit features of the Individual Annuities segment, before the adjustment for the market’s perception of our own non-performance risk, was a net $533 million liability. This liability was comprised of
$1,503 million of embedded derivative liabilities net of $970 million of contra-liabilities. For 2010, our adjustment for the market’s perception of our own non-performance risk resulted in a $723 million decrease to the embedded derivative
liability for the Individual Annuities segment, reflecting the additional spread over LIBOR we incorporated into the discount rate used in the valuations of those embedded derivatives in a liability position. For December 31, 2009, our
adjustment for the market’s perception of our non-performance risk resulted in a $312 million decrease to the embedded derivative liability for the Individual Annuities segment. The increase in the adjustment for the market’s perception of
our non-performance risk from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010, was driven by an increase in the value of the underlying embedded derivative liabilities primarily due to lower interest rates.

The change in fair value of the GMAB, GMWB and GMIWB resulted
in a decrease in the total liability of $259 million, from a liability of $55 million as of December 31, 2009 to a contra-liability of $204 million as of December 31, 2010. The decrease primarily reflects lower expected future benefit
payments, primarily resulting from an increase in policyholder account balances driven by favorable market conditions in 2010. These changes were significantly offset by decreased amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs, and
changes in value of related hedging instruments, primarily in our Individual Annuities segment as described in more detail under “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—U.S. Retirement Solutions and
Investment Management Division—Individual Annuities.”

Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments

Realized Investment Gains and Losses

Realized investment gains and losses are generated from numerous sources, including the sale of fixed maturity securities, equity
securities, investments in joint ventures and limited partnerships and other types of investments, as well as adjustments to the cost basis of investments for other-than-temporary impairments.



Realized investment gains and losses are also generated from prepayment premiums received on private fixed maturity securities, recoveries of principal on previously impaired securities, net
changes in the allowance for losses, as well as gains and losses on sales, certain restructurings, and foreclosures on commercial mortgage and other loans, fair value changes on commercial mortgage loans carried at fair value, and fair value changes
on embedded derivatives and free-standing derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, except those derivatives used in our capacity as a broker or dealer.

For a further discussion of our policies regarding
other-than-temporary declines in investment value and the related methodology for recording fixed maturity other-than-temporary impairments, see “—General Account Investments—Fixed Maturity Securities—Other-Than-Temporary
Impairments of Fixed Maturity Securities” below. For a further discussion of our policies regarding other-than-temporary declines in investment value and the related methodology for recording equity impairments, see “—General Account
Investments—Equity Securities—Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of Equity Securities” below. For a further discussion of our policy regarding commercial mortgage and other loans, see “—General Account
Investments—Commercial Mortgage and Other Loans—Commercial Mortgage and Other Loan Quality” below.

The level of other-than-temporary impairments generally reflects economic conditions and is generally expected to increase when economic
conditions worsen and to decrease when economic conditions improve. Historically, the causes of other-than-temporary impairments have been specific to each individual issuer and have not directly resulted in impairments to other securities within
the same industry or geographic region. As discussed in more detail below, certain of the other-than-temporary impairments recognized for the year ended December 31, 2010 are primarily related to asset-backed securities collateralized by
sub-prime mortgages and Japanese commercial mortgage-backed securities that reflect adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers, foreign currency translation losses related to foreign denominated securities that are approaching maturity,
and the intent to sell securities, primarily related to asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages. Other-than-temporary impairments for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, were primarily related to asset-backed
securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages and reflected the overall deterioration of the U.S. housing market.

We may realize additional credit and interest rate related losses through sales of investments pursuant to our credit risk and portfolio
management objectives. In light of unprecedented market conditions, and in consideration of the potential impact on capital and tax positions, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, we temporarily curtailed the active trading policy of certain
portfolios. In the second quarter of 2009, we resumed a more restricted trading program in these portfolios. Other-than-temporary impairments, interest rate related losses and credit related losses on sales (other than those related to certain of
our businesses which primarily originate investments for sale or syndication to unrelated investors) are excluded from adjusted operating income.

We require most issuers of private fixed maturity securities to pay us make-whole yield maintenance payments when they prepay the
securities. Prepayments are driven by factors specific to the activities of our borrowers as well as the interest rate environment.

We use interest rate and currency swaps and other derivatives to manage interest and currency exchange rate exposures arising from
mismatches between assets and liabilities, including duration mismatches. We use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk that unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates will reduce U.S. dollar equivalent earnings generated by certain of our
non-U.S. businesses. We also use equity-based and interest rate derivatives to hedge the risks embedded in some of our annuity products. Derivative contracts also include forward purchases and sales of to-be-announced mortgage-backed securities
primarily related to our dollar roll program. Many of these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, and consequently, we recognize the changes in fair value of such contracts from period to period in current earnings, although we
do not necessarily account for the related assets or liabilities the same way. Accordingly, realized investment gains and losses from our derivative activities can contribute significantly to fluctuations in net income.

Adjusted operating income generally excludes “Realized
investment gains (losses), net,” subject to certain exceptions (realized investment gains or losses within certain of our businesses for which such gains or losses are a principal source of earnings and those associated with terminating hedges
of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments) and related charges and adjustments.



The following tables set forth “Realized investment gains (losses), net,” by
investment type for the Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business, as well as related charges and adjustments associated with the Financial Services Businesses, for the periods indicated. For additional details regarding adjusted
operating income, which is our measure of performance for the segments of our Financial Services Businesses, see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(1)

Related adjustments include that portion of “Realized investment gains (losses), net,” that are included in adjusted operating income, including those
pertaining to certain derivative contracts, as well as those within certain of our businesses for which such gains (losses) are a principal source of earnings. Related adjustments also include that portion of “Asset management fees and other
income” that are excluded from adjusted operating income, including the change in value due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period on certain assets and liabilities for which we economically hedge the
foreign currency exposure, realized and unrealized gains and losses on certain general account investments classified as “Other trading account assets,” as well as counterparty credit losses on derivative positions. See Note 22 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these related adjustments.

Reflects charges that are excluded from adjusted operating income, as described more fully in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



2010 to 2009 Annual Comparison

Financial Services Businesses

The Financial Services Businesses’ net realized
investment gains in 2010 were $256 million, compared to net realized investment losses of $1,612 million in 2009.

Net realized losses on fixed maturity securities were $361 million in 2010, compared to net realized losses of $823 million in 2009, as
set forth in the following table:

(1)

Amounts exclude prepayment premiums, other-than-temporary impairments, and credit related losses through sales of investments pursuant to our credit risk and portfolio
management objectives.

(2)

Excludes the portion of other-than-temporary impairments recorded in “Other comprehensive income (loss),” representing any difference between the fair value
of the impaired debt security and the net present value of its projected future cash flows at the time of impairment.

Net trading gains on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities of $207 million in 2010 were primarily due to sales within our
Retirement and Individual Annuities segments. Included in the gross gains on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities were $4 million of gross gains related to the sale of asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages. Net
trading gains on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities of $469 million in 2009 were primarily due to sales of government bonds in our Gibraltar Life and Japanese Life Planner operations and sales within our Individual Annuities segment.
Sales of fixed maturity securities in our Individual Annuities segment were primarily due to transfers of investments out of our general account and into separate accounts relating to an automatic rebalancing element embedded in the living benefit
features of some of our variable annuity products. There were no sales in 2009 related to asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages. See “—General Account Investments—Fixed Maturity Securities—Asset-Backed
Securities” for additional information regarding our exposure to sub-prime mortgages. See below for additional information regarding the other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities in 2010 and 2009.

Net realized gains on equity securities were $11 million in
2010, of which net trading gains on sales of equity securities were $89 million, partially offset by other-than-temporary impairments of $78 million. Net trading gains in 2010 were primarily due to private equity sales within our Corporate and Other
operations and sales within our International Insurance operations. Net realized losses on equity securities were $402 million in 2009, of which other-than-temporary impairments were $389 million and net trading losses on sales of equity securities
were $13 million. Net trading losses in 2009 were primarily due to sales within our Gibraltar Life operations. See below for additional information regarding the other-than-temporary impairments of equity securities in 2010 and 2009.

Net realized gains on commercial mortgage and other loans in
2010 were $35 million and primarily related to a net decrease in the loan loss reserves of $103 million and mark-to-market net gains on our interim loan



portfolio of $17 million. These net gains were partially offset by net realized losses on loan modifications, payoffs, and foreclosures within our commercial mortgage operations. Net losses on
commercial mortgage and other loans in 2009 were $517 million primarily related to the net increase in the loan loss reserve of $317 million and mark-to-market losses on mortgage loans within our commercial mortgage operations. For additional
information regarding our commercial mortgage and other loan loss reserves see “—General Account Investments—Commercial Mortgage and Other Loans—Commercial Mortgage and Other Loan Quality.”

Net realized gains on derivatives were $601 million in 2010,
compared to net realized gains of $171 million in 2009. The net derivative gains in 2010 primarily reflect net gains of $521 million on interest rate derivatives used to manage duration as interest rates declined and net gains of $325 million
primarily related to embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with certain variable annuity contracts. See “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—U.S. Retirement Solutions and
Investment Management Division—Individual Annuities” for additional information. Also contributing to these gains are net derivative gains of $99 million on currency derivatives used to hedge foreign denominated investments and net gains
of $43 million on embedded derivatives associated with certain externally-managed investments in the European market. Partially offsetting these gains were net derivative losses of $319 million on foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge the
future income of non-U.S. businesses primarily in Japan and net losses of $75 million on credit derivatives as credit spreads tightened. The net derivative gains in 2009 primarily reflect net gains of $376 million on embedded derivatives and related
hedge positions associated with certain variable annuity contracts. Also contributing to the net derivative gains in 2009 were net gains of $196 million on embedded derivatives associated with certain externally-managed investments in the European
market and net gains of $87 million on mark-to-market adjustments from credit derivatives. Partially offsetting these gains were net mark-to-market losses of $376 million on interest rate derivatives used to manage duration and net losses of $121
million on currency derivatives used to hedge foreign denominated investments.

Net realized losses on other investments were $30 million in 2010, which reflected $30 million of other other-than-temporary impairments on joint ventures and partnerships and real estate investments. Net
realized losses on other investments were $41 million in 2009, which included $48 million of other-than-temporary impairments on joint ventures and partnerships and losses on investment real estate in our asset management operations.

During 2010, we recorded other-than-temporary impairments of
$672 million in earnings, compared to total other-than-temporary impairments of $1,611 million recorded in earnings in 2009. The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the composition of other-than-temporary impairments recorded in
earnings attributable to the Financial Services Businesses by asset type, and for fixed maturity securities, by reason.

(1)

Excludes the portion of other-than-temporary impairments recorded in “Other comprehensive income (loss),” representing any difference between the fair value
of the impaired debt security and the net present value of its projected future cash flows at the time of impairment.

(2)

Includes other-than-temporary impairments relating to investments in joint ventures and partnerships.



(1)

Excludes the portion of other-than-temporary impairment recorded in “Other comprehensive income (loss),” representing any difference between the fair value of
the impaired debt security and the net present value of its projected future cash flows at the time of impairment.

(2)

Represents circumstances where we believe credit events or other adverse conditions of the respective issuers have caused, or will lead to, a deficiency in the
contractual cash flows related to the investment. The amount of the impairment recorded in earnings is the difference between the amortized cost of the debt security and the net present value of its projected future cash flows discounted at the
effective interest rate implicit in the debt security prior to impairment.

(3)

Primarily represents circumstances where we intend to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized
cost basis.

Fixed maturity
other-than-temporary impairments in 2010 were concentrated in asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, Japanese commercial mortgage-backed securities, and the services, manufacturing, and finance sectors of our corporate
securities. These other-than-temporary impairments were primarily driven by asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages that reflect adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers, the impact of the rising forward LIBOR
curve and the intent to sell securities. Additionally, other-than-temporary impairments were driven by Japanese commercial mortgage-backed securities that reflect adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers, and foreign currency
translation losses related to foreign denominated securities that are approaching maturity. Our Japanese insurance operations hold U.S. dollar-denominated investments which in some cases, due primarily to the strengthening of the yen, are currently
in an unrealized loss position. As they approach maturity and remain in an unrealized loss position, it becomes less likely that the exchange rates will recover and more likely that losses will be realized upon maturity. Accordingly, additional
impairments would be recorded in earnings. As of December 31, 2010, gross unrealized losses related to those securities maturing between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2012 are $201 million. Based on December 31, 2010 fair
values, absent a change in currency rates, impairments of approximately $169 million would be recorded in earnings in 2011. During 2010, we recorded other-than-temporary impairments of $143 million in earnings related to securities with an
unrealized foreign currency translation loss that are approaching maturity. Fixed maturity other-than-temporary impairments in 2009 were concentrated in asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, and the manufacturing and
services sectors of our corporate securities, and were primarily driven by liquidity concerns, downgrades in



credit, bankruptcy or other adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers, which have caused, or we believe will lead to, a deficiency in the contractual cash flows related to the
investment.

Equity security other-than-temporary
impairments in 2010 and 2009 were primarily driven by circumstances where the decline in value was maintained for one year or greater or where we intend to sell the security. Equity security other-than-temporary impairments in 2010 were primarily in
our Japanese insurance operations equity portfolios. Equity security other-than-temporary impairments in 2009 were primarily driven by declines in value of fund shares representing our interest in high yield bond funds of certain of our separate
account investments supporting corporate-owned life insurance and circumstances where we lack the ability or intent to retain the security to recovery.

Closed Block Business

For the Closed Block Business, net realized investment gains in 2010 were $794 million, compared to net realized investment losses of
$1,285 million in 2009.

Net realized gains on
fixed maturity securities were $117 million in 2010, compared to net realized losses of $381 million in 2009, as set forth in the following table:

(1)

Amounts exclude prepayment premiums, other-than-temporary impairments, and credit related losses through sales of investments pursuant to our credit risk and portfolio
management objectives.

(2)

Excludes the portion of other-than-temporary impairments recorded in “Other comprehensive income (loss),” representing any difference between the fair value
of the impaired debt security and the net present value of its projected future cash flows at the time of impairment.

Net trading gains on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities of $263 million in 2010 included $3 million of gross gains on sales
or maturities related to asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages in 2010. See “—General Account Investments—Fixed Maturity Securities—Asset-Backed Securities” for additional information regarding our
exposure to sub-prime mortgages. See below for additional information regarding the other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities in 2010 and 2009.

Net realized gains on equity securities were $174 million in
2010. Net trading gains on sales of equity securities were $208 million, partially offset by other-than-temporary impairments of $34 million. Net realized losses on equity securities were $473 million in 2009, of which other-than-temporary
impairments were $613 million, partially offset by net trading gains on sales of equity securities of $140 million. These gains reflect improved equity markets throughout 2010 and 2009 coupled with the current equity trading strategy which produced
gains as the years progressed. See below for additional information regarding the other-than-temporary impairments of equity securities in 2010 and 2009.



Net realized gains on commercial mortgage and other loans in 2010 were $18 million related
to a net decrease in the loan loss reserve of $22 million, partially offset by net realized losses. Net realized losses on commercial mortgage and other loans in 2009 were $85 million related to a net increase in the loan loss reserve of $82 million
and other net realized losses. For additional information regarding our loan loss reserves see “—General Account Investments—Commercial Mortgage and Other Loans—Commercial Mortgage and Other Loan Quality.”

Net realized gains on derivatives were $489 million in 2010,
compared to net realized losses of $298 million in 2009. Derivative gains in 2010 primarily reflect net mark-to-market gains of $404 million on interest rate derivatives used to manage duration as interest rates declined and net derivative gains of
$74 million on currency derivatives used to hedge foreign denominated investments. Also, contributing to the net derivative gains were net realized gains of $17 million on embedded derivatives associated with certain externally-managed investments
in the European market. Derivative losses in 2009 primarily reflect net mark-to-market losses of $218 million on interest rate derivatives used to manage the duration of the fixed maturity investment portfolio and net losses of $149 million related
to currency derivatives used to hedge foreign denominated investments. Partially offsetting these losses were net gains of $52 million on embedded derivatives associated with certain externally-managed investments in the European market.

Net realized losses on other investments were $4 million in
2010, which included $6 million of other-than-temporary impairments on joint ventures and partnerships investments. Net realized losses on other investments were $48 million in 2009 of which $51 million was related to other-than-temporary
impairments on joint ventures and partnerships investments.

During 2010, we recorded other-than-temporary impairments of $208 million in earnings, compared to other-than-temporary impairments of $1,184 million recorded in earnings in 2009. The following tables set
forth, for the periods indicated, the composition of other-than-temporary impairments recorded in earnings attributable to the Closed Block Business by asset type, and for fixed maturity securities, by reason.

(1)

Excludes the portion of other-than-temporary impairments recorded in “Other comprehensive income (loss),” representing any difference between the fair value
of the impaired debt security and the net present value of its projected future cash flows at the time of impairment.

(2)

Includes other-than-temporary impairments relating to investments in joint ventures and partnerships.



(1)

Excludes the portion of other-than-temporary impairment recorded in “Other comprehensive income (loss),” representing any difference between the fair value of
the impaired debt security and the net present value of its projected future cash flows at the time of impairment.

(2)

Represents circumstances where we believe credit events or other adverse conditions of the respective issuers have caused, or will lead to, a deficiency in the
contractual cash flows related to the investment. The amount of the impairment recorded in earnings is the difference between the amortized cost of the debt security and the net present value of its projected future cash flows discounted at the
effective interest rate implicit in the debt security prior to impairment.

(3)

Primarily represents circumstances where we intend to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized
cost basis.

Fixed maturity
other-than-temporary impairments in 2010 were concentrated in asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages that reflect adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers as well as our intent to sell certain asset-backed
securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages. Fixed maturity other-than-temporary impairments in 2009 were concentrated in asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, and the manufacturing and services sectors of our corporate
securities and were primarily driven by liquidity concerns, downgrades in credit, bankruptcy or other adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers, which have caused, or we believe will lead to, a deficiency in the contractual cash flows
related to the investment.

Equity security
other-than-temporary impairments in 2010 and 2009 were primarily due to circumstances where the decline in value was maintained for one year or greater.



2009 to 2008 Annual Comparison

Financial Services Businesses

The Financial Services Businesses’ net realized
investment losses in 2009 were $1,612 million, compared to net realized investment losses of $2,472 million in 2008.

Net realized losses on fixed maturity securities were $823 million in 2009, compared to net realized losses of $1,647 million in 2008, as
set forth in the following table:

(1)

Amounts exclude prepayment premiums, other-than-temporary impairments, and credit related losses through sales of investments pursuant to our credit risk and portfolio
management objectives.

(2)

Excludes the portion of 2009 other-than-temporary impairments recorded in “Other comprehensive income (loss),” representing any difference between the fair
value of the impaired debt security and the net present value of its projected future cash flows at the time of impairment.

Net trading gains on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities of $469 million in 2009 were primarily due to sales of government
bonds in our Gibraltar Life and Japanese Life Planner operations and sales within our Individual Annuities segment. Sales of fixed maturity securities in our Individual Annuities segment were primarily due to transfers of investments out of our
general account and into separate accounts relating to an automatic rebalancing element embedded in the living benefit features of some of our variable annuity products. Net trading gains on sales and maturities of fixed maturity investments of $111
million in 2008, were primarily related to sales of government bonds in our Gibraltar Life and Japanese Life Planner operations. None of the gross losses on sales and maturities in 2009 and 2008 related to asset-backed securities collateralized by
sub-prime mortgages. See “—General Account Investments—Fixed Maturity Securities—Asset-Backed Securities” for additional information regarding our exposure to sub-prime mortgages. See below for additional information
regarding the other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities in 2009 and 2008.

Net realized losses on equity securities were $402 million in 2009, of which other-than-temporary impairments were $389 million and net trading losses on sales of equity securities were $13 million. Net
trading losses in 2009 were primarily due to sales within our Gibraltar Life operations. Net realized losses on equity securities were $941 million in 2008, of which other-than-temporary impairments were $815 million and net trading losses on sales
of equity securities were $126 million. Net trading losses in 2008 were primarily due to sales within our Gibraltar Life and Life Planner operations. See below for additional information regarding the other-than-temporary impairments of equity
securities in 2009 and 2008.

Net realized gains
on derivatives were $171 million in 2009, compared to net realized gains of $282 million in 2008. The net derivative gains in 2009 primarily reflect net gains of $376 million on embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with
certain variable annuity contracts. See “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division—Individual Annuities” for additional information. Also
contributing to the net derivative gains in 2009 were net gains of $196 million on embedded derivatives associated with certain externally-managed investments in the



European market and net gains of $87 million on mark to market adjustments from credit derivatives. Partially offsetting these gains were net mark-to-market losses of $376 million on interest
rate derivatives used to manage duration and net losses of $121 million on currency derivatives used to hedge foreign denominated investments. The net derivative gains in 2008 primarily reflect net mark-to-market gains of $985 million on interest
rate derivatives used to manage duration, net gains of $226 million on currency derivatives used to hedge foreign investments in our domestic investment portfolio and net gains of $124 million related to equity market hedges used in our asset
management business. Partially offsetting these gains were net mark-to-market losses of $621 million on embedded derivatives associated with certain externally-managed investments in the European market and net losses of $456 million on embedded
derivatives and related hedge positions associated with certain variable annuity contracts.

Net realized losses on commercial mortgage and other loans and other investments were $558 million in aggregate in 2009, primarily related to $317 million of increases to commercial mortgage and other
loan loss reserves. The remaining $241 million of net realized losses on other investments was primarily driven by mark-to-market losses on mortgage loans within our commercial mortgage operations and losses on investment real estate in our asset
management operations, as well as $48 million of other other-than-temporary impairments on joint ventures and partnerships and real estate investments. Net realized losses on commercial mortgage and other loans and other investments were $166
million in aggregate in 2008, primarily related to mark-to-market losses on mortgage loans within our divested commercial mortgage securitization operations due to instability in the commercial real estate market during 2008. For additional
information regarding our commercial mortgage and other loan loss reserves see “—General Account Investments—Commercial Mortgage and Other Loans—Commercial Mortgage and Other Loan Quality.”

During 2009, we recorded other-than-temporary impairments of
$1,611 million in earnings, compared to total other-than-temporary impairments of $2,533 million recorded in earnings in 2008. The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the composition of other-than-temporary impairments recorded in
earnings attributable to the Financial Services Businesses by asset type, and for fixed maturity securities, by reason.

(1)

Excludes the portion of 2009 other-than-temporary impairments recorded in “Other comprehensive income (loss),” representing any difference between the fair
value of the impaired debt security and the net present value of its projected future cash flows at the time of impairment.

(2)

Includes other-than-temporary impairments relating to investments in joint ventures and partnerships.

(1)

Excludes the portion of 2009 other-than-temporary impairments recorded in “Other comprehensive income (loss),” representing any difference between the fair
value of the impaired debt security and the net present value of its projected future cash flows at the time of impairment.



(2)

Represents circumstances where we believe credit events or other adverse conditions of the respective issuers have caused, or will lead to, a deficiency in the
contractual cash flows related to the investment. The amount of the impairment recorded in earnings is the difference between the amortized cost of the debt security and the net present value of its projected future cash flows discounted at the
effective interest rate implicit in the debt security prior to impairment.

(3)

Primarily represents circumstances where we intend to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized
cost basis and amounts related to foreign currency translation losses for securities approaching maturity.

(1)

Represents circumstances where we believe credit events or other adverse conditions of the respective issuers have caused, or will lead to, a deficiency in the
contractual cash flows related to the investment. In certain of these circumstances the decrease in fair value, at the time the impairment was recorded, was partially driven by general credit spread widening or liquidity concerns and we believe the
recoverable value of the investment, based on the expected future cash flows, is greater than the current fair value.

(2)

Includes certain circumstances relating to asset-backed securities with a credit rating below AA, where the present value of prospective cash flows of the security have
declined, but we do not believe credit events or other adverse conditions of the respective issuers have caused a deficiency in the contractual cash flows related to the investment. Also includes circumstances where we cannot assert our ability or
intent to hold for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value. In certain of these circumstances the decrease in fair value, at the time the impairment was recorded, was driven primarily by general credit spread widening or liquidity
concerns, and we believe the recoverable value of the investment, based on the expected future cash flows, is greater than the current fair value.

Fixed maturity other-than-temporary impairments in 2009 were concentrated in asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime
mortgages, and the manufacturing and services sectors of our corporate securities, and were primarily driven by liquidity concerns, downgrades in credit, bankruptcy or other adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers, which have caused,
or we believe will lead to, a deficiency in the contractual cash flows related to the investment. Equity security other-than-temporary impairments in 2009 were primarily driven by declines in value of fund shares representing our interest in high
yield bond funds of certain of our separate account investments supporting corporate owned life insurance and circumstances where we lack the ability or intent to retain the security to recovery. Fixed maturity other-than-temporary impairments in
2008 were concentrated in asset-backed securities and the finance, services, and manufacturing sectors of our corporate securities, and were primarily driven by credit spread increases, liquidity concerns, downgrades in credit, bankruptcy or other
adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers. Fixed maturity other-than-temporary impairments in 2008 included $84 million related to the filing of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition by Lehman Brothers and $50 million related to American
International Group, or AIG. Equity security other-than-temporary impairments in 2008 were primarily driven by overall declines in the Japanese equity markets and value declines in our mutual fund shares representing our interest in high yield bond
funds of certain of our separate account investments supporting corporate owned life insurance.

As mentioned above, fixed maturity other-than-temporary impairments in 2008 included $84 million related to the filing of a bankruptcy petition by Lehman Brothers. In addition, 2008 also included a $75
million loss associated with this bankruptcy filing relating to the unsecured portion of our counterparty exposure on derivative transactions we had entered into with Lehman Brothers and its affiliates. We replaced these derivative positions with
various other counterparties. The loss was included in “Asset management fees and other income,” under the broker-dealer accounting model followed by our affiliated derivative subsidiary that executed these transactions, and was excluded
from adjusted operating income as a related adjustment to “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Closed Block Business

For the Closed Block Business, net realized investment
losses in 2009 were $1,285 million, compared to net realized investment gains of $15 million in 2008.



Net realized losses on fixed maturity securities were $381 million in 2009, compared to net
realized losses of $451 million in 2008, as set forth in the following table:

(1)

Amounts exclude prepayment premiums, other-than-temporary impairments, and credit related losses through sales of investments pursuant to our credit risk and portfolio
management objectives.

(2)

Excludes the portion of 2009 other-than-temporary impairments recorded in “Other comprehensive income (loss),” representing any difference between the fair
value of the impaired debt security and the net present value of its projected future cash flows at the time of impairment.

Net gains on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities of $127 million in 2009 were primarily due to sales related to our total
return strategy. Gross losses on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities of $72 million in 2009, declined in comparison to $259 million of such losses in 2008, primarily due to the restriction of our active trading policies, as discussed
below. There were no gross losses on sales or maturities in 2009 or 2008 related to asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages. In light of the unprecedented market conditions and in consideration of the potential impact on
capital and tax positions, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 we curtailed our active trading policy. Starting in the second quarter of 2009, we resumed a more restricted trading program in these portfolios. These restrictions resulted in a
lower level of realized gains and losses in this portfolio than might otherwise have been incurred. Net gains on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities of $278 million in 2008 were also primarily due to sales related to our total return
strategy.

Net realized losses on equity
securities were $473 million in 2009, of which other-than-temporary impairments were $613 million, partially offset by net trading gains on sales of equity securities of $140 million. These gains reflect improved equity markets throughout 2009
coupled with the current equity trading strategy which produced gains as the year progressed. Net realized losses on equity securities were $441 million in 2008, of which other-than-temporary impairments were $387 million, and net trading losses on
sales of equity securities were $54 million. Net trading losses for 2008 reflect sales pursuant to our active management strategy, which was curtailed or partially restricted for 2009, as discussed above. See below for additional information
regarding the other-than-temporary impairments of equity securities in 2009 and 2008.

Net realized losses on derivatives were $298 million in 2009, compared to net realized gains of $958 million in 2008. Derivative losses in 2009 primarily reflect net mark-to-market losses of $218 million
on interest rate derivatives used to manage the duration of the fixed maturity investment portfolio and net losses of $149 million related to currency derivatives used to hedge foreign denominated investments. Partially offsetting these losses were
net gains of $52 million on embedded derivatives associated with certain externally-managed investments in the European market. Derivative gains in 2008 primarily reflect net mark-to-market gains of $824 million on interest rate derivatives used to
manage duration and net gains of $149 million on currency derivatives used to hedge foreign denominated investments. Partially offsetting these gains are net losses of $105 million on embedded derivatives associated with certain externally-managed
investments in the European market.

Net realized
losses on commercial mortgage and other loans and other investments were $133 million in aggregate in 2009, including $51 million of other-than-temporary impairments on joint ventures and partnerships investments. The remaining $82 million was
primarily related to increases to commercial mortgage loan loss



reserves. Net realized losses on commercial mortgage and other loans and other investments were $51 million in aggregate in 2008, including $22 million related to other-than-temporary impairments
on joint ventures and partnerships. For additional information regarding our commercial mortgage and other loan loss reserves see “—General Account Investments—Commercial Mortgage and Other Loans—Commercial Mortgage and Other
Loan Quality.”

During 2009 we recorded
other-than-temporary impairments of $1,184 million in earnings, compared to other-than-temporary impairments of $1,127 million recorded in earnings in 2008. The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the composition of
other-than-temporary impairments recorded in earnings attributable to the Closed Block Business by asset type, and for fixed maturity securities, by reason.

Represents circumstances where we believe credit events or other adverse conditions of the respective issuers have caused, or will lead to, a
deficiency in the contractual cash flows related to the investment. In certain of these circumstances the decrease in the fair value, at



the time the impairment was recorded, was partially driven by general credit spread widening or liquidity concerns and we believe the recoverable value of the investment, based on the expected
future cash flows, is greater than the current fair value.

(2)

Includes certain circumstances relating to asset-backed securities with a credit rating below AA, where the present value of prospective cash flows of the security have
declined, but we do not believe credit events or other adverse conditions of the respective issuers have caused a deficiency in the contractual cash flows related to the investment. Also includes circumstances where we cannot assert our ability or
intent to hold for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value. In certain of these circumstances the decrease in fair value, at the time the impairment was recorded, was driven primarily by general credit spread widening or liquidity
concerns, and we believe the recoverable value of the investment, based on the expected future cash flows, is greater than the current fair value.

Fixed maturity other-than-temporary impairments in 2009 were concentrated in asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime
mortgages, and the manufacturing and services sectors of our corporate securities and were primarily driven by liquidity concerns, downgrades in credit, bankruptcy or other adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers, which have caused,
or we believe will lead to, a deficiency in the contractual cash flows related to the investment. Other-than-temporary impairments in 2008 were concentrated in asset-backed securities and the finance, services and manufacturing sectors of our
corporate securities and were primarily driven by credit spread increases, liquidity concerns, downgrades in credit, bankruptcy or other adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers. Fixed maturity other-than-temporary impairments in 2008
included $16 million related to the filing of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition by Lehman Brothers and $30 million related to AIG. Equity security other-than-temporary impairments in 2009 were primarily based on the extent and duration of the decline
in value, as equity markets only partially recovered in the latter portion of 2009. Equity security other-than-temporary impairments in 2008 were primarily driven by overall declines in the equity markets.

General Account Investments

We maintain diversified investment portfolios in our
insurance companies to support our liabilities to customers in our Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, as well as our other general liabilities. Our general account does not include: (1) assets of our brokerage, trading
and banking operations, real estate and relocation services; (2) assets of our asset management operations, including assets managed for third parties; and (3) those assets classified as “Separate account assets” on our balance
sheet.

The general account portfolio is managed
pursuant to the distinct objectives and investment policy statements of the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. The primary investment objectives of the Financial Services Businesses include:

•

matching the liability characteristics of the major products and other obligations of the Company;

•

maximizing the portfolio book yield within risk constraints over time; and

•

for certain portfolios, maximizing total return, including both investment yield and capital gains, and preserving principal, within risk constraints,
while matching the liability characteristics of their major products.

Our strategies for maximizing the portfolio book yield of the Financial Services Businesses over time include: (1) the investment of proceeds from investment sales, repayments and prepayments, and
operating cash flows, into investments with competitive yields, and (2) where appropriate, the sale of the portfolio’s lower yielding investments, either to meet various cash flow needs or to manage the portfolio’s duration, credit,
currency and other risk constraints, all while minimizing the amount of taxes on realized capital gains.

The primary investment objectives of the Closed Block Business include:

•

providing for the reasonable dividend expectations of the participating policyholders within the Closed Block Business and the Class B shareholders;
and

•

maximizing total return, including both investment yield and capital gains, and preserving principal, within risk constraints, while matching the
liability characteristics of the major products in the Closed Block Business.



In light of the recent market and economic conditions, while we continue to look to maximize
book yield and match the liability characteristics of our major products, our portfolio management approach now reflects a greater consideration of the capital and tax implications of portfolio activity, as well as our assertions regarding our
ability and intent to hold equity securities to recovery, and our lack of any intention or requirement to sell debt securities before anticipated recovery. In consideration of the potential impact on capital and tax positions, beginning in the
fourth quarter of 2008 we temporarily curtailed the active trading policy previously employed in the Closed Block Business and certain portfolios of the Financial Services Businesses. Starting in the second quarter of 2009, we resumed a more
restricted trading program in these portfolios, and continue to evaluate trading strategies for these portfolios. For a further discussion of our policies regarding other-than-temporary impairments, including our assertions regarding our ability and
intent to hold equity securities to recovery and any intention or requirement to sell debt securities before anticipated recovery, see “—Fixed Maturity Securities—Other-than-Temporary Impairments of Fixed Maturity Securities” and
“—Equity Securities—Other-than-Temporary Impairments of Equity Securities,” below.

Management of Investments

We design asset mix strategies and derivative strategies for our general account to match the characteristics of our products and other obligations and seek to closely approximate the interest rate
sensitivity, but not necessarily the exact cash flow characteristics, of the assets with the estimated interest rate sensitivity of the product liabilities. In certain markets, primarily outside the U.S., capital market limitations hinder our
ability to acquire assets that closely approximate the duration of some of our liabilities. We achieve income objectives through asset/liability management, strategic and tactical asset allocations and derivative strategies within a disciplined risk
management framework. Derivative strategies are employed within our risk management framework to help manage duration gaps, currency, and other risks between assets and liabilities. For a discussion of our risk management process see
“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Risk Management, Market Risk and Derivative Instruments, and —Other Than Trading Activities—Insurance and Annuity Products Asset/Liability Management.”

Our asset allocation also reflects our desire for broad
diversification across asset classes, sectors and issuers. The Asset Management segment manages virtually all of our investments, other than those managed by our International Insurance segment, under the direction and oversight of the Asset
Liability Management and Risk Management groups. Our International Insurance segment manages the majority of its investments locally, within enterprise risk constraints, in most cases using the international and domestic asset management
capabilities of our International Investments or Asset Management segments.

The Investment Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our proprietary investments. It also reviews performance and risk positions periodically. Our Asset Liability Management and Risk Management
groups develop the investment policy for the general account assets of our insurance subsidiaries, oversee the investment process for our general account and have the authority to initiate tactical shifts within exposure ranges approved annually by
the Investment Committee.

The Asset Liability
Management and Risk Management groups work closely with each of our business units to ensure that the specific characteristics of our products are incorporated into their processes and to develop investment objectives, including performance factors
and measures and asset allocation ranges. We adjust this dynamic process as products change, as customer behavior changes and as changes in the market environment occur. We develop asset strategies for specific classes of product liabilities and
attributed or accumulated surplus, each with distinct risk characteristics. Most of our products can be categorized into the following three classes:

•

interest-crediting products for which the rates credited to customers are periodically adjusted to reflect market and competitive forces and actual
investment experience, such as fixed annuities and universal life insurance;

•

participating individual and experience-rated group products in which customers participate in actual investment and business results through annual
dividends, interest or return of premium; and

•

guaranteed products for which there are price or rate guarantees for the life of the contract, such as GICs and funding agreements.



We determine a target asset mix for each product class, which we reflect in our investment
policies. Our asset/liability management process has permitted us to manage interest-sensitive products successfully through several market cycles.

Portfolio Composition

Our investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans, equity securities
and other invested assets. The composition of our general account reflects, within the discipline provided by our risk management approach, our need for competitive results and the selection of diverse investment alternatives available primarily
through our Asset Management segment. The size of our portfolio enables us to invest in asset classes that may be unavailable to the typical investor. The following tables set forth the composition of the investments of our general account
apportioned between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business as of the dates indicated.

(1)

Other long-term investments consist of real estate and non-real estate related investments in joint ventures and partnerships, investment real estate held through
direct ownership and other miscellaneous investments. For additional information regarding these investments, see “—Other Long-Term Investments” below.

(2)

Short-term investments have virtually no sub-prime exposure.



(3)

Includes invested assets of brokerage, trading and banking operations, real estate and relocation services, and asset management operations. Excludes assets of our
asset management operations managed for third parties and those assets classified as “Separate account assets” on our balance sheet. For additional information regarding these investments, see “—Invested Assets of Other Entities
and Operations” below.

As of
December 31, 2010, the average duration of our general account investment portfolio attributable to the domestic Financial Services Businesses, including the impact of derivatives, is between 4 and 5 years. The increase in general account
investments attributable to the Financial Services Businesses in 2010 was primarily due to portfolio growth as a result of reinvestment of net investment income and a net increase in fair value driven by a decrease in risk free rates. The increase
in general account investments attributable to the Closed Block Business in 2010 was primarily due to portfolio growth as a result of reinvestment of net investment income and a net increase in fair value driven by a decrease in risk free rates,
partially offset by net operating outflows. For information regarding the methodology used in determining the fair value of our fixed maturities, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We have substantial insurance operations in Japan, with 38%
and 36% of our Financial Services Businesses’ general account investments relating to our Japanese insurance operations as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The following table sets forth the composition of the investments of
our Japanese insurance operations’ general account as of the dates indicated.

(1)

Other long-term investments consist of real estate and non-real estate related investments in joint ventures and partnerships, investment real estate held through
direct ownership, derivatives, and other miscellaneous investments.

(2)

Excludes assets classified as “Separate accounts assets” on our balance sheet.

As of December 31, 2010, the average duration of our general account investment portfolio related to our
Japanese insurance operations, including the impact of derivatives, is approximately 12 years. The increase in general account investments related to our Japanese insurance operations in 2010 is primarily attributable to the impact of changes in
foreign currency exchange rates, portfolio growth as a result of business inflows and a net increase in fair value driven by a decrease in risk free rates.

Our Japanese insurance operations use the yen as their functional currency, as it is the currency in which they conduct the majority of
their operations. Although the majority of the Japanese general account is invested in yen denominated investments, our Japanese insurance operations also hold significant investments denominated in U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2010, our
Japanese insurance operations had $18.2 billion, at fair value, of investments denominated in U.S. dollars, including $0.7 billion that were hedged to yen through third party derivative contracts and $10.7 billion that support liabilities
denominated in U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2009, our Japanese insurance operations had $14.8 billion, at fair value, of investments denominated in U.S. dollars, including $0.5 billion that were hedged to yen through third party derivative
contracts and $7.9 billion that support liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars. For additional information regarding U.S. dollar investments held in our Japanese insurance operations see, “—Results of Operations for Financial Services
Businesses by Segment—International Insurance and Investments Division.”



Investment Results

The following tables set forth the income yield and
investment income, excluding realized investment gains (losses) and non-hedge accounting derivative results, for each major investment category of our general account for the periods indicated.



(1)

Yields are based on quarterly average carrying values except for fixed maturities, equity securities and securities lending activity. Yields for fixed maturities are
based on amortized cost. Yields for equity securities are based on cost. Yields for fixed maturities and short-term investments and cash equivalents are calculated net of liabilities and rebate expenses corresponding to securities lending activity.
Yields exclude investment income on assets other than those included in invested assets. Prior periods’ yields are presented on a basis consistent with the current period presentation.

(2)

Includes investment income of securities brokerage, securities trading, banking operations, real estate and relocation services, and asset management operations.

See below for a discussion of the
change in the Financial Services Businesses’ yields. The increase in net investment income yield attributable to the Closed Block Business for 2010 compared to 2009, was primarily due to investments in joint ventures and limited partnerships,
driven by appreciation and gains on the underlying assets, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates on floating rate investments due to rate resets and lower fixed income reinvestment rates.

The decrease in net investment income yield attributable to
the Closed Block Business for 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates on floating rate investments due to rate resets, higher losses from investments in joint ventures and limited partnerships, driven by
depreciation and losses on the underlying assets, and lower income from short-term investments as a result of lower short-term rates.



The following tables set forth the income yield and investment income, excluding realized
investment gains (losses) and non-hedge accounting derivative results, for each major investment category of the Financial Services Businesses’ general account, excluding the Japanese operations’ portion of the general account which is
presented separately below, for the periods indicated.

(1)

Yields are based on quarterly average carrying values except for fixed maturities, equity securities and securities lending activity. Yields for fixed maturities are
based on amortized cost. Yields for equity securities are based on cost. Yields for fixed maturities and short-term investments and cash equivalents are calculated net of liabilities and rebate expenses corresponding to securities lending activity.
Yields exclude investment income on assets other than those included in invested assets. Prior periods’ yields are presented on a basis consistent with the current period presentation.

(2)

Includes investment income of securities brokerage, securities trading, banking operations, real estate and relocation services, and asset management operations.

The decrease in net investment
income yield attributable to the Financial Services Businesses’ general account excluding the Japanese operations’ portfolio for 2010 compared to 2009 was primarily due to a decrease in fixed maturity yields as a result of lower interest
rates on floating rate investments from rate resets and lower fixed maturity reinvestment rates partially offset by an increase in other investment yields driven by favorable joint venture and limited partnership earnings driven by appreciation on
the underlying assets.

The decrease in net
investment income yield attributable to the non-Japanese operations’ portion of the Financial Services Businesses portfolio for 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to a decrease in fixed maturity yields as a result of lower interest rates
on floating rate investments from rate resets and a shift in asset mix stemming from enterprise risk constraints. Short-term yields also decreased as a result of lower short-term rates.



The following tables set forth the income yield and investment income, excluding realized
investment gains (losses) and non-hedge accounting derivative results, for each major investment category of our Japanese operations’ general account for the periods indicated.

(1)

Yields are based on quarterly average carrying values except for fixed maturities, equity securities and securities lending activity. Yields for fixed maturities are
based on amortized cost. Yields for equity securities are based on cost. Yields for fixed maturities and short-term investments and cash equivalents are calculated net of liabilities and rebate expenses corresponding to securities lending activity.
Yields exclude investment income on assets other than those included in invested assets. Prior periods’ yields are presented on a basis consistent with the current period presentation.

The decrease in yield on the Japanese insurance portfolio for
2010 compared to 2009 is primarily attributable to lower fixed maturity reinvestment rates and a lower short-term interest rate environment both in the U.S. and Japan, as well less favorable results in joint ventures and limited partnerships.

The decrease in yield on the Japanese insurance
portfolio for 2009 compared to 2008 is primarily attributable to lower fixed maturity reinvestment rates, including the reinvestment of proceeds realized from certain capital actions and a lower short-term interest rate environment both in the U.S.
and Japan.

The U.S. dollar denominated fixed
maturities that are not hedged to yen through third party derivative contracts provide a yield that is substantially higher than the yield on comparable Japanese fixed maturities. The average value of U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities that
are not hedged to yen through third party derivative contracts for the years ended December 31, 2010, and 2009, was approximately $12.3 billion and $10.4 billion, respectively, based on amortized cost. For additional information regarding U.S.
dollar investments held in our Japanese insurance operations see, “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—International Insurance and Investments Division.”

Fixed Maturity Securities

Investment Mix

Our fixed maturity securities portfolio consists of
publicly-traded and privately-placed debt securities across an array of industry categories. The fixed maturity securities relating to our international insurance operations are primarily comprised of foreign government securities.

We manage our public portfolio to a risk profile directed or
overseen by the Asset Liability Management and Risk Management groups and to a profile that also reflects the local market environments impacting both our domestic and international insurance portfolios. The investment objectives for fixed maturity
securities are consistent with those described above. The total return that we earn on the portfolio will be reflected both as investment income and also as realized gains or losses on investments.



We use our private placement and asset-backed portfolios to enhance the diversification and
yield of our overall fixed maturity portfolio. Within our domestic portfolios, we maintain a private fixed income portfolio that is larger than the industry average as a percentage of total fixed income holdings. Over the last several years, our
investment staff has originated the majority of our annual private placement originations through direct borrower relationships. Our origination capability offers the opportunity to lead transactions and gives us the opportunity for better terms,
including covenants and call protection, and to take advantage of innovative deal structures.

As of December 31, 2010, our consolidated direct exposure to the sovereign and local government debt of Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain was in aggregate approximately $423 million, based
on amortized cost, substantially all within the Financial Services Businesses and primarily representing Italian government securities owned by Prudential’s Italian insurance operations.

As of December 31, 2010, our consolidated direct investment exposure in Turkey, United Arab Emirates,
Israel, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, and Tunisia was in aggregate approximately $450 million, based on amortized cost, primarily within the Financial Services Businesses, and included approximately $120 million representing investment
exposure in Israel. We had no direct investment exposure in Egypt as of December 31, 2010.

Fixed Maturity Securities by Contractual Maturity Date

The following table sets forth the breakdown of the amortized cost of our fixed maturity securities portfolio in total by contractual
maturity as of December 31, 2010.



Fixed Maturity Securities and Unrealized Gains and Losses by Industry Category

The following table sets forth the
composition of the portion of our fixed maturity securities portfolio by industry category attributable to the Financial Services Businesses as of the dates indicated and the associated gross unrealized gains and losses.

Fixed Maturity Securities—Financial Services Businesses

Investment data has been classified based on standard industry categorizations for domestic public holdings and similar classifications by industry for all other
holdings.

(2)

Includes $320 million of gross unrealized gains and $68 million of gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2010, compared to $211 million of gross unrealized
gains and $133 million of gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2009 on securities classified as held to maturity.

(3)

Includes reclassifications of prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation.

The table above excludes fixed maturity securities classified as trading. See “—Other Trading Account Assets” for additional information.

The change in unrealized gains and
losses from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010, was primarily due to a net decrease in interest rates, mainly the result of risk free rates.

Asset-Backed Securities

Included within asset-backed securities attributable to the Financial Services Businesses are securities collateralized by sub-prime
mortgages. While there is no market standard definition, we define sub-prime mortgages as residential mortgages that are originated to weaker quality obligors as indicated by weaker credit scores, as well as mortgages with higher loan-to-value
ratios, or limited documentation. The significant deterioration of the U.S. housing market, high interest rate resets, higher unemployment levels, and relaxed underwriting standards for some originators of sub-prime mortgages have led to higher
delinquency rates, particularly for those mortgages issued in 2006 and 2007. Recently there has been significant attention given to potential deficiencies in lenders’ foreclosure documentation, causing delays in the foreclosure process. Many
lenders have indicated that the issues are administrative and they do not expect significant delays in their foreclosure proceedings. From the perspective of an investor in securities backed by sub-prime collateral, any significant delays in
foreclosure proceedings could result in increased servicing costs which could negatively impact the value of the impacted securities. Separately, as an investor in sub-prime securities, we are evaluating our legal options with respect to potential
remedies arising from any potential deficiencies related to the original lending and securitization practices. The following tables set forth the amortized cost and fair value of our asset-backed securities attributable to the Financial Services
Businesses as of the dates indicated, by credit quality, and for asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, by year of issuance (vintage).



Asset-Backed Securities at Amortized Cost—Financial Services Businesses



Asset-Backed Securities at Fair Value—Financial Services Businesses

(1)

Our enhanced short-term portfolio is used primarily to invest cash proceeds of securities lending and repurchase activities, commercial paper issuances and cash
generated from certain trading and operating activities. The investment policy statement of this portfolio requires that securities purchased for this portfolio have a remaining expected average life of 2 years or less when acquired.

(2)

Included within the $3.4 billion of asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages as of December 31, 2010 are $266 million of securities
collateralized by second-lien exposures.

(3)

As of December 31, 2010, includes collateralized debt obligations with amortized cost of $81 million and fair value of $87 million, with none secured by sub-prime
mortgages. Also includes asset-backed securities collateralized by education loans, equipment leases, franchises, timeshares, and aircraft.

(4)

Excluded from the tables above are asset-backed securities held outside the general account in other entities and operations. For additional information regarding
asset-backed securities held outside the general account, see “—Invested Assets of Other Entities and Operations” below. Also excluded from the table above are asset-backed securities classified as trading and carried at fair value.
See “—Trading Account Assets Supporting Insurance Liabilities” and “—Other Trading Account Assets” for additional information regarding these securities.

The tables above provide ratings as assigned by nationally
recognized rating agencies as of December 31, 2010, including Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch. In making our investment decisions, rather than relying solely on the rating agencies’ evaluations, we assign internal
ratings to our asset-backed securities based upon our dedicated asset-backed securities unit’s independent evaluation of the underlying collateral and securitization structure, including any guarantees from monoline bond insurers.

On an amortized cost basis, asset-backed securities
collateralized by sub-prime mortgages attributable to the Financial Services Businesses decreased from $4.270 billion as of December 31, 2009, to $3.424 billion as of December 31, 2010, primarily reflecting principal paydowns and
other-than-temporary impairments recognized. Gross unrealized losses related to our asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages attributable to the Financial Services Businesses were $882 million as of December 31, 2010, and
$1.293 billion as of December 31, 2009. For additional information regarding other-than-temporary impairments of asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages see “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses” above. For



information regarding the methodology used in determining the fair value of our asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The weighted average estimated
subordination percentage of our asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages attributable to the Financial Services Businesses, excluding those supported by guarantees from monoline bond insurers, was 29% as of December 31,
2010. The subordination percentage represents the current weighted average estimated percentage of the capital structure subordinated to our investment holding that is available to absorb losses before the security incurs the first dollar loss of
principal. As of December 31, 2010, based on amortized cost, approximately 64% of the asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages attributable to the Financial Services Businesses have estimated credit subordination
percentages of 20% or more, and 41% have estimated credit subordination percentages of 30% or more.

In addition to subordination, certain securities, referred to as front pay or second pay securities, benefit from the prioritization of principal cash flows within the senior tranches of the structure. In
most instances, these shorter duration senior securities have priority to principal cash flows over other securities in the structure, including longer duration senior securities. Included within the $3.424 billion of asset-backed securities
collateralized by sub-prime mortgages attributable to the Financial Services Businesses as of December 31, 2010 were $767 million of securities, on an amortized cost basis, that represent front pay or second pay securities, depending on the
overall structure of the securities.

Included
within asset-backed securities attributable to the Closed Block Business are securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, as defined above. The following tables set forth the amortized cost and fair value of our asset-backed securities
attributable to the Closed Block Business as of the dates indicated, by credit quality, and for asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, by year of issuance (vintage).

On an
amortized cost basis, asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages attributable to the Closed Block Business decreased from $3.435 billion as of December 31, 2009 to $2.757 billion as of December 31, 2010, primarily
reflecting principal paydowns and other-than-temporary impairments recognized. Gross unrealized losses related to our asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages attributable to the Closed Block Business were $673 million as of
December 31, 2010 and $988 million as of December 31, 2009. For additional information regarding other-than-temporary impairments of asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages see “—Realized Investment Gains
and Losses” above. For information regarding the methodology used in determining the fair value of our asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The weighted average estimated subordination percentage of
asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages attributable to the Closed Block Business, excluding those supported by guarantees from monoline bond insurers, was 31% as of December 31, 2010. The subordination percentage
represents the current weighted average estimated percentage of the capital structure subordinated to our investment holding that is available to absorb losses before the security incurs the first dollar loss of principal. As of December 31,
2010,



based on amortized cost, approximately 70% of the asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages attributable to the Closed Block Business have estimated credit subordination
percentages of 20% or more, and 43% have estimated credit subordination percentages of 30% or more.

In addition to subordination, certain securities, referred to as front pay or second pay securities, benefit from the prioritization of principal cash flows within the senior tranches of the structure. In
most instances, these shorter duration senior securities have priority to principal cash flows over other securities in the structure, including longer duration senior securities. Included within the $2.757 billion of asset-backed securities
collateralized by sub-prime mortgages attributable to the Closed Block Business as of December 31, 2010, were $763 million of securities, on an amortized cost basis, that represent front pay or second pay securities, depending on the overall
structure of the securities.

Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities

Weakness in commercial real estate fundamentals, along with
an overall decrease in liquidity and availability of capital have led to a very difficult refinancing environment and an increase in the overall delinquency rate on commercial mortgages in the commercial mortgage-backed securities market. Despite an
otherwise stabilizing economy, job growth, a key factor in driving demand for commercial real estate, remains weak. However, the pace of deterioration has slowed and prices of commercial real estate appear to have bottomed. There were signs of
improvement in commercial real estate fundamentals in 2010 such as vacancy rates declining from their peak and positive rent growth. In addition, we have observed several market factors related to commercial mortgage-backed securities issued in 2006
and 2007, including less stringent underwriting, higher levels of leverage and collateral valuations that are generally no longer realizable. To ensure our investment objectives and asset strategies are maintained, we consider these market factors
in making our investment decisions on securities in these vintages. The following tables set forth the amortized cost and fair value of our commercial mortgage-backed securities attributable to the Financial Services Businesses as of the dates
indicated by credit quality and by year of issuance (vintage).

Included in the table above as of December 31, 2010 are downgraded super senior securities with amortized cost of $359 million in AA and $63 million in A.

(4)

Included in the table above as of December 31, 2010 are agency commercial mortgage-backed securities with amortized cost of $221 million all rated AAA.

Included in the table above are
commercial mortgage-backed securities collateralized by Non-U.S. properties all related to Japanese commercial mortgage-backed securities held by our Japanese insurance operations with an amortized cost of $12 million in AAA, $3 million in A, $18
million in BBB and $104 million in BB and below as of December 31, 2010, and $12 million in AAA, $20 million in A, $97 million in BBB and $203 million in BB and below as of December 31, 2009.

The weighted average estimated subordination percentage of
our commercial mortgage-backed securities attributable to the Financial Services Businesses was 32% as of December 31, 2010. The subordination percentage represents the current weighted average estimated percentage of the capital structure
subordinated to our investment holding that is available to absorb losses before the security incurs the first dollar loss of principal. The weighted average estimated subordination percentage includes an adjustment for that portion of the capital
structure, which has been effectively defeased by U.S. Treasury securities. As of December 31, 2010, based on amortized cost, approximately 97% of the commercial mortgage-backed securities attributable to the Financial Services Businesses have
estimated credit subordination percentages of 20% or more, and 80% have estimated credit subordination percentages of 30% or more. The following tables set forth the weighted average estimated subordination percentage, adjusted for that portion of
the capital structure which has been effectively defeased by U.S. Treasury securities, of our commercial mortgage-backed securities collateralized by U.S. and Non-U.S. properties, attributable to the Financial Services Businesses based on amortized
cost as of December 31, 2010, by rating and vintage.

Excludes agency commercial mortgage-backed securities.



The super senior structure was introduced to the U.S. commercial mortgage-backed securities
market in late 2004 and was modified in early 2005 to increase subordination from 20% to 30%. With the changes to the commercial mortgage-backed securities structure in 2005, there became three distinct AAA classes for commercial mortgage-backed
securities with fixed rate terms, (1) super senior AAA with 30% subordination, (2) mezzanine AAA with 20% subordination and (3) junior AAA with approximately 14% subordination. The super senior class has priority over the mezzanine
and junior classes to all principal cash flows (repayments, prepayments and recoveries on defaulted loans). As a result, all super senior bonds must be completely repaid before the mezzanine or junior bonds receive any principal cash flows. In
addition, the super senior bonds will not experience any loss of principal until both the entire mezzanine and junior bonds are written down to zero. We believe the importance of this additional credit enhancement afforded to the super senior class
over the mezzanine and junior classes is limited in a benign commercial real estate cycle with low defaults but becomes more significant in a deep commercial real estate downturn under which expected losses increase substantially.

In addition to enhanced subordination, certain securities
within the super senior class benefit from the prioritization of principal cash flows. The super senior class is generally structured such that shorter duration time tranches have priority over longer duration time tranches as to all principal cash
flows (repayments, prepayments, and recoveries on defaulted loans) until the deal reaches 30% cumulative net loss, at which point all super senior securities are paid pro rata. As a result, short of reaching 30% cumulative net losses, the
“shorter duration super senior” tranches must be completely repaid before the “longest duration super senior” tranche receives any principal cash flows. We have generally focused our purchases of recent vintage commercial
mortgage-backed securities on “shorter duration super senior” tranches that we believe have sufficient priority to ensure that in most scenarios our positions will be fully repaid prior to the structure reaching the 30% cumulative net loss
threshold. The following tables set forth the amortized cost of our AAA commercial mortgage-backed securities attributable to the Financial Services Businesses as of the dates indicated, by type and by year of issuance (vintage).

approximately 95% of the commercial mortgage-backed securities attributable to the Closed Block Business have estimated credit subordination percentages of 20% or more, and 62% have estimated credit subordination percentages of 30% or more. The
following tables set forth the weighted average estimated subordination percentage, adjusted for that portion of the capital structure which has been effectively defeased by US Treasury securities, of our commercial mortgage-backed securities

As discussed above, with the changes to the commercial mortgage-backed securities market in late 2004 and early 2005, there are now three distinct AAA classes for commercial mortgage-backed securities
with fixed rate terms, (1) super senior AAA with 30% subordination, (2) mezzanine AAA with 20% subordination and (3) junior AAA with approximately 14% subordination. In addition to the enhanced subordination, certain securities within
the super senior class benefit from the prioritization of principal cash flows. The following table sets forth the amortized cost our AAA commercial mortgage-backed securities attributable to the Closed Block Business as of the dates indicated, by

Fixed Maturity Securities
Credit Quality

The Securities Valuation
Office, or SVO, of the NAIC, evaluates the investments of insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called “NAIC Designations.” In general, NAIC designations of “1”
highest quality, or “2” high quality, include fixed maturities considered investment grade, which include securities rated Baa3 or higher by Moody’s or BBB- or higher by Standard & Poor’s. NAIC Designations of
“3” through “6” generally include fixed maturities referred to as below investment grade, which include securities rated Ba1 or lower by Moody’s and BB+ or lower by Standard & Poor’s. However, in the fourth
quarter of 2009 the NAIC adopted rules which changed the methodology for determining the NAIC Designations for non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, including our asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages. Under the
new rules, rather than being based on the rating of a third party rating agency, as of December 31, 2009 the NAIC Designations for such securities are based on security level expected losses as modeled by an independent third party (engaged by
the NAIC) and the statutory carrying value of the security, including any purchase discounts or impairment charges previously recognized. The modeled results used in determining NAIC designations as of December 31, 2009, were updated and
utilized for reporting as of December 31, 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the NAIC adopted rules which changed the



methodology for determining the NAIC designations for commercial mortgage-backed securities, similar to what was done in the fourth quarter of 2009 for residential mortgage-backed securities.

As a result of time lags between the funding of
investments, the finalization of legal documents and the completion of the SVO filing process, the fixed maturity portfolio generally includes securities that have not yet been rated by the SVO as of each balance sheet date. Pending receipt of SVO
ratings, the categorization of these securities by NAIC designation is based on the expected ratings indicated by internal analysis.

Investments of our international insurance companies are not subject to NAIC guidelines. Investments of our Japanese insurance operations
are regulated locally by the Financial Services Agency, an agency of the Japanese government. The Financial Services Agency has its own investment quality criteria and risk control standards. Our Japanese insurance companies comply with the
Financial Services Agency’s credit quality review and risk monitoring guidelines. The credit quality ratings of the investments of our Japanese insurance companies are based on ratings assigned by nationally recognized credit rating agencies,
including Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, or rating equivalents based on ratings assigned by Japanese credit ratings agencies.

The amortized cost of our public and private fixed maturities attributable to the Financial Services Businesses considered other than high
or highest quality based on NAIC or equivalent rating totaled $8.7 billion, or 6%, of the total fixed maturities as of December 31, 2010 and $9.6 billion, or 7%, of the total fixed maturities as of December 31, 2009. Fixed maturities
considered other than high or highest quality based on NAIC or equivalent rating represented 27% and 29% of the gross unrealized losses attributable to the Financial Services Businesses as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As of
December 31, 2010, the amortized cost of our public and private below investment grade fixed maturities attributable to the Financial Services Businesses, based on the lowest of external rating agency ratings, totaled $10.0 billion, or 7%, of
the total fixed maturities, and include securities considered high or highest quality by the NAIC based on the new rules for residential mortgage-backed securities described above.

The amortized cost of our public and private fixed maturities
attributable to the Closed Block Business considered other than high or highest quality based on NAIC or equivalent rating totaled $5.6 billion, or 13%, of the total fixed maturities as of December 31, 2010 and $6.7 billion, or 16%, of the
total fixed maturities as of December 31, 2009. Fixed maturities considered other than high or highest quality based on NAIC or equivalent rating represented 44% of the gross unrealized losses attributable to the Closed Block Business as of
December 31, 2010, compared to 41% of gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2010, the amortized cost of our public and private below investment grade fixed maturities attributable to the Closed Block
Business, based on the lowest of external rating agency ratings, totaled $6.6 billion, or 15%, of the total fixed maturities, and include securities considered high or highest quality by the NAIC based on the new rules for residential
mortgage-backed securities described above.

Credit Derivative Exposure to
Public Fixed Maturities

In addition to the
credit exposure from public fixed maturities noted above, we sell credit derivatives to enhance the return on our investment portfolio by creating credit exposure similar to an investment in public fixed maturity cash instruments.

In a credit derivative, we sell credit protection on an
identified name, or a basket of names in a first-to-default structure, and in return receive a quarterly premium. With single name credit default derivatives, this premium or credit spread generally corresponds to the difference between the yield on
the referenced name’s public fixed maturity cash instruments and swap rates, at the time the agreement is executed. With first-to-default



baskets, because of the additional credit risk inherent in a basket of named credits, the premium generally corresponds to a high proportion of the sum of the credit spreads of the names in the
basket. If there is an event of default by the referenced name or one of the referenced names in a basket, as defined by the agreement, then we are obligated to pay the counterparty the referenced amount of the contract and receive in return the
referenced defaulted security or similar security. Subsequent defaults on the remaining names within such instruments require no further payment to counterparties.

The referenced names in the credit derivatives where we have
sold credit protection, as well as all the counterparties to these agreements, are investment grade credit quality and our credit derivatives generally have maturities of five years or less. Credit derivative contracts are recorded at fair value
with changes in fair value, including the premium received, recorded in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” The premium received for the credit derivatives we sell attributable to the Financial Services Businesses was $7 million and
$10 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and is included in adjusted operating income as an adjustment to “Realized investment gains (losses), net.”

The following tables set forth our exposure where we have
sold credit protection through credit derivatives in the Financial Services Businesses by NAIC rating of the underlying credits as of the dates indicated.

Credit Derivatives, Sold Protection—Closed Block Business

(1)

Excludes embedded derivatives contained in certain externally-managed investments in the European market. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information regarding these derivatives.

In addition to selling credit protection, we have purchased credit protection using credit derivatives in order to hedge specific credit exposures in our investment portfolio, including exposures relating
to certain guarantees from monoline bond insurers. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Financial Services Businesses had $1.785 billion and $1.852 billion of outstanding notional amounts, reported at fair value as a $2 million asset and a
$113 million asset, respectively. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Closed Block Business had $399 million and $461 million of outstanding notional amounts, reported at fair value as a liability of $1 million and an asset of $61 million,
respectively. The premium paid for the credit derivatives we purchase attributable to the Financial Services Businesses was $50 million and $52 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and is included in adjusted
operating income as an adjustment to “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding credit derivatives and an overall description of our derivative
activities.

Unrealized Losses from Fixed
Maturity Securities

The following table sets
forth the amortized cost and gross unrealized losses of fixed maturity securities attributable to the Financial Services Businesses where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost by 20% or more for the following
timeframes:

Unrealized Losses from Fixed Maturity Securities,
Greater than 20%—Financial Services Businesses

(1)

The aging of amortized cost and gross unrealized losses is determined based upon a count of the number of months the estimated fair value remained below amortized cost
by 20% or more, using month-end valuations.



The gross unrealized losses were primarily concentrated in asset-backed securities as of
December 31, 2010 and 2009. Gross unrealized losses attributable to the Financial Services Businesses where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost by 20% or more of $1.548 billion as of December 31, 2010,
includes $731 million relating to asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages. Gross unrealized losses attributable to the Financial Services Businesses where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost
by 20% or more as of December 31, 2010, also includes $65 million of gross unrealized losses on securities with amortized cost of $107 million where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost by 50% or more, of
which, $3 million was included in the less than three months timeframe, $4 million was included in the three months or greater but less than six months timeframe, $2 million was included in the six months or greater but less than nine months
timeframe, $20 million was included in the nine months or greater but less than twelve months timeframe, and $36 million was included in the greater than twelve months timeframe. We have not recognized the gross unrealized losses shown in the tables
above as other-than-temporary impairments in earnings based on our detailed analysis of the underlying credit and cash flows on each of these securities. The gross unrealized losses are primarily attributable to general credit spread widening in the
structured credit marketplace, liquidity discounts, and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and we believe the recoverable value of these investments based on the expected future cash flows is greater than or equal to our
remaining amortized cost. At December 31, 2010, we do not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before the anticipated recovery of its remaining amortized cost
basis. See “—Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of Fixed Maturity Securities” for a discussion of the factors we consider in making these determinations.

The following table sets forth the amortized cost and gross
unrealized losses of fixed maturity securities attributable to the Closed Block Business where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost by 20% or more for the following timeframes:

Unrealized Losses from Fixed Maturity Securities, Greater than
20%—Closed Block Business

(1)

The aging of amortized cost and gross unrealized losses is determined based upon a count of the number of months the estimated fair value remained below amortized cost
by 20% or more, using month-end valuations.

The gross unrealized losses were primarily concentrated in asset-backed securities as of December 31, 2010, and December 31, 2009. Gross unrealized losses attributable to the Closed Block
Business where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost by 20% or more of $677 million as of December 31, 2010, includes $561 million relating to asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages.
Gross unrealized losses attributable to the Closed Block Business where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost by 20% or more as of December 31, 2010, does not include any gross unrealized losses on securities
where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost by 50% or more. We have not recognized the gross unrealized losses shown in the tables above as other-than-temporary impairments in earnings based on our detailed analysis
of the underlying credit and cash flows on each of these securities. The gross unrealized losses are primarily attributable to general credit spread widening in the structured credit marketplace and liquidity discounts, and we believe the
recoverable value of these investments based on the expected future cash flows is greater than or equal to our remaining amortized cost. At December 31, 2010, we do not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that we
will be



required to sell these securities before the anticipated recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis. See “—Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of Fixed Maturity Securities” for a
discussion of the factors we consider in making these determinations.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of Fixed Maturity Securities

We maintain separate monitoring processes for public and private fixed maturities and create watch lists to highlight securities that
require special scrutiny and management. Our public fixed maturity asset managers formally review all public fixed maturity holdings on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration whether due to
ratings downgrades, unexpected price variances, and/or company or industry specific concerns.

For private placements, our credit and portfolio management processes help ensure prudent controls over valuation and management. We have separate pricing and authorization processes to establish
“checks and balances” for new investments. We apply consistent standards of credit analysis and due diligence for all transactions, whether they originate through our own in-house origination staff or through agents. Our regional offices
closely monitor the portfolios in their regions. We set all valuation standards centrally, and we assess the fair value of all investments quarterly. Our private fixed maturity asset managers formally review all private fixed maturity holdings on a
quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings downgrades, unexpected price variances, and/or company or industry specific concerns.

Fixed maturity securities classified as held to maturity are
those securities where we have the intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity. These securities are reflected at amortized cost in our consolidated statements of financial position. Other fixed maturity securities are considered
available for sale, and, as a result, we record unrealized gains and losses to the extent that amortized cost is different from estimated fair value. All held to maturity securities and all available for sale securities with unrealized losses are
subject to our review to identify other-than-temporary impairments in value. In evaluating whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, we consistently consider several factors including, but not limited to, the following:

•

the reasons for the decline in value (credit event, currency or interest rate related, including general credit spread widening);

•

the financial condition of and near-term prospects of the issuer; and

•

the extent and duration of the decline.

In determining whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, we place greater emphasis on our analysis of the underlying credit
versus the extent and duration of a decline in value. Our credit analysis of an investment includes determining whether the issuer is current on its contractual payments, evaluating whether it is probable that we will be able to collect all amounts
due according to the contractual terms of the security, and analyzing our overall ability to recover the amortized cost of the investment. We continue to utilize valuation declines as a potential indicator of credit deterioration, and apply
additional levels of scrutiny in our analysis as the severity and duration of the decline increases.

In addition, we recognize an other-than-temporary impairment in earnings for a debt security in an unrealized loss position when
(a) we have the intent to sell the debt security or (b) it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery or (c) a foreign currency denominated security with a foreign currency
translation loss approaches maturity. For all debt securities in unrealized loss positions that do not meet any of these criteria, we analyze our ability to recover the amortized cost by comparing the net present value of our best estimate of
projected future cash flows with the amortized cost of the security. If the net present value is less than the amortized cost of the investment, an other-than-temporary impairment is recorded. The determination of the assumptions used in these
projections requires the use of significant management judgment. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these assumptions and our policies for recognizing other-than-temporary impairments for debt
securities.



Other-than-temporary impairments of general account fixed maturity securities attributable
to the Financial Services Businesses that were recognized in earnings were $564 million and $1.162 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Included in the other-than-temporary impairments of general account fixed
maturities attributable to the Financial Services Businesses for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, were $209 million and $668 million, respectively, of other-than-temporary impairments on asset-backed securities collateralized by
sub-prime mortgages.

Other-than-temporary
impairments of fixed maturity securities attributable to the Closed Block Business that were recognized in earnings were $168 million and $520 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Included in the
other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturities attributable to the Closed Block Business for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, were $133 million and $322 million, respectively, of other-than-temporary impairments on asset-backed
securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages. For a further discussion of other-than-temporary impairments, see “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses” above.

Trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities

Certain products included in the
Retirement and International Insurance segments, are experience-rated, meaning that we expect the investment results associated with these products will ultimately accrue to contractholders. The investments supporting these experience-rated
products, excluding commercial mortgage and other loans, are classified as trading. These trading investments are reflected on the balance sheet as “Trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities, at fair value.” Realized and
unrealized gains and losses for these investments are reported in “Asset management fees and other income,” and excluded from adjusted operating income. Investment income for these investments is reported in “Net investment
income,” and is included in adjusted operating income. The following table sets forth the composition of this portfolio as of the dates indicated.

As a percentage of amortized
cost, 76% and 75% of the portfolio was publicly traded as of December 31, 2010, and December 31, 2009, respectively. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, 90% and 88%, respectively, of the fixed maturity portfolio was considered high or
highest quality based on NAIC or equivalent rating. As of December 31, 2010, $1.188 billion of the residential mortgage-backed securities were publicly traded agency pass-through securities, which are supported by implicit or explicit
government guarantees all of which have credit ratings of A or higher. Collateralized mortgage obligations, including approximately $104 million secured by “ALT-A” mortgages, represented the remaining $162 million of residential
mortgage-backed securities, of which 86% have credit ratings of A or better and 14% are BBB and below. For a discussion of changes in the fair value of our trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities see “—Investment Gains and
Losses on Trading Account Assets Supporting Insurance Liabilities and Changes in Experience-Rated Contractholder Liabilities Due to Asset Value Changes,” above.

Other Trading Account Assets

“Other trading account assets, at fair value”
consist primarily of certain financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative where we elected to classify the entire instrument as a trading account asset rather than bifurcate. These instruments are carried at fair value, with realized
and unrealized gains and losses reported in “Asset management fees and other income,” and excluded from adjusted operating income. Interest and dividend income from these investments is reported in “Net investment income,”
and is included in adjusted operating income. The following table sets forth the composition of our other trading account assets as of the dates indicated.



As of December 31, 2010, on an amortized cost basis 83% of asset-backed securities
classified as “Other trading account assets” attributable to the Financial Services Businesses have credit ratings of A or above, 11% have BBB and the remaining 6% have BB and below credit ratings. As of December 31, 2010, on an
amortized cost basis 44% of asset-backed securities classified as “Other trading account assets” attributable to the Closed Block Business have credit ratings of A or above and the remaining 56% have BBB credit ratings.

Commercial Mortgage and Other Loans

Investment Mix

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we held approximately
10% and 12%, respectively, of our general account investments in commercial mortgage and other loans. This percentage is net of a $435 million and $534 million allowance for losses as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The following
table sets forth the composition of our commercial mortgage and other loans portfolio, before the allowance for losses, as of the dates indicated.

(1)

Excluded from the table above are commercial mortgage loans held outside the general account in other entities and operations. For additional information regarding
commercial mortgage loans held outside the general account, see “—Invested Assets of Other Entities and Operations” below.

We originate commercial and agricultural mortgage loans using a dedicated investment staff and a network of independent companies through
our various regional offices. All loans are underwritten consistently to our standards using a proprietary quality rating system that has been developed from our experience in real estate and mortgage lending.

Uncollateralized loans primarily represent reverse dual
currency loans and corporate loans which do not meet the definition of a security under authoritative accounting guidance.

Residential property loans primarily include Japanese recourse loans. Upon default of these recourse loans we can make a claim against the
personal assets of the property owner, in addition to the mortgaged property. In addition, these loans are backed by third party guarantors.

Other collateralized loans attributable to the Financial Services Businesses include $75 million and $93 million of collateralized
consumer loans and $4 million and $17 million of loans collateralized by aviation assets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Composition of Commercial and Agricultural Mortgage Loans

The flow of capital to commercial real estate has improved
dramatically during 2010 as the adverse market and economic conditions that began in the second half of 2007 have improved. Portfolio lenders are actively originating loans on the highest quality properties in primary markets, resulting in an
increase in the liquidity and availability of capital in the commercial mortgage loan market. In addition, the commercial banks are selectively more active and there has been an emergence of new loan origination activity by a handful of
securitization lenders. These conditions have led to greater competition for portfolio lenders such as our general account, resulting in a tightening on loan pricing, though underwriting remains conservative. While there is still weakness in
commercial real estate fundamentals, delinquency rates on our commercial mortgage loans remain low and



relatively stable. For certain property types, the market fundamentals are beginning to stabilize, though other property types will lag in terms of rising vacancies or falling rents. For
additional information see “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses.”

Our commercial and agricultural mortgage loan portfolio strategy emphasizes diversification by property type and geographic location. The following tables set forth the breakdown of the gross carrying
values of our general account investments in commercial and agricultural mortgage loans by geographic region and property type as of the dates indicated.

Loan-to-value and debt service
coverage ratios are measures commonly used to assess the quality of commercial and agricultural mortgage loans. The loan-to-value ratio compares the amount of the loan to the fair value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan, and is
commonly expressed as a percentage. Loan-to-value ratios greater than 100% percent indicate that the loan amount is greater than the collateral value. A smaller loan-to-value ratio indicates a greater excess of collateral value over the loan amount.
The debt service



coverage ratio compares a property’s net operating income to its debt service payments. Debt service coverage ratios less than 1.0 times indicate that property operations do not generate
enough income to cover the loan’s current debt payments. A larger debt service coverage ratio indicates a greater excess of net operating income over the debt service payments.

As of December 31, 2010, our general account investments in commercial and agricultural mortgage loans
attributable to the Financial Services Businesses had a weighted average debt service coverage ratio of 1.72 times, and a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 61%. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 96% of commercial and agricultural
mortgage loans attributable to the Financial Services Businesses were fixed rate loans. As of December 31, 2010, our general account investments in commercial and agricultural mortgage loans attributable to the Closed Block Business had a
weighted average debt service coverage ratio of 1.79 times, and a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 57%. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 99% of commercial and agricultural mortgage loans attributable to the Closed Block Business
were fixed rate loans. For those general account commercial and agricultural mortgage loans attributable to the Financial Services Businesses that were originated in 2010, the weighted average debt service coverage ratio was 2.16 times and the
weighted average loan-to-value ratio was 60%.

The
values utilized in calculating these loan-to-value ratios are developed as part of our periodic review of the commercial and agricultural mortgage loan portfolio, which includes an internal evaluation of the underlying collateral value. Our periodic
review also includes a quality re-rating process, whereby we update the internal quality rating originally assigned at underwriting based on the proprietary quality rating system mentioned above. As discussed below, the internal quality rating is a
key input in determining our allowance for loan losses.

For loans with collateral under construction, renovation or lease-up, a stabilized value and projected net operating income are used in the calculation of the loan-to-value and debt service coverage
ratios. Our commercial and agricultural mortgage loan portfolio attributable to the Financial Services Businesses included approximately $0.6 billion of such loans as of December 31, 2010 and $1.1 billion of such loans as of December 31,
2009, and our commercial and agricultural mortgage loan portfolio attributable to the Closed Block Business included approximately $0.2 billion and $0.4 billion of such loans as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. All else being equal,
these loans are inherently more risky than those collateralized by properties that have already stabilized. As of December 31, 2010, there are $14 million of loan-specific reserves related to these loans attributable to the Financial Services
Businesses and no reserves attributable to the Closed Block Business. In addition, these unstabilized loans are included in the calculation of our portfolio reserve as discussed below. For information regarding similar loans we hold as part of our
commercial and agricultural mortgage operations, see “—Invested Assets of Other Entities and Operations.” The following tables set forth the gross carrying value of our general account investments in commercial and agricultural
mortgage loans attributable to the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business as of the dates indicated by loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios.

Loans by Contractual Maturity Date

The
following table sets forth the breakdown of our commercial mortgage and other loan portfolio by contractual maturity as of December 31, 2010.



Commercial Mortgage and Other Loan Quality

Ongoing review of the portfolio is performed and loans are
placed on watch list status based on a pre-defined set of criteria, where they are assigned to one of the following categories. We place loans on early warning status in cases where, based on our analysis of the loan’s collateral, the financial
situation of the borrower or tenants or other market factors, we believe a loss of principal or interest could occur. We classify loans as closely monitored when we determine there is a collateral deficiency or other credit events that may lead to a
potential loss of principal or interest. Loans not in good standing are those loans where we have concluded that there is a high probability of loss of principal, such as when the loan is in the process of foreclosure or the borrower is in
bankruptcy. In our domestic operations, our workout and special servicing professionals manage the loans on the watch list. As described below, in determining our allowance for losses we evaluate each loan on the watch list to determine if it is
probable that amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected. In our international portfolios, we monitor delinquency in consumer loans on a pool basis and evaluate any servicing relationship and
guarantees the same way we do for commercial mortgage loans.

We establish an allowance for losses to provide for the risk of credit losses inherent in the lending process. The allowance includes loan specific reserves for loans that are determined to be
non-performing as a result of our loan review process, and a portfolio reserve for probable incurred but not specifically identified losses for loans which are not on the watch list. We define a non-performing loan as a loan for which we estimate it
is probable that amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected. The loan specific portion of the loss allowance is based on our assessment as to ultimate collectability of loan principal and interest.
Valuation allowances for a non-performing loan are recorded based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or based on the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral
dependent. The portfolio reserve for incurred but not specifically identified losses considers the current credit composition of the portfolio based on the internal quality ratings mentioned above, as well as property type diversification, our past
loan experience and other relevant factors. Together with historical credit migration and default statistics, the internal quality ratings are used to determine a default probability by loan. Historical loss severity statistics by property type are
then applied to arrive at an estimate for incurred but not specifically identified losses. Historical credit migration, default and loss severity statistics are updated each quarter based on our actual loan experience, and are considered together
with other relevant qualitative factors in making the final portfolio reserve calculations. The valuation allowance for commercial mortgage and other loans can increase or decrease from period to period based on these factors. The following tables
set forth the aging schedule of our general account investments in commercial mortgage and other loans attributable to the Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Businesses.

December 31, 2010 balances are presented in a format consistent with the new disclosures required under the updated guidance issued by the FASB in 2010 relating to
the allowance for credit losses and the credit quality of a company’s financing receivable portfolio. December 31, 2009 balances are provided consistent with the prior period’s presentation.

The following table sets forth the change in valuation
allowances for our commercial mortgage and other loan portfolio as of the dates indicated.

As of December 31, 2010,
the $333 million valuation allowance for our commercial mortgage and other loan portfolio attributable to the Financial Services Businesses included $143 million related to loan specific



reserves and $190 million related to the portfolio reserve for probable incurred but not specifically identified losses. As of December 31, 2009, the $410 million valuation allowance for our
commercial mortgage and other loan portfolio attributable to the Financial Services Businesses included $162 million related to loan specific reserves and $248 million related to the portfolio reserve for probable incurred but not specifically
identified losses.

As of December 31, 2010,
the $102 million valuation allowance for our commercial mortgage and other loan portfolio attributable to the Closed Block Business included $17 million related to loan specific reserves and $85 million related to the portfolio reserve for probable
incurred but not specifically identified losses. As of December 31, 2009, the $124 million valuation allowance for our commercial mortgage and other loan portfolio attributable to the Closed Block Business included $13 million related to loan
specific reserves and $111 million related to the portfolio reserve for probable incurred but not specifically identified losses. The decrease in the allowance for both the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business primarily
reflects positive credit migration for certain mortgages.

losses of our equity securities attributable to the Financial Services Businesses where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost by less than 20% for the following timeframes:

Unrealized Losses from Equity Securities, Less than 20%—Financial
Services Businesses

(1)

The aging of amortized cost and gross unrealized losses is determined based upon a count of the number of months the estimated fair value remained below cost by less
than 20%, using month-end valuations.



The following table sets forth the cost and gross unrealized losses of our equity securities
attributable to the Financial Services Businesses where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost by 20% or more for the following timeframes:

Unrealized Losses from Equity Securities, Greater than 20%—Financial
Services Businesses

(1)

The aging of amortized cost and gross unrealized losses is determined based upon a count of the number of months the estimated fair value remained below cost by 20% or
more, using month-end valuations.

(2)

Includes only perpetual preferred securities as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.

The gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2010,
were primarily concentrated in the finance and public utilities sectors compared to December 31, 2009, where the gross unrealized losses were primarily concentrated in the finance, energy, and manufacturing sectors. Gross unrealized losses
attributable to the Financial Services Businesses where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost by 20% or more of $25 million as of December 31, 2010, does not include any gross unrealized losses on securities where the
estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost by 50% or more. Perpetual preferred securities have characteristics of both debt and equity securities. Since we apply to these securities an impairment model similar to our fixed maturity
securities, we have not recognized an other-than-temporary impairment on certain of these perpetual preferred securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve months or more as of December 31, 2010. We have not
recognized the gross unrealized losses shown in the table above as other-than-temporary impairments. See “—Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of Equity Securities” for a discussion of the factors we consider in making these
determinations.

The following table sets forth
the cost and gross unrealized losses of our equity securities attributable to the Closed Block Business where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost by less than 20% for the following timeframes:

(1)

The aging of amortized cost and gross unrealized losses is determined based upon a count of the number of months the estimated fair value remained below cost by 20% or
more, using month-end valuations.

The gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2010, were primarily concentrated in the services, manufacturing, and finance sectors
compared to December 31, 2009, where the gross unrealized losses were primarily concentrated in the finance, services, and manufacturing sectors. Gross unrealized losses attributable to the Closed Block Business where the estimated fair value
had declined and remained below cost by 20% or more of $10 million as of December 31, 2010 does not include any gross unrealized losses on securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost by 50% or more. Perpetual
preferred securities have characteristics of both debt and equity securities. Since we apply to these securities an impairment model similar to our fixed maturity securities, we have not recognized an other-than-temporary impairment on certain of
these perpetual preferred securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve months or more as of December 31, 2010. We have not recognized the gross unrealized losses shown in the table above as other-than-temporary
impairments. See “—Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of Equity Securities” for a discussion of the factors we consider in making these determinations.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of Equity Securities

For those equity securities classified as
available for sale we record unrealized gains and losses to the extent cost is different from estimated fair value. All securities with unrealized losses are subject to our review to identify other-than-temporary impairments in value. In evaluating
whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, we consistently consider several factors including, but not limited to, the following:

•

the extent and the duration of the decline; including, but not limited to, the following general guidelines:

•

declines in value greater than 20%, maintained for six months or greater;

•

declines in value maintained for one year or greater; and

•

declines in value greater than 50%;

•

the reasons for the decline in value (issuer specific event, currency or market fluctuation);

•

our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value, including certain equity securities managed by
independent third parties where we do not exercise management discretion concerning individual buy or sell decisions; and

•

the financial condition of and near-term prospects of the issuer.

We generally recognize other-than-temporary impairments for securities with declines in value greater than 50%
maintained for six months or greater or with any decline in value maintained for one year or greater. In



addition, in making our determinations we continue to analyze the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including an assessment of the issuer’s capital position, and
consider our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value.

For those securities that have declines in value that are deemed to be only temporary, we make an assertion as to our ability and intent
to retain the security until recovery. Once identified, these securities are restricted from trading unless authorized based upon events that could not have been foreseen at the time we asserted our ability and intent to retain the security until
recovery. Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, the deterioration of the issuer’s creditworthiness, a major business combination or disposition, a change in regulatory requirements, certain other portfolio actions or other
similar events. For those securities that have declines in value for which we cannot assert our ability and intent to retain until recovery, including certain equity securities managed by independent third parties where we do not exercise management
discretion concerning individual buy or sell decisions, impairments are recognized as other-than-temporary regardless of the reason for, or the extent of, the decline. For perpetual preferred securities, which have characteristics of both debt and
equity securities, we apply an impairment model similar to our fixed maturity securities, factoring in the position of the security in the capital structure and the lack of a formal maturity date. For additional discussion of our policies regarding
other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities, see “—Fixed Maturity Securities—Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of Fixed Maturity Securities” above.

When we determine that there is an other-than-temporary impairment, we record a writedown to estimated fair
value, which reduces the cost basis and is included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our policies around other-than-temporary impairments
for equity securities. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the fair value methodology used for equity securities.

Impairments of equity securities attributable to the Financial Services Businesses were $78 million and $389 million for the years ended
December 31, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Impairments of equity securities attributable to the Closed Block Business were $34 million and $613 million for years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For a further discussion of
impairments, see “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses” above.

Other Long-Term Investments

“Other long-term investments” are comprised as follows:

(1)

Primarily includes investment in an office building used by our Japanese insurance operations.

(2)

Primarily includes derivatives and member and activity stock held in the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and Boston. For additional information regarding our holding
in the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and Boston, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Invested Assets of Other Entities and Operations

The following table sets forth the composition of the
investments held outside the general account in other entities and operations as of the dates indicated.

(1)

Book value is generally based on unpaid principal balance net of any allowance for losses, the lower of cost or fair value, or fair value, depending on the loan.

The table above includes the
invested assets of our brokerage, trading and banking operations, real estate and relocation services, and asset management operations. Assets of our asset management operations managed for third parties and those assets classified as “Separate
account assets” on our balance sheet are not included.

Fixed Maturity Securities

Fixed maturity securities primarily include investments related to our non-retail banking operations, where customer deposit liabilities are primarily supported by fixed maturity and short-term
investments, in addition to cash and cash equivalents.

The following table sets forth the composition of the portion of our fixed maturity securities portfolio by industry category attributable to our other entities and operations.

Fixed Maturity Securities—Invested Assets of Other Entities and
Operations

(1)

Investment data has been classified based on standard industry categorizations for domestic public holdings and similar classifications by industry for all other
holdings.

The table above includes
the invested assets of our brokerage, trading and banking operations, real estate and relocation services, and asset management operations. Assets of our asset management operations managed for third parties and those assets classified as
“Separate account assets” on our balance sheet are not included.



Other Trading Account Assets

Other trading account assets primarily include trading
positions held by our derivatives trading operations and our global commodities group used in a dealer or broker capacity and derivative hedging positions used in a non-broker or non-dealer capacity. The derivative hedging positions used in a
non-broker or non-dealer capacity primarily include a portfolio of derivatives primarily intended to hedge the risks related to certain products. Trading positions held by our derivatives trading operations used in a broker or dealer capacity
include various foreign exchange instruments and commodities, primarily to facilitate transactions for our clients. We seek to use short security positions, forwards, futures, options and other derivatives to limit exposure to interest rate and
other market risks associated with these positions. We also trade derivative financial instruments that allow our clients to manage exposure to interest rate, currency and other market risks. Our derivative transactions involve both exchange-listed
and over-the-counter contracts. Our global commodities group provides advice, sales and trading on a global basis covering a wide variety of commodity, financial and foreign exchange futures, swap and forward contracts, including agricultural
commodities, base and precious metals, major currencies, interest rate and stock indices. We act both as a broker, buying and selling exchange-listed contracts for our customers, and as a dealer, by entering into futures and security transactions as
a principal. Less than $1 million of commercial mortgage-backed securities held outside the general account are classified as other trading account assets as of December 31, 2010 all of which have AAA credit ratings. An additional $34 million
of asset-backed securities held outside the general account as of December 31, 2010 are classified as other trading account assets, and all have AAA credit ratings.

Commercial mortgage and other loans

Our asset management operations include our commercial
mortgage operations, which provide mortgage origination, asset management and servicing for our general account, institutional clients, and government sponsored entities such as Fannie Mae, the Federal Housing Administration, and Freddie Mac. We
also originate shorter-term interim loans for spread lending that are collateralized by assets generally under renovation or lease-up. All else being equal, these interim loans are inherently more risky than those collateralized by properties that
have already stabilized. Our interim loans are generally paid off through refinancing or the sale of the underlying collateral by the borrower. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the interim loans had an unpaid principal
balance of $1.3 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, and an allowance for losses or credit related market value losses totaling $168 million and $236 million, respectively. The weighted average loan-to-value ratio was 108% as of December 31,
2010 and 112% as of December 31, 2009, indicating that, in aggregate, the loan amount was greater than the collateral value, and the weighted average debt service coverage ratio was 1.24 times as of December 31, 2010 and 1.16 times as of
December 31, 2009. A stabilized value and projected net operating income are used in the calculation of the loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios. As of December 31, 2010, we also hold $69 million of commercial real estate held
for sale related to foreclosed interim loans. The mortgage loans of our commercial mortgage operations are included in “Commercial mortgage and other loans,” with related derivatives and other hedging instruments primarily included in
“Other trading account assets” and “Other long-term investments.”

Other long-term investments

Other long-term investments primarily include proprietary investments made as part of our asset management operations. We make these proprietary investments in real estate, as well as fixed income, public
equity and real estate securities, including controlling interests. Certain of these investments are made primarily for purposes of co-investment in our managed funds and structured products. Other proprietary investments are made with the intention
to sell or syndicate to investors, including our general account, or for placement in funds and structured products that we offer and manage (seed investments). As part of our asset management operations we also make loans to our managed funds that
are secured by equity commitments from investors or assets of the funds.

Commercial Real Estate

As discussed above, we have investment-based exposure to commercial real estate through a variety of investment vehicles. This exposure primarily results from our investments in commercial mortgage-backed
securities and our whole-loan commercial mortgage holdings. For additional information regarding our exposure



to commercial real estate, see the respective investment sections above within “—General Account Investments.” Our invested asset exposure to commercial real estate as of the dates
indicated includes the following, shown at their respective balance sheet carrying value:

(1)

Carrying value is generally based on unpaid principal balance. Amounts are shown gross of allowance for losses of $283 million and $102 million as of December 31,
2010 and $371 million and $124 million as of December 31, 2009, attributable to the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, respectively. Commercial mortgage loans are shown net of the allowance for losses on the statement
of financial position.

(2)

Balances accounted for under either the cost or equity method and include all real estate related exposures, net of impairments.

(3)

Represents wholly-owned investment real estate which we have the intent to hold for the production of income as well as real estate held for sale. Real estate which we
have the intent to hold for the production of income is carried at depreciated cost less any writedowns to fair value for impairment. Real estate held for sale is carried at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value less estimated selling costs
and is not further depreciated once classified as such.

(4)

Includes invested assets of brokerage, trading and banking operations, real estate and relocation services, and asset management operations. Excludes assets of our
asset management operations managed for third parties and those assets classified as “Separate account assets” on our balance sheet.

(5)

Carrying value is generally based on unpaid principal balance, the lower of cost or fair value, or fair value. Amounts are shown gross of allowance for losses of $120
million and $147 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Commercial mortgage loans are shown net of the allowance for losses on the statement of financial position.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Overview

Liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet the payment obligations of the
Company. Capital refers to the long term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses, fund business growth, and provide a cushion to withstand adverse circumstances. Our ability to generate and maintain sufficient
liquidity and capital depends on the profitability of our businesses, general economic conditions and our access to the capital markets and the alternate sources of liquidity and capital described herein.

Management monitors the liquidity of Prudential Financial and
its subsidiaries on a daily basis and projects borrowing and capital needs over a multi-year time horizon through our quarterly planning process. We believe that cash flows from the sources of funds presently available to us are sufficient to
satisfy the current liquidity requirements of Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries, including reasonably foreseeable contingencies.



We continue to refine our metrics for capital management. These refinements to the current
framework, which is primarily based on statutory risk based capital measures, are designed to more appropriately reflect risks associated with our businesses on a consistent basis across the Company. In addition, we continue to use an economic
capital framework for making certain business decisions. Similar to our planning and management process for liquidity, we also use a disciplined framework to ensure the availability of adequate capital under reasonably foreseeable contingencies.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act, signed into law on July 21, 2010, could result in the imposition of new capital, liquidity and other requirements on Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries. See “Business—Regulation” for information regarding
the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the Company.

Acquisition of AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd., AIG Edison Life Insurance Company and Related Entities

On February 1, 2011, we completed the acquisition from
American International Group, Inc., or AIG, of AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd., AIG Edison Life Insurance Company and certain other AIG subsidiaries pursuant to the stock purchase agreement dated September 30, 2010 with AIG. The total
purchase price was approximately $4.8 billion, comprised of approximately $4.2 billion in cash and $0.6 billion in the assumption of third-party debt, substantially all of which is expected to be repaid, over time, with excess capital of the
acquired entities.

To partially fund the
acquisition purchase price, in November 2010, Prudential Financial completed a public offering and sale of 18,348,624 shares of Common Stock and $1.0 billion of medium-term notes, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $2.0 billion. The
remainder of the purchase price was funded with approximately $2.2 billion of cash and short-term investments. In November 2010, the Company also terminated the $3.0 billion term loan bridge facility previously entered into at the time of signing
the purchase agreement with AIG. The bridge facility was intended to be available to finance any portion of the acquisition purchase price not otherwise funded with proceeds from capital markets transactions or with other resources.

Prudential Financial

The principal sources of funds available to Prudential
Financial, the parent holding company, are dividends, returns of capital and interest income from its subsidiaries, and cash and short-term investments. These sources of funds may be supplemented by Prudential Financial’s access to the capital
markets and credit facilities, as well as the “—Alternative Sources of Liquidity” described below.

The primary uses of funds at Prudential Financial include servicing our debt and the payment of declared shareholder dividends, operating
expenses and capital contributions and obligations to subsidiaries.

As of December 31, 2010, Prudential Financial had cash and short-term investments of $6.672 billion, an increase of $2.842 billion from December 31, 2009. Included in the cash and short-term
investments of Prudential Financial is $1.013 billion held in an intercompany liquidity account that is designed to optimize the use of cash by facilitating the lending and borrowing of funds between Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries on a
daily basis. Also included are short-term investments of $1.085 billion, consisting primarily of government agency securities and money market funds.



The following table sets forth Prudential Financial’s principal sources and uses of
cash and short-term investments for the period indicated.

(1)

Includes dividends and/or returns of capital of $3.0 billion from Prudential Insurance, $470 million from Prudential Annuities Life Assurance Corporation, $205 million
from international insurance and investment subsidiaries, $247 million from asset management subsidiaries and $53 million from other subsidiaries.

(2)

See “—Financing Activities.”

(3)

Includes capital contributions of $851 million to international insurance and investments subsidiaries, $498 million to asset management subsidiaries, $495 million to
an investment subsidiary, $256 million to our offshore captive reinsurer, $95 million to an irrevocable trust, commonly referred to as a “rabbi trust,” which holds assets of the Company to be used to satisfy its obligation with respect to
certain non-qualified retirement plans, and $4 million to other subsidiaries.

(4)

Includes net borrowings of $859 million by Pruco Reinsurance to support the capital markets hedging program related to our variable annuity products, net borrowings of
$400 million and $250 million by Prudential Arizona Reinsurance Term Company and Universal Prudential Arizona Reinsurance Captive Company, respectively, funding statutory reserves required under Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX, as discussed in
more detail in “—Financing Activities,” net borrowings of $245 million by Pruco Life Insurance Company of Arizona to fund deferred acquisition costs on variable annuity products, and net borrowings of $150 million by our asset
management subsidiaries. The remainder represents net repayments from other subsidiaries as well as net activity in our intercompany liquidity account described above.

(5)

Primarily represents an estimated tax payment to the Internal Revenue Service made March 15, 2010 with an extension request for Prudential Financial and its
subsidiaries’ 2009 consolidated federal income tax return. This payment is driven in part by the gain on the sale of our minority joint venture interest in Wachovia Securities. Prudential Financial has also made estimated tax payments to the
Internal Revenue Service for 2010 and settled certain tax liabilities and benefits for 2009 and 2010 pursuant to a tax allocation agreement with its subsidiaries.

On November 9, 2010, Prudential Financial’s Board
of Directors declared an annual dividend for 2010 of $1.15 per share of Common Stock, representing an increase of approximately 64 percent from the 2009 Common Stock dividend. The table below presents declaration, record, and payment dates, as well
as per share and aggregate dividend amounts, for the Common Stock dividend for the last five years.



The primary components of capitalization for the Financial Services Businesses consist of
the equity we attribute to the Financial Services Businesses (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income related to unrealized gains and losses on investments and pension/postretirement benefits), outstanding junior subordinated debt and
outstanding capital debt of the Financial Services Businesses. Capital debt consists of borrowings that are used or will be used to meet the capital requirements of Prudential Financial, as well as borrowings invested in equity or debt securities of
direct or indirect subsidiaries of Prudential Financial and subsidiary borrowings utilized for capital requirements. As shown in the table below, as of December 31, 2010, the Financial Services Businesses had $38.0 billion in capital, all of
which was available to support the aggregate capital requirements of its three divisions and its Corporate and Other operations. Based on our assessments of these businesses and operations, we believe this level of capital was consistent with the
“AA” ratings targets of our regulated operating entities as of December 31, 2010.

We seek to capitalize all of our
subsidiaries and businesses in accordance with their ratings targets, and we believe Prudential Financial’s capitalization and use of financial leverage are consistent with those ratings targets. Management uses the ratio of capital debt to
total capital (as such amounts are reflected in the table above) as a primary measure of the use of financial leverage. As of December 31, 2010, our capital debt to total capital ratio was 22.1%. The terms of our outstanding junior subordinated
debt have certain features which result in their treatment as hybrid securities by the rating agencies. As a result, for purposes of calculating the capital debt to total capital ratio, 25% of our outstanding junior subordinated debt is treated as
equity and the remaining 75% is treated as capital debt, based on Moody’s current criteria for these types of hybrid securities, which is the most restrictive treatment among the rating agencies.

Our long-term senior debt rating targets for Prudential
Financial are “A” for Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, or S&P, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., or Moody’s, and Fitch Ratings Ltd., or Fitch, and “a” for A.M. Best Company, or A.M. Best. Our
financial strength rating targets for our domestic life insurance companies are “AA/Aa/AA” for S&P, Moody’s and Fitch, respectively, and “A+” for A.M. Best. Currently, some of our ratings are below these targets. For a
description of material rating actions that have occurred from the beginning of 2010 through the date of this filing and a discussion of the potential impacts of ratings downgrades, see “—Ratings.”

Restrictions on Dividends and Returns of Capital from
Subsidiaries

Our insurance and
various other companies are subject to regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends and other transfers of funds to affiliates. With respect to Prudential Insurance, New Jersey insurance law provides that, except in the case of extraordinary
dividends (as described below), all dividends or other distributions paid by Prudential Insurance may be paid only from unassigned surplus, as determined pursuant to statutory accounting principles, less unrealized investment gains and losses and
revaluation of assets as of the prior calendar year-end. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, Prudential Insurance’s unassigned surplus was $4.224 billion and $5.295 billion, respectively, and it recorded applicable adjustments for cumulative
unrealized investment gains of $1,499 million and $925 million, respectively. Prudential Insurance must give prior notification to the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, or NJDOBI, or the Department, of its intent to pay any dividend or
distribution. Also, if any dividend, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (i) 10% of the prior calendar year’s statutory surplus or (ii) the prior calendar
year’s statutory net gain from operations excluding realized investment gains and losses, the dividend is considered to be an “extraordinary dividend” and the prior approval of the Department is required for payment of the dividend.
Prudential Insurance’s statutory surplus as of December 31, 2010 was $8.364 billion and its statutory net gain from operations, excluding realized investment gains and losses, for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $1.127 billion.
In addition to the regulatory limitations, the terms of the IHC debt



contain restrictions potentially limiting dividends by Prudential Insurance applicable to the Financial Services Businesses in the event the Closed Block Business is in financial distress and
under certain other circumstances. The laws regulating dividends of the other states and foreign jurisdictions where our other insurance companies are domiciled are similar, but not identical, to New Jersey’s.

On May 14, 2010, Prudential Insurance paid an ordinary
dividend of $2.4 billion, and on November 23, 2010, it paid an extraordinary dividend of $600 million. Also in 2010, Prudential Annuities Life Assurance Corporation paid an ordinary dividend of $330 million and an extraordinary dividend of $140
million. These dividends were ultimately received by Prudential Financial.

As a result of Gibraltar Life’s reorganization, in addition to regulatory restrictions, there are certain other restrictions that preclude Gibraltar Life from paying dividends to Prudential Financial
in the near term. We anticipate that it will be several years before these restrictions will allow Gibraltar Life to pay dividends. In 2010, The Prudential Life Insurance Company, Ltd., or Prudential of Japan, for which the payment of dividends is
subject to regulatory limitations pursuant to statutory accounting principles, paid a dividend of ¥9 billion, or approximately $110 million, to Prudential Holdings of Japan, Inc., some of which was used to fund a portion of the purchase price
for the acquisition of the Star and Edison Businesses. The ability of our asset management subsidiaries and the majority of our other operating subsidiaries to pay dividends is largely unrestricted from a regulatory standpoint. The ability of each
of our subsidiaries to pay dividends in 2011 depends on market conditions and other factors.

See “Liquidity and Capital Resources of Subsidiaries” below for additional details on the liquidity of our domestic insurance subsidiaries, international insurance subsidiaries and asset
management subsidiaries.

Alternative Sources of Liquidity

Prudential Financial maintains an
intercompany liquidity account that is designed to optimize the use of cash by facilitating the lending and borrowing of funds between the parent holding company and its affiliates on a daily basis. Depending on the overall availability of cash, the
parent holding company invests excess cash on a short-term basis or borrows funds in the capital markets. Additional longer term liquidity is available through inter-affiliate borrowing arrangements. Prudential Financial and certain of its
subsidiaries also have access to bank facilities, as discussed under “—Credit Facilities,” as well as the alternative sources of liquidity described below.

Commercial Paper Programs

Prudential Financial has a commercial paper program, the
authorized capacity of which was reduced from $5.0 billion to $3.0 billion as of June 30, 2010. Prudential Financial commercial paper borrowings generally have been used to fund the working capital needs of Prudential Financial’s
subsidiaries and to provide short-term liquidity at Prudential Financial. As of December 31, 2010, Prudential Financial’s outstanding commercial paper borrowings were $283 million, representing an increase of $137 million from
December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2010, the weighted average maturity of Prudential Financial’s outstanding commercial paper was 43 days, of which 15% was overnight. The daily average commercial paper outstanding during 2010 under
this program was $222 million. The weighted average interest rate on these borrowings was 0.42% and 1.61% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Prudential Funding, LLC, or Prudential Funding, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Insurance, has a commercial paper program, the authorized capacity of which was reduced from $12.0 billion to $7.0 billion as of June 30, 2010. Prudential Funding commercial paper borrowings have generally
served as an additional source of financing to meet the working capital needs of Prudential Insurance and its subsidiaries. Prudential Funding also lends to other subsidiaries of Prudential Financial up to limits agreed with the New Jersey
Department of Banking and Insurance. As of December 31, 2010, Prudential Funding’s outstanding commercial paper borrowings were $874 million, representing an increase of $144 million from December 31, 2009. As of December 31,
2010, the weighted average maturity of Prudential Funding’s outstanding commercial paper was 31 days, of which 30% was overnight. The majority of the proceeds from outstanding commercial paper were utilized to fund the working capital needs of
our affiliates and short-term cash flow timing mismatches. The daily average commercial paper outstanding during 2010 under this program was $985 million. The weighted average interest rates on these borrowings were 0.31% and 0.77% for the years
ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.



Prudential Funding maintains a support agreement with Prudential Insurance whereby
Prudential Insurance has agreed to maintain Prudential Funding’s positive tangible net worth at all times. Prudential Financial has also issued a subordinated guarantee covering Prudential Funding’s commercial paper program.

While we continue to consider commercial paper one of our
alternative sources of liquidity due to the low cost and efficient financing it provides, we have significantly reduced our reliance on commercial paper to fund our operations, and have developed plans that would enable us to further reduce, or if
necessary eliminate, our commercial paper borrowings by accessing other sources of liquidity.

As of December 31, 2010, Prudential Financial, Prudential Insurance and Prudential Funding had unsecured committed lines of credit totaling $4.1 billion. These facilities can be used as backup
liquidity for our commercial paper programs or for other general corporate purposes. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities as of December 31, 2010 or as of the date of this filing. For a further discussion of these lines
of credit, see “—Credit Facilities.”

Asset-based Financing

We conduct asset-based or secured financing within our insurance and other subsidiaries, including transactions such as securities
lending, repurchase agreements and mortgage dollar rolls, in order to earn spread income, to borrow funds, or to facilitate trading activity. These programs are driven by portfolio holdings of securities that are lendable based on counterparty
demand for these securities in the marketplace. The collateral received in connection with these programs is primarily used to purchase securities in the short-term spread portfolios of our domestic insurance entities. Investments held in the
short-term spread portfolios include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and fixed maturities, including mortgage- and asset-backed securities, with a weighted average life at time of purchase of two years or less. A portion of the
asset-backed securities held in our short-term spread portfolios, including our enhanced short-term portfolio, are collateralized by sub-prime mortgages. Floating rate assets comprise the majority of our short-term spread portfolio. See
“—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—General Account Investments—Fixed Maturity Securities” for a further discussion of our asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime holdings,
including details regarding those securities held in our enhanced short-term portfolio. These short-term portfolios are subject to specific investment policy statements, which among other things, do not allow for significant asset/liability interest
rate duration mismatch.

As of December 31,
2010, our Financial Services Businesses had liabilities totaling $4.172 billion under such programs, including $2.557 billion representing securities sold under agreements to repurchase, $1.614 billion representing cash collateral for loaned
securities and $1 million representing securities sold but not yet purchased. Of the $4.172 billion for the Financial Services Businesses as of December 31, 2010, $2.581 billion represents securities that may be returned to the company
overnight requiring immediate return of the cash collateral, and the remainder generally has maturities ranging from two days to three months with a weighted average maturity of 14 days. The daily weighted average outstanding under such programs
during 2010 was $4.678 billion. As of December 31, 2009, our Financial Services Businesses had liabilities totaling $5.309 billion under such programs. In addition, as of December 31, 2010, our Financial Services Businesses had outstanding
mortgage dollar rolls under which we are committed to repurchase $36 million of mortgage-backed securities, or “to be announced” (“TBA”) forward contracts. These repurchase agreements do not qualify as secured borrowings and are
accounted for as derivatives. These mortgage-backed securities are considered high or highest quality based on NAIC or equivalent rating.

As of December 31, 2010, our Closed Block Business had liabilities totaling $3.885 billion under such programs, including $3.328
billion representing securities sold under agreements to repurchase and $557 million representing cash collateral for loaned securities. Of the $3.885 billion for the Closed Block Business as of December 31, 2010, $2.446 billion represents
securities that may be returned to the company overnight requiring immediate return of the cash collateral, and the remainder generally has maturities ranging from two days to three months with a weighted average maturity of 24 days. The daily
weighted average outstanding under such programs during 2010 was $3.969 billion. As of December 31, 2009, our Closed Block Business had liabilities totaling $3.888 billion under such programs. In addition, as of December 31, 2010, the
Closed Block Business had outstanding mortgage dollar rolls under which we are committed to repurchase $68 million of TBA forward



contracts. These repurchase agreements do not qualify as secured borrowings and are accounted for as derivatives. These mortgage-backed securities are considered high or highest quality based on
NAIC or equivalent rating.

As of
December 31, 2010, our domestic insurance entities had assets eligible for the lending program of $79.4 billion, of which $7.6 billion were on loan. Taking into account market conditions and outstanding loan balances as of December 31,
2010, we believe approximately $25.5 billion of the remaining eligible assets are readily lendable, of which approximately $17.2 billion relates to the Financial Services Businesses; however, these amounts are subject to potential regulatory
constraints. Further, changes in market conditions can affect the ability to lend the available assets.

As referenced above, these programs are typically limited to securities in demand that can be loaned at relatively low financing rates. As
such, we believe there is unused capacity available through these programs. Holdings of cash and cash equivalent investments in these short-term spread portfolios allow for further flexibility in sizing the portfolio to better match available
financing. Current conditions in both the financing and investment markets are continuously monitored in order to appropriately manage the cost of funds, investment spreads, asset/liability duration matching and liquidity.

Federal Home Loan Bank of New York

Prudential Insurance is a member of the Federal Home Loan
Bank of New York, or FHLBNY. Membership allows Prudential Insurance access to the FHLBNY’s financial services, including the ability to obtain collateralized loans and to issue collateralized funding agreements that can be used as an
alternative source of liquidity. FHLBNY borrowings and funding agreements are collateralized by qualifying mortgage-related assets or U.S. Treasury securities, the fair value of which must be maintained at certain specified levels relative to
outstanding borrowings, depending on the type of asset pledged. FHLBNY membership requires Prudential Insurance to own member stock and borrowings require the purchase of activity-based stock in an amount equal to 4.5% of outstanding borrowings.
Under FHLBNY guidelines, if Prudential Insurance’s financial strength ratings decline below A/A2/A Stable by S&P/Moody’s/Fitch, respectively, and the FHLBNY does not receive written assurances from NJDOBI regarding Prudential
Insurance’s solvency, new borrowings from the FHLBNY would be limited to a term of 90 days or less. Currently there are no restrictions on the term of borrowings from the FHLBNY.

NJDOBI previously permitted Prudential Insurance to pledge collateral to the FHLBNY in an amount of up to 7% of
its prior year-end statutory net admitted assets, excluding separate account assets; however, since we elected not to seek an extension, this limitation reset to 5% effective January 1, 2011. Based on Prudential Insurance’s statutory net
admitted assets as of December 31, 2009, the 5% limitation equates to a maximum amount of pledged assets of $7.4 billion and an estimated maximum borrowing capacity (after taking into account required collateralization levels and purchases of
activity-based stock) of approximately $6.2 billion. Nevertheless, FHLBNY borrowings are subject to the FHLBNY’s discretion and to the availability of qualifying assets at Prudential Insurance.

As of December 31, 2010, we had pledged qualifying
assets with a fair value of $2.8 billion, which supported outstanding collateralized advances of $1.0 billion and collateralized funding agreements of $1.5 billion. The fair value of qualifying assets that were available to Prudential Insurance but
not pledged amounted to $5.5 billion as of December 31, 2010.

As of December 31, 2010, $275 million of the FHLBNY outstanding advances is reflected in “Short-term debt” and matures in December 2011 and the remaining $725 million is in “Long-term
debt” and matures in December 2015. FHLBNY advances declined $1.0 billion from December 31, 2009, reflecting the repayment at maturity of $1.0 billion of advances in June and the refinancing of $1.0 billion of advances in December. The
June repayment at maturity was funded through the repayment of an affiliate loan (which was replaced by a loan from Prudential Financial) and with available cash. As of December 31, 2010, $650 million of the outstanding FHLBNY proceeds were
used to support the operating needs of our businesses, and $350 million were used to purchase investments, including the FHLBNY activity-based stock. The funding agreements issued to the FHLBNY, which are reflected in “Policyholders’
account balances,” have priority claim status above debt



holders of Prudential Insurance. These funding agreements currently serve as a substitute funding source for a product of our Retirement segment, which earns investment spread that was previously
funded by retail medium-term notes issued by Prudential Financial.

Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston

Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company, or PRIAC, became a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, or FHLBB, in December 2009. Membership allows PRIAC access to collateralized
advances which will be classified in “Short-term debt” or “Long-term debt,” depending on the maturity date of the obligation. PRIAC’s membership in FHLBB requires the ownership of member stock and borrowings from FHLBB
require the purchase of activity-based stock in an amount between 3.0% and 4.5% of outstanding borrowings, depending on the maturity date of the obligation. As of December 31, 2010, PRIAC had no advances outstanding under the FHLBB facility.

The Connecticut Department of Insurance, or
CTDOI, permits PRIAC to pledge up to $2.6 billion in qualifying assets to secure FHLBB borrowings through December 31, 2011. PRIAC must seek re-approval from CTDOI prior to borrowing additional funds after that date. Based on available eligible
assets as of December 31, 2010, PRIAC had an estimated maximum borrowing capacity, after taking into consideration required collateralization levels and required purchases of activity-based FHLBB stock, of approximately $1.1 billion.

Liquidity and Capital Resources of Subsidiaries

Domestic Insurance Subsidiaries

General Liquidity

We manage the liquidity of our domestic insurance operations
to ensure stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of cash flows to meet all of our obligations. Liquidity is provided by a variety of sources, as described more fully below, including portfolios of liquid assets. The investment portfolios of our
domestic operations are integral to the overall liquidity of those operations. We segment our investment portfolios and employ an asset/liability management approach specific to the requirements of our product lines. This enhances the discipline
applied in managing the liquidity, as well as the interest rate and credit risk profiles, of each portfolio in a manner consistent with the unique characteristics of the product liabilities. We use a projection process for cash flows from operations
to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet projected cash outflows, including claims. The impact of Prudential Funding’s financing capacity on liquidity, as discussed more fully under “—Alternative Sources of Liquidity,”
is considered in the internal liquidity measures of the domestic insurance operations.

Liquidity is measured against internally-developed benchmarks that take into account the characteristics of both the asset portfolio and the liabilities that they support. The results are affected
substantially by the overall asset type and quality of our investments.

Pursuant to the documentation for the disposition of our property and casualty operations completed in 2003, we were required to deposit cash or securities into a trust for the purpose of securing
insurance liabilities that were to have been transferred to Prudential Insurance following completion of the disposition but that have not been so transferred. In June 2010, we deposited securities which, as of December 31, 2010, have a market
value of $577 million. The deposit of these assets was not a material liquidity event for Prudential Insurance.

Cash Flow

The principal sources of liquidity for Prudential Insurance and our other domestic insurance subsidiaries are premiums and annuity
considerations, investment and fee income, and investment maturities and sales associated with our insurance and annuity operations, as well as internal and external borrowings. The principal uses of that liquidity include benefits, claims,
dividends paid to policyholders, and payments to policyholders and contractholders in connection with surrenders, withdrawals and net policy loan activity. Other uses of liquidity include commissions, general and administrative expenses, purchases
of investments, and payments in connection with financing activities.



We believe that the cash flows from our insurance and annuity operations are adequate to
satisfy the current liquidity requirements of these operations, including under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios. The continued adequacy of this liquidity will depend upon factors such as future securities market conditions, changes in
interest rate levels, policyholder perceptions of our financial strength, and the relative safety of competing products, each of which could lead to reduced cash inflows or increased cash outflows. In addition, market volatility can impact the level
of capital required to support our businesses, particularly in our annuity business. Our domestic insurance operations’ cash flows from investment activities result from repayments of principal, proceeds from maturities and sales of invested
assets and investment income, net of amounts reinvested. The primary liquidity risks with respect to these cash flows are the risk of default by debtors or bond insurers, our counterparties’ willingness to extend repurchase and/or securities
lending arrangements, commitments to invest and market volatility. We closely manage these risks through our credit risk management process and regular monitoring of our liquidity position.

In managing the liquidity of our domestic insurance operations, we also consider the risk of policyholder and
contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions when selecting assets to support these contractual obligations. We use surrender charges and other contract provisions to mitigate the extent, timing and profitability impact of
withdrawals of funds by customers from annuity contracts and deposit liabilities. The following table sets forth withdrawal characteristics of our general account annuity reserves and deposit liabilities (based on statutory liability values) as of
the dates indicated.

Individual life insurance
policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than our annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may incur surrender charges and be subject to a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy. Our annuity
reserves with guarantee features may be less susceptible to withdrawal than historical experience indicates, due to the perceived value of these guarantee features to policyholders as a result of market declines in recent years. Annuity benefits and
guaranteed investment withdrawals under group annuity contracts are generally not subject to early withdrawal. Gross account withdrawals for our domestic insurance operations’ products were consistent with our assumptions in asset/liability
management, and the associated cash outflows did not have a material adverse impact on our overall liquidity.

Liquid Assets

Liquid assets include cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, fixed maturities that are not designated as held to maturity and
public equity securities. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, our domestic insurance operations had liquid assets of $138.5 billion and $134.3 billion, respectively, which includes a portion financed with asset-based financing. The portion of
liquid assets comprised of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was $5.8 billion and $11.1 billion as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As of December 31, 2010, $116.7 billion, or 90.5%, of the fixed maturity
investments that are not designated as held-to-maturity within our domestic insurance company general account portfolios were considered high or highest quality based on NAIC or equivalent rating. The remaining $12.2 billion, or 9.5%, of these fixed
maturity investments were considered other than high or highest quality based on NAIC or equivalent rating. We consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets (for example, type of asset and credit quality) in calculating internal
liquidity measures in order to evaluate the adequacy of our domestic insurance operations’ liquidity



under a variety of stress scenarios. We believe that the liquidity profile of our assets is sufficient to satisfy current liquidity requirements, including under foreseeable stress scenarios.

Given the size and liquidity profile of our
investment portfolios, we believe that claim experience varying from our projections does not constitute a significant liquidity risk. Our asset/liability management process takes into account the expected maturity of investments and expected claim
payments as well as the specific nature and risk profile of the liabilities. Historically, there has been no significant variation between the expected maturities of our investments and the payment of claims.

Our domestic insurance companies’ liquidity is managed
through access to substantial investment portfolios as well as a variety of instruments available for funding and/or managing cash flow mismatches, including from time to time those arising from claim levels in excess of projections. To the extent
we need to pay claims in excess of projections, we may borrow temporarily or sell investments sooner than anticipated to pay these claims, which may result in increased borrowing costs or realized investment gains or losses affecting results of
operations. For a further discussion of realized investment gains and losses, see “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—Realized Investment Gains and Losses.” We believe that borrowing temporarily
or selling investments earlier than anticipated will not have a material impact on the liquidity of our domestic insurance companies. Payment of claims and sale of investments earlier than anticipated would have an impact on the reported level of
cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities, respectively, in our financial statements. Instead of selling investments at depressed market prices externally, in order to preserve economic value (including tax attributes), we may
also sell investments from one subsidiary to another at fair market value or transfer investments internally between businesses within the same subsidiary.

Capital

The Risk Based Capital, or RBC, ratio is a primary measure by which we evaluate the capital adequacy of Prudential Insurance and our other
domestic life insurance subsidiaries, which includes businesses in both the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. We manage Prudential Insurance and our other domestic life insurance subsidiaries’ RBC ratios to a level
consistent with their ratings targets. RBC is determined by statutory guidelines and formulas that consider, among other things, risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets, insurance-related risks associated with an insurer’s
products and liabilities, interest rate risks and general business risks. The RBC ratio calculations are intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring the adequacy of an insurer’s statutory capitalization. As of December 31, 2010,
RBC for Prudential Insurance was approximately 530%, which exceeded the minimum levels required by applicable insurance regulations. In addition, all of our other domestic life insurance subsidiaries have RBC ratios that exceed the minimum level
required by applicable insurance regulations. The reporting of RBC measures is not intended for the purpose of ranking any insurance company or for use in connection with any marketing, advertising or promotional activities.

The level of statutory capital of our domestic life insurance
subsidiaries can be materially impacted by interest rate and equity market fluctuations, changes in the values of derivatives, the level of impairments recorded and credit quality migration of the investment portfolio, among other items. Further,
the recapture of business subject to reinsurance arrangements due to defaults by, or credit quality migration affecting, the reinsurers could result in higher required statutory capital levels. The level of statutory capital of our domestic life
insurance subsidiaries is also affected by statutory accounting rules, which are subject to change by insurance regulators.

During 2010, we changed the focus of our capital hedge program from the equity price risk associated with our annuities business to a
broader view of equity market exposure of the statutory capital of the Company as a whole. In the second quarter of 2010, we removed the equity component of our capital hedge within the Individual Annuities segment as described under
“—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division—Individual Annuities” and entered into equity index-linked derivative transactions that are
designed to mitigate the impact on statutory capital of a severe equity market stress event. The program now focuses on tail risk rather than general equity market declines in order to protect our capital in a more cost-effective manner under stress
scenarios. We assess the composition of our hedging program on an ongoing basis, and we may change it from time to time based on our evaluation of the Company’s risk position or other factors.



In addition to hedging the equity market exposure as mentioned above, we also manage certain
risks associated with our variable annuity products through our hedging programs, as described under “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management
Division—Individual Annuities.” In our living benefits hedging program, we purchase equity options and futures as well as interest rate derivatives to hedge certain optional living benefit features accounted for as embedded derivatives
against changes in equity markets, interest rates, and market volatility. Historically, our hedging strategy sought to generally match the sensitivities of the embedded derivative liability as defined by GAAP, excluding the impact of the
market-perceived risk of our own non-performance, with capital market derivatives and options. In the third quarter of 2010, we revised our hedging strategy as, in the low interest rate environment, we do not believe the GAAP value of the embedded
derivative liability to be an appropriate measure for determining the hedge target. Our new hedge target continues to be grounded in a GAAP/capital markets valuation framework but incorporates modifications to the risk-free return assumption to
account for the fact that the underlying customer separate account funds, which support these living benefits, are invested in assets that contain risk. Consistent with sound risk management practices we evaluate hedge levels versus our target given
overall capital considerations of the Company and prevailing capital market conditions and may decide to temporarily hedge to an amount that differs from our hedge target definition. As part of our capital planning and management process, we use a
disciplined framework to ensure the availability of adequate capital under reasonably foreseeable contingencies, including potentially adverse outcomes resulting from our hedging strategy.

We reinsure variable annuity living benefit guarantees to our offshore captive reinsurance company. We satisfy
the reinsurance reserve credit requirements by funding statutory reserve credit trusts. Reinsurance credit reserve requirements can move materially in either direction due to changes in equity markets and interest rates, actuarial assumptions and
other factors. Higher reinsurance credit reserve requirements would necessitate depositing additional assets in the statutory reserve credit trusts, while lower reinsurance credit reserve requirements would allow assets to be removed from the
statutory reserve credit trusts. We provided additional funding to the captive reinsurance trusts of $379 million for the second quarter of 2010 to meet increased reserve credit requirements due to unfavorable equity market conditions and lower
interest rates, and provided an additional $354 million for the third quarter of 2010 due to an update of actuarial assumptions based on an annual review, most notably a decrease in expected future lapse rates, partially offset by favorable equity
market conditions. Due to favorable equity market conditions and higher interest rates in the fourth quarter of 2010, our need to fund the captive reinsurance trusts has declined by $1,255 million.

We review the reinsurance reserve credit requirements and the
value of the reinsurance trust assets on a quarterly basis. If we determine that the value of the reinsurance trust assets are not sufficient to meet the reinsurance reserve credit requirements, we would expect to satisfy those additional needs
through a combination of funding the reinsurance credit trusts with available cash, loans from Prudential Financial and/or affiliates and assets pledged to our offshore captive reinsurance company under hedging positions related to our living
benefit features. We also continue to evaluate other options to address reserve credit needs such as obtaining letters of credit.

International Insurance and Investments Subsidiaries

In our international insurance operations, liquidity is
provided through operating cash flows from ongoing operations as well as portfolios of liquid assets. In managing the liquidity, and the interest and credit risk profiles of our international insurance portfolios, we employ a discipline similar to
the discipline employed for domestic insurance subsidiaries. We monitor liquidity through the use of internal liquidity measures, taking into account the liquidity of the asset portfolios.

As with our domestic operations, in managing the liquidity of these operations, we consider the risk of
policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions in selecting assets to support these contractual obligations. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, our international insurance subsidiaries had total general account
insurance-related liabilities (other than dividends payable to policyholders) of $84.4 billion and $74.0 billion, respectively. Of those amounts, $44.2 billion and $41.1 billion, respectively, were associated with Gibraltar Life.



A special dividend was payable to certain Gibraltar Life policyholders based on 70% of the
net increase in the fair value, through March 2009, of certain real estate and loans, net of transaction costs and taxes, included in the Gibraltar Life reorganization plan. The first special dividend was paid in 2005 and the final special dividend
was payable generally on the next anniversary of the issue date of each applicable insurance policy, beginning in April 2009. In 2010, Gibraltar Life made distributions to policyholders of $129 million in payment of the 2009 special dividend
liability, primarily in the form of additional policy values, and to a lesser extent in cash. The liability related to the special dividend was fully paid as of June 30, 2010.

On February 1, 2011, we completed our acquisition of the
Star and Edison Businesses. Gibraltar Life and Prudential of Japan each contributed $400 million to the payment of the acquisition purchase price, with the remaining funding provided by Prudential Financial and other subsidiaries. Although these
contributions will reduce local solvency margin ratios in Gibraltar Life and Prudential of Japan, the solvency margins for these companies remain in excess of our targets. See below for additional information regarding solvency margin requirements.
The contributions did not materially impact Gibraltar Life’s or Prudential of Japan’s liquidity as their investment portfolios were positioned to provide the funding.

Star and Edison solvency margin ratios at acquisition are
estimated to be in excess of our solvency margin targets and will continue to be managed to capitalization levels consistent with our “AA” ratings targets. We believe the liquidity profiles of Star and Edison are sufficient to meet their
obligations, including under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios.

On May 1, 2009, our Gibraltar Life operations acquired Yamato Life, a Japanese life insurance company that declared bankruptcy in October 2008. Gibraltar Life served as the reorganization sponsor for
Yamato and under the reorganization agreement acquired Yamato by contributing $72 million of capital to Yamato. Concurrent with our acquisition, substantially all of Yamato’s insurance liabilities were restructured under a plan of
reorganization to include special surrender penalties on existing policies. These charges were 20% in the first year and decline by 2% each year thereafter. Subsequent to the acquisition, we renamed the acquired company The Prudential Gibraltar
Financial Life Insurance Company, Ltd.

As of
December 31, 2010 and 2009, Prudential of Japan had $32.2 billion and $26.2 billion, respectively, of general account insurance-related liabilities, other than dividends to policyholders. Prudential of Japan did not have a material amount of
general account annuity reserves or deposit liabilities subject to discretionary withdrawal as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Additionally, we believe that the individual life insurance policies sold by Prudential of Japan do not have
significant withdrawal risk because policyholders may incur surrender charges and must undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy.

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, our international
insurance subsidiaries had cash and short-term investments of $3.2 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, as well as fixed maturity investments, other than those designated as held to maturity, with fair values of $69.3 billion and $58.2 billion,
respectively. As of December 31, 2010, $68.3 billion, or 99%, of the fixed maturity investments that are not designated as held to maturity within our international insurance subsidiaries were considered high or highest quality based on NAIC or
equivalent rating, of which $33.8 billion and $25.2 billion were associated with Gibraltar Life and Prudential of Japan, respectively. The remaining $1.0 billion, or 1%, of these fixed maturity investments were considered other than high or highest
quality based on NAIC or equivalent rating, of which $0.7 billion and $0.3 billion were associated with Gibraltar Life and Prudential of Japan, respectively. In addition, of the $68.3 billion of fixed maturity investments that are not designated as
held to maturity and considered high or highest quality based on NAIC or equivalent rating, $50.6 billion, or 74%, were invested in government or government agency bonds. We consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets (for
example, type of asset and credit quality) in calculating internal liquidity measures to evaluate the adequacy of our international insurance operations’ liquidity under stress scenarios. We believe that ongoing operations and the liquidity
profile of our international insurance assets provide sufficient liquidity under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios.

Similar to the RBC ratios that are employed by U.S. insurance regulators, regulatory authorities in the international jurisdictions in
which we operate generally establish some form of minimum solvency margin requirements for insurance companies. All of our international insurance subsidiaries have solvency margins in



excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable regulatory authorities. These solvency margins are also a primary measure by which we evaluate the capital adequacy of our international
insurance operations. We manage these solvency margins to a capitalization level consistent with our “AA” ratings target. Maintenance of our solvency ratios at certain levels is also important to our competitive positioning, as in certain
jurisdictions, such as Japan, these solvency margins are required to be disclosed to the public and therefore impact the public perception of an insurer’s financial strength.

The Financial Services Agency, the insurance regulator in
Japan, has implemented revisions to the solvency margin requirements that will revise risk charges for certain assets and change the manner in which an insurance company’s core capital is calculated. These changes are effective for the fiscal
year ending March 31, 2012; however, it is anticipated that companies may begin to publicly disclose prior to that date both the old and new solvency margin calculations. While we believe that the solvency margins of our Japanese insurance
subsidiaries would continue to satisfy regulatory requirements and our internal targets, it is possible that a reduction in our reported ratios arising from changes in the calculation requirements could affect customer perception of our financial
strength. The capital requirements in Korea and Taiwan are also undergoing change.

We employ various hedging strategies to manage potential exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements, including the strategies discussed in “—Results of Operations for Financial
Services Businesses by Segment—International Insurance and Investments Division.” These hedging strategies include both internal and external hedging programs.

The internal hedges are between a subsidiary of Prudential
Financial and certain of our yen-based entities and serve to hedge the value of U.S. dollar denominated investments held on the books of these yen-based entities. Cash settlements from these hedging activities result in cash flows between Prudential
Financial and these yen-based subsidiaries. The cash flows are dependent on changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the notional amount of the exposures hedged. During 2010, Prudential Financial funded $158 million of cash settlements related
to the internal hedge program, which were paid to the yen-based subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2010, the market value of the internal hedges was a liability of $1,304 million owed to the yen-based subsidiaries of Prudential Financial. Absent
any changes in forward exchange rates from those expected as of December 31, 2010, the $1,304 million internal hedge liability represents the present value of the net cash flows from Prudential Financial to these entities over the life of the
hedging instruments, up to 30 years. A significant yen appreciation over an extended period of time, and in excess of the forward exchange rates, would result in higher net cash outflows from Prudential Financial in excess of our historical
experience.

Our external hedges primarily serve
to hedge the equity investments in certain subsidiaries and future income of most foreign subsidiaries. The external hedges are between a subsidiary of Prudential Financial and external parties. Cash settlements on these activities result in cash
flows between Prudential Financial and the external parties and are dependent on changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the notional amount of the exposures hedged. During 2010, Prudential Financial paid $171 million of net cash flows for
international insurance related external hedge settlements. As of December 31, 2010, the net liability related to external foreign currency hedges was $540 million. A significant appreciation in yen and other foreign currencies could result in
net cash outflows in excess of our liability. During the second quarter of 2009, we terminated our hedges of the U.S. GAAP equity exposure of our Korean operations due to a variety of considerations, including a desire to limit the potential for
cash settlement outflows that would result from a strengthening Korean won. For similar reasons, during the third quarter of 2010, we also terminated our hedges of the U.S. GAAP equity exposure for all other foreign operations, excluding our Japan
and Taiwan insurance operations.

In our
international investments operations, liquidity is provided through asset management fees as well as commission revenue. The principal uses of liquidity include general and administrative expenses and distributions of dividends and returns of
capital. As with our domestic operations, the primary liquidity risks for our fee-based asset management businesses relate to their profitability, which is impacted by market conditions and our investment management performance. We believe cash
flows from our international investments subsidiaries are adequate to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of their operations, as well as requirements that could arise under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios, which are monitored through
the use of internal measures.



Asset Management Subsidiaries

Our asset management businesses, which include real estate, public and private fixed income and public equity
asset management, as well as commercial mortgage origination and servicing, and retail investment products, such as mutual funds and other retail services, are largely unregulated from the standpoint of dividends and distributions. Our asset
management subsidiaries through which we conduct these businesses generally do not have restrictions on the amount of distributions they can make, and the fee-based asset management business can provide a relatively stable source of cash flow to
Prudential Financial.

The principal sources of
liquidity for our fee-based asset management businesses include asset management fees and commercial mortgage servicing fees. The principal uses of liquidity include general and administrative expenses and distribution of dividends and returns of
capital to Prudential Financial. The primary liquidity risks for our fee-based asset management businesses relate to their profitability, which is impacted by market conditions and our investment management performance. We believe the cash flows
from our fee-based asset management businesses are adequate to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of these operations, as well as requirements that could arise under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios, which are monitored through the
use of internal measures.

The principal sources
of liquidity for our proprietary investments and interim loans held in our asset management businesses are cash flows from investments, the ability to liquidate investments, and available borrowing lines from internal sources, including Prudential
Funding and Prudential Financial. The primary liquidity risks include the inability to sell assets in a timely manner, declines in the value of assets and credit defaults. The global economic recession experienced during 2008 and 2009 increased the
liquidity risks associated with our proprietary investments and interim loans, as the markets for certain investments, such as commercial mortgages and real estate, became less liquid. Though these markets have improved, if we needed to sell these
investments, it could still take longer and the prices could be lower than prior to the global recession.

In December 2008, we received approval from NJDOBI for Prudential Insurance to provide an 18-month $1.5 billion lending facility to our
commercial mortgage operation that is collateralized primarily by its interim loan portfolio. The maximum amount outstanding under this facility was $1.0 billion and was drawn at inception. This amount was gradually repaid during the period it was
outstanding and was repaid in its entirety during the second quarter of 2010 using long-term funding provided by Prudential Financial.

In April 2009, our commercial mortgage origination and servicing business received approval to participate in a Fannie Mae alternative
delivery program known as ASAP Plus (“As Soon as Pooled” delivery). Our approval limit for outstanding balances on ASAP Plus is presently $350 million. This program allows us to assign a qualified Fannie Mae loan trade commitment to Fannie
Mae as early as the next business day after a loan closes, and receive 99% of the loan purchase price from Fannie Mae. The program does not eliminate the need to provide temporary warehouse financing, but does significantly reduce the duration of
funding requirements for eligible Fannie Mae originated loans from the normal delivery cycle of two to four weeks down to as little as one to two days. There was no balance outstanding on this program as of December 31, 2010.

Certain real estate funds under management are held for the
benefit of clients in insurance company separate accounts sponsored by Prudential Insurance. In the normal course of business, these separate accounts enter into purchase commitments which include commitments to purchase real estate, invest in
future real estate partnerships, and/or fund additional construction or other expenditures on previously-acquired real estate investments. Certain purchases of real estate are contingent on the developer’s development of the real estate
according to plans and specifications outlined in a pre-sale agreement or the property achieving a certain level of leasing. Purchase commitments are typically entered into by Prudential Insurance on behalf of the particular separate account and,
upon acquisition, are titled either in the name of Prudential Insurance or an LLC subsidiary formed for that purpose. In certain cases, the commitments specify that recourse on the obligation is limited to the assets of the separate account.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, total
outstanding purchase commitments were $5.3 billion and $8.7 billion, respectively. The decrease in total outstanding purchase commitments was primarily driven by debt repayments funded from investor capital contributions and property sales. The
following is a summary of the



outstanding purchase commitments for these separate account portfolios as of December 31, 2010. Off-balance sheet commitments have not yet substantially satisfied pre-conditions and are
considered contingent liabilities. On-balance sheet commitments represent obligations which have substantially satisfied pre-conditions of the commitments.

The contractual maturity dates
of some of the outstanding purchase commitments may accelerate upon a failure to maintain required loan-to-value ratios, failure of Prudential Insurance to maintain required ratings or failure to satisfy other financial covenants.

Some separate accounts have also entered into syndicated
credit facilities providing for borrowings in the aggregate amount of up to $1.0 billion. As of December 31, 2010, there were outstanding borrowings of $100 million under these credit facilities. These facilities also include loan-to-value
ratio requirements and other financial covenants. Recourse on obligations under these facilities is limited to the assets of the applicable separate account.

As of December 31, 2010, these separate account portfolios had combined gross and net asset values of $25.7 billion and $14.5
billion, respectively.

At the time of maturity of
a commitment obligation, Prudential Insurance often endeavors to negotiate extensions, refinancings or other solutions with creditors. Management believes that the separate accounts have sufficient resources to ultimately meet their obligations.
However, there is a risk that the separate accounts may not be able to timely fund all maturing obligations from regular sources such as asset sales, operating cash flow, deposits from clients, debt refinancings or from the above-mentioned portfolio
level credit facilities. In cases where the separate account is not able to fund maturing obligations, Prudential Insurance may be called upon or required to provide interim funding solutions. To date, Prudential Insurance has not been required to
provide any such funding.

As of December 31,
2010 and 2009, our asset management subsidiaries had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $805 million and $646 million, respectively.

Financing Activities

Prudential Financial maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that permits the issuance of public debt, equity and hybrid
securities. As a “Well-Known Seasoned Issuer” under SEC rules, Prudential Financial’s shelf registration statement provides for automatic effectiveness upon filing, pay-as-you-go fees and the ability to add securities by filing
automatically effective amendments. Also, in accordance with these rules, the shelf registration statement has no stated issuance capacity.

In November 2010, Prudential Financial issued 18,348,624 shares of its Common Stock in a public offering at a price of $54.50 per share
for gross proceeds of $1.0 billion. The proceeds from the offering, along with proceeds from the sale of $1.0 billion of medium-term notes, were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of the Star and Edison Businesses from
AIG.



As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, total short- and long-term debt of the Company on a
consolidated basis was $25.6 billion and $24.2 billion, respectively, which as shown below, includes $17.6 billion and $14.7 billion, respectively, related to the parent company, Prudential Financial.

Prudential Financial Borrowings

Prudential Financial is authorized to borrow funds from
various sources to meet its capital and other funding needs, as well as the capital and other funding needs of its subsidiaries. The following table sets forth the outstanding short- and long-term debt of Prudential Financial, other than debt issued
to consolidated subsidiaries, as of December 31:

The following table presents, as
of December 31, 2010, Prudential Financial’s contractual maturities of its general obligation long-term debt:

Prudential Financial maintains a
Medium-Term Notes, Series D program under its shelf registration statement with an authorized issuance capacity of $20 billion, reflecting an increase in the program size by $10 billion effective June 9, 2010. As of December 31, 2010,
approximately $9.4 billion remained available under the program. In 2010 Prudential Financial issued an aggregate of $3.25 billion of notes under the program, as follows: in January we issued $500 million of 2.75% notes due January 2013 and $750
million of 3.875% notes due January 2015, the proceeds from which were used to replace a portion of the FHLBNY borrowing that matured in June 2010 and to make operating loans to our affiliates; in June we issued $650 million of 5.375% notes due June
2020 and $350 million of 6.625% notes due June 2040, the proceeds from which were used to purchase surplus notes from our insurance subsidiaries to support the financing of statutory reserve requirements under Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX and
to make operating loans to our affiliates; and in November we issued $500 million of 4.50% notes due November 2020 and $500 million of 6.20% notes due November 2040, the proceeds from which were used to fund a portion of the acquisition purchase
price for the Star and Edison Businesses. The weighted average interest rates on Prudential Financial’s medium-term and senior notes, including the effect of interest rate hedging activity, were 5.21% and 5.51% for the years ended
December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, excluding the effect of debt issued to consolidated subsidiaries.



Prudential Financial also maintains a retail medium-term notes program,
including the InterNotes

®

program, under its shelf registration statement with an authorized issuance capacity
of $5.0 billion. As of December 31, 2010, approximately $2.8 billion remained available under this program. The retail medium-term notes program traditionally has served as a funding source for a product of our Retirement segment for which we
earn investment spread; however, the program can also be used for general corporate purposes. Beginning in 2009, we began using a portion of the proceeds from outstanding retail medium-term notes for general corporate purposes and used funding
agreements issued to the FHLBNY as a substitute funding source for the asset portfolio within the Retirement segment, as discussed in “—Prudential Financial—Alternative Sources of Liquidity—Federal Home Loan Bank of New
York.” The weighted average interest rates on Prudential Financial’s retail medium-term notes were 5.74% and 5.50% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, excluding the effect of debt issued to consolidated
subsidiaries. A decline in demand by retail investors, and an increase in borrowing costs versus historical levels have resulted in a halt in new issuances under the retail medium-term notes program. However, if the capital markets continue to
improve, we may resume new issuances under the program.

In 2008, Prudential Financial issued $600 million of 8.875% fixed-to-floating rate junior subordinated notes to institutional investors and $920 million of 9.0% fixed-rate junior subordinated notes to
retail investors. Both issuances are considered hybrid capital securities, which receive enhanced equity treatment from the rating agencies. Both series of notes have a scheduled maturity of June 15, 2038 and a final maturity of June 15,
2068. In connection with the issuance of both series of notes, Prudential Financial entered into a replacement capital covenant, or RCC, for the benefit of holders of its 6.625% Senior Notes due 2037. Under the RCC, Prudential Financial agreed that
it will not repay, redeem, defease, or purchase the notes prior to June 15, 2048, unless it has received proceeds from the issuance of specified replacement capital securities, which include, but are not limited to, hybrid capital securities
and common stock. See Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning these junior subordinated notes.

Consolidated Borrowings

Current capital markets activities for the Company on a consolidated basis principally consist of unsecured short-term and long-term
borrowings by Prudential Funding and Prudential Financial, unsecured third party bank borrowings, and asset-based or secured financing. As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to the borrowings in the
table below.

The following table
sets forth total consolidated borrowings of the Company as of the dates indicated:

(1)

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, includes $0.3 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, of short-term debt representing collateralized advances with the Federal
Home Loan Bank of New York, which are discussed in more detail in “—Alternative Sources of Liquidity—Federal Home Loan Bank of New York.”



(2)

As of both December 31, 2010 and 2009, includes $3.2 billion of floating rate surplus notes issued by subsidiaries of Prudential Insurance to fund regulatory
reserves, as well as $942 million and $941 million, respectively, of fixed rate surplus notes issued by Prudential Insurance.

(3)

Reflects collateralized advances with Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, which are discussed in more detail in “—Alternative Sources of
Liquidity—Federal Home Loan Bank of New York.”

(4)

As of both December 31, 2010 and 2009, $1.750 billion of limited and non-recourse long-term debt outstanding was attributable to the Closed Block Business.

(5)

Does not include $3.5 billion and $4.9 billion of medium-term notes of consolidated trust entities secured by funding agreements purchased with the proceeds of such
notes as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, or $1.5 billion of collateralized funding agreements issued to the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York as of both December 31, 2010 and 2009. These notes and funding agreements are
included in “Policyholders’ account balances.” For additional information on the trust notes, see “—Funding Agreement Notes Issuance Program” and for additional information on the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York
funding agreements, see “—Alternative Sources of Liquidity—Federal Home Loan Bank of New York.”

On September 18, 2009, Prudential Insurance issued in a private placement $500 million of surplus notes due September 2019, with an
interest rate of 5.36% per annum, that are exchangeable by the holders for shares of Prudential Financial Common Stock. See Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding these exchangeable surplus notes. The
proceeds from the sale of these surplus notes are being used for general corporate purposes at Prudential Insurance.

Total general debt obligations increased by $1.9 billion from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010, primarily reflecting
issuances of medium-term notes and an increase in commercial paper utilized to fund loans to our affiliates, offset by the repayment of the collateralized advance with the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and certain retail medium-term notes.

Our total borrowings consist of capital debt,
investment-related debt, securities business-related debt and debt related to specified other businesses. Capital debt consists of borrowings that are used or will be used to meet the capital requirements of Prudential Financial, as well as
borrowings invested in equity or debt securities of direct or indirect subsidiaries of Prudential Financial and subsidiary borrowings utilized for capital requirements. Investment-related borrowings consist of debt issued to finance specific
investment assets or portfolios of investment assets, including institutional spread lending investment portfolios, real estate and real estate-related investments held in consolidated joint ventures, assets supporting reserve requirements under
Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX as described below, as well as institutional and insurance company portfolio cash flow timing differences. Securities business-related debt consists of debt issued to finance primarily the liquidity of our
broker-dealers and our capital markets and other securities business-related operations. Debt related to specified other businesses consists of borrowings associated with our individual annuity business, real estate franchises and relocation
services. Borrowings under which either the holder is entitled to collect only against the assets pledged to the debt as collateral, or has only very limited rights to collect against other assets, have been classified as limited and non-recourse
debt.



The following table summarizes our borrowings, categorized by use of proceeds, as of
December 31:

(1)

Includes $1.519 billion and $1.518 billion of total outstanding junior subordinated debt as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. See “—Prudential
Financial” for additional information on our capital debt to total capital ratio, including the equity credit attributed to our outstanding junior subordinated debt.

(2)

As of both December 31, 2010 and 2009, $1.750 billion of limited and non-recourse debt outstanding was attributable to the Closed Block Business.

The following table presents, as of
December 31, 2010, the Company’s contractual maturities of its long-term debt:

We may, from time to time, seek
to redeem or repurchase our outstanding debt securities through individually negotiated transactions or otherwise. Any such repurchases will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity position, contractual restrictions and other factors.

The states of domicile of our domestic life
insurance subsidiaries have in place a regulation entitled “Valuation of Life Insurance Policies,” commonly known as “Regulation XXX,” and a supporting Guideline entitled “The Application of the Valuation of Life Insurance
Policies,” commonly known as “Guideline AXXX.” The Regulation and supporting Guideline require insurers to establish statutory reserves for term and universal life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees that are
consistent with the statutory reserves required for other individual life insurance policies with similar guarantees. Many market participants believe that this level of reserves is excessive, and we have implemented reinsurance and capital
management actions to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX on our term and universal life insurance business, including actions that are described in more detail below.

In 2006, a subsidiary of Prudential Insurance entered into a surplus note purchase agreement with an
unaffiliated financial institution that provides for the issuance of up to $3.0 billion of ten-year floating rate surplus notes through 2016, if certain conditions are met (commonly referred to as XXX notes), for the purpose



of financing certain regulatory reserves required to be held by subsidiary life insurers in connection with the intercompany reinsurance of certain term life insurance policies. In connection
with this financing arrangement, Prudential Financial has agreed with such subsidiary that it or certain of its affiliates will make capital contributions to such subsidiary as necessary to maintain the capital of such subsidiary at or above a
prescribed minimum level. Concurrent with the issuance of each surplus note, Prudential Financial enters into arrangements with the buyer, which are accounted for as derivative instruments, which may result in payments by, or to, Prudential
Financial over the term of the surplus notes, to the extent there are significant changes in the value of the surplus notes. Principal factors that impact the value of the surplus notes are mortality experience, interest rates and credit spreads. As
of December 31, 2010, there have been no collateral postings made under the derivative instruments. Surplus notes issued under this facility are subordinated to policyholder obligations and are subject to regulatory approvals for principal and
interest payments. Total outstanding notes under this facility were $2.7 billion as of both December 31, 2010 and 2009.

During 2007, a subsidiary of Prudential Insurance issued $500 million of 45-year floating rate surplus notes (commonly referred to as AXXX
notes) to an unaffiliated financial institution for the purpose of financing certain regulatory reserves required to be held by subsidiary life insurers in connection with the intercompany reinsurance of certain universal life insurance policies.
Surplus notes issued under this facility are subordinated to policyholder obligations and are subject to regulatory approvals for principal and interest payments. In connection with this financing arrangement, Prudential Financial has agreed with
such subsidiary that it or certain of its affiliates will make capital contributions to such subsidiary as necessary to maintain the capital of such subsidiary at or above a prescribed minimum level. Concurrent with the issuance of these surplus
notes, Prudential Financial entered into a credit derivative that requires Prudential Financial to make certain payments in the event of deterioration in the value of the surplus note. Under this credit derivative, we are required to post cash
collateral based on tests that consider the level of 10-year credit default swap spreads on Prudential Financial’s senior debt. As of December 31, 2010, no collateral amounts were required to be paid.

As we continue to underwrite term and universal life
business, we expect to have additional borrowing needs to finance statutory reserves required under Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX. We were able to fund these reserves through 2010 primarily with the proceeds from Prudential Financial’s June
2010 medium-term note issuance. Based on current sales expectations, we believe our 2011 reserve growth could be up to $600 million. We are evaluating both internal and external solutions to fund this growth.

Funding Agreement Notes Issuance Program

In 2003, Prudential Insurance established a Funding
Agreement Notes Issuance Program pursuant to which a Delaware statutory trust issues medium-term notes (which are included in our statements of financial position in “Policyholders’ account balances” and not included in the foregoing
table) secured by funding agreements issued to the trust by Prudential Insurance and included in our Retirement segment. The funding agreements provide cash flow sufficient for the debt service on the related medium-term notes. The medium-term notes
are sold in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The notes have fixed or floating interest rates and original maturities ranging from five to ten years. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the outstanding
aggregate principal amount of such notes totaled $3.5 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, out of a total authorized amount of up to $15 billion. The decrease in outstanding aggregate principal amount of such notes is due to maturities in excess
of issuances during 2010. Our ability to issue under this program depends on market conditions. The aggregate maturities of these notes over the next 12 months are approximately $302 million. We intend to repay the maturing notes through a
combination of cash flows from asset maturities, asset sales, new liability origination and internal sources of funds.

Credit Facilities

As of December 31, 2010, Prudential Financial, Prudential Insurance and Prudential Funding maintained an aggregate of $4.108 billion
of unsecured committed credit facilities. There were no outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities as of December 31, 2010 or as of the date of this filing. Each of the facilities is available to the applicable borrowers up to the
aggregate committed credit and may be used for general corporate purposes, including as backup liquidity for our commercial paper programs. Any borrowings under the credit facilities would mature no later than the respective expiration dates of the
facilities and would bear interest at the rates set forth in the applicable credit agreement.



This $4.108 billion of committed credit facilities consists of three separate five-year
credit facilities: Prudential Financial, Prudential Insurance and Prudential Funding are parties to a $698 million five-year credit facility that expires in May 2012, which includes 21 financial institutions, and a $2.16 billion credit facility, of
which $180 million expires in December 2011 and $1.98 billion expires in December 2012, which includes 20 financial institutions. Prudential Financial is the sole borrower party to a separate $1.25 billion five-year credit facility that expires in
November 2015, which includes 21 financial institutions. Prudential Financial expects to borrow loans under the $1.25 billion facility from time to time for general corporate purposes.

These credit facilities contain representations and warranties, covenants and events of default that are
customary for facilities of this type. Our ability to borrow under the facilities is conditioned on the continued satisfaction of customary conditions, including, for the facilities shared by Prudential Financial, Prudential Insurance and Prudential
Funding, the maintenance at all times by Prudential Insurance of total adjusted capital of at least $5.5 billion based on statutory accounting principles prescribed under New Jersey law and, in the case of each of the facilities, Prudential
Financial’s maintenance of a prescribed minimum level of consolidated net worth.

For the credit facilities shared by Prudential Financial, Prudential Insurance and Prudential Funding, the minimum level of consolidated net worth of Prudential Financial is $12.5 billion which for this
purpose is calculated as U.S. GAAP equity, excluding net unrealized gains and losses on investments. For the credit facility on which Prudential Financial is the sole borrower party, the minimum level of consolidated net worth of Prudential
Financial is $19.0 billion, which for this purpose is calculated as U.S. GAAP equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

As of December 31, 2010, Prudential Insurance’s total adjusted capital and Prudential Financial’s consolidated net worth
(as defined in the applicable credit agreements) exceeded the minimum amounts required to borrow under the facilities. Our ability to borrow under the facilities is not contingent on our credit ratings, nor subject to material adverse change
clauses.

We also use uncommitted lines of credit
from financial institutions.

Ratings

Financial strength ratings (which are
sometimes referred to as “claims-paying” ratings) and credit ratings are important factors affecting public confidence in an insurer and its competitive position in marketing products. Nationally Recognized Statistical Ratings
Organizations continually review the financial performance and financial condition of the entities they rate, including Prudential Financial and its rated subsidiaries. Our credit ratings are also important for our ability to raise capital through
the issuance of debt and for the cost of such financing.

A downgrade in the credit or financial strength ratings of Prudential Financial or its rated subsidiaries could potentially, among other things, limit our ability to market products, reduce our
competitiveness, increase the number or value of policy surrenders and withdrawals, increase our borrowing costs and potentially make it more difficult to borrow funds, adversely affect the availability of financial guarantees, such as letters of
credit, cause additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements, allow counterparties to terminate derivative agreements and/or hurt our relationships with creditors, distributors or trading counterparties
thereby potentially negatively affecting our profitability, liquidity and/or capital. In addition, we consider our own risk of non-performance in determining the fair value of our liabilities. Therefore, changes in our credit or financial strength
ratings may affect the fair value of our liabilities.



Financial strength ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding the financial
ability of an insurance company to meet its obligations under an insurance policy. Credit ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding an entity’s ability to repay its indebtedness. The following table summarizes the ratings for
Prudential Financial and certain of its subsidiaries as of the date of this filing:

*

“NR” indicates not rated.

(1)

A.M. Best Company, which we refer to as A.M. Best, financial strength ratings for insurance companies currently range from “A++ (superior)” to “F (in
liquidation).” A.M. Best’s ratings reflect its opinion of an insurance company’s financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders. An A.M. Best long-term credit rating is an opinion of the
ability of an obligor to pay interest and principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation. A.M. Best long-term credit ratings range from “aaa (exceptional)” to “d (in default),” with ratings from “aaa” to
“bbb” considered as investment grade. An A.M. Best short-term credit rating reflects an opinion of the issuer’s fundamental credit quality. Ratings range from “AMB-1+,” which represents an exceptional ability to repay
short-term debt obligations, to “AMB-4,” which correlates with a speculative (“bb”) long-term rating.

(2)

Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, which we refer to as S&P, financial strength ratings currently range from “AAA (extremely strong)” to
“R (regulatory supervision).” These ratings reflect S&P’s opinion of an operating insurance company’s financial capacity to meet the obligations of its insurance policies in accordance with their terms. A “+” or
“-” indicates relative strength within a category. An S&P credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation, a specific class of financial obligations or a specific
financial program. S&P’s long-term issue credit ratings range from “AAA (extremely strong)” to “D (default).” S&P short-term ratings range from “A-1 (highest category)” to “D (default).”

(3)

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., which we refer to as Moody’s, insurance financial strength ratings currently range from “Aaa (exceptional)” to
“C (lowest).” Moody’s insurance ratings reflect the ability of insurance companies to repay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations. Numeric modifiers are used to refer to the ranking within the group—with 1 being
the highest and 3 being the lowest. These modifiers are used to indicate relative strength within a category. Moody’s credit ratings currently range from “Aaa (highest)” to “C (default).” Moody’s credit ratings grade
debt according to its investment quality. Moody’s considers “A1,” “A2” and “A3” rated debt to be upper medium grade obligations, subject to low credit risk. Moody’s short-term ratings are opinions of the
ability of issuers to honor senior financial obligations and contracts. Prime ratings range from “Prime-1 (P-1),” which represents a superior ability for repayment of senior short-term debt obligations, to “Prime-3 (P-3),” which
represents an acceptable ability for repayment of such obligations. Issuers rated “Not Prime” do not fall within any of the Prime rating categories.

(4)

Fitch Ratings Ltd., which we refer to as Fitch, financial strength ratings currently range from “AAA (exceptionally strong)” to “D (distressed).”
Fitch’s ratings reflect its assessment of the likelihood of timely payment of policyholder and contractholder obligations. Fitch long-term credit ratings currently range from “AAA (highest credit quality),” which denotes exceptionally
strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments, to “D (default).” Investment grade ratings range between “AAA” and “BBB.” Short-term ratings range from “F1 (highest credit quality)” to “C
(high default risk).” Within long-term and short-term ratings, a “+” or a “–” may be appended to a rating to denote relative status within major rating categories.

(5)

Includes the retail medium-term notes program.



The ratings set forth above reflect current opinions of each rating agency. Each rating
should be evaluated independently of any other rating. These ratings are not directed toward shareholders and do not in any way reflect evaluations of the safety and security of the Common Stock. These ratings are reviewed periodically and may be
changed at any time by the rating agencies. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will maintain our current ratings in the future.

Requirements to post collateral or make other payments, as a result of ratings downgrades, under certain agreements, including derivative
agreements, can be satisfied in cash or by posting permissible securities held by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements. A ratings downgrade of three ratings levels from the ratings levels as of December 31, 2010 (relating to financial
strength ratings in certain cases and credit ratings in other cases) would result in estimated additional collateral posting requirements or payments under such agreements of approximately $198 million as of December 31, 2010. The amount of
collateral required to be posted for derivative agreements is also dependent on the fair value of the derivative positions as of the balance sheet date. For additional information regarding the potential impacts of a ratings downgrade on our
derivative agreements see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, a ratings downgrade by A.M. Best to “A-” for our domestic life insurance companies would require Prudential Insurance to post a letter of credit in
the amount of approximately $1.7 billion, based on the level of statutory reserves related to the variable annuity business acquired from Allstate, that we estimate would result in annual cash outflows of approximately $14 million, or collateral
posting in the form of cash or securities to be held in a trust. We believe that the posting of such collateral would not be a material liquidity event for Prudential Insurance.

Rating agencies use an “outlook” statement for both
industry sectors and individual companies. For an industry sector, a stable outlook generally implies that over the next 12-18 months the rating agency expects ratings to remain unchanged among companies in the sector. Currently, A.M. Best, S&P,
Moody’s and Fitch all have the U.S. life insurance industry on stable outlook. For a particular company, an outlook generally indicates a medium- or long-term trend (generally six months to two years) in credit fundamentals, which if continued,
may lead to a rating change. These indicators are not necessarily a precursor of a rating change nor do they preclude a rating agency from changing a rating at any time without notice. A.M. Best, S&P, Moody’s and Fitch currently have all of
the Company’s ratings on stable outlook.

In
view of the difficulties experienced recently by many financial institutions, the rating agencies have heightened the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions, have increased the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, have
requested additional information from the companies that they rate, and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels, such as the financial strength ratings
currently held by our life insurance subsidiaries. In addition, actions we might take to access third party financing or to realign our capital structure may in turn cause rating agencies to reevaluate our ratings.

The following is a summary of the significant changes in our
ratings and rating outlooks that have occurred from the beginning of 2010 through the date of this filing.

On January 29, 2010, Fitch downgraded the junior subordinated long-term debt rating of Prudential Financial from “BBB-” to
“BB+.” The outlook on this rating is stable.



On June 4, 2010, A.M. Best affirmed the long-term senior debt rating of Prudential
Financial at “a-” and the financial strength ratings of our life insurance subsidiaries at “A+,” and revised the outlook from negative to stable.

On August 11, 2010, S&P affirmed the long-term
senior debt rating of Prudential Financial at “A” and the financial strength ratings of our life insurance subsidiaries at “AA-.”

On November 3, 2010, Fitch upgraded Prudential Financial’s long-term senior debt rating to “BBB+” from “BBB”
and the junior subordinated long-term debt rating to “BBB-” from “BB+,” and affirmed all of our other ratings. The outlook for all ratings remained stable.

In connection with the announcement of our agreement to
acquire AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd. and AIG Edison Life Insurance Company, all four rating agencies reviewed and affirmed all of our ratings.

Contractual Obligation

The table below summarizes the future estimated cash payments related to certain contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010. The
estimated payments reflected in this table are based on management’s estimates and assumptions about these obligations. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the actual cash outflows in future periods will vary,
possibly materially, from those reflected in the table. In addition, we do not believe that our cash flow requirements can be adequately assessed based solely upon an analysis of these obligations, as the table below does not contemplate all aspects
of our cash inflows, such as the level of cash flow generated by certain of our investments, nor all aspects of our cash outflows.

(1)

The estimated payments due by period for long-term debt reflects the contractual maturities of principal, as disclosed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, as well as estimated future interest payments. The payment of principal and estimated future interest for short-term debt are reflected in estimated payments due in less than one year. The estimate for future interest payments includes
the effect of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning our short-term and long-term debt.

(2)

The estimated payments due by period for operating leases reflect the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases, as disclosed in Note 23 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements. We have no significant capital lease obligations.

(3)

As discussed in Note 23, we have commitments to purchase or fund investments, some of which are contingent upon events or circumstances not under our control, including
those at the discretion of our counterparties. The timing of the fulfillment of certain of these commitments cannot be estimated, therefore the settlement of these obligations are reflected in estimated payments due in less than one year.
Commitments to purchase or fund investments include $1.868 billion that we anticipate will ultimately be funded from our separate accounts. Of these separate account commitments, $1.015 billion have recourse to Prudential Insurance if the separate
accounts are unable to fund the amounts when due. For further discussion of these separate account commitments, see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources of Subsidiaries—Asset Management Subsidiaries.”

(4)

As discussed in Note 23, loan commitments of our commercial mortgage operations, which are legally binding commitments to extend credit to a counterparty, have been
reflected in the contractual obligations table above principally based on the expiration date of the commitment; however, it is possible these loan commitments could be funded prior to their expiration. In certain circumstances the counterparty may
also extend the date of the expiration in exchange for a fee.



(5)

The estimated payments due by period for insurance liabilities reflect future estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and others for future policy benefits,
policyholders’ account balances, policyholder’s dividends, reinsurance payables and separate account liabilities. These future estimated cash outflows are based on mortality, morbidity, lapse and other assumptions comparable with our
experience, consider future premium receipts on current policies in force, and assume market growth and interest crediting consistent with assumptions used in amortizing deferred acquisition costs and valuation of business acquired. These cash
outflows are undiscounted with respect to interest and, as a result, the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of $1,112 billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of $453 billion included in the Consolidated Financial
Statements as of December 31, 2010. Separate account liabilities are legally insulated from general account obligations, and it is generally expected these liabilities will be fully funded by separate account assets and their related cash
flows. We have made significant assumptions to determine the future estimated cash outflows related to the underlying policies and contracts. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, actual cash outflows will differ, possibly materially,
from these estimates.

(6)

The estimated payments due by period for other liabilities includes securities sold under agreements to repurchase, cash collateral for loaned securities, liabilities
for unrecognized tax benefits, and other miscellaneous liabilities.

We also enter into agreements to purchase goods and services in the normal course of business; however, these purchase obligations are not material to our consolidated results of operations or financial
position as of December 31, 2010.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Guarantees and Other Contingencies

In the course of our business, we provide certain guarantees and indemnities to third parties pursuant to which we may be contingently
required to make payments now or in the future. See “Commitments and Guarantees” within Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Other Contingent Commitments

We also have other commitments, some of which are contingent
upon events or circumstances not under our control, including those at the discretion of our counterparties. See “Commitments and Guarantees” within Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding
these commitments. For further discussion of certain of these commitments that relate to our separate accounts, also see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources of Subsidiaries—Asset Management Subsidiaries.”

Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have retained or contingent interests in assets
transferred to unconsolidated entities, or variable interests in unconsolidated entities or other similar transactions, arrangements or relationships that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support, that we believe are reasonably likely to
have a material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or our access to or requirements for capital resources. In addition, we do not have
relationships with any unconsolidated entities that are contractually limited to narrow activities that facilitate our transfer of or access to associated assets.



ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Risk Management, Market Risk and Derivative Instruments

Risk management includes the identification and measurement
of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns on the underlying assets or liabilities. We consider risk management an integral
part of managing our core businesses.

Market risk
is the risk of change in the value of financial instruments as a result of absolute or relative changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity prices or commodity prices. To varying degrees, the investment and trading activities
supporting all of our products and services generate exposure to market risk. The market risk incurred and our strategies for managing this risk vary by product.

With respect to non-variable life insurance products,
fixed-rate annuities, the fixed-rate accounts in our variable life insurance and annuity products, and other finance businesses, we incur market risk primarily in the form of interest rate risk. We manage this risk through asset/liability management
and derivative strategies that seek to closely approximate the interest rate sensitivity, but not necessarily the exact cash flow characteristics, of the assets with the estimated interest rate sensitivity of the product liabilities. Our overall
objective in these strategies is to limit the net change in value of assets and liabilities arising from interest rate movements within the context of market conditions and other relative opportunities. While it is more difficult to measure the
interest sensitivity of our insurance liabilities than that of the related assets, to the extent that we can measure such sensitivities we believe that interest rate movements will generate asset value changes that substantially offset changes in
the value of the liabilities relating to the underlying products. Certain products supported by general account investments also expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce the spread between the amounts that we are required to
pay under the contracts and the rate of return we are able to earn on our general account investments supporting the contracts. In a declining or sustained low interest rate environment, our ability to achieve desired spreads can become limited by
minimum guaranteed crediting rates associated with some of our variable life insurance and annuity products.

For variable annuities and variable life insurance products, excluding the fixed-rate accounts associated with these products, mutual
funds and most separate accounts, we are exposed to the risk that asset-based fees may decrease as a result of declines in assets under management due to changes in investment prices. We also run the risk that asset management fees calculated by
reference to performance could be lower. The risk of decreased asset-based and asset management fees could also impact our estimates of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs. While a decrease
in our estimates of total gross profits would accelerate amortization and decrease net income in a given period, it would not affect our cash flow or liquidity position.

For variable annuity and variable life insurance products
with minimum guaranteed death benefits and variable annuity products with living benefits such as guaranteed minimum income, withdrawal, and accumulation benefits, we also face the risk that declines in the value of underlying investments as a
result of interest rate, equity market, or market volatility changes may increase our net exposure to the guarantees under these contracts. As part of our risk management strategy, we utilize product design elements such as asset allocation
restrictions, an automatic rebalancing element and minimum purchase age requirements, in addition to externally-purchased hedging instruments such as interest rate and equity based derivatives to help to hedge or limit our market risk exposure to
the benefit features of certain of our variable annuity contracts. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our use of interest rate and equity based derivatives. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information about the guaranteed minimum death benefits associated with our variable life and variable annuity contracts, and the guaranteed minimum income, withdrawal, and accumulation benefits associated with our variable annuity
contracts.

For a discussion of asset-based fees
associated with our variable life products and our variable annuity contracts, our estimates of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs, and the impact of our guaranteed minimum death and other
benefits on the results of our Individual Life and Individual Annuities segments, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by
Segment—U.S. Individual



Life and Group Insurance Division—Individual Life” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations for
Financial Services Businesses by Segment—U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division—Individual Annuities.”

For risk management purposes we perform stress scenario testing to monitor the impact of extreme, but realistic adverse market events on
our capital adequacy and liquidity. This testing allows us to assess the sensitivity of our businesses to market factors and identify any concentrations of risk. The regulatory capital levels and liquidity of our insurance companies in particular
are closely monitored to ensure they remain consistent with our rating objectives. Changes to these ratings could impact our borrowing costs, our ability to access alternative sources of liquidity, and our ability to market certain products. For
additional information regarding our liquidity and capital resources see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Market fluctuations or changes in
market conditions could also cause a change in consumer sentiment adversely affecting sales and persistency of our long-term savings, protection and other investment products. For additional information regarding the potential impacts of interest
rate and other market fluctuations as well as general economic and market conditions on our businesses and profitability see Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”

The sources of our exposure to market risk can be divided
into two categories, “other than trading” activities conducted primarily in our insurance and annuity operations, and “trading” activities conducted primarily in our derivatives trading operations. As part of our management of
both “other than trading” and “trading” market risks, we use a variety of risk management tools and techniques. These include sensitivity and Value-at-Risk, or VaR, measures, position and other limits based on type of risk, and
various hedging methods.

Other Than Trading Activities

We hold the majority of our assets for
“other than trading” activities in our segments that offer insurance, retirement and annuities products. We incorporate asset/liability management techniques and other risk management policies and limits into the process of investing our
assets. We use derivatives for hedging and other purposes in the asset/liability management process.

Insurance and Annuities Products Asset/Liability Management

We seek to maintain interest rate and equity exposures
within established ranges, which we periodically adjust based on market conditions and the design of related products sold to customers. Our risk managers establish investment risk limits for exposures to any issuer, geographic region, type of
security or industry sector and oversee efforts to manage interest rate and equity exposure risk, as well as credit, liquidity and other risks, all within policy constraints set by management and approved by the Investment Committee of the Board of
Directors. For additional information regarding the management of our general account investments and our asset mix strategies, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Realized
Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—General Account Investments—Management of Investments.”

We use duration and convexity analyses to measure price sensitivity to interest rate changes. Duration measures the relative sensitivity
of the fair value of a financial instrument to changes in interest rates. Convexity measures the rate of change of duration with respect to changes in interest rates. We use asset/liability management and derivative strategies to manage our interest
rate exposure by legal entity by matching the relative sensitivity of asset and liability values to interest rate changes, or controlling “duration mismatch” of assets and liabilities. We have target duration mismatch constraints by
segment for each insurance entity. In certain markets, primarily outside the U.S., capital market limitations that hinder our ability to acquire assets that closely approximate the duration of some of our liabilities are considered in setting the
constraint limits. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the difference between the pre-tax duration of assets and the target duration of liabilities in our duration-managed portfolios was within our constraint limits. We consider risk-based
capital and tax implications as well as current market conditions in our asset/liability management strategies.

We also perform portfolio stress testing as part of our U.S. regulatory cash flow for major product lines that are subject to risk from
changes in interest rates. In this testing, we evaluate the impact of altering our interest-



sensitive assumptions under various adverse interest rate environments. These interest-sensitive assumptions relate to the timing and amount of redemptions and prepayments of fixed-income
securities and lapses and surrenders of insurance products and the potential impact of any guaranteed minimum interest rates. We evaluate any shortfalls that this cash flow testing reveals to determine if we need to increase statutory reserves or
adjust portfolio management strategies.

Market
Risk Related to Interest Rates

Our
“other than trading” assets that subject us to interest rate risk include primarily fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans and policy loans. In the aggregate, the carrying value of these assets represented 78% of
our consolidated assets, other than assets that we held in separate accounts, as of both December 31, 2010 and 2009.

With respect to “other than trading” liabilities, we are exposed to interest rate risk through policyholder account balances
relating to interest-sensitive life insurance, annuity and other investment-type contracts, collectively referred to as investment contracts, and through outstanding short-term and long-term debt.

We assess interest rate sensitivity for “other than
trading” financial assets, financial liabilities and derivatives using hypothetical test scenarios that assume either upward or downward 100 basis point parallel shifts in the yield curve from prevailing interest rates, reflecting changes in
either credit spreads or the risk-free rate. The following tables set forth the net estimated potential loss in fair value from a hypothetical 100 basis point upward shift as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, because this scenario results in the
greatest net exposure to interest rate risk of the hypothetical scenarios tested at those dates. While the test scenario is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future interest rates or the performance of
fixed-income markets, it is a near-term, reasonably possible hypothetical change that illustrates the potential impact of such events. These test scenarios do not measure the changes in value that could result from non-parallel shifts in the yield
curve, which we would expect to produce different changes in discount rates for different maturities. As a result, the actual loss in fair value from a 100 basis point change in interest rates could be different from that indicated by these
calculations.



(1)

Includes “trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities” and other fixed maturities classified as trading securities under U.S. GAAP, but are held
for “other than trading” activities in our segments that offer insurance, retirement and annuities products.

(2)

The hypothetical change in fair value related to our variable annuity and other living benefit feature embedded derivatives reflects only the gross fair value change on
the embedded derivatives, and excludes any offsetting impact of derivative instruments purchased to hedge such changes in fair value.

(3)

Included in “Other liabilities” together with all liabilities of consolidated variable interest entities. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information regarding consolidated variable interest entities.

The tables above do not include approximately $163 billion of insurance reserve and deposit liabilities as of December 31, 2010 and $154 billion as of December 31, 2009 which are not considered
financial liabilities. We believe that the interest rate sensitivities of these insurance liabilities would serve as an offset to the net interest rate risk of the financial assets and liabilities, including investment contracts, which are set forth
in these tables.

Our net estimated potential loss
in fair value as of December 31, 2010 increased $1,656 million from December 31, 2009, primarily reflecting an increase in our fixed maturity securities portfolio in 2010. The increase in our fixed maturity securities portfolio in 2010 was
primarily due to portfolio growth as a result of reinvestment of net investment income and a net increase in fair value primarily driven by a net decrease in interest rates, mainly from risk free rates.

The estimated changes in fair values of our financial assets
shown above relate primarily to assets invested to support our insurance liabilities, but do not include separate account assets associated with products for which investment risk is borne primarily by the separate account contractholders rather
than by us.

Market Risk Related to Equity
Prices

We actively manage investment equity
price risk against benchmarks in respective markets. We benchmark our return on equity holdings against a blend of market indices, mainly the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 for U.S. equities. For foreign equities we benchmark against the Tokyo Price
Index, or TOPIX, and the MSCI EAFE, a market index of European, Australian, and Far Eastern equities. We target price sensitivities that approximate those of the benchmark indices. We estimate our investment equity price risk from a hypothetical 10%
decline in equity benchmark market levels and measure this risk in terms of the decline in fair market value of equity securities we hold. Using this methodology, our estimated investment equity price risk as of December 31, 2010 was $922
million, representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of equity securities we held at that date from $9.217 billion to $8.295 billion. Our estimated investment equity price risk using this methodology as of



December 31, 2009 was $809 million, representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of equity securities we held at that date from $8.091 billion to $7.282 billion. In calculating
these amounts, we exclude separate account equity securities related to products for which the investment risk is borne primarily by the separate account contractholder rather than by us.

In addition to equity securities, as indicated above, we hold equity-based derivatives primarily to hedge the
equity price risk embedded in the living benefit features in some of our variable annuity products, as well as part of our capital hedging program described further below. As of December 31, 2010, our equity-based derivatives had notional
values of $26.004 billion, and were reported at fair value as a $353 million asset, and the living benefit features accounted for as embedded derivatives were reported at fair value as a $204 million asset. As of December 31, 2009, our
equity-based derivatives had notional values of $7.126 billion, and were reported at fair value as a $532 million asset, and the living benefits features accounted for as embedded derivatives were reported at fair value as a $55 million liability.
Our estimated equity price risk associated with living benefit features accounted for as embedded derivatives, net of the related equity-based derivatives used in our living benefits hedging program, was a $87 million benefit as of December 31,
2010 and a $61 million benefit as of December 31, 2009, estimated based on a hypothetical 10% decline in equity benchmark market levels. The higher sensitivity level as of December 31, 2010 primarily reflects the impact of our own risk of
non-performance on the embedded derivative liabilities, which does not have an offsetting impact on the hedge assets. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the impact of our own risk of non-performance on
the valuation of the living benefit features accounted for as embedded derivatives. In addition, we expanded our hedging program in the second quarter of 2009 to include a portion of the market exposure related to the overall capital position of our
variable annuity business, including the impact of certain statutory reserve exposures. These capital hedges primarily consisted of equity-based total return swaps that were designed to partially offset changes in our capital position resulting from
market driven changes in certain living and death benefit features of our variable annuity products. Our estimated equity price risk associated with these capital hedges as of December 31, 2009 was a $104 million benefit, estimated based on a
hypothetical 10% decline in equity benchmark market levels, which would partially offset an overall decline in our capital position related to the equity market decline. In 2010, we changed the focus of our capital hedge program for the equity price
risk associated with our variable annuities business to a broader view of equity market exposure of the statutory capital of the Company as a whole. In the second quarter of 2010, we removed the equity component of our capital hedge within the
Individual Annuities segment and entered into equity index-linked derivative transactions that are designed to mitigate the impact on statutory capital of a severe equity market stress event. The program now focuses on tail risk rather than general
equity market declines in order to protect our capital in a more cost-effective manner under stress scenarios. We continue to assess the composition of our hedging program on an ongoing basis, and we may change it from time to time based on our
evaluation of the Company’s risk position or other factors. Our estimated equity price risk associated with these capital hedges as of December 31, 2010 was a $3 million benefit, estimated based on a hypothetical 10% decline in equity
benchmark market levels, which would partially offset an overall decline in our capital position related to the equity market decline.

While these scenarios are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect our expectations regarding future performance of equity
markets or of our equity portfolio, they represent near term reasonably possible hypothetical changes that illustrate the potential impact of such events. These scenarios consider only the direct impact on fair value of declines in equity benchmark
market levels and not changes in asset-based fees recognized as revenue, changes in our estimates of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs, or changes in any other assumptions such as market
volatility or mortality, utilization or persistency rates in our variable annuity contracts that could also impact the fair value of our living benefit features. In addition, these scenarios do not reflect the impact of basis risk, such as potential
differences in the performance of the investment funds underlying the variable annuity products relative to the market indices we use as a basis for developing our hedging strategy. The impact of basis risk could result in larger differences between
the change in fair value of the equity-based derivatives and the related living benefit features, in comparison to the scenarios above.



Market Risk Related to Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in our
domestic general account investment portfolios, other proprietary investment portfolios and through our operations in foreign countries and foreign currency liability issuances.

Our exposure to foreign currency risk within the domestic
general account investment portfolios supporting our U.S. insurance operations and other domestic proprietary investment portfolios arises primarily from investments that are denominated in foreign currencies. We generally hedge substantially all
domestic general account foreign currency-denominated fixed-income investments and other domestic proprietary foreign currency investments into U.S. dollars in order to mitigate the risk that the cash flows or fair value of these investments
fluctuates as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We generally do not hedge all of the foreign currency risk of our investments in equity securities of unaffiliated foreign entities.

Our operations in foreign countries create the following
three additional sources of foreign currency risk:

•

First, we reflect the operating results of our foreign operations in our financial statements based on the average exchange rates prevailing during the
period. We hedge some of these foreign currency operating results as part of our overall risk management strategy. We generally hedge our anticipated exposure to adjusted operating income fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency
exchange rates relating to our International operations primarily in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Europe.

•

Second, we translate our equity investment in foreign operations into U.S. dollars using the foreign currency exchange rate at the financial statement
period-end date. For our equity investments in our Japanese and Taiwanese operations, we generally hedge this exposure through a combination of issuing foreign denominated liabilities outside these operations and by holding U.S. dollar denominated
securities in the investment portfolios of these operations.

•

Third, our international insurance operations may hold investments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of those operations on
an unhedged basis in addition to the aforementioned equity hedges resulting from foreign subsidiaries’ investing in U.S. dollar denominated investments. Most significantly, our Japanese operations hold U.S. dollar denominated investments in
their investment portfolios in excess of our equity investment in such operations. For a discussion of our Japanese operations’ U.S. dollar denominated investment holdings, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—General Account Investments—Portfolio Composition,” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations —Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—International Insurance and Investments Division.”

We manage our investment foreign currency exchange rate risks, described above, within specified limits.
Foreign currency exchange risks for our domestic general account investment portfolio and the unhedged portion of our equity investment in foreign subsidiaries are managed using VaR-based analysis. This statistical technique estimates, at a
specified confidence level, the potential pre-tax loss in portfolio market value that could occur over an assumed time horizon due to adverse market movements.

The estimated VaR as of December 31, 2010 for foreign currency exchange risks in our domestic general account portfolio and the
unhedged portion of equity investment in foreign subsidiaries, measured at a 95% confidence level and using a one-month time horizon, was $133 million, representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of these foreign currency assets from
$3.491 billion to $3.358 billion. The estimated VaR as of December 31, 2009 for foreign currency exchange risks in our domestic general account portfolio and the unhedged portion of equity investment in foreign subsidiaries, measured at a 95%
confidence level and using a one-month time horizon, was $95 million, representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of these foreign currency assets from $3.188 billion to $3.093 billion. The estimated one-month VaR as of
December 31, 2010 increased driven by a reduction in our hedging activities related to our equity investment in foreign subsidiaries, primarily related to our Korean insurance subsidiary, and a higher level of exchange rate volatility
experience during 2010. The average VaR for foreign currency exchange risks in our domestic general account portfolio and the unhedged portion of equity investment in foreign subsidiaries, measured monthly at a 95%



confidence level over a one month time horizon, was $125 million during 2010 and $114 million during 2009. The average one-month VaR for 2010 increased in comparison to 2009 due to the reduction
in hedging activities discussed above and the higher level of exchange rate volatility experience during 2010. These calculations use historical price volatilities and correlation data at a 95% confidence level. We discuss limitations of VaR models
below.

The estimated VaR for instruments used to
hedge our anticipated exposure to adjusted operating income fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our International operations, measured at a 95% confidence level and using a one-month time horizon, was
$134 million as of December 31, 2010 and $129 million as of December 31, 2009. The increased VaR for foreign currency exchange risks primarily reflects increased volatility in exchange rates for Japanese yen and Korean won.

Derivatives

Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are
derived from interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial indices, or the prices of securities or commodities. Derivative financial instruments may be exchange-traded or contracted in the over-the-counter market and include swaps,
futures, options and forward contracts. We are also a party to financial instruments that may contain derivative instruments that are embedded in the financial instruments. We are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by
counterparties to financial derivative transactions. We manage credit risk by entering into derivative transactions with major international financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties, and by obtaining collateral where appropriate.
Additionally, limits are set on single party credit exposures which are subject to periodic management review. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our derivative activities and credit risk as of
December 31, 2010 and 2009. Under insurance statutes, our insurance companies may use derivative financial instruments to hedge actual or anticipated changes in their assets or liabilities, to replicate cash market instruments or for certain
income-generating activities. These statutes generally prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. We use derivative financial instruments primarily to seek to reduce market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency
exchange rates, as well as equity prices, and to alter interest rate or foreign currency exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities. In addition, we use derivative financial instruments to mitigate risk associated with some of
our benefit features of our variable annuity contracts. The notional amount of derivative instruments increased $43 billion in 2010, from $137 billion as of December 31, 2009 to $180 billion as of December 31, 2010, driven by an increase
in interest rate derivatives, primarily related to our variable annuity hedging activities, and an increase in investment-only, fee-based stable value products sold in our retirement segment, which are accounted for as derivatives, as well as an
increase in equity-based derivatives related to our capital hedge program.

We use credit derivatives to enhance the return on our investment portfolio by creating credit exposure similar to an investment in public fixed maturity cash instruments, and purchase credit protection
using credit derivatives in order to hedge specific credit exposures in our investment portfolio. For additional information regarding our exposure to credit derivatives, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—General Account Investments—Fixed Maturity Securities—Credit Derivative Exposure to Public Fixed Maturities.”

Trading Activities

We engage in trading activities primarily in connection with
our derivatives trading operations. We maintain trading positions in various foreign exchange instruments and commodities, primarily to facilitate transactions for our clients. Market risk affects the values of our trading positions through
fluctuations in absolute or relative interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, securities and commodity prices. We seek to use security positions and forwards, futures, options and other derivatives to limit exposure to interest rate and
other market risks. We also trade derivative financial instruments that allow our clients to manage exposure to interest rate, currency and other market risks. Our derivative transactions involve both exchange-listed and over-the-counter contracts
and are generally short-term in duration. We act both as a broker, buying and selling exchange-listed contracts for our customers, and as a dealer, by entering into futures and security transactions as a principal. As a broker, we assume
counterparty and credit risks that we seek to mitigate by using margin or other credit enhancements and by establishing trading limits and credit lines. As a dealer, we are subject to market risk as



well as counterparty and credit risk. We manage the market risk associated with trading activities through hedging activities and formal policies, risk and position limits, counterparty and
credit limits, daily position monitoring, and other forms of risk management.

Value-at-Risk

VaR is one of the tools we use to monitor and manage our exposure to the market risk of our trading activities. We calculate a VaR that encompasses our trading activities using a 95% confidence level. The
VaR method incorporates the risk factors to which the market value of our trading activities is exposed, which consist of interest rates, including credit spreads, foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity prices, estimates of volatilities from
historical data, the sensitivity of our trading activities to changes in those market factors and the correlations of those factors. The total VaR for our trading activities, which considers our combined exposure to interest rate risk, foreign
currency exchange rate risk, and commodities price risk, expressed in terms of adverse changes to fair value at a 95% confidence level over a one-day time horizon, was $1 million as of December 31, 2010 and $2 million as of December 31,
2009. The largest component of this total VaR as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 was related to commodities price risk. The total average daily VaR for our trading activities considering our exposure to interest rate risk, foreign currency
exchange rate risk, and commodities price risk, expressed in terms of adverse changes to fair value with a 95% confidence level over a one-day time horizon, was $1 million during both 2010 and 2009. The largest component of both periods’ total
average daily VaR was related to commodities price risk.

Limitations of VaR Models

Although VaR models are a recognized tool for risk management, they have inherent limitations, including reliance on historical data that
may not be indicative of future market conditions or trading patterns. Accordingly, VaR models should not be viewed as a predictor of future results. We may incur losses that could be materially in excess of the amounts indicated by the models on a
particular trading day or over a period of time, and there have been instances when results have fallen outside the values generated by our VaR models. A VaR model does not estimate the greatest possible loss. The results of these models and
analysis thereof are subject to the judgment of our risk management personnel.



ITEM 8.    FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INDEX



Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

Management of Prudential
Financial, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness, as of
December 31, 2010, of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, based on the framework established

in Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). Based on our assessment under that framework, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010.

Our internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed by or under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
transactions and dispositions of assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing herein.

February 25, 2011



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of

Prudential Financial, Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Prudential Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under
Item 15.2 present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, listed in the accompanying index. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement
schedules, and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,
and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Our
audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. The accompanying supplemental combining financial information is presented for the purposes of additional analysis of the
consolidated financial statements rather than to present the financial position and results of operations of the individual components. Such supplemental information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the
consolidated financial statements and, in our opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

As described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial
statements, on January 1, 2009, the Company changed its method of determining and recording other-than-temporary impairment for debt securities, of presenting non-controlling interests, of accounting for certain convertible debt instruments,
and of reflecting certain unvested share-based payments awards in computing earnings per share.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance

1.    BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Prudential Financial, Inc. (“Prudential Financial”) and its subsidiaries (collectively,
“Prudential” or the “Company”) provide a wide range of insurance, investment management, and other financial products and services to both individual and institutional customers throughout the United States and in many other
countries. Principal products and services provided include life insurance, annuities, retirement-related services, mutual funds, investment management, and real estate services. The Company has organized its principal operations into the Financial
Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. The Financial Services Businesses operate through three operating divisions: U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management, U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance, and International
Insurance and Investments. The Company’s real estate and relocation services business as well as businesses that are not sufficiently material to warrant separate disclosure and divested businesses, are included in Corporate and Other
operations within the Financial Services Businesses. The Closed Block Business, which includes the Closed Block (see Note 12), is managed separately from the Financial Services Businesses. The Closed Block Business was established on the date of
demutualization and includes the Company’s in force participating insurance and annuity products and assets that are used for the payment of benefits and policyholders’ dividends on these products, as well as other assets and equity that
support these products and related liabilities. In connection with the demutualization, the Company ceased offering these participating products.

Demutualization

On December 18, 2001 (the “date of demutualization”), The Prudential Insurance Company of America (“Prudential
Insurance”) converted from a mutual life insurance company to a stock life insurance company and became an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial. At the time of demutualization Prudential Financial issued two classes of
common stock, both of which remain outstanding. The Common Stock, which is publicly traded, reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses, and the Class B Stock, which was issued through a private placement, reflects the performance
of the Closed Block Business.

Basis of Presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements
include the accounts of Prudential Financial, entities over which the Company exercises control, including majority-owned subsidiaries and minority-owned entities such as limited partnerships in which the Company is the general partner, and variable
interest entities in which the Company is considered the primary beneficiary. See Note 5 for more information on the Company’s consolidated variable interest entities. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

The Company’s Gibraltar Life Insurance Company, Ltd. (“Gibraltar Life”) consolidated operations use a November 30
fiscal year end for purposes of inclusion in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2010, and 2009, include Gibraltar Life’s assets and liabilities as of
November 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, include Gibraltar Life’s results of operations for the twelve months ended November 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

1.    BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

(continued)

The most significant estimates include those used in determining deferred policy
acquisition costs and related amortization; valuation of business acquired and its amortization; amortization of sales inducements; measurement of goodwill and any related impairment; valuation of investments including derivatives and the
recognition of other-than-temporary impairments; future policy benefits including guarantees; pension and other postretirement benefits; provision for income taxes and valuation of deferred tax assets; and reserves for contingent liabilities,
including reserves for losses in connection with unresolved legal matters.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRONOUNCEMENTS

Share-Based Payments

The Company recognizes the cost resulting from all
share-based payments in accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for stock based compensation and applies the fair value based measurement method in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees except for equity
instruments held by employee share ownership plans. The Company accounts for excess tax benefits in additional paid-in capital as a single “pool” available to all share-based compensation awards. The Company does not recognize excess tax
benefits in additional paid-in capital until the benefits result in a reduction in taxes payable. The Company has elected the “tax-law ordering methodology” and has adopted a convention that considers excess tax benefits to be the last
portion of a net operating loss carryforward to be utilized.

The Company accounts for non-employee stock options using the fair value method in accordance with authoritative guidance and related interpretations on accounting for equity instruments that are issued
to other than employees for acquiring, or in conjunction with selling, goods or services.

Earnings Per Share

As discussed in Note 1, the Company has outstanding two separate classes of common stock. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing available income attributable to each of the two groups of common
shareholders by the respective weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share includes the effect of all dilutive potential common shares that were outstanding during the period.

As discussed under “Share-Based Payments” above,
the Company accounts for excess tax benefits in additional paid-in capital as a single “pool” available to all share-based compensation awards. The Company reflects in assumed proceeds, based on application of the treasury stock method,
the excess tax benefits that would be recognized in additional paid-in capital upon exercise or release of the award.

Investments and Investment-Related Liabilities

The Company’s principal investments are fixed maturities; trading account assets; equity securities; commercial mortgage and other
loans; policy loans; other long-term investments, including joint ventures (other than operating joint ventures), limited partnerships, and real estate; and short-term investments. Investments and investment-related liabilities also include
securities repurchase and resale agreements and securities lending transactions. The accounting policies related to each are as follows:

Fixed maturities are comprised of bonds, notes and redeemable preferred stock. Fixed maturities classified as “available for
sale” are carried at fair value. See Note 20 for additional information regarding the



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRONOUNCEMENTS

(continued)

determination of fair value. Fixed maturities that the Company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as “held to
maturity.” The amortized cost of fixed maturities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Interest income, as well as the related amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is included in
“Net investment income” under the effective yield method. For mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, the effective yield is based on estimated cash flows, including prepayment assumptions based on data from widely accepted
third-party data sources or internal estimates. In addition to prepayment assumptions, cash flow estimates vary based on assumptions regarding the underlying collateral, including default rates and changes in value. These assumptions can
significantly impact income recognition and the amount of other-than-temporary impairments recognized in earnings and other comprehensive income. For high credit quality mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities (those rated AA or above), cash
flows are provided quarterly, and the amortized cost and effective yield of the security are adjusted as necessary to reflect historical prepayment experience and changes in estimated future prepayments. The adjustments to amortized cost are
recorded as a charge or credit to net investment income in accordance with the retrospective method. For asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities rated below AA, the effective yield is adjusted prospectively for any changes in estimated cash
flows. See the discussion below on realized investment gains and losses for a description of the accounting for impairments, as well as the impact of the Company’s adoption on January 1, 2009 of new authoritative guidance for the
recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments for debt securities. Unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities classified as “available for sale,” net of tax, and the effect on deferred policy acquisition costs,
valuation of business acquired, deferred sales inducements, future policy benefits and policyholders’ dividends that would result from the realization of unrealized gains and losses, are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss).”

“Trading account assets
supporting insurance liabilities, at fair value” includes invested assets that support certain products included in the Retirement segment, as well as certain products included in the International Insurance segment, which are experience rated,
meaning that the investment results associated with these products are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. Realized and unrealized gains and losses for these investments are reported in “Asset management fees and other
income.” Interest and dividend income from these investments is reported in “Net investment income.”

“Other trading account assets, at fair value” consist primarily of investments and certain derivatives, including those used by
the Company in its capacity as a broker-dealer and derivative hedging positions used in a non-broker or non-dealer capacity primarily to hedge the risks related to certain products. These instruments are carried at fair value. Realized and
unrealized gains and losses on these investments and on derivatives used by the Company in its capacity as a broker-dealer are reported in “Asset management fees and other income.” Interest and dividend income from these investments
is reported in “Net investment income.”

Equity securities available for sale are comprised of common stock, mutual fund shares, non-redeemable preferred stock, and perpetual
preferred stock, and are carried at fair value. The associated unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, and the effect on deferred policy acquisition costs, valuation of business acquired, deferred sales inducements, future policy benefits and
policyholders’ dividends that would result from the realization of unrealized gains and losses, are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” The cost of equity securities is written down to fair value when a
decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary. See the discussion below on realized investment gains and losses for a description of the accounting for impairments. Dividends from these investments are recognized in “Net investment
income” when declared.

Commercial mortgage
and other loans consist of commercial mortgage loans, agricultural loans, loans backed by residential properties, as well as certain other collateralized and uncollateralized loans. Commercial mortgage loans are broken down by class which is based
on property type (industrial properties, retail, office, multi-family/apartment, hospitality, and other). Loans backed by residential properties primarily include recourse loans held by the Company’s international insurance businesses. Other
collateralized loans primarily include



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRONOUNCEMENTS

(continued)

senior loans made by the Company’s international insurance businesses and loans made to the Company’s real estate franchisees. Uncollateralized loans primarily represent reverse dual
currency loans and corporate loans held by the Company’s international insurance businesses.

Commercial mortgage and other loans originated and held for investment are generally carried at unpaid principal balance, net of an allowance for losses. Commercial mortgage loans originated within the
Company’s commercial mortgage operations include loans held for sale which are reported at the lower of cost or fair market value; loans held for investment which are reported at amortized cost net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees
and expenses; and loans reported at fair value under the fair value option. Commercial mortgage and other loans acquired, including those related to the acquisition of a business, are recorded at fair value when purchased, reflecting any premiums or
discounts to unpaid principal balances.

Interest
income, as well as prepayment fees and the amortization of the related premiums or discounts, related to commercial mortgage and other loans, are included in “Net investment income.”

Impaired loans include those loans for which it is probable that amounts due according to the contractual terms
of the loan agreement will not all be collected. The Company defines “past due” as principal or interest not collected at least 30 days past the scheduled contractual due date. Interest received on impaired loans, including loans that were
previously modified in a troubled debt restructuring, is either applied against the principal or reported as net investment income based on the Company’s assessment as to the collectability of the principal. See Note 4 for additional
information about the Company’s past due loans.

The Company discontinues accruing interest on impaired loans after the loans become 90 days delinquent as to principal or interest payments, or earlier when the Company has doubts about collectability.
When a loan is deemed to be impaired, any accrued but uncollectible interest on the impaired loan and other loans backed by the same collateral, if any, is charged to interest income in the period the loan is deemed to be impaired. Generally, a loan
is restored to accrual status only after all delinquent interest and principal are brought current and, in the case of loans where the payment of interest has been interrupted for a substantial period, a regular payment performance has been
established.

The Company reviews the performance
and credit quality of the commercial mortgage and other loan portfolio on an on-going basis. Loans are placed on watch list status based on a predefined set of criteria and are assigned one of three categories. Loans are placed on “early
warning” status in cases where, based on the Company’s analysis of the loan’s collateral, the financial situation of the borrower or tenants or other market factors, it is believed a loss of principal or interest could occur. Loans
are classified as “closely monitored” when it is determined that there is a collateral deficiency or other credit events that may lead to a potential loss of principal or interest. Loans “not in good standing” are those loans
where the Company has concluded that there is a high probability of loss of principal, such as when the loan is delinquent or in the process of foreclosure. As described below, in determining our allowance for losses, the Company evaluates each loan
on the watch list to determine if it is probable that amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected.

Loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios are measures commonly used to assess the quality of commercial mortgage loans. The
loan-to-value ratio compares the amount of the loan to the fair value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan, and is commonly expressed as a percentage. Loan-to-value ratios greater than 100% indicate that the loan amount exceeds the
collateral value. A smaller loan-to-value ratio indicates a greater excess of collateral value over the loan amount. The debt service coverage ratio compares a property’s net operating income to its debt service payments. Debt service coverage
ratios less than 1.0 times indicate that property operations do not generate enough income to cover the loan’s current debt payments. A larger debt service coverage ratio indicates a greater excess of net operating income over the debt service



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRONOUNCEMENTS

(continued)

payments. The values utilized in calculating these ratios are developed as part of the Company’s periodic review of the commercial mortgage loan and agricultural loan portfolio, which
includes an internal appraisal of the underlying collateral value. The Company’s periodic review also includes a quality re-rating process, whereby the internal quality rating originally assigned at underwriting is updated based on current
loan, property and market information using a proprietary quality rating system. The loan-to-value ratio is the most significant of several inputs used to establish the internal credit rating of a loan which in turn drives the allowance for losses.
Other key factors considered in determining the internal credit rating include debt service coverage ratios, amortization, loan term, estimated market value growth rate and volatility for the property type and region. See Note 4 for additional
information related to the loan-to-value ratios and debt service coverage ratios related to the Company’s commercial mortgage and agricultural loan portfolios.

Loans backed by residential properties, other collateralized
loans, and uncollateralized loans are also reviewed periodically. Each loan is assigned an internal or external credit rating. Internal credit ratings take into consideration various factors including financial ratios and qualitative assessments
based on non-financial information. In cases where there are personal or third party guarantors, the credit quality of the guarantor is also reviewed. These factors are used in developing the allowance for losses. Based on the diversity of the loans
in these categories and their immateriality, the Company has not disclosed the credit quality indicators related to these loans in Note 4.

For those loans not reported at fair value, the allowance for losses includes a loan specific reserve for each impaired loan that has a
specifically identified loss and a portfolio reserve for probable incurred but not specifically identified losses. For impaired commercial mortgage and other loans the allowances for losses are determined based on the present value of expected
future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or based upon the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The portfolio reserves for probable incurred but not specifically identified losses in the
commercial mortgage and agricultural loan portfolio segments considers the current credit composition of the portfolio based on an internal quality rating, (as described above). The portfolio reserves are determined using past loan experience,
including historical credit migration, default probability and loss severity factors by property type. Historical credit migration, default and loss severity factors are updated each quarter based on the Company’s actual loan experience, and
are considered together with other relevant qualitative factors in making the final portfolio reserve calculations.

The allowance for losses on commercial mortgage and other loans can increase or decrease from period to period based on the factors noted
above. “Realized investment gains (losses), net” includes changes in the allowance for losses and changes in value for loans accounted for under the fair value option. “Realized investment gains (losses), net” also includes gains
and losses on sales, certain restructurings, and foreclosures.

When a commercial mortgage or other loan is deemed to be uncollectible, any specific valuation allowance associated with the loan is reversed and a direct write down to the carrying amount of the loan is
made. The carrying amount of the loan is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in value.

Policy loans are carried at unpaid principal balances. Interest income on policy loans is recognized in net investment income at the contract interest rate when earned. Policy loans are fully
collateralized by the cash surrender value of the associated insurance policies.

Securities repurchase and resale agreements and securities loaned transactions are used to earn spread income, to borrow funds, or to facilitate trading activity. Securities repurchase and resale
agreements are generally short-term in nature, and therefore, the carrying amounts of these instruments approximate fair value. As part of securities repurchase agreements or securities loaned transactions, the Company transfers either corporate
debt securities, or U.S. government and government agency securities and receives cash as collateral. As part of securities resale agreements, the Company transfers cash as collateral and receives U.S. government



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRONOUNCEMENTS

(continued)

securities. For securities repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions used to earn spread income, the cash received is typically invested in cash equivalents, short-term investments
or fixed maturities.

Securities repurchase and
resale agreements that satisfy certain criteria are treated as collateralized financing arrangements. These agreements are carried at the amounts at which the securities will be subsequently resold or reacquired, as specified in the respective
agreements. For securities purchased under agreements to resell, the Company’s policy is to take possession or control of the securities and to value the securities daily. Securities to be resold are the same, or substantially the same, as the
securities received. For securities sold under agreements to repurchase, the market value of the securities to be repurchased is monitored, and additional collateral is obtained where appropriate, to protect against credit exposure. Securities to be
repurchased are the same, or substantially the same, as those sold. Income and expenses related to these transactions executed within the insurance companies and broker-dealer subsidiaries used to earn spread income are reported as “Net
investment income;” however, for transactions used to borrow funds, the associated borrowing cost is reported as interest expense (included in “General and administrative expenses”). Income and expenses related to these transactions
executed within the Company’s derivative dealer operations are reported in “Asset management fees and other income.”

Securities loaned transactions are treated as financing arrangements and are recorded at the amount of cash received. The Company obtains
collateral in an amount equal to 102% and 105% of the fair value of the domestic and foreign securities, respectively. The Company monitors the market value of the securities loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained as necessary.
Substantially all of the Company’s securities loaned transactions are with large brokerage firms. Income and expenses associated with securities loaned transactions used to earn spread income are reported as “Net investment income;”
however, for securities loaned transactions used for funding purposes the associated rebate is reported as interest expense (included in “General and administrative expenses”).

Other long-term investments consist of the Company’s investments in joint ventures and limited
partnerships, other than operating joint ventures, as well as wholly-owned investment real estate and other investments. Joint venture and partnership interests are generally accounted for using the equity method of accounting. In certain instances
in which the Company’s partnership interest is so minor (generally less than 3%) that it exercises virtually no influence over operating and financial policies, the Company applies the cost method of accounting. The Company’s income from
investments in joint ventures and partnerships accounted for using the equity method or the cost method, other than the Company’s investment in operating joint ventures, is included in “Net investment income.” The carrying value of
these investments is written down, or impaired, to fair value when a decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary. In applying the equity method or the cost method (including assessment for other-than-temporary impairment), the Company
uses financial information provided by the investee, which is generally received on a one quarter lag. The Company consolidates joint ventures and limited partnerships in certain other instances where it is deemed to exercise control, or is
considered the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. Certain of these consolidated joint ventures and limited partnerships relate to investment structures in which the Company’s asset management business invests with other
co-investors in an investment fund referred to as a feeder fund. In these structures, the invested capital of several feeder funds is pooled together and used to purchase ownership interests in another fund, referred to as a master fund. The master
fund utilizes this invested capital, and in certain cases other debt financing, to purchase various classes of assets on behalf of its investors. Specialized industry accounting for investment companies calls for the feeder fund to reflect its
investment in the master fund as a single net asset equal to its proportionate share of the net assets of the master fund, regardless of its level of interest in the master fund. In cases where the Company consolidates the feeder fund, it retains
the feeder fund’s net asset presentation and reports the consolidated feeder fund’s proportionate share of the net assets of the master fund in “Other long-term investments,” with any unaffiliated investors’ noncontrolling
interest in the feeder fund reported in “Other liabilities” or “Noncontrolling interests.” The Company’s net income from consolidated joint ventures and



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRONOUNCEMENTS

(continued)

limited partnerships, including these consolidated feeder funds, is included in the respective revenue and expense line items depending on the activity of the consolidated entity.

The Company’s wholly-owned investment real estate
consists of real estate which the Company has the intent to hold for the production of income as well as real estate held for sale. Real estate which the Company has the intent to hold for the production of income is carried at depreciated cost less
any writedowns to fair value for impairment losses and is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Real estate held for sale is carried at the lower of depreciated cost or fair
value less estimated selling costs and is not further depreciated once classified as such. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value of the investment real estate exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows (excluding
interest charges) from the investment. At that time, the carrying value of the investment real estate is written down to fair value. Decreases in the carrying value of investment real estate held for the production of income due to
other-than-temporary impairments are recorded in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” Depreciation on real estate held for the production of income is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the
properties, and is included in “Net investment income.” In the period a real estate investment is deemed held for sale and meets all of the discontinued operation criteria, the Company reports all related net investment income and any
resulting investment gains and losses as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Short-term investments primarily consist of highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity of greater than three months and less than twelve months when purchased, other than those debt instruments
meeting this definition that are included in “Trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities, at fair value.” These investments are generally carried at fair value and include certain money market investments, short-term debt
securities issued by government sponsored entities and other highly liquid debt instruments. Short-term investments held in our broker-dealer operations are marked-to-market through “Asset management fees and other income.”

Realized investment gains (losses) are computed using the
specific identification method with the exception of some of the Company’s International Insurance businesses’ portfolios, where the average cost method is used. Realized investment gains and losses are generated from numerous sources,
including the sale of fixed maturity securities, equity securities, investments in joint ventures and limited partnerships and other types of investments, as well as adjustments to the cost basis of investments for net other-than-temporary
impairments recognized in earnings. Realized investment gains and losses are also generated from prepayment premiums received on private fixed maturity securities, recoveries of principal on previously impaired securities, allowance for losses on
commercial mortgage and other loans, fair value changes on commercial mortgage loans carried at fair value, and fair value changes on embedded derivatives and free-standing derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, except those
derivatives used in the Company’s capacity as a broker or dealer.

The Company’s available for sale and held to maturity securities with unrealized losses are reviewed quarterly to identify other-than-temporary impairments in value. In evaluating whether a decline
in value is other-than-temporary, the Company considers several factors including, but not limited to the following: (1) the extent and the duration of the decline; (2) the reasons for the decline in value (credit event, currency or
interest-rate related, including general credit spread widening); and (3) the financial condition of and near-term prospects of the issuer. With regard to available for sale equity securities, the Company also considers the ability and intent
to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value. When it is determined that a decline in value of an equity security is other-than-temporary, the carrying value of the equity security is reduced to its fair value, with a
corresponding charge to earnings.

In addition, in
April 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) revised the authoritative guidance for the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments for debt securities. The



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRONOUNCEMENTS

(continued)

Company early adopted this guidance on January 1, 2009. Prior to the adoption of this guidance the Company was required to record an other-than-temporary impairment for a debt security
unless it could assert that it had both the intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in its fair value to its amortized cost basis. The revised guidance indicates that an other-than-temporary
impairment must be recognized in earnings for a debt security in an unrealized loss position when an entity either (a) has the intent to sell the debt security or (b) more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before
its anticipated recovery. For all debt securities in unrealized loss positions that do not meet either of these two criteria, the guidance requires that the Company analyze its ability to recover the amortized cost by comparing the net present value
of projected future cash flows with the amortized cost of the security. The net present value is calculated by discounting the Company’s best estimate of projected future cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the debt security
prior to impairment. The Company may use the estimated fair value of collateral as a proxy for the net present value if it believes that the security is dependent on the liquidation of collateral for recovery of its investment. If the net present
value is less than the amortized cost of the investment, an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. In addition to the above mentioned circumstances, the Company also recognizes an other-than-temporary impairment in earnings when a foreign
currency denominated security in an unrealized loss position approaches maturity.

Under the authoritative guidance for the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments, when an other-than-temporary impairment of a debt security has occurred, the amount of the
other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings depends on whether the Company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If the debt security meets
either of these two criteria or the foreign currency loss is not expected to be recovered before maturity, the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings is equal to the entire difference between the security’s amortized cost basis
and its fair value at the impairment measurement date. For other-than-temporary impairments of debt securities that do not meet these criteria, the net amount recognized in earnings is equal to the difference between the amortized cost of the debt
security and its net present value calculated as described above. Any difference between the fair value and the net present value of the debt security at the impairment measurement date is recorded in “Other comprehensive income (loss).”
Unrealized gains or losses on securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment has been recognized in earnings is tracked as a separate component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” Prior to the adoption of this
guidance in 2009, an other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings for debt securities was equal to the total difference between amortized cost and fair value at the time of impairment.

For debt securities, the split between the amount of an
other-than-temporary impairment recognized in other comprehensive income and the net amount recognized in earnings is driven principally by assumptions regarding the amount and timing of projected cash flows. For mortgage-backed and asset-backed
securities, cash flow estimates consider the payment terms of the underlying assets backing a particular security, including prepayment assumptions, and are based on data from widely accepted third-party data sources or internal estimates. In
addition to prepayment assumptions, cash flow estimates include assumptions regarding the underlying collateral including default rates and recoveries, which vary based on the asset type and geographic location, as well as the vintage year of the
security. For structured securities, the payment priority within the tranche structure is also considered. For all other debt securities, cash flow estimates are driven by assumptions regarding probability of default and estimates regarding timing
and amount of recoveries associated with a default. The Company has developed these estimates using information based on its historical experience as well as using market observable data, such as industry analyst reports and forecasts, sector credit
ratings and other data relevant to the collectability of a security, such as the general payment terms of the security and the security’s position within the capital structure of the issuer.

The new cost basis of an impaired security is not adjusted
for subsequent increases in estimated fair value. In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment, the impaired security is accounted for as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of the impairment. For debt
securities, the

(continued)

discount (or reduced premium) based on the new cost basis may be accreted into net investment income in future periods, including increases in cash flow on a prospective basis.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due
from banks, certain money market investments and other debt instruments with maturities of three months or less when purchased, other than cash equivalents that are included in “Trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities, at fair
value.”

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs

Costs that vary with and that are
related primarily to the production of new insurance and annuity business are deferred to the extent such costs are deemed recoverable from future profits. Such deferred policy acquisition costs (“DAC”) include commissions, costs of policy
issuance and underwriting, and variable field office expenses that are incurred in producing new business. In each reporting period, capitalized DAC is amortized to “Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs,” net of the accrual of
imputed interest on DAC balances. DAC is subject to recoverability testing at the end of each reporting period to ensure that the balance does not exceed the present value of anticipated gross profits, anticipated gross margins, or premiums less
benefits and maintenance expenses, as applicable. DAC, for applicable products, is adjusted for the impact of unrealized gains or losses on investments as if these gains or losses had been realized, with corresponding credits or charges included in
“Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).”

For traditional participating life insurance included in the Closed Block, DAC is amortized over the expected life of the contracts (up to 45 years) in proportion to gross margins based on historical and
anticipated future experience, which is evaluated regularly. The effect of changes in estimated gross margins on unamortized deferred acquisition costs is reflected in “Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs” in the period such
estimated gross margins are revised. Policy acquisition costs related to interest-sensitive and variable life products and fixed and variable deferred annuity products are deferred and amortized over the expected life of the contracts (periods
ranging from 25 to 99 years) in proportion to gross profits arising principally from investment results, mortality and expense margins, and surrender charges, based on historical and anticipated future experience, which is updated periodically. The
Company uses a reversion to the mean approach to derive the future rate of return assumptions. However, if the projected future rate of return calculated using this approach is greater than the maximum future rate of return assumption, the maximum
future rate of return is utilized. In addition to the gross profit components previously mentioned, we also include the impact of the embedded derivatives associated with certain optional living benefit features of the Company’s variable
annuity contracts and related hedging activities in actual gross profits used as the basis for calculating current period amortization. The effect of changes to estimated gross profits on unamortized deferred acquisition costs is reflected in
“Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs” in the period such estimated gross profits are revised. DAC related to non-participating traditional individual life insurance is amortized in proportion to gross premiums.

For group annuity contracts, acquisition expenses are
deferred and amortized over the expected life of the contracts in proportion to gross profits. For group corporate-, bank- and trust-owned life insurance contracts, acquisition costs are deferred and amortized in proportion to lives insured. For
group and individual long-term care contracts, acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized in proportion to gross premiums. For single premium immediate annuities with life contingencies, and single premium group annuities and single premium
structured settlements with life contingencies, all acquisition costs are charged to expense immediately because generally all premiums are received at the inception of the contract. For funding agreement notes contracts, single premium structured
settlement contracts without life contingencies, and single premium immediate annuities without life contingencies, acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the expected life of the contracts using the interest method. For other group
life and disability insurance contracts and guaranteed investment contracts, acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.

For some products, policyholders can elect to modify product benefits, features, rights
or coverages by exchanging a contract for a new contract or by amendment, endorsement, or rider to a contract, or by the election of a feature or coverage within a contract. These transactions are known as internal replacements. If policyholders
surrender traditional life insurance policies in exchange for life insurance policies that do not have fixed and guaranteed terms, the Company immediately charges to expense the remaining unamortized DAC on the surrendered policies. For other
internal replacement transactions, except those that involve the addition of a nonintegrated contract feature that does not change the existing base contract, the unamortized DAC is immediately charged to expense if the terms of the new policies are
not substantially similar to those of the former policies. If the new terms are substantially similar to those of the earlier policies, the DAC is retained with respect to the new policies and amortized over the expected life of the new policies.

Separate Account Assets and Liabilities

Separate account assets are reported at fair value and
represent segregated funds that are invested for certain policyholders, pension funds and other customers. The assets consist primarily of equity securities, fixed maturities, real estate related investments, real estate mortgage loans, short-term
investments and derivative instruments. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are generally not subject to claims that arise out of any other business of the Company. Investment risks associated with market value changes are borne by
the customers, except to the extent of minimum guarantees made by the Company with respect to certain accounts. Separate account liabilities primarily represent the contractholder’s account balance in separate account assets and to a lesser
extent borrowings of the separate account. See Note 11 for additional information regarding separate account arrangements with contractual guarantees. The investment income and realized investment gains or losses from separate account assets
generally accrue to the policyholders and are not included in the Company’s results of operations. Mortality, policy administration and surrender charges assessed against the accounts are included in “Policy charges and fee income.”
Asset management fees charged to the accounts are included in “Asset management fees and other income.” Seed money that the Company invests in separate accounts is reported in the appropriate general account asset line. Investment income
and realized investment gains or losses from seed money invested in separate accounts accrues to the Company and is included in the Company’s results of operations.

Other Assets and Other Liabilities

Other assets consist primarily of prepaid pension benefit
costs, certain restricted assets, broker-dealer related receivables, trade receivables, valuation of business acquired, goodwill and other intangible assets, deferred sales inducements, the Company’s investments in operating joint ventures,
which include the Company’s indirect investment in China Pacific Insurance (Group) Co., Ltd. (“China Pacific Group”) and prior to its sale on December 31, 2009 included the Company’s investment in Wachovia Securities
Financial Holdings, LLC (“Wachovia Securities”), property and equipment, reinsurance recoverables, receivables resulting from sales of securities that had not yet settled at the balance sheet date, and relocation real estate assets and
receivables. Other liabilities consist primarily of trade payables, broker-dealer related payables, pension and other employee benefit liabilities, derivative liabilities, reinsurance payables, and payables resulting from purchases of securities
that had not yet settled at the balance sheet date.

Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is determined using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which generally range from 3 to 40 years.

(continued)

As a result of certain acquisitions and the application of purchase accounting, the
Company reports a financial asset representing the valuation of business acquired (“VOBA”). VOBA is determined by estimating the net present value of future cash flows from contracts in force in the acquired business at the date of
acquisition. VOBA includes an explicit adjustment to reflect the cost of capital invested in the business. VOBA balances are subject to recoverability testing, in the manner in which it was acquired, at the end of each reporting period to ensure
that the balance does not exceed the present value of anticipated gross profits. The Company has established a VOBA asset primarily for its acquired traditional life, deferred annuity, defined contribution and defined benefit businesses. For
acquired traditional insurance contracts, future positive cash flows generally include net premiums while future negative cash flows include policyholders’ benefits and certain maintenance expenses. For acquired annuity contracts, future
positive cash flows generally include fees and other charges assessed to the contracts as long as they remain in force as well as fees collected upon surrender, if applicable, while future negative cash flows include costs to administer contracts
and benefit payments. In addition, future cash flows with respect to acquired annuity business include the impact of future cash flows expected from the guaranteed minimum death and living benefit provisions, including the performance of hedging
programs for embedded derivatives. For acquired defined contribution and defined benefits businesses, contract balances are projected using assumptions for add-on deposits, participant withdrawals, contract surrenders, and investment returns. Gross
profits are then determined based on investment spreads and the excess of fees and other charges over the costs to administer the contracts. The Company amortizes VOBA over the effective life of the acquired contracts in “General and
administrative expenses.” For acquired traditional insurance contracts, VOBA is amortized in proportion to estimated gross premiums or in proportion to the face amount of insurance in force, as applicable. For acquired annuity contracts, VOBA
is amortized in proportion to estimated gross profits arising from the contracts and anticipated future experience, which is evaluated regularly. For acquired defined contribution and defined benefit businesses, the majority of VOBA is amortized in
proportion to estimated gross profits arising principally from investment spreads and fees in excess of actual expense based upon historical and estimated future experience, which is updated periodically. The remainder of VOBA is amortized based on
estimated gross revenues, fees, or the change in policyholders’ account balances, as applicable. The effect of changes in estimated gross profits on unamortized VOBA is reflected in the period such estimates of expected future profits are
revised. See Note 8 for additional information regarding VOBA.

As a result of certain acquisitions, the Company recognizes an asset for goodwill representing the excess of cost over the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is
assigned to reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially recorded. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a unit one level below the operating segment, if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management
at that level. Once goodwill has been assigned to reporting units, it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition, and all of the activities within a reporting unit, whether acquired or organically grown, are available to support
the value of the goodwill.

The Company tests
goodwill for impairment annually as of December 31 and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The goodwill impairment
analysis is a two-step test that is performed at the reporting unit level. The first step, used to identify potential impairment, involves comparing each reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value including goodwill. If the fair value of
a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the applicable goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, there is an indication of a potential impairment and the second step of the test is performed to measure
the amount of impairment.

The second step
involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated impairment. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business
combination, which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in the first step, over the aggregate fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired
in a business combination. If the implied fair



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRONOUNCEMENTS

(continued)

value of goodwill in the “pro forma” business combination accounting as described above exceeds the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the goodwill
assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded in “General and administrative expenses” for the excess. An impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill
assigned to a reporting unit, and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill. Subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted. Management is required to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of a reporting
unit including, but not limited to: projected earnings, comparative market multiples, and the risk rate at which future net cash flows are discounted.

See Note 9 for additional information regarding goodwill, including a discussion of impairments the Company recorded during 2008.

The Company offers various types of sales
inducements to policyholders related to fixed and variable deferred annuity contracts. The Company defers sales inducements and amortizes them over the anticipated life of the policy using the same methodology and assumptions used to amortize
deferred policy acquisition costs. Sales inducements balances are subject to recoverability testing at the end of each reporting period to ensure that the balance does not exceed the present value of anticipated gross profits. The Company records
amortization of deferred sales inducements in “Interest credited to policyholders’ account balances.” See Note 11 for additional information regarding sales inducements.

The majority of the Company’s reinsurance recoverables and payables are receivables and corresponding
payables associated with the reinsurance arrangements used to effect the Company’s acquisition of the retirement businesses of CIGNA. The remaining amounts relate to other reinsurance arrangements entered into by the Company. For each of its
reinsurance contracts, the Company determines if the contract provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The Company reviews all contractual features,
particularly those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims. See Note 13 for additional information about the Company’s reinsurance arrangements.

Identifiable intangible assets are recorded net
of accumulated amortization. The Company tests identifiable intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of December 31 of each year or whenever events or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an identifiable intangible
asset may exceed the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. If this condition exists and the carrying value of an identifiable intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the excess is recognized as
an impairment and is recorded as a charge against net income. Measuring intangibles requires the use of estimates. Significant estimates include the projected net cash flow attributable to the intangible asset and the risk rate at which future net
cash flows are discounted for purposes of estimating fair value, as applicable. Identifiable intangible assets primarily include customer relationships and mortgage servicing rights. See Note 9 for additional information regarding identifiable
intangible assets.

Investments in operating joint
ventures are generally accounted for under the equity method. The carrying value of these investments is written down, or impaired, to fair value when a decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary. The Company held an investment in
Wachovia Securities which was sold on December 31, 2009. See Note 7 for additional information on investments in operating joint ventures.

Future Policy Benefits

The Company’s liability for future policy benefits is primarily comprised of the present value of estimated future payments to or on
behalf of policyholders, where the timing and amount of payment depends on policyholder mortality or morbidity, less the present value of future net premiums. For individual traditional



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRONOUNCEMENTS

(continued)

participating life insurance products, the mortality and interest rate assumptions applied are those used to calculate the policies’ guaranteed cash surrender values. For life insurance,
other than individual traditional participating life insurance, and annuity and disability products, expected mortality and morbidity is generally based on the Company’s historical experience or standard industry tables including a provision
for the risk of adverse deviation. Interest rate assumptions are based on factors such as market conditions and expected investment returns. Although mortality and morbidity and interest rate assumptions are “locked-in” upon the issuance
of new insurance or annuity business with fixed and guaranteed terms, significant changes in experience or assumptions may require the Company to provide for expected future losses on a product by establishing premium deficiency reserves. Premium
deficiency reserves, if required, are determined based on assumptions at the time the premium deficiency reserve is established and do not include a provision for the risk of adverse deviation. See Note 10 for additional information regarding future
policy benefits.

The Company’s liability for
future policy benefits also includes a liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. The Company does not establish claim liabilities until a loss has occurred. However, unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses includes estimates of
claims that the Company believes have been incurred but have not yet been reported as of the balance sheet date. The Company’s liability for future policy benefits also includes net liabilities for guarantee benefits related to certain
nontraditional long-duration life and annuity contracts, which are discussed more fully in Note 11, and certain unearned revenues.

Policyholders’ Account Balances

The Company’s liability for policyholders’ account balances represents the contract value that has accrued to the benefit of the
policyholder as of the balance sheet date. This liability is generally equal to the accumulated account deposits, plus interest credited, less policyholder withdrawals and other charges assessed against the account balance. These policyholders’
account balances also include provision for benefits under non-life contingent payout annuities and certain unearned revenues. See Note 10 for additional information regarding policyholders’ account balances.

Policyholders’ Dividends

The Company’s liability for policyholders’
dividends includes its dividends payable to policyholders and its policyholder dividend obligation associated with the participating policies included in the Closed Block. The dividends payable for participating policies included in the Closed Block
are determined at the end of each year for the following year by the Board of Directors of Prudential Insurance based on its statutory results, capital position, ratings, and the emerging experience of the Closed Block. The policyholder dividend
obligation represents amounts to be paid to Closed Block policyholders as an additional policyholder dividend unless otherwise offset by future Closed Block performance that is less favorable than originally expected, the components of which are
discussed more fully in Note 12. The dividends payable for policies other than the participating policies included in the Closed Block include dividends payable in accordance with certain group and individual insurance policies and, as of
December 31, 2009, also included special dividends to certain policyholders of Gibraltar Life, a Japanese insurance company acquired in April 2001. The special dividends payable to the policyholders of Gibraltar Life were based on 70% of the
net increase in the fair value, through March 2009, of certain real estate and loans, net of transaction costs and taxes, included in the Gibraltar Life reorganization plan. The liability related to the special dividend was fully paid as of
June 30, 2010. As of December 31, 2009, this dividend liability was $151 million.

Contingent Liabilities

Amounts related to contingent liabilities are accrued if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount is reasonably estimable. Management evaluates whether there are incremental legal
or other costs directly associated with the ultimate resolution of the matter that are reasonably estimable and, if so, they are included in the accrual.

Insurance Revenue and Expense Recognition

Premiums from individual life products, other than
interest-sensitive life contracts, and health insurance and long-term care products are recognized when due. When premiums are due over a significantly shorter period than the period over which benefits are provided, any gross premium in excess of
the net premium (i.e., the portion of the gross premium required to provide for all expected future benefits and expenses) is deferred and recognized into revenue in a constant relationship to insurance in force. Benefits are recorded as an expense
when they are incurred. A liability for future policy benefits is recorded when premiums are recognized using the net level premium method.

Premiums from non-participating group annuities with life contingencies, single premium structured settlements with life contingencies and
single premium immediate annuities with life contingencies are recognized when due. When premiums are due over a significantly shorter period than the period over which benefits are provided, any gross premium in excess of the net premium is
deferred and recognized into revenue in a constant relationship to the amount of expected future benefit payments. Benefits are recorded as an expense when they are incurred. A liability for future policy benefits is recorded when premiums are
recognized using the net premium method.

Certain
individual annuity contracts provide the holder a guarantee that the benefit received upon death or annuitization will be no less than a minimum prescribed amount. These benefits are accounted for as insurance contracts and are discussed in further
detail in Note 11. The Company also provides contracts with certain living benefits which are considered embedded derivatives. These contracts are discussed in further detail in Note 11.

Amounts received as payment for interest-sensitive group and individual life contracts, deferred fixed
annuities, structured settlements and other contracts without life contingencies, and participating group annuities are reported as deposits to “Policyholders’ account balances.” Revenues from these contracts are reflected in
“Policy charges and fee income” consisting primarily of fees assessed during the period against the policyholders’ account balances for mortality charges, policy administration charges and surrender charges. In addition to fees, the
Company earns investment income from the investment of policyholders’ deposits in the Company’s general account portfolio. Fees assessed that represent compensation to the Company for services to be provided in future periods and certain
other fees are deferred and amortized into revenue over the life of the related contracts in proportion to estimated gross profits. Benefits and expenses for these products include claims in excess of related account balances, expenses of contract
administration, interest credited to policyholders’ account balances and amortization of DAC.

For group life, other than interest-sensitive group life contracts, and disability insurance, premiums are recognized over the period to which the premiums relate in proportion to the amount of insurance
protection provided. Claim and claim adjustment expenses are recognized when incurred.

Premiums, benefits and expenses are stated net of reinsurance ceded to other companies, except for amounts associated with certain modified coinsurance contracts which are reflected in the Company’s
financial statements based on the application of the deposit method of accounting. Estimated reinsurance recoverables and the cost of reinsurance are recognized over the life of the reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to
account for the underlying policies.

Asset Management Fees
and Other Income

“Asset management
fees and other income” principally include asset management fees and securities and commodities commission revenues, which are recognized in the period in which the services are performed. Realized and unrealized gains or losses from
investments classified as “trading” such as “Trading account assets

supporting insurance liabilities” and “Other trading account assets,” short-term investments that are marked-to-market through other income, and from consolidated entities that
follow specialized investment company fair value accounting are also included in “Asset management fees and other income.” In certain asset management fee arrangements, the Company is entitled to receive performance based incentive fees
when the return on assets under management exceeds certain benchmark returns or other performance targets. Performance based incentive fee revenue is accrued quarterly based on measuring fund performance to date versus the performance benchmark
stated in the investment management agreement. Certain performance based incentive fees are also subject to future adjustment based on cumulative fund performance in relation to these specified benchmarks.

Foreign Currency

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations and
subsidiaries reported in currencies other than U.S. dollars are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period. Revenues, benefits and other expenses are translated at the average rate prevailing during the period. The effects of
translating the statements of operations and financial position of non-U.S. entities with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included, net of related qualifying hedge gains and losses and income taxes, in “Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss).” Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are reported in either “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” or current earnings in “Asset management fees and other income”
depending on the nature of the related foreign currency denominated asset or liability.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices, values of securities or commodities, credit spreads, market volatility,
expected returns, and liquidity. Values can also be affected by changes in estimates and assumptions, including those related to counterparty behavior and non-performance risk used in valuation models. Derivative financial instruments generally used
by the Company include swaps, futures, forwards and options and may be exchange-traded or contracted in the over-the-counter market. Derivative positions are carried at fair value, generally by obtaining quoted market prices or through the use of
valuation models.

Derivatives are used in a
non-dealer or non-broker capacity in insurance, investment and international businesses, and treasury operations, to manage the interest rate and currency characteristics of assets or liabilities and to mitigate the risk of a diminution, upon
translation to U.S. dollars, of expected non-U.S. earnings and net investments in foreign operations resulting from unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Additionally, derivatives may be used to seek to reduce exposure to interest rate,
credit, foreign currency and equity risks associated with assets held or expected to be purchased or sold, and liabilities incurred or expected to be incurred. As discussed in detail below and in Note 21, all realized and unrealized changes in fair
value of non-dealer or non-broker related derivatives, with the exception of the effective portion of cash flow hedges and effective hedges of net investments in foreign operations, are recorded in current earnings. Cash flows from these derivatives
are reported in the operating, investing, or financing activities sections in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Derivatives are also used in a derivative dealer or broker capacity in the Company’s global commodities group to meet the needs of
clients by structuring transactions that allow clients to manage their exposure to interest rates, foreign exchange rates, indices or prices of securities and commodities. Realized and unrealized changes in fair value of derivatives used in these
dealer related operations are included in “Asset management fees and other income” in the periods in which the changes occur. Cash flows from such derivatives are reported in the operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements
of Cash Flows.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

(continued)

Derivatives are recorded either as assets, within “Other trading account assets, at
fair value” or “Other long-term investments,” or as liabilities, within “Other liabilities,” except for embedded derivatives which are recorded with the associated host contract. The Company nets the fair value of all
derivative financial instruments with counterparties for which a master netting arrangement has been executed.

The Company designates derivatives as either (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or unrecognized firm
commitment (“fair value” hedge); (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash flow” hedge); (3) a foreign-currency
fair value or cash flow hedge (“foreign currency” hedge); (4) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation; or (5) a derivative that does not qualify for hedge accounting.

To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative must
be highly effective in mitigating the designated risk of the hedged item. Effectiveness of the hedge is formally assessed at inception and throughout the life of the hedging relationship. Even if a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting
treatment, there may be an element of ineffectiveness of the hedge. Under such circumstances, the ineffective portion is recorded in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.”

The Company formally documents at inception all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as
well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as fair value, cash flow, or foreign currency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the
balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation are linked to the specific foreign operation.

When a derivative is designated as a fair value hedge and is
determined to be highly effective, changes in its fair value, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability (including losses or gains on firm commitments), are reported on a net basis in the income statement, generally in
“Realized investment gains (losses), net.” When swaps are used in hedge accounting relationships, periodic settlements are recorded in the same income statement line as the related settlements of the hedged items.

When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge and is
determined to be highly effective, changes in its fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows being hedged (e.g., when periodic settlements on a
variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings). At that time, the related portion of deferred gains or losses on the derivative instrument is reclassified and reported in the income statement line item associated with the hedged item.

When a derivative is designated as a foreign
currency hedge and is determined to be highly effective, changes in its fair value are recorded either in current period earnings if the hedge transaction is a fair value hedge (e.g., a hedge of a recognized foreign currency asset or liability) or
in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” if the hedge transaction is a cash flow hedge (e.g., a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction). When a derivative is used as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign
operation, its change in fair value, to the extent effective as a hedge, is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment account within “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).”

If it is determined that a derivative no longer qualifies as
an effective fair value or cash flow hedge or management removes the hedge designation, the derivative will continue to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value, with changes in fair value recognized currently in “Realized investment
gains (losses), net.” The asset or liability under a fair value hedge will no longer be adjusted for changes in fair value and the existing basis adjustment is amortized to the income statement line associated with the asset or liability. The
component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” related to discontinued cash flow hedges is amortized to the income statement line associated with the hedged cash flows consistent with the earnings impact of the original
hedged cash flows.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRONOUNCEMENTS

(continued)

When hedge accounting is discontinued because the hedged item no longer meets the
definition of a firm commitment, or because it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the specified time period, the derivative will continue to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value, with changes in
fair value recognized currently in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” Any asset or liability that was recorded pursuant to recognition of the firm commitment is removed from the balance sheet and recognized currently in
“Realized investment gains (losses), net.” Gains and losses that were in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” pursuant to the hedge of a forecasted transaction are recognized immediately in “Realized investment
gains (losses), net.”

If a derivative does
not qualify for hedge accounting, all changes in its fair value, including net receipts and payments, are included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net” without considering changes in the fair value of the economically associated
assets or liabilities.

The Company is a party to
financial instruments that contain derivative instruments that are “embedded” in the financial instruments. At inception, the Company assesses whether the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are clearly and closely related
to the economic characteristics of the remaining component of the financial instrument (i.e., the host contract) and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative instrument.
When it is determined that (1) the embedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract, and (2) a separate instrument with the same terms
would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is separated from the host contract, carried at fair value, and changes in its fair value are included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” For certain financial
instruments that contain an embedded derivative that otherwise would need to be bifurcated and reported at fair value, the Company may elect to classify the entire instrument as a trading account asset and report it within “Other trading
account assets, at fair value.”

Short-Term and
Long-Term Debt

Liabilities for
short-term and long-term debt are primarily carried at an amount equal to unpaid principal balance, net of unamortized discount or premium. Original-issue discount or premium and debt-issue costs are recognized as a component of interest expense
over the period the debt is expected to be outstanding, using the interest method of amortization. Long-term debt included, as of December 31, 2009, funding received from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on a non-recourse basis to finance
the purchase of eligible asset-backed securities under the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, recorded at fair value under the fair value option. Short-term debt is debt coming due in the next twelve months, including that portion of debt
otherwise classified as long-term. The short-term debt caption may exclude short-term items the Company intends to refinance on a long-term basis in the near term. See Note 14 for additional information regarding short-term and long-term debt.

Income Taxes

The Company and its eligible domestic subsidiaries file a
consolidated federal income tax return that includes both life insurance companies and non-life insurance companies. Subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. are taxed, and income tax expense is recorded, based on applicable foreign statutes. See
Note 19 for a discussion of certain non-U.S. jurisdictions for which the Company assumes repatriation of earnings to the U.S.

Deferred income taxes are recognized, based on enacted rates, when assets and liabilities have different values for financial statement
and tax reporting purposes. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce a deferred tax asset to the amount expected to be realized.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

(continued)

The Company’s liability for income taxes includes the liability for unrecognized
tax benefits, interest and penalties which relate to tax years still subject to review by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or other taxing jurisdictions. Audit periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed.
Generally, for tax years which produce net operating losses, capital losses or tax credit carryforwards (“tax attributes”), the statute of limitations does not close, to the extent of these tax attributes, until the expiration of the
statute of limitations for the tax year in which they are fully utilized. The completion of review or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the liability for income taxes. The Company
classifies all interest and penalties related to tax uncertainties as income tax expense. See Note 19 for additional information regarding income taxes.

Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2010, the FASB issued updated guidance that requires enhanced disclosures related to the allowance for credit losses and the
credit quality of a company’s financing receivable portfolio. The disclosures as of the end of a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after December 15, 2010. The Company adopted this
guidance effective December 31, 2010. The required disclosures are included above and in Note 4. The disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2010. The Company will provide these required disclosures in the interim reporting period ending March 31, 2011. In January 2011, the FASB deferred the disclosures required by this guidance related to troubled debt
restructurings. The disclosures will be effective, and the Company will provide these disclosures, concurrent with the effective date of proposed guidance for determining what constitutes a troubled debt restructuring.

In March 2010, the FASB issued updated guidance that amends
and clarifies the accounting for credit derivatives embedded in interests in securitized financial assets. This new guidance eliminates the scope exception for embedded credit derivatives (except for those that are created solely by subordination)
and provides new guidance on how the evaluation of embedded credit derivatives is to be performed. This new guidance is effective for the first interim reporting period beginning after June 15, 2010. The Company’s adoption of this guidance
effective with the interim reporting period ending September 30, 2010 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, and financial statement disclosures.

In January 2010, the FASB issued updated guidance that
requires new fair value disclosures about significant transfers between Level 1 and 2 measurement categories and separate presentation of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements within the roll forward of Level 3 activity. Also, this updated
fair value guidance clarifies the disclosure requirements about level of disaggregation and valuation techniques and inputs. This new guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for
the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of Level 3 activity, which are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010. The Company adopted the effective
portions of this guidance on January 1, 2010. The required disclosures are provided in Note 20. The Company will provide the required disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of Level 3 activity in the
interim reporting period ending March 31, 2011.

In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which changes the analysis required to determine whether or not an entity is a variable interest entity (“VIE”). In addition, the guidance
changes the determination of the primary beneficiary of a VIE from a quantitative to a qualitative model. Under the new qualitative model, the primary beneficiary must have both the ability to direct the activities of the VIE and the obligation to
absorb either losses or gains that could be significant to the VIE. This guidance also changes when reassessment is needed, as well as requires enhanced disclosures, including the effects of a company’s involvement with a VIE on its financial
statements. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after

November 15, 2009. In February 2010, the FASB issued updated guidance which defers, except for disclosure requirements, the impact of this guidance for entities that (1) possess the
attributes of an investment company, (2) do not require the reporting entity to fund losses, and (3) are not financing vehicles or entities that were formerly classified as qualified special purpose entities (“QSPE’s”). The
Company’s adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2010 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations. The disclosures required by this revised guidance are provided in
Note 5.

In June 2009, the FASB issued
authoritative guidance which changes the accounting for transfers of financial assets, and is effective for transfers of financial assets occurring in interim and annual reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2009. It removes the
concept of a QSPE from the guidance for transfers of financial assets and removes the exception from applying the guidance for consolidation of variable interest entities to qualifying special-purpose entities. It changes the criteria for achieving
sale accounting when transferring a financial asset and changes the initial recognition of retained beneficial interests. The guidance also defines “participating interest” to establish specific conditions for reporting a transfer of a
portion of a financial asset as a sale. The Company’s adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2010 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, and financial statement
disclosures.

In January 2010, the FASB issued
updated guidance that clarifies existing guidance on accounting and reporting by an entity that experiences a decrease in ownership of a subsidiary that is a business. The updated guidance states that a decrease in ownership applies to a subsidiary
or group of assets that is a business, but does not apply to a sale of in-substance real estate even if it involves a business, such as an ownership interest in a partnership whose only asset is operating real estate. This guidance also affects
accounting and reporting by an entity that exchanges a group of assets that constitutes a business for an equity interest in another entity. The updated guidance also expands disclosures about fair value measurements relating to retained investments
in a deconsolidated subsidiary or a preexisting interest held by an acquirer in a business combination. The updated guidance is effective in the first interim or annual reporting period ending on or after December 15, 2009, and is applied on a
retrospective basis to the first period that the Company adopted the existing guidance, which was as of January 1, 2009. The Company’s adoption of this updated guidance effective December 31, 2009 did not have a material effect on the
Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or financial statement disclosures.

In January 2010, the FASB issued updated guidance on accounting for distributions to shareholders with components of stock and cash. This
guidance clarifies that the stock portion of a distribution to shareholders that allows them to elect to receive either cash or shares, with a potential limitation on the total amount of cash that all shareholders can elect to receive, is considered
a share issuance, not a stock dividend. Such a share issuance is reflected in the calculation of earnings per share prospectively. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods ending on or after December 15, 2009, and should be
applied on a retrospective basis. Since the Company has not made distributions to shareholders with components of stock and cash, the adoption of this guidance effective December 31, 2009 had no effect on the Company’s consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

In
September 2009, the FASB issued updated guidance for the fair value measurement of investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share including certain alternative investment funds. This guidance allows companies to determine
the fair value of such investments using net asset value (“NAV”) if the fair value of the investment is not readily determinable and the investee entity issues financial statements in accordance with measurement principles for investment
companies. Use of this practical expedient is prohibited if it is probable the investment will be sold at something other than NAV. This guidance also requires new disclosures for each major category of alternative investments. This guidance does
not apply to the Company’s investments in joint ventures and limited partnerships that are generally accounted for under the equity method or cost method. It is effective for the first annual or interim reporting period ending after
December 15, 2009. The

Company’s adoption of this guidance effective December 31, 2009 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or financial
statement disclosures.

In August 2009, the FASB
issued updated guidance for the fair value measurement of liabilities. This guidance provides clarification on how to measure fair value in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available. This
guidance also clarifies that restrictions preventing the transfer of a liability should not be considered as a separate input or adjustment in the measurement of fair value. The Company adopted this guidance effective with the annual reporting
period ended December 31, 2009, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, and financial statement disclosures.

In June 2009, the FASB issued
authoritative guidance for the FASB’s Accounting Standards Codification

TM

as the source of authoritative U.S. GAAP. The Codification is not intended to change U.S. GAAP but is a new structure which organizes accounting pronouncements by accounting topic. This guidance is
effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The Company’s adoption of this guidance effective with the interim reporting period ending September 30, 2009 impacts the way
the Company references U.S. GAAP standards in the financial statements.

In April 2009, the FASB revised the authoritative guidance for disclosures about fair value of financial instruments. This new guidance requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for
interim reporting periods similar to those included in annual financial statements. This guidance is effective for interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009. The Company adopted this guidance effective with the interim period ending
June 30, 2009.

In April 2009, the FASB
revised the authoritative guidance for the recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments. This new guidance amends the other-than-temporary impairment guidance for debt securities and expands the presentation and disclosure
requirements of other-than-temporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements. This guidance also requires that the required annual disclosures for debt and equity securities be made for interim reporting periods. This
guidance does not amend existing recognition and measurement guidance related to other-than-temporary impairments of equity securities. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009, with early
adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009. The Company early adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2009, which resulted in a net after-tax increase to retained earnings and decrease to accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) of $659 million. The disclosures required by this new guidance are provided in Note 4. See “Investments and Investment-Related Liabilities” above for more information.

In April 2009, the FASB revised the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures to
provide guidance on (1) estimating the fair value of an asset or liability if there was a significant decrease in the volume and level of trading activity for these assets or liabilities, and (2) identifying transactions that are not
orderly. Further, this new guidance requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements in interim and annual periods. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009, and shall be
applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009. The Company’s early adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2009 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated
financial position or results of operations. The disclosures required by this revised guidance are provided in Note 20.

In April 2009, the FASB revised the authoritative guidance for the accounting for business combinations. This new guidance requires an
asset acquired or liability assumed in a business combination that arises from a contingency to be recognized at fair value at the acquisition date, if the acquisition date fair value of that asset or liability can be determined during the
measurement period. If the acquisition date fair value of an asset acquired



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRONOUNCEMENTS

(continued)

or liability assumed in a business combination that arises from a contingency cannot be determined during the measurement period, the asset or liability shall be recognized at the acquisition
date using the authoritative guidance related to accounting for contingencies. This new guidance also amends disclosure requirements. This guidance is effective for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations for which
the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. The Company’s adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2009 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In December 2008, the FASB revised the
authoritative guidance for employers’ disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets. This new guidance requires additional disclosures about the components of plan assets, investment strategies for plan assets, significant concentrations
of risk within plan assets, and requires disclosures regarding the fair value measurement of plan assets. This guidance is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009. The Company adopted this guidance effective December 31,
2009. The required disclosures are provided in Note 18.

In September 2008, the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) reached consensus on an issuer’s accounting for liabilities measured at fair value with a third-party credit enhancement.
This consensus concluded that (a) the issuer of a liability (including debt) with a third-party credit enhancement that is inseparable from the liability, shall not include the effect of the credit enhancement in the fair value measurement of
the liability; (b) the issuer shall disclose the existence of any third-party credit enhancement on such liabilities, and (c) in the period of adoption the issuer shall disclose the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of
such liabilities and disclose any changes from valuation techniques used in prior periods. The Company’s adoption of this guidance on a prospective basis effective January 1, 2009 did not have a material effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In June 2008, the FASB EITF reached consensus on the following issues contained in authoritative guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities for determining whether an instrument (or an
embedded feature) is indexed to an entity’s own stock: (1) how an entity should evaluate whether an instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to the entity’s own stock; (2) how the currency in which the strike price of an
equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded equity-linked feature) is denominated affects the determination of whether the instrument is indexed to the entity’s own stock; (3) how an issuer should account for equity-linked financial
instruments issued to investors for purposes of establishing a market-based measure of the grant-date fair value of employee stock options. This guidance clarifies what instruments qualify as indexed to an entity’s own stock and are thereby
eligible for equity classification. The Company’s adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2009 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In June 2008, the FASB revised the authoritative guidance for
earnings per share for determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities. This new guidance states that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or
dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share (EPS) pursuant to the two-class method. This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods
beginning after December 15, 2008, and must be applied retrospectively to all EPS data presented. The Company’s adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2009 reduced both basic earnings per share of Common Stock and diluted
earnings per share of Common Stock for the year ended December 31, 2008 by $0.01.

In May 2008, the FASB revised the authoritative guidance for the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement). This new
guidance, which is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008 and must be applied retrospectively, addresses the accounting for certain convertible debt instruments including those that have been issued by
the Company. It requires bifurcation of the instrument into a debt component that is initially recorded



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRONOUNCEMENTS

(continued)

at fair value and an equity component. The difference between the fair value of the debt component and the initial proceeds from issuance of the instrument is recorded as a component of equity
within additional paid-in capital. The liability component of the debt instrument is accreted to par using the effective yield method, with the accretion being reported as a component of interest expense. Bond issuance costs are allocated to the
debt and equity components in proportion to the debt proceeds. The Company’s adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2009, reduced net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 by $44 million, or $0.10 per share of Common
Stock, on both a basic and diluted basis.

In
April 2008, the FASB revised the authoritative guidance for the determination of the useful life of intangible assets. This new guidance amends the list of factors an entity should consider in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to
determine the useful life of recognized intangible assets. This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008, with the guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset
being applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date, and the disclosure requirements being applied prospectively to all intangible assets recognized as of, and after, the effective date. The Company’s adoption of
this guidance effective January 1, 2009 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In March 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities which amends and expands the
disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring companies to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged
items are accounted for, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. The Company’s adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2009
did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations. The required disclosures are provided in Note 21.

In February 2008, the FASB revised the authoritative guidance for the accounting for transfers of financial assets and repurchase
financing transactions. The new guidance provides recognition and derecognition guidance for a repurchase financing transaction, which is a repurchase agreement that relates to a previously transferred financial asset between the same
counterparties, that is entered into contemporaneously with or in contemplation of, the initial transfer. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company’s adoption of this guidance on a
prospective basis effective January 1, 2009 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations.

In February 2008, the FASB revised the authoritative guidance which delays the effective date related to fair value measurements and
disclosures for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), to fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company’s adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2009 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative
guidance for business combinations which addresses the accounting for business acquisitions, is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008, with early adoption prohibited, and generally applies to business acquisitions
completed after December 31, 2008. Among other things, the new guidance requires that all acquisition-related costs be expensed as incurred, and that all restructuring costs related to acquired operations be expensed as incurred. This new
guidance also addresses the current and subsequent accounting for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies acquired or assumed and, for acquisitions both prior and subsequent to December 31, 2008, requires the acquirer to recognize
changes in the amount of its deferred tax benefits that are recognizable because of a business combination either in income from continuing operations in the period of the combination or directly in contributed capital, depending

(continued)

on the circumstances. The Company’s adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2009 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results
of operations, but may have an effect on the accounting for future business combinations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements. This guidance changes the accounting for minority interests, which are
recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified by the parent company as a component of equity. Upon adoption, this guidance requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing noncontrolling
interests and prospective adoption for all other requirements. The Company’s adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2009 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations,
but did affect financial statement presentation and disclosure. Noncontrolling interests, previously reported as a liability, are now required to be reported as a separate component of equity on the statement of financial position, and totaled $351
million at December 31, 2008. In addition, income attributable to the noncontrolling interests, which was previously reported as an expense in general and administrative expenses and reflected within income from continuing operations is now
reported as a separate amount below net income, and totaled $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

In September 2006, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other
postretirement plans, which amended previous guidance. This revised guidance requires an employer on a prospective basis to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as an asset or
liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through other comprehensive income. The Company adopted this guidance, along with the required disclosures, on
December 31, 2006. The revised guidance also requires an employer on a prospective basis to measure the funded status of its plans as of its fiscal year-end. This requirement is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008.
The Company adopted this guidance on December 31, 2008 and the impact of changing from a September 30 measurement date to a December 31 measurement date was a net after-tax increase to retained earnings of $17 million.

Future Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance
that modifies the first step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely
than not that a goodwill impairment exists. In determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist. The
qualitative factors are consistent with existing authoritative guidance, which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce
the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. This new guidance is effective for public entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2010. The Company’s adoption of this
guidance effective January 1, 2011 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, and financial statement disclosures.

In December 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that
specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the
beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. This guidance expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures required for business combinations to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma
adjustments directly attributable to the business combination(s) included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings. This new guidance is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the
beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRONOUNCEMENTS

(continued)

December 15, 2010. The Company will adopt this guidance prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2011. The Company is currently
assessing the impact of this guidance on the Company’s financial statement disclosures.

In October 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to address diversity in practice regarding the interpretation of which costs relating to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts
qualify for deferral. Under the new guidance acquisition costs are to include only those costs that are directly related to the acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts by applying a model similar to the accounting for loan origination costs.
An entity may defer incremental direct costs of contract acquisition that are incurred in transactions with independent third parties or employees as well as the portion of employee compensation and other costs directly related to underwriting,
policy issuance and processing, medical inspection, and contract selling for successfully negotiated contracts. Additionally, an entity may capitalize as a deferred acquisition cost only those advertising costs meeting the capitalization criteria
for direct-response advertising. This change is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 and interim periods within those years. Early adoption as of the beginning of a fiscal year is permitted. The guidance is to be applied
prospectively upon the date of adoption, with retrospective application permitted, but not required. The Company will adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2012. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the guidance on the
Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, and financial statement disclosures.

In April 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance clarifying that an insurance entity should not consider any separate account
interests in an investment held for the benefit of policyholders to be the insurer’s interests, and should not combine those interests with its general account interest in the same investment when assessing the investment for consolidation,
unless the separate account interests are held for a related party policyholder, whereby consolidation of such interests must be considered under applicable variable interest guidance. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2010 and retrospectively to all prior periods upon the date of adoption, with early adoption permitted. The Company’s adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2011 is not expected to have a
material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, and financial statement disclosures.

recognized in “Other comprehensive income (loss)” (“OCI”). For these securities the net amount recognized in earnings (“credit loss impairments”) represents the difference between the amortized cost of the security and
the net present value of its projected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate implicit in the debt security prior to impairment. Any remaining difference between the fair value and amortized cost is recognized in OCI. The
following table sets forth the amount of pre-tax credit loss impairments on fixed maturity securities held by the Company as of the dates indicated, for which a portion of the OTTI loss was recognized in OCI, and the corresponding changes in such
amounts.

Credit losses recognized in earnings on fixed
maturity securities held by the Company for which a portion of the OTTI loss was recognized in OCI

Represents circumstances where the Company determined in the current period that it intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that it will be required
to sell the security before recovery of the security’s amortized cost.

December 31, 2009 are as follows:

Impaired commercial mortgage and
other loans with no allowance for losses are loans in which the fair value of the collateral or the net present value of the loans’ expected future cash flows equals or exceeds the recorded investment. The average recorded investment in
impaired loans before allowance for losses was $750 million for 2010. Net investment income recognized on these loans totaled $35 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. See Note 2 for information regarding the Company’s accounting
policies for commercial mortgage and other loans.

Non-performing commercial mortgage and other loans with no allowance for losses are loans in which the fair value of the collateral or the
net present value of the loans’ expected future cash flows equals or exceeds the recorded investment. The average recorded investment in non-performing loans before allowance for losses was $835 million for 2009. Net investment income
recognized on these loans totaled $47 million for 2009. See Note 2 for information regarding the Company’s accounting policies for commercial mortgage and other loans.

The net carrying value of commercial loans held for sale by
the Company as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $136 million and $124 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, all of the Company’s commercial loans held for sale were collateralized, with collateral primarily
consisting of office buildings, retail stores, apartment complexes and industrial buildings. In certain transactions, the Company prearranges that it will sell the loan to an investor. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, $136 million and $113
million, respectively, of loans held for sale are subject to such arrangements.

Other Long-term Investments

“Other long-term investments”
are comprised as follows at December 31:

In certain investment
structures, the Company’s asset management business invests with other co-investors in an investment fund referred to as a feeder fund. In these structures, the invested capital of several feeder funds is pooled together and used to purchase
ownership interests in another fund, referred to as a master fund. The master fund utilizes this invested capital, and in certain cases other debt financing, to purchase various classes of assets on behalf of its investors. Specialized industry
accounting for investment companies calls for the feeder fund to reflect its investment in the master fund as a single net asset equal to its proportionate share of the net assets of the master fund, regardless of its level of interest in the master
fund. In cases where the Company consolidates the feeder fund, it retains the feeder fund’s net asset presentation and reports the consolidated feeder fund’s proportionate share of the net assets of the master fund in “Other long-term
investments,” with any unaffiliated investors’ noncontrolling interest in the feeder fund reported in “Other liabilities” or “Noncontrolling interests.” As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, the
consolidated feeder funds’ investments in these master funds, reflected on this net asset basis, totaled $172 million and $142 million. The unaffiliated interest in the consolidated feeder funds was $1 million and $0 million as of
December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and the master funds had gross assets of $781 million and $339 million, respectively, and gross liabilities of $540 million and $142 million, respectively, which are not included on the Company’s
balance sheet.

Includes $1,216 million of fair value and $133 million of gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2009 on securities classified as held to maturity, a portion of
which are not reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income.

The gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2010 and 2009 are composed of $2,950 million and $4,240 million related to high or highest quality securities based on NAIC or equivalent rating and $1,386
million and $2,042 million related to other than high or highest quality securities based on NAIC or equivalent rating. At December 31, 2010, $2,238 million of the gross unrealized losses represented declines in value of greater than 20%, $386
million of which had been in that position for less than six months, as compared to $3,594 million at December 31, 2009, that represented declines in value of greater than 20%, $588 million of which had been in that position for less than six
months. At December 31, 2010, the $3,491 million of gross unrealized losses of twelve months or more were concentrated in asset-backed securities, and in the manufacturing, finance, and services sectors of the Company’s corporate
securities. At December 31, 2009, the $4,908 million of gross unrealized losses of twelve months or more were concentrated in asset-backed securities, and in the manufacturing and finance sectors of the Company’s corporate securities. In
accordance with its policy described in Note 2, the Company concluded that an adjustment to earnings for other-than-temporary impairments for these securities was not warranted at December 31, 2010 and 2009. These conclusions are based on a
detailed analysis of the underlying credit and cash flows on each security. The gross unrealized losses are primarily attributable to credit spread widening and increased liquidity discounts. At December 31, 2010, the Company does not intend to
sell the securities and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis.

Duration of Gross Unrealized Loss Positions for Equity Securities

The following table shows the fair value and gross
unrealized losses aggregated by length of time that individual equity securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at December 31:

At December 31, 2010, $35
million of the gross unrealized losses represented declines of greater than 20%, $18 million of which had been in that position for less than six months. At December 31, 2009, $62 million of the gross unrealized losses represented declines of
greater than 20%, $37 million of which had been in that position for less than six months. Perpetual preferred securities have characteristics of both debt and equity securities. Since an impairment model similar to fixed maturity securities is
applied to these securities, an other-than-temporary impairment has not been recognized on certain perpetual preferred securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve months or more as of December 31, 2010 and
2009. In accordance with its policy described in Note 2, the Company concluded that an adjustment for other-than-temporary impairments for these equity securities was not warranted at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Securities Pledged, Restricted Assets and Special Deposits

The Company pledges as collateral
investment securities it owns to unaffiliated parties through certain transactions, including securities lending, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, collateralized borrowings and postings of collateral with derivative counterparties. At
December 31, the carrying value of investments pledged to third parties as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position included the following:

(1)

Includes $132 million and $838 million of fixed maturity securities classified as short-term investments at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

4.    INVESTMENTS

(continued)

As of December 31, 2010, the carrying amount of the associated liabilities
supported by the pledged collateral was $16,026 million. Of this amount, $5,885 million was “Securities sold under agreements to repurchase,” $4,082 million was “Separate account liabilities,” $2,171 million was “Cash
collateral for loaned securities,” $725 million was “Long-term debt,” $275 million was “Short-term debt,” $1,500 million was “Policyholders’ account balances,” and $1,388 million was “Other
liabilities.” As of December 31, 2009, the carrying amount of the associated liabilities supported by the pledged collateral was $18,559 million. Of this amount, $6,033 million was “Securities sold under agreements to
repurchase,” $4,028 million was “Separate account liabilities,” $3,163 million was “Cash collateral for loaned securities,” $2,000 million was “Short-term debt, $1,500 million was ‘Policyholders’ account
balances,” and $1,835 million was “Other liabilities.”

In the normal course of its business activities, the Company accepts collateral that can be sold or repledged. The primary sources of this collateral are securities in customer accounts and securities
purchased under agreements to resell. The fair value of this collateral was approximately $1,773 million and $1,507 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, all of which, for both periods, had either been sold or repledged.

Assets of $88 million and $160 million at
December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, were on deposit with governmental authorities or trustees. Additionally, assets carried at $694 million and $693 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, were held in voluntary trusts
established primarily to fund guaranteed dividends to certain policyholders and to fund certain employee benefits. Securities restricted as to sale amounted to $638 million and $538 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These
amounts include member and activity based stock associated with memberships in the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and Boston. Restricted cash and securities of $2,917 million and $2,644 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively,
were included in “Other assets.” The restricted cash and securities primarily represent funds deposited by clients and funds accruing to clients as a result of trades or contracts.

5.    VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

In the normal course of its activities, the Company enters
into relationships with various special purpose entities and other entities that are deemed to be variable interest entities (“VIEs”). A VIE is an entity that either (1) has equity investors that lack certain essential characteristics
of a controlling financial interest (including the ability to control activities of the entity, the obligation to absorb the entity’s expected losses and the right to receive the entity’s expected residual returns) or (2) lacks
sufficient equity to finance its own activities without financial support provided by other entities, which in turn would be expected to absorb at least some of the expected losses of the VIE.

If the Company determines that it is the VIE’s “primary beneficiary” it consolidates the VIE.
There are currently two models for determining whether or not the Company is the “primary beneficiary” of a VIE. The first relates to those VIE’s that have the characteristics of an investment company and for which certain other
conditions are true. These conditions are that (1) the Company does not have the implicit or explicit obligation to fund losses of the VIE and (2) the VIE is not a securitization entity, asset-backed financing entity or an entity that was
formerly considered a qualified special-purpose entity. In this model the Company is the primary beneficiary if it stands to absorb a majority of the VIE’s expected losses or to receive a majority of the VIE’s expected residual returns and
would be required to consolidate the VIE.

For all
other VIE’s, the Company is the primary beneficiary if the Company has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of
the entity that could be potentially significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could be potentially significant. If both conditions are present the Company would be required to consolidate the VIE.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

5.    VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

(continued)

Consolidated Variable Interest Entities for which the Company is the Sponsor

The Company is the sponsor of certain asset-backed
investment vehicles (commonly referred to as collateralized debt obligations, or “CDOs”) and certain other vehicles for which the Company earns fee income for investment management services, including certain investment structures which
the Company’s asset management business invests with other co-investors in investment funds referred to as feeder funds. The Company sells or syndicates investments through these vehicles, principally as part of the proprietary investing
activity of the Company’s asset management businesses. Additionally, the Company may invest in debt or equity securities issued by these vehicles. CDOs raise capital by issuing debt securities, and use the proceeds to purchase investments,
typically interest-bearing financial instruments. The Company analyzes these relationships to determine whether it has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity and
(2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could be potentially significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could be potentially significant and thus is the primary beneficiary. This analysis
includes a review of (1) the Company’s rights and responsibilities as sponsor, (2) fees received by the Company and (3) other interests (if any) held by the Company. The Company is not required to provide, and has not provided,
material financial or other support to any VIE for which it is the sponsor.

The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of certain VIEs that it sponsors, including one CDO and certain other investment structures, as it meets both conditions listed above. The
table below reflects the carrying amount and balance sheet caption in which the assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs for which the Company is the sponsor are reported. The assets of these VIE’s are restricted and must be used first to
settle liabilities of the VIE. The creditors of these VIEs do not have recourse to the Company in excess of the assets contained within the VIE.

The Company also consolidates a
VIE whose beneficial interests are wholly owned by consolidated subsidiaries. This VIE is not included in the table above and the Company does not currently intend to sell these beneficial interests to third parties.

Other Consolidated Variable Interest Entities

The Company is the primary beneficiary of certain VIEs in
which the Company has invested, as part of its investment activities. Included among these structured investments are structured investments issued by a VIE that manages yen-denominated investments coupled with cross-currency coupon swap agreements
thereby

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(continued)

creating synthetic dual currency investments. The Company’s involvement in the structuring of these investments combined with its economic interest indicates that the Company is the primary
beneficiary. The Company has not provided material financial or other support that was not contractually required to these VIEs. The table below reflects the carrying amount and balance sheet caption in which the assets and liabilities of
consolidated VIEs for which the Company is not the sponsor are reported. These liabilities primarily comprise obligations under debt instruments issued by the VIEs that are non-recourse to the Company. The creditors of each consolidated VIE have
recourse only to the assets of that VIE.

In addition, not reflected in
the table above, the Company has created a trust that is a VIE, to facilitate Prudential Insurance’s Funding Agreement Notes Issuance Program (“FANIP”). The trust issues medium-term notes secured by funding agreements issued to the
trust by Prudential Insurance with the proceeds of such notes. The trust is the beneficiary of an indemnity agreement with the Company that provides that the Company is responsible for costs related to the notes issued with limited exception. As a
result, the Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of the trust, which is therefore consolidated.

The funding agreements represent an intercompany transaction that is eliminated upon consolidation. However, in recognition of the
security interest in such funding agreements, the trust’s medium-term note liability of $3,509 million and $4,927 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, is classified within “Policyholders’ account balances.”
Creditors of the trust have recourse to Prudential Insurance if the trust fails to make contractual payments on the medium-term notes. The Company has not provided material financial or other support that was not contractually required to the trust.

Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities

The Company has determined that it is
not the primary beneficiary of certain VIEs that it sponsors, including certain CDOs and other investment structures, as it does not have both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the economic
performance of the entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could be potentially significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could be potentially significant. The Company’s maximum
exposure to loss resulting from its relationship with unconsolidated VIEs it sponsors is limited to its investment in the VIEs, which was $506 million and $452 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These investments are reflected
in “Fixed maturities, available for sale,” “Other trading account assets, at fair value” and “Other long-term investments.” The fair value of assets held within these unconsolidated VIEs was $8,979 million and $8,194
million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There are no liabilities associated with these unconsolidated VIEs on the Company’s balance sheet.

In the normal course of its activities, the Company will
invest in joint ventures and limited partnerships. These ventures include hedge funds, private equity funds and real estate related funds and may or may not be



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

5.    VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

(continued)

VIEs. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss on these investments, both VIEs and non-VIEs, is limited to the amount of its investment. The Company has determined that it is not required to
consolidate these entities because either (1) it does not control them or (2) it does not have the obligation to absorb losses of the entities that could be potentially significant to the entities or the right to receive benefits from the
entities that could be potentially significant. The Company classifies these investments as “Other long-term investments” and its maximum exposure to loss associated with these entities was $3,535 million and $3,251 million as of
December 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

In
addition, in the normal course of its activities, the Company will invest in structured investments including VIEs for which it is not the sponsor. These structured investments typically invest in fixed income investments and are managed by third
parties and include asset-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage-backed securities. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss on these structured investments, both VIEs and non-VIEs, is limited to the
amount of its investment. See Note 4 for details regarding the carrying amounts and classification of these assets. The Company has not provided material financial or other support that was not contractually required to these structures. The Company
has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these structures due to the fact that it does not control these entities.

Included among these structured investments are asset-backed securities issued by VIEs that manage investments in the European market. In
addition to a stated coupon, each investment provides a return based on the VIE’s portfolio of assets and related investment activity. The market value of these VIEs was approximately $5.0 billion and $7.5 billion as of December 31, 2010
and 2009, respectively, and these VIEs were financed primarily through the issuance of notes similar to those purchased by the Company. The Company generally accounts for these investments as available for sale fixed maturities containing embedded
derivatives that are bifurcated and marked-to-market through “Realized investment gains (losses), net,” based upon the change in value of the underlying portfolio. The Company’s variable interest in each of these VIEs represents less
than 50% of the only class of variable interests issued by the VIE. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss from these interests was $754 million and $723 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which includes the fair value of
the embedded derivatives.

trading on the Shanghai Exchange in 2007 and since the fourth quarter of 2009 are trading on the Hong Kong exchange. In December 2010, a consortium of investors including the Company sold approximately 16% of its holdings, resulting in a pre-tax
gain of $66 million to the Company, and sold approximately 40% of its remaining holdings in the first quarter of 2011, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $153 million to the Company. The Company transacts with certain of these operating joint ventures
in the normal course of business, on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm’s length transactions. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized $16 million, $15 million and $14 million, respectively,
of asset management fee income from these transactions.

7.    INVESTMENTS IN OPERATING JOINT VENTURES

(continued)

Former Investment in Wachovia Securities

On December 31, 2009, the Company completed the sale of
its minority joint venture interest in Wachovia Securities (including Wells Fargo Advisors) to Wells Fargo. At the closing, the Company received $4.5 billion in cash as the purchase price of its joint venture interest and de-recognized the carrying
value of its investment in the joint venture and the carrying value of the “lookback” option described below. For the year ended December 31, 2009, “Equity in earnings of operating joint ventures, net of taxes” includes the
associated pre-tax gain on the sale of $2.247 billion. In addition, “General and administrative expenses” includes certain one-time costs related to the sale of the joint venture interest of $104 million, for pre-tax compensation costs and
costs related to increased contributions to the Company’s charitable foundation. Results related to the joint venture are included in Corporate and Other operations as a divested business.

In addition, the Company received $418 million in payment of
the principal of and accrued interest on the subordinated promissory note in the principal amount of $417 million that had been issued by Wachovia Securities in connection with the establishment of the joint venture.

Wachovia Corporation’s (“Wachovia”)
contribution to the joint venture of the A.G. Edwards retail securities brokerage business on January 1, 2008 entitled the Company to elect a “lookback” option (which the Company exercised) permitting the Company to delay for a period
of two years ending on January 1, 2010, the decision on whether or not to make payments to avoid or limit dilution of its 38% ownership interest in the joint venture or, alternatively, to “put” its joint venture interests to Wachovia
based on the appraised value of the joint venture, excluding the A.G. Edwards business, as of January 1, 2008. During this “lookback” period, the Company’s share in the earnings of the joint venture and one-time costs associated
with the combination of the A.G. Edwards business with Wachovia Securities was based on the Company’s diluted ownership level. The Company adjusted the carrying value of its ownership interest in the joint venture effective as of
January 1, 2008 to reflect the addition of the A.G. Edwards business and the dilution of the Company’s 38% ownership interest and to record the value of the above described rights under the “lookback” option. The Company
accordingly recognized a corresponding increase to “Additional paid-in capital” of $1.041 billion, net of tax, which represented the excess of the estimated value of the Company’s share of the A.G. Edwards business received (of
approximately $1.444 billion) and the estimated value of the “lookback” option acquired (of approximately $580 million) over the carrying value of the portion of the Company’s ownership interest in Wachovia Securities that was diluted
(of approximately $422 million), net of taxes (of approximately $561 million). In connection with the sale of the Company’s interest in the joint venture to Wells Fargo on December 31, 2009, the Company’s final diluted ownership
percentage in the joint venture for 2008 and 2009 was established as 23%. On December 31, 2009, the Company recognized a decrease to “Additional paid-in capital” of $109 million, net of tax, and a true-up to the Company’s 2008
and 2009 earnings from the joint venture of $15 million, net of tax based on the difference between the diluted ownership percentage previously used to record earnings and the final diluted ownership percentage.

On August 15, 2008, Wachovia announced that it had
reached an agreement in principle for a global settlement of investigations concerning the underwriting, sale and subsequent auction of certain auction rate securities by subsidiaries of Wachovia Securities and had recorded an increase to legal
reserves. The Company’s recorded share of pre-tax losses from the joint venture for the year ended December 31, 2008 included $355 million related to the impact of this item on our share of the equity earnings of the joint venture.

8.    VALUATION OF BUSINESS ACQUIRED

The balances of and changes in VOBA as of and for the years ended December 31, are as follows:

(1)

The VOBA balances at December 31, 2010 were $277 million, $33 million, and $174 million related to the insurance transactions associated with the CIGNA, American
Skandia, Inc. (“American Skandia”), and Aoba Life Insurance Company, LTD. (“Aoba Life”), respectively. The weighted average remaining expected life of VOBA varies by product. The weighted average remaining expected lives were
approximately 17, 4 and 6 years for the VOBA related to CIGNA, American Skandia and Aoba Life, respectively.

(2)

The interest accrual rates vary by product. The interest rates for 2010 were 7.00%, 4.97%, and 2.60% for the VOBA related to CIGNA, American Skandia, and Aoba Life,
respectively. The interest rates for 2009 were 5.42%, 6.90%, 5.24%, and 2.60% for the VOBA related to Allstate, CIGNA, American Skandia, and Aoba Life, respectively. The interest rates for 2008 were 5.42%, 7.30%, 5.72%, and 2.50% to 2.60% for the
VOBA related to Allstate, CIGNA, American Skandia, and Aoba Life, respectively.

During the first quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recognized impairments of $73 million and $234 million, respectively, related to the VOBA associated with the Allstate
acquisition. These impairments are included on the “Amortization—Impact of assumption and experience unlocking and true-ups” line in the table above. The impairment recorded in 2009 represented the remaining VOBA balance associated
with the Allstate acquisition. These impairments were reflective of the deterioration in the financial markets, which resulted in additional market depreciation within the separate account assets and corresponding decreases in fee income and overall
expected future earnings for this business. These impairments were determined using discounted present value of future estimated gross profits. Since the VOBA balance was completely impaired for these contracts, it cannot be reestablished for market
value appreciation in subsequent periods. There were no impairments during 2010.

The following table provides estimated future amortization, net of interest, for the periods indicated.

The changes in the book value of goodwill by reporting unit are as follows:

(1)

Other represents foreign currency translation and purchase price adjustments.

The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually as of
December 31 and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, as discussed in further detail in Note 2.

The Company performed goodwill impairment testing for all
three reporting units that had goodwill at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 and no impairments were needed.

The Company performed goodwill impairment testing for all six reporting units that had goodwill at December 31, 2008. There was an
indication of impairment in the Individual Annuities segment, International Investments segment and Real Estate and Relocation Services reporting units, and accordingly, the second step of the test was performed on these reporting units. Based on
the results of the second step, all of the goodwill in these three reporting units was impaired.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company impaired the entire amount of goodwill associated with the Individual Annuities segment. This impairment was reflective of the deterioration of financial
market conditions, which resulted in additional market depreciation within separate account assets and corresponding decreases in anticipated fee income and overall expected future earnings for this business.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

9.    GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES

(continued)

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company impaired the entire amount of goodwill
associated with the International Investments segment’s asset management reporting unit. This impairment was reflective of the significant deterioration in financial market conditions, which resulted in a decline in anticipated future asset
management and transaction based fees, and hence a decrease in the expected future earnings of the segment’s asset management businesses.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company impaired the entire amount of goodwill associated with Corporate and Other operation’s
real estate and relocation services reporting unit. This impairment was reflective of the deterioration of the U.S. housing market and the Company’s view of the timing of the recovery of this market, which resulted in a decrease in the expected
future earnings of this business.

Other Intangibles

Other intangible balances at
December 31, are as follows:

The fair values of net mortgage
servicing rights were $172 million and $165 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Amortization expense for other intangibles was $45 million, $45 million and $48 million for the years ending December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. Amortization expense for other intangibles is expected to be approximately $44 million in 2011, $39 million in 2012, $39 million in 2013, $32 million in 2014 and $29 million in 2015. The amortization expense amounts listed above for
2010 and 2009 do not include impairments recorded for mortgage servicing rights. See the non-recurring fair value measurements section of Note 20 for more information regarding these impairments.

10.    POLICYHOLDERS’ LIABILITIES

Future Policy Benefits

Future policy benefits at December 31, are as follows:



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

10.    POLICYHOLDERS’ LIABILITIES

(continued)

Life insurance liabilities include reserves for death and endowment policy benefits,
terminal dividends and certain health benefits. Individual and group annuities and supplementary contracts liabilities include reserves for life contingent immediate annuities and life contingent group annuities. Other contract liabilities include
unearned revenue and certain other reserves for group, annuities and individual life and health products.

Future policy benefits for individual participating traditional life insurance are based on the net level premium method, calculated using
the guaranteed mortality and nonforfeiture interest rates which range from 2.5% to 7.5%. Participating insurance represented 12% and 13% of domestic individual life insurance in force at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and 81%, 83%
and 85% of domestic individual life insurance premiums for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Future policy benefits for individual non-participating traditional life insurance policies, group and individual long-term care policies and individual health insurance policies are generally equal to
the aggregate of (1) the present value of future benefit payments and related expenses, less the present value of future net premiums, and (2) any premium deficiency reserves. Assumptions as to mortality, morbidity and persistency are
based on the Company’s experience, and in certain instances, industry experience, when the basis of the reserve is established. Interest rates used in the determination of the present values range from 1.0% to 9.5%; less than 1% of the reserves
are based on an interest rate in excess of 8%.

Future policy benefits for individual and group annuities and supplementary contracts are generally equal to the aggregate of (1) the
present value of expected future payments, and (2) any premium deficiency reserves. Assumptions as to mortality are based on the Company’s experience, and in certain instances, industry experience, when the basis of the reserve is
established. The interest rates used in the determination of the present values range from 1.0% to 14.8%; less than 1% of the reserves are based on an interest rate in excess of 8%.

Future policy benefits for other contract liabilities are generally equal to the present value of expected
future payments based on the Company’s experience, except for example, certain group insurance coverages for which future policy benefits are equal to gross unearned premium reserves. The interest rates used in the determination of the present
values range from 0.2% to 6.2%.

Premium
deficiency reserves are established, if necessary, when the liability for future policy benefits plus the present value of expected future gross premiums are determined to be insufficient to provide for expected future policy benefits and expenses
and to recover any unamortized policy acquisition costs. Premium deficiency reserves have been recorded for the group single premium annuity business, which consists of limited-payment, long-duration, traditional, and non-participating annuities;
structured settlements; single premium immediate annuities with life contingencies; and for certain individual health policies. Liabilities of $2,001 million and $1,649 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, are included in
“Future policy benefits” with respect to these deficiencies, of which $926 million and $490 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, relate to net unrealized gains on securities classified as available for sale.

The Company’s liability for future policy
benefits is also inclusive of liabilities for guarantee benefits related to certain nontraditional long-duration life and annuity contracts, which are discussed more fully in Note 11 and are primarily reflected in other contract liabilities in the
table above.

Unpaid claims and claim adjustment
expenses primarily reflect the Company’s estimate of future disability claim payments and expenses as well as estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet dates related to group disability products. Unpaid claim
liabilities are discounted using interest rates ranging from 0% to 6.4%.

Policyholders’ Account Balances

Policyholders’ account balances at December 31,
are as follows:

Policyholders’ account
balances represent an accumulation of account deposits plus credited interest less withdrawals, expenses and mortality charges, if applicable. These policyholders’ account balances also include provisions for benefits under non-life contingent
payout annuities. Included in “Funding agreements” at December 31, 2010 and 2009, are $3,592 million and $4,996 million, respectively, related to the Company’s FANIP product which is carried at amortized cost, adjusted for the
effective portion of changes in fair value of qualifying derivative financial instruments. For additional details on the FANIP product see Note 5. The interest rates associated with such notes range from 0.4% to 5.6%. Interest crediting rates range
from 0% to 12.0% for interest-sensitive life contracts and from 0% to 13.4% for contracts other than interest-sensitive life. Less than 1% of policyholders’ account balances have interest crediting rates in excess of 8%.

11.    CERTAIN NONTRADITIONAL LONG-DURATION CONTRACTS

The Company issues traditional variable annuity contracts
through its separate accounts for which investment income and investment gains and losses accrue directly to, and investment risk is borne by, the contractholder. The Company also issues variable annuity contracts with general and separate account
options where the Company contractually guarantees to the contractholder a return of no less than (1) total deposits made to the contract less any partial withdrawals (“return of net deposits”), (2) total deposits made to the
contract less any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return (“minimum return”), or (3) the highest contract value on a specified date minus any withdrawals (“contract value”). These guarantees include benefits that are
payable in the event of death, annuitization or at specified dates during the accumulation period and withdrawal and income benefits payable during specified periods. The Company also issues annuity contracts with market value adjusted investment
options (“MVAs”), which provide for a return of principal plus a fixed rate of return if held to maturity, or, alternatively, a “market adjusted value” if surrendered prior to maturity or if funds are reallocated to other
investment options. The market value adjustment may result in a gain or loss to the Company, depending on crediting rates or an indexed rate at surrender, as applicable.

In addition, the Company issues variable life, variable
universal life and universal life contracts where the Company contractually guarantees to the contractholder a death benefit even when there is insufficient value to cover monthly mortality and expense charges, whereas otherwise the contract would
typically lapse (“no lapse guarantee”). Variable life and variable universal life contracts are offered with general and separate account options.

The assets supporting the variable portion of both traditional variable annuities and certain variable contracts with guarantees are
carried at fair value and reported as “Separate account assets” with an equivalent amount reported as “Separate account liabilities.” Amounts assessed against the contractholders for mortality, administration, and other services
are included within revenue in “Policy charges and fee income” and changes in



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

11.    CERTAIN NONTRADITIONAL LONG-DURATION CONTRACTS

(continued)

liabilities for minimum guarantees are generally included in “Policyholders’ benefits.” In 2010, 2009 and 2008, there were no gains or losses on transfers of assets from the
general account to a separate account.

For those
guarantees of benefits that are payable in the event of death, the net amount at risk is generally defined as the current guaranteed minimum death benefit in excess of the current account balance at the balance sheet date. The Company’s primary
risk exposures for these contracts relates to actual deviations from, or changes to, the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products, including equity market returns, contract lapses and contractholder mortality.

For guarantees of benefits that are payable at annuitization,
the net amount at risk is generally defined as the present value of the minimum guaranteed annuity payments available to the contractholder determined in accordance with the terms of the contract in excess of the current account balance. The
Company’s primary risk exposures for these contracts relates to actual deviations from, or changes to, the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products, including equity market returns, timing of annuitization, contract lapses and
contractholder mortality.

For guarantees of
benefits that are payable at withdrawal, the net amount at risk is generally defined as the present value of the minimum guaranteed withdrawal payments available to the contractholder determined in accordance with the terms of the contract in excess
of the current account balance. For guarantees of accumulation balances, the net amount at risk is generally defined as the guaranteed minimum accumulation balance minus the current account balance. The Company’s primary risk exposures for
these contracts relates to actual deviations from, or changes to, the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products, including equity market returns, interest rates, market volatility or contractholder behavior used in the original
pricing of these products.

The Company’s
contracts with guarantees may offer more than one type of guarantee in each contract; therefore, the amounts listed may not be mutually exclusive. The liabilities related to the net amount at risk are reflected within “Future policy
benefits.” As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had the following guarantees associated with these contracts, by product and guarantee type:

Liabilities For Guarantee Benefits

The table below summarizes the changes in general account
liabilities for guarantees on variable contracts. The liabilities for guaranteed minimum death benefits (“GMDB”) and guaranteed minimum income benefits (“GMIB”) are included in “Future policy benefits” and the related
changes in the liabilities are included in “Policyholders’ benefits.” Guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (“GMAB”), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (“GMWB”), and guaranteed minimum income and withdrawal
benefits (“GMIWB”) features are considered to be bifurcated embedded derivatives and are recorded at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives, including changes in the Company’s own risk of non-performance, along
with any fees attributed or payments made relating to the derivative, are recorded in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” See Note 20 for additional information regarding the methodology used in determining the fair value of these
embedded derivatives. The liabilities for GMAB, GMWB and GMIWB are included in “Future policy benefits.” As discussed below, the Company maintains a portfolio of derivative investments that serve as a partial hedge of the risks associated
with these products, for which the changes in fair value are also recorded in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” This portfolio of derivatives investments does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP.

(1)

Incurred guarantee benefits include the portion of assessments established as additions to reserves as well as changes in estimates affecting the reserves. Also
includes changes in the fair value of features considered to be derivatives.

The GMDB liability is determined each period end by estimating the accumulated value of a portion of the total assessments to date less the accumulated value of the death benefits in excess of the account
balance. The GMIB liability is determined each period by estimating the accumulated value of a portion of the total assessments to date less the accumulated value of the projected income benefits in excess of the account balance. The portion of
assessments used is chosen such that, at issue (or, in the case of acquired contracts at the acquisition date) the present value of expected death benefits or expected income benefits in excess of the



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

11.    CERTAIN NONTRADITIONAL LONG-DURATION CONTRACTS

(continued)

projected account balance and the portion of the present value of total expected assessments over the lifetime of the contracts are equal. The Company regularly evaluates the estimates used and
adjusts the GMDB and GMIB liability balances, with an associated charge or credit to earnings, if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised.

The GMAB features provide the contractholder with a guaranteed return of initial account value or an enhanced
value if applicable. The most significant of the Company’s GMAB features are the guaranteed return option (“GRO”) features, which includes an automatic rebalancing element that reduces the Company’s exposure to these guarantees.
The GMAB liability is calculated as the present value of future expected payments to customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature.

The GMWB features provide the contractholder with a guaranteed remaining balance if the account value is
reduced to zero through a combination of market declines and withdrawals. The guaranteed remaining balance is generally equal to the protected value under the contract, which is initially established as the greater of the account value or cumulative
deposits when withdrawals commence, less cumulative withdrawals. The contractholder also has the option, after a specified time period, to reset the guaranteed remaining balance to the then-current account value, if greater. The GMWB liability is
calculated as the present value of future expected payments to customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature.

The GMIWB features predominantly present a benefit that
provides a contractholder two optional methods to receive guaranteed minimum payments over time, a “withdrawal” option or an “income” option. The withdrawal option guarantees that, upon the election of such benefit, a contract
holder can withdraw an amount each year until the cumulative withdrawals reach a total guaranteed balance. The guaranteed remaining balance is generally equal to the protected value under the contract, which is initially established as the greater
of: (1) the account value on the date of first withdrawal; (2) cumulative deposits when withdrawals commence, less cumulative withdrawals plus a minimum return; or (3) the highest contract value on a specified date minus any
withdrawals. The income option guarantees that a contract holder can, upon the election of this benefit, withdraw a lesser amount each year for the annuitant’s life based on the total guaranteed balance. The withdrawal or income benefit can be
elected by the contract holder upon issuance of an appropriate deferred variable annuity contract or at any time following contract issue prior to annuitization. Certain GMIWB features include an automatic rebalancing element that reduces the
Company’s exposure to these guarantees. The GMIWB liability is calculated as the present value of future expected payments to customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature.

As part of its risk management strategy, the Company hedges
or limits its exposure to these risks, excluding those risks that have been deemed suitable to retain, through a combination of product design elements, such as an automatic rebalancing element, and externally purchased hedging instruments, such as
equity options and interest rate derivatives. The automatic rebalancing element included in the design of certain optional living benefits transfers assets between the variable investments selected by the annuity contractholder and, depending on the
benefit feature, a fixed rate account in the general account or a bond portfolio within the separate account. The transfers are based on the static mathematical formula used with the particular optional benefit which considers a number of factors,
including the impact of investment performance of the contractholder’s total account value. In general, negative investment performance may result in transfers to a fixed rate account in the general account or a bond portfolio within the
separate account, and positive investment performance may result in transfers back to contractholder-selected investments. Other product design elements utilized for certain products to manage these risks include asset allocation restrictions and
minimum purchase age requirements. For risk management purposes the Company segregates the variable annuity living benefit features into those that include the automatic rebalancing element, including certain GMIWB riders and certain GMAB riders
that feature the GRO policyholder benefits; and those that do not include the automatic rebalancing element,



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

11.    CERTAIN NONTRADITIONAL LONG-DURATION CONTRACTS

(continued)

including certain legacy GMIWB, GMWB, GMAB and GMIB riders. Living benefit riders that include the automatic rebalancing element also include GMDB riders, and as such the GMDB risk in these
riders also benefits from the automatic rebalancing element.

Sales Inducements

The Company defers sales inducements and amortizes them over the anticipated life of the policy using the same methodology and assumptions
used to amortize deferred policy acquisition costs. These deferred sales inducements are included in “Other assets.” The Company offers various types of sales inducements. These inducements include: (1) a bonus whereby the
policyholder’s initial account balance is increased by an amount equal to a specified percentage of the customer’s initial deposit, (2) additional credits after a certain number of years a contract is held and (3) enhanced
interest crediting rates that are higher than the normal general account interest rate credited in certain product lines. Changes in deferred sales inducements, reported as “Interest credited to policyholders’ account balances,” are
as follows:

12.    CLOSED BLOCK

On the date of demutualization, Prudential Insurance
established a Closed Block for certain individual life insurance policies and annuities issued by Prudential Insurance in the U.S. The recorded assets and liabilities were allocated to the Closed Block at their historical carrying amounts. The
Closed Block forms the principal component of the Closed Block Business. For a discussion of the Closed Block Business see Note 22.

The policies included in the Closed Block are specified individual life insurance policies and individual annuity contracts that were in
force on the effective date of the Plan of Reorganization and for which Prudential Insurance is currently paying or expects to pay experience-based policy dividends. Assets have been allocated to the Closed Block in an amount that has been
determined to produce cash flows which, together with revenues from policies included in the Closed Block, are expected to be sufficient to support obligations and liabilities relating to these policies, including provision for payment of benefits,
certain expenses, and taxes and to provide for continuation of the policyholder dividend scales in effect in 2000, assuming experience underlying such scales continues. To the extent that, over time, cash flows from the assets allocated to the
Closed Block and



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

12.    CLOSED BLOCK

(continued)

claims and other experience related to the Closed Block are, in the aggregate, more or less favorable than what was assumed when the Closed Block was established, total dividends paid to Closed
Block policyholders may be greater than or less than the total dividends that would have been paid to these policyholders if the policyholder dividend scales in effect in 2000 had been continued. Any cash flows in excess of amounts assumed will be
available for distribution over time to Closed Block policyholders and will not be available to stockholders. If the Closed Block has insufficient funds to make guaranteed policy benefit payments, such payments will be made from assets outside of
the Closed Block. The Closed Block will continue in effect as long as any policy in the Closed Block remains in force unless, with the consent of the New Jersey insurance regulator, it is terminated earlier.

The excess of Closed Block Liabilities over Closed Block
Assets at the date of the demutualization (adjusted to eliminate the impact of related amounts in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)”) represented the estimated maximum future earnings at that date from the Closed Block
expected to result from operations attributed to the Closed Block after income taxes. In establishing the Closed Block, the Company developed an actuarial calculation of the timing of such maximum future earnings. If actual cumulative earnings of
the Closed Block from inception through the end of any given period are greater than the expected cumulative earnings, only the expected earnings will be recognized in income. Any excess of actual cumulative earnings over expected cumulative
earnings will represent undistributed accumulated earnings attributable to policyholders, which are recorded as a policyholder dividend obligation. The policyholder dividend obligation represents amounts to be paid to Closed Block policyholders as
an additional policyholder dividend unless otherwise offset by future Closed Block performance that is less favorable than originally expected. If the actual cumulative earnings of the Closed Block from its inception through the end of any given
period are less than the expected cumulative earnings of the Closed Block, the Company will recognize only the actual earnings in income. However, the Company may reduce policyholder dividend scales, which would be intended to increase future actual
earnings until the actual cumulative earnings equaled the expected cumulative earnings.

As of December 31, 2010, the Company recognized a policyholder dividend obligation of $126 million, to Closed Block policyholders for the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected
cumulative earnings. Additionally, accumulated net unrealized investment gains that have arisen subsequent to the establishment of the Closed Block have been reflected as a policyholder dividend obligation of $2,117 million at December 31,
2010, to be paid to Closed Block policyholders unless offset by future experience, with an offsetting amount reported in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” As of December 31, 2009, actual cumulative earnings were below
the expected cumulative earnings, thereby eliminating the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation. Furthermore, the accumulation of net unrealized investment gains as of December 31, 2009 that had arisen subsequent to the
establishment of the Closed Block, were not sufficient to overcome the cumulative earnings shortfall. See the table below for changes in the components of the policyholder dividend obligation for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.

On December 14, 2010, Prudential
Insurance’s Board of Directors approved a continuation of the Closed Block dividend scales in 2011. On December 8, 2009, Prudential Insurance’s Board of Directors acted to reduce the dividends payable in 2010 on Closed Block policies.
This decrease reflected the deterioration in investment results and resulted in a $98 million reduction of the liability for policyholder dividends recognized in the year ended December 31, 2009. On December 19, 2008, Prudential
Insurance’s Board of Directors acted to reduce the dividends payable in 2009 on Closed Block policies. This decrease also reflected the deterioration in investment results and resulted in a $187 million reduction of the liability for
policyholder dividends recognized in the year ended December 31, 2008.

In 2006, the Company acquired the variable annuity business of The Allstate Corporation (“Allstate”) through a reinsurance
transaction. The reinsurance arrangements with Allstate include a coinsurance arrangement associated with the general account liabilities assumed and a modified coinsurance arrangement associated with the separate account liabilities assumed. The
reinsurance payable, which represents the Company’s obligation under the modified coinsurance arrangement, is netted with the reinsurance receivable in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

In 2004, the Company acquired the retirement business of
CIGNA and as a result, entered into various reinsurance arrangements. The Company still has indemnity coinsurance and modified coinsurance without assumption arrangements in effect related to this acquisition.

Life and disability reinsurance is accomplished through
various plans of reinsurance, primarily yearly renewable term, per person excess and coinsurance. In addition, the Company has reinsured with unaffiliated third parties, 73% of the Closed Block through various modified coinsurance arrangements. The
Company accounts for these modified coinsurance arrangements under the deposit method of accounting. Reinsurance ceded arrangements do not discharge the Company as the primary insurer. Ceded balances would represent a liability of the Company in the
event the reinsurers were unable to meet their obligations to the Company under the terms of the reinsurance agreements. Reinsurance premiums, commissions, expense reimbursements, benefits

and reserves related to reinsured long-duration contracts are accounted for over the life of the underlying reinsured contracts using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the
underlying contracts. The cost of reinsurance related to short-duration contracts is accounted for over the reinsurance contract period. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers, for both short-and long-duration reinsurance arrangements, are estimated in
a manner consistent with the claim liabilities and policy benefits associated with the reinsured policies.

The tables presented below exclude amounts pertaining to the Company’s discontinued operations.

Reinsurance amounts included in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations for premiums, policy charges and fees and policyholders’ benefits for the years ended December 31, were as follows:

Reinsurance recoverables at

Company has recorded related reinsurance payables of $1,068 million and $1,038 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Excluding the reinsurance recoverable associated with the acquisition of the retirement business of CIGNA, four major reinsurance
companies account for approximately 58% of the reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2010. The Company periodically reviews the financial condition of its reinsurers and amounts recoverable therefrom in order to minimize its exposure to loss
from reinsurer insolvencies, recording an allowance when necessary for uncollectible reinsurance.

14.    SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT

Short-term Debt

Short-term debt at December 31, is as follows:

(1)

Includes collateralized borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York of $275 million at December 31, 2010, discussed in more detail below.

(2)

Includes collateralized borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York of $2,000 million at December 31, 2009, discussed in more detail below.

(3)

Includes Prudential Financial debt of $769 million and $203 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The weighted average interest rate on outstanding short-term
debt, excluding the current portion of long-term debt and convertible debt, was 0.39% and 0.51% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company was in compliance with all covenants related to the
above debt.

Commercial Paper

The Company issues commercial paper under the two programs
described below. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the weighted average maturity of total commercial paper outstanding was 34 and 27 days, respectively.

Prudential Financial has a commercial paper program with an authorized capacity of $3.0 billion. Prudential Financial commercial paper
borrowings have been generally used to fund the working capital needs of Prudential Financial’s subsidiaries and provide short-term liquidity at Prudential Financial. Prudential Financial’s outstanding commercial paper borrowings were $283
million and $146 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Prudential Funding, LLC (“Prudential Funding”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Insurance, has a commercial paper program, with an authorized capacity of $7.0 billion. Prudential Funding
commercial paper borrowings have generally served as an additional source of financing to meet the working capital needs of Prudential Insurance and its subsidiaries. Prudential Funding also lends to other subsidiaries of Prudential Financial up to
limits agreed with the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance. Prudential Funding’s outstanding commercial paper borrowings were $874 million and $730 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Prudential Financial has
issued a subordinated guarantee covering Prudential Funding’s domestic commercial paper program.

Federal Home Loan Bank of New York

Prudential Insurance is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLBNY”). Membership allows Prudential Insurance
access to the FHLBNY’s financial services, including the ability to obtain collateralized loans and to issue collateralized funding agreements that can be used as an alternative source of liquidity. FHLBNY borrowings and funding agreements are
collateralized by qualifying mortgage-related assets or U.S. Treasury securities, the fair value of which must be maintained at certain specified levels relative to outstanding borrowings, depending on the type of asset pledged. FHLBNY membership
requires Prudential Insurance to own member stock and borrowings require the purchase of activity-based stock in an amount equal



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

14.    SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT

(continued)

to 4.5% of outstanding borrowings. Under FHLBNY guidelines, if Prudential Insurance’s financial strength ratings decline below A/A2/A Stable by S&P/Moody’s/Fitch, respectively, and
the FHLBNY does not receive written assurances from the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (“NJDOBI”) regarding Prudential Insurance’s solvency, new borrowings from the FHLBNY would be limited to a term of 90 days or less.
Currently there are no restrictions on the term of borrowings from the FHLBNY. All FHLBNY stock purchased by Prudential Insurance is classified as restricted general account investments within “Other long-term investments,” and the
carrying value of these investments was $177 million and $221 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

NJDOBI previously permitted Prudential Insurance to pledge collateral to the FHLBNY in an amount up to 7% of its prior year-end statutory
net admitted assets, excluding separate account assets; however, since the Company elected not to seek an extension, this limitation reset to 5% effective January 1, 2011. Based on Prudential Insurance’s statutory net admitted assets as of
December 31, 2009, the 5% limitation equates to a maximum amount of pledged assets of $7.4 billion and an estimated maximum borrowing capacity (after taking into account required collateralization levels and purchases of activity-based stock)
of approximately $6.2 billion. Nevertheless, FHLBNY borrowings are subject to the FHLBNY’s discretion and to the availability of qualifying assets at Prudential Insurance.

As of December 31, 2010, Prudential Insurance had
pledged qualifying assets with a fair value of $2.8 billion, which supported outstanding collateralized advances of $1.0 billion and collateralized funding agreements of $1.5 billion. The fair value of qualifying assets that were available to
Prudential Insurance but not pledged amounted to $5.5 billion as of December 31, 2010.

As of December 31, 2010, $275 million of the FHLBNY outstanding advances are reflected in “Short-term debt” and the remaining $725 million is in “Long-term debt.” FHLBNY advances
declined $1,000 million from December 31, 2009, reflecting the repayment at maturity of $1,000 million of advances in June and the refinancing of $1,000 million of advances in December. Of the outstanding $1,000 million collateralized advances,
$275 million matures in December 2011 and $725 million matures in December 2015. The funding agreements issued to the FHLBNY, which are reflected in “Policyholders’ account balances,” have priority claim status above debt holders of
Prudential Insurance.

Federal Home Loan Bank
of Boston

Prudential Retirement Insurance
and Annuity Company (“PRIAC”) became a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (“FHLBB”) in December 2009. Membership allows PRIAC access to collateralized advances which will be classified in “Short-term debt”
or “Long-term debt,” depending on the maturity date of the obligation. PRIAC’s membership in FHLBB requires the ownership of member stock and borrowings from FHLBB require the purchase of activity-based stock in an amount between 3.0%
and 4.5% of outstanding borrowings depending on the maturity date of the obligation. As of December 31, 2010, PRIAC had no advances outstanding under the FHLBB facility.

The Connecticut Department of Insurance (“CTDOI”)
permits PRIAC to pledge up to $2.6 billion in qualifying assets to secure FHLBB borrowings through December 31, 2011. PRIAC must seek re-approval from CTDOI prior to borrowing additional funds after that date. Based on available eligible assets
as of December 31, 2010, PRIAC had an estimated maximum borrowing capacity, after taking into consideration required collateralization levels and required purchases of activity-based FHLBB stock, of approximately $1.1 billion.

Convertible Senior Notes

On December 12, 2007 and December 7, 2006,
Prudential Financial issued in a private placement $3.0 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, of floating rate convertible senior notes that are convertible by the holders



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

14.    SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT

(continued)

at any time after issuance into cash and shares of Prudential Financial’s Common Stock, at a stated conversion price of $132.39 and $104.21 per share, respectively. Holders of the notes may
require Prudential Financial to repurchase the notes, at par plus accrued interest, on contractually specified dates. During 2009 and 2008, $2,147 million and $853 million, respectively, of the $3.0 billion floating rate convertible senior notes
were repurchased by Prudential Financial at the request of the holders or through individually negotiated transactions. In addition, during both 2010 and 2009, $2 million of the $2.0 billion floating rate convertible senior notes were repurchased by
Prudential Financial at the request of the holders. Prior to 2009, an aggregate amount of $1,996 million of the $2.0 billion floating rate convertible senior notes was repurchased by the Company at the request of the holders. As of December 31,
2010, an aggregate amount of $0.4 million of these floating rate convertible senior notes remain outstanding.

Credit Facilities

As of December 31, 2010, Prudential Financial, Prudential Insurance and Prudential Funding maintained an aggregate of $4,108 million
of unsecured committed credit facilities, which includes a $1,250 million credit facility on which Prudential Financial is the sole borrower party. These facilities have terms ranging from one to five years. There were no outstanding borrowings
under these credit facilities as of December 31, 2010. Each of the facilities is available to the applicable borrowers up to the aggregate committed credit and may be used for general corporate purposes, including as backup liquidity for the
Company’s commercial paper programs discussed above. Any borrowings under the credit facilities would mature no later than the respective expiration dates of the facilities and would bear interest at the rates set forth in the applicable credit
agreement.

These credit facilities contain
representations and warranties, covenants and events of default that are customary for facilities of this type. The Company’s ability to borrow under the facilities is conditioned on the continued satisfaction of customary conditions,
including, for the facilities shared by Prudential Financial, Prudential Insurance and Prudential Funding, the maintenance at all times by Prudential Insurance of total adjusted capital of at least $5.5 billion based on statutory accounting
principles prescribed under New Jersey law and, in the case of each of the facilities, Prudential Financial’s maintenance of a prescribed minimum level of consolidated net worth. For the credit facilities shared by Prudential Financial,
Prudential Insurance and Prudential Funding, the minimum level of consolidated net worth of Prudential Financial is $12.5 billion, which for this purpose is based on U.S. GAAP equity, excluding net unrealized gains and losses on investments. For the
credit facility on which Prudential Financial is the sole borrower party, the minimum level of consolidated net worth of Prudential Financial is $19.0 billion, which for this purpose is based upon U.S. GAAP equity, excluding accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss).

As of
December 31, 2010, Prudential Insurance’s total adjusted capital and Prudential Financial’s consolidated net worth (as defined in the applicable credit agreements) exceeded the minimum amounts required to borrow under the facilities.
The Company’s ability to borrow under the facilities is not contingent on its credit ratings nor subject to material adverse change clauses.

The Company also has access to uncommitted lines of credit from financial institutions. In addition, the Company, as part of its real
estate separate account activities, had outstanding lines of credit of $960 million at December 31, 2010, of which $100 million was used.

Long-term Debt

Long-term debt at December 31, is as follows:

(1)

Annual scheduled repayments of principal for the Series A and Series C notes begin in 2013. Annual scheduled repayments of principal for the Series B notes begin in
2018.

(2)

The interest rate on the Series A notes is a floating rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.875% per year. The interest rate ranged from 1.1% to 1.4% in 2010 and 1.1% to 2.7%
in 2009.

(3)

Includes collateralized borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York of $725 million at December 31, 2010. These borrowings are discussed in more detail
above.

(4)

The interest rate on the floating rate Surplus notes ranged from 0.5% to 3.7% in 2010 and 0.6% to 4.8% in 2009.

(5)

The interest rates on the other floating rate notes are based on LIBOR and the U.S. Consumer Price Index. Interest rates ranged from 0.0% to 5.5% in 2010 and 0.0% to
7.7% in 2009.

(6)

Includes Prudential Financial debt of $16,841 million and $14,465 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company was in
compliance with all debt covenants related to the borrowings in the table above.

The following table presents, as of December 31, 2010, the Company’s contractual maturities of its long-term debt:

Surplus Notes

The fixed rate surplus notes issued by Prudential Insurance
are subordinated to other Prudential Insurance borrowings and policyholder obligations, and the payment of interest and principal may only be made with the prior approval of the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance of the State of New Jersey (the
“Commissioner”). The Commissioner could prohibit the payment of the interest and principal on the surplus notes if certain statutory capital requirements are not met. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company met these statutory
capital requirements.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

(continued)

In September 2009, Prudential Insurance issued in a private placement $500 million
of surplus notes due September 2019 with an interest rate of 5.36% per annum. The surplus notes are exchangeable at the option of the holder, in whole but not in part, for shares of Prudential Financial Common Stock beginning in September 2014,
or earlier upon a fundamental business combination involving Prudential Financial or a continuing payment default. The initial exchange rate for the surplus notes is 10.1235 shares of Common Stock per each $1,000 principal amount of surplus notes,
which represents an initial exchange price per share of Common Stock of $98.78; however, the exchange rate is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The exchange rate is also subject to a make-whole decrease in the event of an exchange
prior to maturity (except upon a fundamental business combination or a continuing payment default), that will result in a reduction in the number of shares issued upon exchange (per $1,000 principal amount of surplus notes) determined by dividing a
prescribed cash reduction value (which will decline over the life of the surplus notes, from $102.62 for an exercise on September 18, 2014 to zero for an exercise at maturity) by the price of the Common Stock at the time of exchange. In
addition, the exchange rate is subject to a customary make-whole increase in connection with an exchange of the surplus notes upon a fundamental business combination where 10% or more of the consideration in that business combination consists of
cash, other property or securities that are not listed on a U.S. national securities exchange.

These exchangeable surplus notes are not redeemable by Prudential Insurance prior to maturity, except in connection with a fundamental business combination involving Prudential Financial, in which case
the surplus notes will be redeemable by Prudential Insurance, subject to the noteholders’ right to exchange the surplus notes instead, at par or, if greater, a make-whole redemption price. The surplus notes are subordinated to all other
Prudential Insurance borrowings and policyholder obligations, except for other surplus notes of Prudential Insurance (including those currently outstanding), with which the surplus notes rank pari passu. Payments of interest and principal on the
surplus notes may only be made with the prior approval of the Commissioner.

During 2007, a subsidiary of Prudential Insurance issued $500 million of 45-year floating rate surplus notes to an unaffiliated financial institution. Surplus notes issued under this facility are
subordinated to policyholder obligations, and the payment of interest and principal on them may only be made by the issuer with the prior approval of the Arizona Department of Insurance. Concurrent with the issuance of these surplus notes,
Prudential Financial entered into a credit derivative that will require Prudential Financial to make certain payments in the event of deterioration in the value of the surplus notes. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the credit derivative was a
liability of $26 million and $22 million, respectively, with no requirement to pledge collateral.

During 2006, a subsidiary of Prudential Insurance entered into a surplus note purchase agreement with an unaffiliated financial institution that provides for the issuance of up to $3,000 million of
ten-year floating rate surplus notes. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, $2,700 million were outstanding under this agreement. Concurrent with the issuance of each surplus note, Prudential Financial enters into arrangements with the buyer, which
are accounted for as derivative instruments that may result in payments by, or to, Prudential Financial over the term of the surplus notes, to the extent there are significant changes in the value of the surplus notes. Surplus notes issued under
this facility are subordinated to policyholder obligations, and the payment of interest and principal on them may only be made by the issuer with the prior approval of the Arizona Department of Insurance. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, these
derivative instruments had no material value.

Junior Subordinated Notes

In June and July 2008, Prudential Financial issued $600 million of 8.875% fixed-to-floating rate junior subordinated notes to
institutional investors and $920 million of 9% fixed-rate junior subordinated notes to retail

(continued)

investors. Both issuances are considered hybrid capital securities, which receive enhanced equity treatment from the rating agencies. Both series of notes have a scheduled maturity of
June 15, 2038 and a final maturity of June 15, 2068. Prudential Financial is required to use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to market disruption events, to raise sufficient proceeds from the issuance of specified qualifying
capital securities, which include hybrid capital securities, to repay the principal of the notes at their scheduled maturity. For the institutional notes, interest is payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 8.875% until June 15, 2018, from
which date interest is payable quarterly at a floating rate of 3-month LIBOR plus 5.00%. Prudential Financial may redeem the institutional notes, subject to the terms of the replacement capital covenant (“RCC”), as discussed below, in
whole or in part, on or after June 15, 2018 at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest or prior to June 15, 2018 at a make-whole price. Prudential Financial may redeem the retail notes, subject to the terms of the RCC as
discussed below, on or after June 15, 2013, in whole or in part, at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest or prior to June 15, 2013, in whole, at a make-whole price. Both series of notes may also be redeemed in whole
upon the occurrence of certain defined events. Prudential Financial has the right to defer interest payments on either or both series of notes for a period up to ten years, during which time interest will be compounded. If Prudential Financial were
to exercise its right to defer interest it will be required, commencing on the earlier of (i) the first interest payment date on which current interest is paid after the deferral period or (ii) the fifth anniversary of the deferral period,
to issue specified alternative payment securities, which include but are not limited to Common Stock, to satisfy its obligation with respect to the deferred interest. In connection with the issuance of both series of notes, Prudential Financial
entered into a RCC for the benefit of holders of the Company’s 6.625% Senior Notes due 2037. Under the RCC, Prudential Financial agreed that it will not repay, redeem, defease, or purchase the notes prior to June 15, 2048, unless it has
received proceeds from the issuance of specified replacement capital securities, which include but are not limited to hybrid capital securities as well as Common Stock. The RCC will terminate upon the occurrence of certain events, including
acceleration due to an event of default.

Term
Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility

During
2009, the Company purchased securities under the Federal Reserve’s Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (“TALF”). The TALF is designed to provide secured financing for the acquisition of certain types of asset-backed securities,
including certain high-quality commercial mortgage-backed securities issued before January 1, 2009. TALF financing is non-recourse to the borrower, is collateralized by the purchased securities and provides financing for the purchase price of
the securities, less a ‘haircut’ that varies based on the type of collateral. Borrowers under the program can deliver the collateralized securities to a special purpose vehicle created by the Federal Reserve in full defeasance of the loan.

During 2009, the Company obtained $1,167 million
of secured financing from the Federal Reserve under this program. In 2009, the Company sold a portion of the securities purchased under the program and used the proceeds to repay $738 million of the borrowings. In 2010, the Company sold a portion of
the remaining securities purchased under the program and used the proceeds, as well as internal sources of cash, to repay the remaining $429 million of the borrowings.

Prudential Financial maintains a Medium-term Notes, Series D program under its shelf registration statement
with an authorized issuance capacity of $20 billion. The following table presents Prudential Financial’s 2010 issuances under this program:

Retail Medium-term Notes

Prudential Financial also maintains a retail medium-term notes program, including the InterNotes

program, under its shelf registration statement with an authorized issuance capacity of $5.0 billion. As of
December 31, 2010, the outstanding balance of retail notes was $2.8 billion, a decrease of $450 million from December 31, 2009, resulting primarily from maturities and redemptions at the request of the Company.

Other

In order to modify exposure to interest rate and currency
exchange rate movements, the Company utilizes derivative instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt issues. The impact of these derivative instruments are not reflected in the rates presented in the tables
above. For those derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment, interest expense was increased by $5 million and by $13 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. See Note 21 for additional
information on the Company’s use of derivative instruments.

Interest expense for short-term and long-term debt was $1,224 million, $1,168 million and $1,396 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. This includes interest
expense of $39 million, $93 million and $152 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, reported in “Net investment income.”

Included in “Policyholders’ account balances”
are additional debt obligations of the Company. See Notes 10 and 5 for further discussion.

Prudential Holdings, LLC Notes

On December 18, 2001, the date of demutualization, Prudential Holdings, LLC (“PHLLC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial, issued $1,750 million in senior secured notes (the
“IHC debt”). PHLLC owns the capital stock of Prudential Insurance and does not have any operating businesses of its own. The IHC debt represents senior secured obligations of PHLLC with limited recourse; neither Prudential Financial,
Prudential Insurance nor any other affiliate of PHLLC is an obligor or guarantor on the IHC debt. The IHC debt is collateralized by 13.8% of the outstanding common stock of Prudential Insurance and other items specified in the indenture, primarily
the “Debt Service Coverage Account” (the “DSCA”) discussed below.

PHLLC’s ability to meet its obligations under the IHC debt is dependent principally upon sufficient available funds being generated by the Closed Block Business and the ability of Prudential
Insurance, the sole



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(continued)

direct subsidiary of PHLLC, to dividend such funds to PHLLC. The payment of scheduled principal and interest on the Series A notes and the Series B notes is insured by a financial guarantee
insurance policy. The payment of principal and interest on the Series C notes is not insured. The IHC debt is redeemable prior to its stated maturity at the option of PHLLC and, in the event of certain circumstances, the IHC debt bond insurer can
require PHLLC to redeem the IHC debt.

Net
proceeds from the IHC debt amounted to $1,727 million. The majority of the net proceeds, or $1,218 million, was distributed to Prudential Financial through a dividend on the date of demutualization for use in the Financial Services Businesses.
In addition, $72 million was used to purchase a guaranteed investment contract to fund a portion of the financial guarantee insurance premium related to the IHC debt. The remainder of the net proceeds was deposited to a restricted account within
PHLLC, referred to as the DSCA, and constitutes collateral for the IHC debt. The balance in the DSCA was $728 million as of December 31, 2010.

Summarized consolidated financial data for Prudential Holdings, LLC is presented below.

Prudential Financial is a
holding company and is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. The rights of Prudential Financial to participate in any distribution of assets of any subsidiary, including upon its liquidation or reorganization, are subject to
the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary, except to the extent that Prudential Financial may itself be a creditor of that subsidiary and its claims are recognized. PHLLC and its subsidiaries have entered into covenants and arrangements with
third parties in connection with the issuance of the IHC debt which are intended to confirm their separate, “bankruptcy-remote” status, by assuring that the assets of PHLLC and its subsidiaries are not available to creditors of Prudential
Financial or its other subsidiaries,



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

(continued)

except and to the extent that Prudential Financial and its other subsidiaries are, as shareholders or creditors of PHLLC and its subsidiaries, or would be, entitled to those assets.

At December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with
all IHC debt covenants.

15.    EQUITY

The Company has outstanding two classes of common stock: the
Common Stock and the Class B Stock. The changes in the number of shares issued, held in treasury and outstanding are as follows for the periods indicated:

(1)

Represents net shares issued from treasury pursuant to the Company’s stock-based compensation program as discussed in Note 17.

(2)

In June 2009, the Company issued 36,858,975 shares of Common Stock in a public offering at a price of $39.00 per share for net proceeds of $1.391 billion.

(3)

In November 2010, the Company issued 18,348,624 shares of Common Stock in a public offering at a price of $54.50 per share for net proceeds of $970 million.

Common Stock and Class B Stock

On the date of demutualization,
Prudential Financial completed an initial public offering of its Common Stock at an initial public offering price of $27.50 per share. The shares of Common Stock issued were in addition to shares of Common Stock the Company distributed to
policyholders as part of the demutualization. The Common Stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “PRU.” Also on the date of demutualization, Prudential Financial completed the sale, through a private placement, of
2.0 million shares of Class B Stock at a price of $87.50 per share. The Class B Stock is a separate class of common stock which is not publicly traded. The Common Stock reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Class
B Stock reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business.

Holders of Common Stock have no interest in a separate legal entity representing the Financial Services Businesses and holders of the Class B Stock have no interest in a separate legal entity representing
the Closed

Block Business and holders of each class of common stock are subject to all of the risks associated with an investment in the
Company.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

15.    EQUITY

(continued)

In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, holders of
Common Stock and holders of Class B Stock would be entitled to receive a proportionate share of the net assets of the Company that remain after paying all liabilities and the liquidation preferences of any preferred stock.

Common Stock Held in Treasury

Common Stock held in treasury is accounted for at average
cost. Gains resulting from the reissuance of “Common Stock held in treasury” are credited to “Additional paid-in capital.” Losses resulting from the reissuance of “Common Stock held in treasury” are charged first to
“Additional paid-in capital” to the extent the Company has previously recorded gains on treasury share transactions, then to “Retained earnings.”

In November 2007, Prudential Financial’s Board of
Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $3.5 billion of its outstanding Common Stock in calendar year 2008. During 2008, the Company acquired 29.3 million shares of its outstanding Common Stock at a total cost of $2.161 billion. In
light of market conditions in 2008, the Company suspended all purchases of its Common Stock under the 2008 stock repurchase program effective October 10, 2008.

The timing and amount of repurchases under these
authorizations were determined by management based upon market conditions and other considerations, with repurchases effected in the open market, through derivative, accelerated repurchase and other negotiated transactions and through prearranged
trading plans complying with Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Exchange Act.

Stock Conversion Rights of the Class B Stock

Prudential Financial may, at its option, at any time, exchange all outstanding shares of Class B Stock into such number of shares of
Common Stock as have an aggregate average market value equal to 120% of the appraised fair market value of the outstanding shares of Class B Stock.

Holders of Class B Stock will be permitted to convert their shares of Class B Stock into such number of shares of Common Stock as have an
aggregate average market value equal to 100% of the appraised fair market value of the outstanding shares of Class B Stock (1) in the holder’s sole discretion, in the year 2016 or at any time thereafter, and (2) at any time in the
event that (a) the Class B Stock will no longer be treated as equity of Prudential Financial for federal income tax purposes or (b) the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance amends, alters, changes or modifies the regulation of
the Closed Block, the Closed Block Business, the Class B Stock or the IHC debt in a manner that materially adversely affects the “CB Distributable Cash Flow”; provided, however, that in no event may a holder of Class B Stock convert shares
of Class B Stock to the extent such holder immediately upon such conversion, together with its affiliates, would be the beneficial owner (as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of in excess of 9.9% of the total outstanding voting
power of Prudential Financial’s voting securities. In the event a holder of shares of Class B Stock requests to convert shares pursuant to clause (2)(a) in the preceding sentence, Prudential Financial may elect, instead of effecting such
conversion, to increase the Target Dividend Amount to $12.6875 per share per annum retroactively from the time of issuance of the Class B Stock.

Dividends

The principal sources of funds available to Prudential Financial, the parent holding company, are dividends, returns of capital and
interest income from its subsidiaries, and cash and short-term investments. The primary uses of funds at Prudential Financial include servicing its debt and the payment of declared shareholder dividends, operating expenses and capital contributions
and obligations to its subsidiaries.

The regulated insurance and various other subsidiaries are subject to regulatory
limitations on their payment of dividends and other transfers of funds to Prudential Financial. With respect to Prudential Insurance, New Jersey insurance law provides that, except in the case of extraordinary dividends (as described below), all
dividends or other distributions paid by Prudential Insurance may be paid only from unassigned surplus, as determined pursuant to statutory accounting principles, less unrealized investment gains and losses and revaluation of assets as of the prior
calendar year-end. As of December 31, 2010, Prudential Insurance’s unassigned surplus was $4,224 million, and it recorded applicable adjustments for cumulative unrealized investment gains of $1,499 million. Prudential Insurance must give
prior notification to the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (the “Department”) of its intent to pay any dividend or distribution. Also, if any dividend, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding
twelve months, exceeds the greater of (i) 10% of Prudential Insurance’s statutory surplus as of the preceding December 31 ($8,364 million as of December 31, 2010) or (ii) its statutory net gain from operations excluding
realized investment gains and losses for the twelve month period ending on the preceding December 31, ($1,127 million for the year ended December 31, 2010), the dividend is considered to be an “extraordinary dividend” and the
prior approval of the Department is required for the payment of the dividend.

The laws regulating dividends of Prudential Financial’s other insurance subsidiaries domiciled in other states and foreign jurisdictions are similar, but not identical, to New Jersey’s. Further,
as a result of Gibraltar Life’s reorganization, in addition to regulatory restrictions, there are certain other restrictions that preclude Gibraltar Life from paying dividends to Prudential Financial in the near term.

The declaration and payment of dividends on the Common Stock
depends primarily upon the financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors relating to the Financial Services Businesses. Furthermore, dividends on the Common Stock are limited to both the amount
that is legally available for payment under New Jersey corporate law if the Financial Services Businesses were treated as a separate corporation thereunder and the amount that is legally available for payment under New Jersey corporate law on a
consolidated basis after taking into account dividends on the Class B Stock.

The declaration and payment of dividends on the Class B Stock depends upon the financial performance of the Closed Block Business and, as the Closed Block matures, the holders of the Class B Stock will
receive the surplus of the Closed Block Business no longer required to support the Closed Block for regulatory purposes. Dividends on the Class B Stock are payable in an aggregate amount per year at least equal to the lesser of (1) a Target
Dividend Amount of $19.25 million or (2) the CB Distributable Cash Flow for such year, which is a measure of the net cash flows of the Closed Block Business. Notwithstanding this formula, as with any common stock, Prudential Financial retains
the flexibility to suspend dividends on the Class B Stock; however, if CB Distributable Cash Flow exists and Prudential Financial chooses not to pay dividends on the Class B Stock in an aggregate amount at least equal to the lesser of the CB
Distributable Cash Flow or the Target Dividend Amount for any period, then cash dividends cannot be paid on the Common Stock with respect to such period.

Preferred Stock

Prudential Financial adopted a shareholder rights plan (the “rights plan”) under which each outstanding share of Common Stock is
coupled with a shareholder right. The rights plan is not applicable to any Class B Stock. Each right initially entitles the holder to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of a series of Prudential Financial preferred stock upon payment of the
exercise price. At the time of the demutualization, the Board of Directors of Prudential Financial determined that the initial exercise price per right is $110, subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in the rights plan. There was no
preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

required to prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the state

of domicile. Statutory accounting practices primarily differ from U.S. GAAP by charging policy acquisition costs to expense as incurred, establishing future policy benefit liabilities using
different actuarial assumptions as well as valuing investments and certain assets and accounting for deferred taxes on a different basis. Statutory net income (loss) of Prudential Insurance amounted to $1,623 million, $1,101 million and $(808)
million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Statutory capital and surplus of Prudential Insurance amounted to $8,364 million and $10,042 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

All of the Company’s international insurance operations
also prepare financial statements in accordance with local regulatory requirements. The regulatory authorities in these international jurisdictions generally establish some form of minimum solvency margin requirements. All of the international
insurance operations have surplus levels that exceed the local minimum requirements.

16.    EARNINGS PER SHARE

The Company has outstanding two separate classes of common
stock. The Common Stock reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Class B Stock reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business. Accordingly, earnings per share is calculated separately for each of these two classes
of common stock.

Net income for the Financial
Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business is determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes general and administrative expenses charged to each of the respective businesses based on the Company’s methodology for the allocation of
such expenses. Cash flows between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business related to administrative expenses are determined by a policy servicing fee arrangement that is based upon insurance and policies in force and
statutory cash premiums. To the extent reported administrative expenses vary from these cash flow amounts, the differences are recorded, on an after tax basis, as direct equity adjustments to the equity balances of the businesses.

The direct equity adjustments modify the earnings available
to each of the classes of common stock for earnings per share purposes.

(continued)

Common Stock

A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the
basic and diluted per share computations is as follows:

(1)

For the year ended December 31, 2008, weighted average shares for basic earnings per share is also used for calculating diluted earnings per share because dilutive
shares and dilutive earnings per share are not applicable when a loss from continuing operations is reported. As a result of the loss from continuing operations available to holders of Common Stock after direct equity adjustment for the year ended
December 31, 2008, all potential stock options and compensation programs were considered antidilutive.

Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and included in the
computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Under this method, earnings of the Financial Services Businesses attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. are allocated between Common Stock and the participating awards, as if
the awards were a second class of stock. Undistributed earnings allocated to participating unvested share-based payment awards for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was based on 6.1 million and 5.0 million of such awards,
respectively, weighted for the period they were outstanding. For the year ended December 31, 2008, undistributed earnings were not allocated to participating unvested share-based payment awards as these awards do not participate in losses.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

16.    EARNINGS PER SHARE

(continued)

Distributed earnings are allocated to participating unvested share-based payment awards based on actual dividends paid. The computation of earnings per share of Common Stock excludes the dilutive
impact of participating unvested share-based awards based on the application of the two-class method.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, 10.5 million options, weighted for the portion of the period they were outstanding, with a
weighted average exercise price of $71.67 per share, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options, based on application of the treasury stock method, were antidilutive. For the year ended December 31,
2009, 13.2 million options, weighted for the portion of the period they were outstanding, with a weighted average exercise price of $64.80 per share, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options, based on
application of the treasury stock method, were antidilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2008, 17.9 million options and 4.3 million shares related to deferred and long-term compensation programs, weighted for the portion of the
period they were outstanding, are considered antidilutive as a result of the loss from continuing operations available to holders of Common Stock after direct equity adjustment.

In September 2009, the Company issued $500 million of surplus
notes with an interest rate of 5.36% per annum which are exchangeable at the option of the note holders for shares of Common Stock. The exchange rate used in the diluted earnings per share calculation for the surplus notes is 10.1235 shares of
Common Stock per each $1,000 principal amount of surplus notes. In calculating diluted earnings per share under the if-converted method, the potential shares that would be issued assuming a hypothetical exchange, weighted for the period the notes
are outstanding, is added to the denominator, and interest expense, net of tax, is added to the numerator, if the overall effect is dilutive. See Note 14 for additional information regarding the exchangeable surplus notes.

The Company’s convertible senior notes provide for the
Company to issue shares of its Common Stock as a component of the conversion of the notes. As of December 31, 2010, $0.4 million of senior notes related to the $2.0 billion December 2006 issuance remain outstanding. These will be dilutive to
earnings per share if the average market price of the Common Stock for a particular period is above the initial conversion price of $104.21.

Omnibus Incentive Plan

In March 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted
the Prudential Financial, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (as subsequently amended and restated, the “Omnibus Plan”). Upon adoption of the Omnibus Plan, the Prudential Financial, Inc. Stock Option Plan previously adopted by the Company on
January 9, 2001 (the “Option Plan”) was merged into the Omnibus Plan. The nature of stock based awards provided under the Omnibus Plan are stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock shares, restricted stock units,
stock settled performance shares, and cash settled performance units. Dividend equivalents are generally provided on restricted stock shares and restricted stock units outstanding as of the record date. Dividend equivalents are generally accrued on
target performance shares and units outstanding as of the record date. These dividend equivalents are paid only on the shares and units released up to a maximum of the target number of shares and units awarded. Generally, the requisite service
period is the vesting period.

As of
December 31, 2010, 25,951,113 authorized shares remain available for grant under the Omnibus Plan including previously authorized but unissued shares under the Option Plan.

Compensation Costs

Compensation cost for employee stock options is based on the
fair values estimated on the grant date, while compensation cost for non-employee stock options is re-estimated at each period-end through the vesting date, using the approach and assumptions described below. Compensation cost for restricted stock
shares, restricted stock units and performance shares and units granted to employees is measured by the share price of the underlying Common Stock at the date of grant. Compensation cost for restricted stock shares and restricted stock units granted
to non-employees is measured by the share price as of the balance sheet date for unvested shares and the share price at the vesting date for vested shares.

The fair value of each stock option award is estimated using a binomial option-pricing model on the date of grant for stock options issued
to employees and the balance sheet date or vesting date for stock options issued to non-employees. The weighted average grant date assumptions used in the binomial option valuation model are as follows:

Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Company’s Common Stock and implied volatilities from traded options on the Company’s Common Stock. The Company uses historical
data and expectations of future exercise patterns to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be
outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

Compensation costs for all stock
based compensation plans capitalized in deferred acquisition costs for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were de minimis.

Stock Options

Each stock option granted has an exercise price no less than the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant
and has a maximum term of 10 years. Generally, one third of the option grant vests in each of the first three years. Participants are employees and non-employees (i.e., statutory agents who perform services for the Company and participating
subsidiaries).

A summary of the status of the
Company’s employee and non-employee stock option grants is as follows:

years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $18.00, $9.83 and $14.38, respectively.

The total intrinsic value (i.e., market price of the stock less the option exercise price) of employee stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $35 million,
$11 million and $50 million, respectively.

Restricted Stock Shares,
Restricted Stock Units, Performance Share Awards, and Performance Unit Awards

A restricted stock share represents a grant of Common Stock to employee and non-employee participants that is subject to certain transfer restrictions and forfeiture provisions for a specified period of
time. A restricted stock unit is an unfunded, unsecured right to receive a share of Common Stock at the end of a specified period of time, which is also subject to forfeiture and transfer restrictions. Generally, the restrictions on restricted stock
shares and restricted stock units will lapse on the third anniversary of the date of grant. Restricted stock shares subject to the transfer restrictions and forfeiture provisions are considered nonvested shares and are not reflected as outstanding
shares until the restrictions expire. Performance shares and performance units are awards denominated in Common Stock. The number of units is determined over the performance period, and may be adjusted based on the satisfaction of certain
performance goals. Performance share awards are payable in Common Stock. Performance unit awards are payable in cash.

Stock Purchase Plan

At the Annual Meeting of the Shareholders of the Company held on June 7, 2005, the shareholders approved the Prudential Financial, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The plan is a qualified Employee
Stock Purchase



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

17.    SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

(continued)

Plan under Section 423 of the Code. Under the plan, eligible participants may purchase shares based upon quarterly offering periods at an amount equal to the lesser of (1) 85% of the
closing market price of the Common Stock on the first day of the quarterly offering period, or (2) 85% of the closing market price of the Common Stock on the last day of the quarterly offering period. Participant contributions will be limited
to the lower of 10% of eligible earnings or $25,000. Participants are employees and non-employees (i.e., statutory agents who perform services for the Company and participating subsidiaries).

Compensation cost for employees is recognized for each three-month period and is based on the grant date fair
value of the discount received under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. This fair value is estimated using the 15% discount off of the grant date share price, plus the value of three month call and put options on shares at the grant date share price,
less the value of forgone interest. Compensation costs recognized for employees under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $12 million, $17 million and $12 million,
respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value for employee shares recognized in compensation cost for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $13.06, $10.05 and $18.33, respectively.

Compensation cost for non-employees is recognized for each
three-month period and is based on the fair value of shares at the purchase date less the price the participant pays for the shares. Compensation costs recognized for non-employees under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan for the years
ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $1 million, $2 million and $1 million, respectively. The weighted average fair value for non-employee shares recognized in compensation cost for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008
was $10.88, $13.92 and $14.64, respectively.

Tax
benefits are only recorded in the event of a disqualifying disposition under the revised authoritative guidance on accounting for stock based compensation. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, tax benefits realized upon
disqualifying dispositions for both employees and non-employees were de minimis.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, 1,092,676 shares were purchased under the plan, including those shares purchased in January 2010 related to the October 1 to December 31, 2009
offering period. During the year ended December 31, 2009, 2,103,950 shares were purchased under the plan, including those shares purchased in January 2009 related to the October 1 to December 31, 2008 offering period. During the year
ended December 31, 2008, 772,070 shares were purchased under the plan, including those shares purchased in January 2008 related to October 1 to December 31 2007 offering period. As of December 31, 2010, 21,921,139 authorized
shares remain available for future issuance under the plan.

Settlement of Awards

The Company’s policy is to issue shares from Common Stock held in treasury upon exercise of employee and non-employee stock options,
the release of restricted stock shares, restricted stock units, and performance shares, as well as for purchases under the stock purchase plan. Performance units will be settled in cash in the future.

In addition to the plan assets above, the Company in 2007 established an irrevocable
trust, commonly referred to as a “rabbi trust,” for the purpose of holding assets of the Company to be used to satisfy its obligations with respect to certain non-qualified retirement plans ($860 million and $791 million benefit obligation
at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively). Assets held in the rabbi trust are available to the general creditors of the Company in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy. The Company may from time to time in its discretion make contributions
to the trust to fund accrued benefits payable to participants in one or more of the plans, and, in the case of a change in control of the Company, as defined in the trust agreement, the Company will be required to make contributions to the trust to
fund the accrued benefits, vested and unvested, payable on a pretax basis to participants in the plans. The Company made a discretionary payment of $95 million to the trust during both 2010 and 2009. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the assets
in the trust had a carrying value of $390 million and $281 million, respectively.

The Company also maintains a separate rabbi trust established at the time of the combination of its retail securities brokerage and clearing operations with those of Wachovia for the purpose of holding
assets of the Company to be used to satisfy its obligations with respect to certain non-qualified retirement plans ($74 million and $75 million benefit obligation at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively), as well as certain cash-based
deferred compensation arrangements. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the assets in the trust had a carrying value of $124 million and $124 million, respectively.

Pension benefits for foreign plans comprised 13% and 12% of
the ending benefit obligation for 2010 and 2009, respectively. Foreign pension plans comprised 2% of the ending fair value of plan assets for 2010 and 2009. There are no material foreign postretirement plans.

The Company’s assumptions
related to the calculation of the domestic benefit obligation (end of period) and the determination of net periodic (benefit) cost (beginning of period) are presented in the table below. The assumptions for 2008 use September 30, 2007 for
beginning of period and December 31, 2008 for end of period. The assumptions for 2009 use December 31, 2008 as the beginning of period and December 31, 2009 for end of period. The assumptions for 2010 use December 31, 2009 as the
beginning of period and December 31, 2010 for end of period:

The domestic discount rate used to value the pension and postretirement obligations at December 31, 2010 is based upon the value of a portfolio of Aa investments whose cash flows would be available
to pay the benefit obligation’s cash flows when due. The portfolio is selected from a compilation of approximately 600 Aa-rated bonds across the full range of maturities. Since yields can vary widely at each maturity point, the Company
generally avoids using the highest and lowest yielding bonds at the maturity points, so as to avoid relying on bonds that might be mispriced or misrated. This refinement process generally results in having a distribution from the 10th to 90th
percentile. The Aa portfolio is then selected and, accordingly, its value is a measure of the benefit obligation at December 31, 2010. A single equivalent discount rate is calculated to equate the value of the Aa portfolio to the cash flows for
the benefit obligation. The result is rounded to the nearest 5 basis points and the benefit obligation is recalculated using the rounded discount rate.

The domestic discount rate used to value the pension and postretirement benefit obligations at December 31, 2009 and 2008 is based
upon rates commensurate with current yields on high quality corporate bonds. The first step in determining the discount rate is the compilation of approximately 300 Aa-rated bonds across the full

range of maturities. Since yields can vary widely at each maturity point, the Company generally avoids using the highest and lowest yielding bonds at the maturity points, so as to avoid relying
on bonds that might be mispriced or misrated. This refinement process generally results in having a distribution from the

th

to 90

th

percentile. A spot yield curve is developed from this data that is
then used to determine the present value of the expected disbursements associated with the pension and postretirement obligations, respectively. This results in the present value for each respective benefit obligation. A single discount rate is
calculated that results in the same present value. The rate is then rounded to the nearest 25 basis points and the benefit obligation is recalculated using the rounded discount rate.

The pension and postretirement expected long-term rates of return on plan assets for 2010 were determined based
upon an approach that considered an expectation of the allocation of plan assets during the measurement period of 2010. Expected returns are estimated by asset class as noted in the discussion of investment policies and strategies below. Expected
returns on asset classes are developed using a building-block approach that is forward looking and are not strictly based upon historical returns. The building blocks for equity returns include inflation, real return, a term premium, an equity risk
premium, capital appreciation, effect of active management, expenses and the effect of rebalancing. The building blocks for fixed maturity returns include inflation, real return, a term premium, credit spread, capital appreciation, effect of active
management, expenses and the effect of rebalancing.

The Company applied the same approach to the determination of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in 2011. The expected
long-term rate of return for 2011 is 7.0% for both the pension and postretirement plans.

The Company, with respect to its domestic qualified pension benefits, uses market related value to determine the components of net periodic (benefit) cost. Market related value is a measure of asset value
that reflects the difference between actual and expected return on assets over a five-year period.

The assumptions for foreign pension plans are based on local markets. There are no material foreign postretirement plans.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant
effect on the amounts reported for the health care plan. A one-percentage point increase and decrease in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

Plan Assets

The investment goal of the domestic pension plan assets is to generate an above benchmark return on a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds and other investments, while meeting the cash requirements for
a pension obligation that includes a traditional formula principally representing payments to annuitants and a cash balance formula that allows lump sum payments and annuity payments. The pension plan risk management practices

include guidelines for asset concentration, credit rating and liquidity. The pension plan does not invest in leveraged derivatives. Derivatives such as futures contracts are used to reduce
transaction costs and change asset concentration, while interest rate swaps are used to adjust duration.

The investment goal of the domestic postretirement plan assets is to generate an above benchmark return on a diversified portfolio of
stocks, bonds, and other investments, while meeting the cash requirements for the postretirement obligation that includes a medical benefit including prescription drugs, a dental benefit, and a life benefit. The postretirement plans risk management
practices include guidelines for asset concentration, credit rating, liquidity, and tax efficiency. The postretirement plan does not invest in leveraged derivatives. Derivatives such as futures contracts are used to reduce transaction costs and
change asset concentration, while interest rate swaps are used to adjust duration.

The plan fiduciaries for the Company’s pension and postretirement plans have developed guidelines for asset allocations reflecting a percentage of total assets by asset class, which are reviewed on
an annual basis. Asset allocation targets as of December 31, 2010 are as follows:

To implement the investment strategy, plan assets are invested in funds that primarily invest in securities that correspond to one of the asset categories under the investment guidelines. However, at any
point in time, some of the assets in a fund may be of a different nature than the specified asset category.

Assets held with Prudential Insurance are in either pooled separate accounts or single client separate accounts. Pooled separate accounts
hold assets for multiple investors. Each investor owns a “unit of account.” Single client separate accounts hold assets for only one investor, the domestic qualified pension plan and each security in the fund is treated as individually
owned. Assets held with a bank are either in common/collective trusts or single client trusts. Common or collective trusts hold assets for more than one investor. Each investor owns a “unit of account.” Single client trusts hold assets for
only one investor, the domestic qualified pension plan and each security in the fund is treated as individually owned.

There were no investments in Prudential Financial Common Stock as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 for either the
pension or postretirement plans. Pension plan assets of $6,944 million and $6,393 million are included in the Company’s separate account assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.

The authoritative guidance around fair value established a
framework for measuring fair value. Fair value is disclosed using a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value, as described in Note 20.

The following describes the valuation methodologies used for
pension and postretirement plans assets measured at fair value.

Insurance Company Pooled Separate Accounts, Common or Collective Trusts, and United Kingdom Insurance Pooled Funds

—Insurance company pooled separate accounts are invested via group annuity
contracts

issued by Prudential Insurance. Assets are represented by a “unit of account.” The redemption value of those units is based on a per unit value whose value is the result of the
accumulated values of underlying investments. The underlying investments are valued in accordance with the corresponding valuation method for the investments held.

Equities

—See Note 20 for a discussion of the
valuation methodologies for equity securities.

U.S. Government Securities (both Federal and State & Other), Non–U.S. Government Securities, and Corporate
Debt

—See Note 20 for a discussion of the valuation methodologies for fixed maturity securities.

Interest Rate Swaps

—See Note 20 for a discussion of the valuation methodologies for derivative instruments.

Guaranteed Investment Contract

—The value is based
on contract cash flows and available market rates for similar investments.

Registered Investment Companies (Mutual Funds)

—Securities are priced at the net asset value (“NAV”) of shares.

Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investment of Securities Lending
Collateral

—This value is the contractual position relative to the investment of securities lending collateral.

Real Estate

—The values are determined through an independent appraisal process. The estimate of fair value is based on three
approaches; (1) current cost of reproducing the property less deterioration and functional/economic obsolescence; (2) discounting a series of income streams and reversion at a specific yield or by directly capitalizing a single year income
estimate by an appropriate factor; and (3) value indicated by recent sales of comparable properties in the market. Each approach requires the exercise of subjective judgment.

Short-term Investments

—Securities are valued
initially at cost and thereafter adjusted for amortization of any discount or premium (i.e., amortized cost). Amortized Cost approximates fair value.

Partnerships

—The value of interests owned in partnerships is based on valuations of the underlying investments that include
private placements, structured debt, real estate, equities, fixed maturities, commodities and other investments.

Structured Debt (Gateway Recovery Trust)

—The value is based primarily on unobservable inputs including probability weighted
cash flows and reinvestment yield assumptions.

Hedge Funds

—The value of interests in hedge funds is based on the underlying investments that include equities, debt and other
investments.

Variable Life Insurance
Policies

—These assets are held in group and individual variable life insurance policies issued by Prudential Insurance. Group policies are invested in Insurance Company Pooled Separate Accounts. Individual policies are invested in
Registered Investment Companies (Mutual Funds). The value of interest in these policies is the cash surrender value of the policies based on the underlying investments.

The expected benefit payments for the Company’s pension and postretirement plans,
as well as the expected Medicare Part D subsidy receipts related to the Company’s postretirement plan, for the years indicated are as follows:

The Company anticipates that it
will make cash contributions in 2011 of approximately $110 million to the pension plans and approximately $10 million to the postretirement plans.

Postemployment Benefits

The Company accrues postemployment benefits for income continuance and health and life benefits provided to former or inactive employees
who are not retirees. The net accumulated liability for these benefits at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $33 million and $38 million, respectively, and is included in “Other liabilities.”

Deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, resulted from the items listed
in the following table:

The application of U.S. GAAP
requires the Company to evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not expected to be realized. Considerable judgment is
required in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, and if so, the amount of such valuation allowance. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance the Company considers many factors, including: (1) the nature of the
deferred tax assets and liabilities; (2) whether they are ordinary or capital; (3) in which tax jurisdictions they were generated and the timing of their reversal; (4) taxable income in prior carryback years as well as projected
taxable earnings exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards; (5) the length of time that carryovers can be utilized in the various taxing jurisdictions; (6) any unique tax rules that would impact the utilization of the
deferred tax assets; and (7) any tax planning strategies that the Company would employ to avoid a tax benefit from expiring unused. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax
assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.

A valuation allowance has been recorded primarily related to tax benefits associated with state and local and foreign deferred tax assets. Adjustments to the valuation allowance are made to reflect
changes in management’s assessment of the amount of the deferred tax asset that is realizable. The valuation allowance includes amounts recorded in connection with deferred tax assets at December 31, as follows:

The Company does not provide U.S. income taxes on unremitted foreign earnings of its non-U.S. operations, other
than its operations in Japan and certain operations in Canada, Mexico, India, Germany, and Taiwan. During 2008, the Company made no changes with respect to its repatriation assumptions. During 2009, the Company sold its investment in its Mexican
subsidiaries Prudential Financial Operadora de Sociedades de Inversion S.A. de C.V., Prudential Bank, S.A. Institucion de Banca, and Prudential Consultoria S de RL de C.V. Accordingly, the earnings were no longer considered permanently reinvested
and the Company recognized an income tax expense of $6 million related to the sale in “Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes” in 2009. In addition, in 2009, the Company determined, due to the pending sale considerations, that
the earnings from certain of its Korean investment management subsidiaries would be repatriated to the U.S. Accordingly, earnings from those Korean investment management subsidiaries were no longer considered permanently reinvested and the Company
recognized an income tax expense of $66 million associated with the assumed repatriation of those earnings in “Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes” in 2009. During 2010, the Company made no material changes with respect to
its repatriation assumptions.

The following table
sets forth the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, where the Company assumes permanent reinvestment, for which U.S. deferred taxes have not been provided, as of the periods indicated. Determining the tax liability that would arise if
these earnings were remitted is not practicable.

The Company’s unrecognized tax benefits for the periods indicated are as follows:

The Company classifies all
interest and penalties related to tax uncertainties as income tax expense (benefit). The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for tax-related interest and penalties for the years ended December 31, are as follows:

The Company’s liability for income taxes includes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties which relate to tax years still subject to review by the Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS”) or other taxing authorities. Audit periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed. Generally, for tax years which produce net operating losses, capital losses or tax credit carryforwards (“tax
attributes”), the statute of limitations does not close, to the extent of these tax attributes, until the expiration of the statute of limitations for the tax year in which they are fully utilized. The completion of review or the expiration of
the statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the liability for income taxes. The statute of limitations for the 2002 tax year expired on April 30, 2009. The statute of limitations for the 2003 tax year
expired on July 31, 2009. The statute of limitations for the 2004 through 2007 tax years will expire in February 2012, unless extended. Tax years 2008 and 2009 are still open for IRS examination. The Company does not anticipate any significant
changes within the next 12 months to its total unrecognized tax benefits related to tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired.

As discussed above, the completion of review or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an
adjustment to the liability for income taxes. As such, 2009 benefited from a reduction to

the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of $272 million, primarily related to tax years prior to 2002 as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations for the
2002 and 2003 tax years.

The dividends received
deduction (“DRD”) reduces the amount of dividend income subject to U.S. tax and is the primary component of the non-taxable investment income shown in the table above, and, as such, is a significant component of the difference between the
Company’s effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate of 35%. The DRD for the current period was estimated using information from 2009, current year results, and was adjusted to take into account the current year’s equity market
performance. The actual current year DRD can vary from the estimate based on factors such as, but not limited to, changes in the amount of dividends received that are eligible for the DRD, changes in the amount of distributions received from mutual
fund investments, changes in the account balances of variable life and annuity contracts, and the Company’s taxable income before the DRD.

In August 2007, the IRS released Revenue Ruling 2007-54, which included, among other items, guidance on the methodology to be followed in
calculating the DRD related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts. In September 2007, the IRS released Revenue Ruling 2007-61. Revenue Ruling 2007-61 suspended Revenue Ruling 2007-54 and informed taxpayers that the U.S. Treasury
Department and the IRS intend to address through new regulations the issues considered in Revenue Ruling 2007-54, including the methodology to be followed in determining the DRD related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts. On
February 14, 2011, the Obama Administration released the “General Explanations of the Administration’s Revenue Proposals.” Although the Administration has not released proposed statutory language, one proposal would change the
method used to determine the amount of the DRD. A change in the DRD, including the possible retroactive or prospective elimination of this deduction through regulation or legislation, could increase actual tax expense and reduce the Company’s
consolidated net income. These activities had no impact on the Company’s 2008, 2009 or 2010 results.

In December 2006, the IRS completed all fieldwork with respect to its examination of the consolidated federal income tax returns for tax
years 2002 and 2003. The final report was initially submitted to the Joint Committee on Taxation for their review in April 2007. The final report was resubmitted in March 2008 and again in April 2008. The Joint Committee returned the report to the
IRS for additional review of an industry issue regarding the methodology for calculating the DRD related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts. The IRS completed its review of the issue and proposed an adjustment with respect to the
calculation of the DRD. In order to expedite receipt of an income tax refund related to the 2002 and 2003 tax years, the Company agreed to such adjustment. The report, with the adjustment to the DRD, was submitted to the Joint Committee on Taxation
in October 2008. The Company was advised on January 2, 2009 that the Joint Committee completed its consideration of the report and took no exception to the conclusions reached by the IRS. Accordingly, the final report was processed and a $157
million refund was received in February 2009. The Company believed that its return position with respect to the calculation of the DRD was technically correct. Therefore, the Company filed protective refund claims on October 1, 2009 to recover
the taxes associated with the agreed upon adjustment. The IRS recently issued an Industry Director Directive (“IDD”) stating that the methodology for calculating the DRD set forth in Revenue Ruling 2007-54 should not be followed. The IDD
also confirmed that the IRS guidance issued before Revenue Ruling 2007-54, which guidance the Company relied upon in calculating its DRD, should be used to determine the DRD. The Company is working with its IRS audit team to bring the DRD issue to a
close in accordance with the IDD. These activities had no impact on the Company’s 2008, 2009 or 2010 results.

In January 2007, the IRS began an examination of tax years 2004 through 2006. For tax years 2007 through 2010, the Company is
participating in the IRS’s Compliance Assurance Program (“CAP”). Under CAP, the IRS assigns an examination team to review completed transactions contemporaneously during these tax years in order to reach agreement with the Company on
how they should be reported in the tax returns. If disagreements arise, accelerated resolutions programs are available to resolve the disagreements in a timely manner before the tax

returns are filed. It is management’s expectation this program will shorten the time period between the filing of the Company’s federal income tax returns and the IRS’s completion
of its examination of the returns.

The
Company’s affiliates in Japan file separate tax returns and are subject to audits by the local taxing authority. The general statute of limitations is five years from when the return is filed. During 2009, the Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau
concluded a routine tax audit of the tax returns of Prudential Life Insurance Company Ltd. for its tax years ending March 31, 2004 to March 31, 2008. These activities had no material impact on the Company’s 2008, 2009 or 2010 results.

The Company’s affiliates in South Korea file
separate tax returns and are subject to audits by the local taxing authority. The general statute of limitations is five years from when the return is filed. During 2009, a local district office in the South Korean tax authority concluded a routine
tax audit of the local taxes for tax years ending March 31, 2004 through March 31, 2007 of Prudential Life Insurance Company of Korea, Ltd. (“POK”). During 2010, South Korea’s National Tax Service concluded a general tax
audit of POK’s tax years ending March 31, 2006 to March 31, 2010. These activities had no material impact on the Company’s 2008, 2009 or 2010 results.

On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 signed into law on March 30, 2010, (together, the “Healthcare Act”). The federal government provides a subsidy
to companies that provide certain retiree prescription drug benefits (the “Medicare Part D subsidy”), including the Company. The Medicare Part D subsidy was previously provided tax-free. However, as currently adopted, the Healthcare Act
includes a provision that would reduce the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of any Medicare Part D subsidy received. In effect, this provision of the Healthcare Act makes the Medicare Part D subsidy taxable beginning in
2013. Therefore, the Company incurred a charge in 2010 for the reduction of deferred tax assets of $94 million, which reduces net income and is reflected in “Income tax expense (benefit).”

20.    FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

Fair Value Measurement

—Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The authoritative guidance around fair value established a framework for measuring fair value that includes a hierarchy used to classify
the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques into three levels. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls is determined based on the lowest level
input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

Level 1—Fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible to the Company for identical assets or
liabilities. These generally provide the most reliable evidence and are used to measure fair value whenever available. Active markets are defined as having the following characteristics for the measured asset/liability: (i) many transactions,
(ii) current prices, (iii) price quotes not varying substantially among market makers, (iv) narrow bid/ask spreads and (v) most information publicly available. The Company’s Level 1 assets and liabilities primarily include
certain cash equivalents and short-term investments, equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market. Prices are obtained from readily available sources for market transactions involving identical assets or
liabilities.

Level 2—Fair value is based on
significant inputs, other than Level 1 inputs, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability through corroboration with observable market data. Level 2 inputs
include quoted market prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted market prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar assets or liabilities and other market observable inputs. The Company’s Level 2
assets and liabilities include: fixed



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

20.    FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

(continued)

maturities (corporate public and private bonds, most government securities, certain asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, etc.), certain equity securities (mutual funds, which do not
actively trade and are priced based on a net asset value) and commercial mortgage loans, short-term investments and certain cash equivalents (primarily commercial paper), and certain over-the-counter derivatives. Valuations are generally obtained
from third party pricing services for identical or comparable assets or liabilities or through the use of valuation methodologies using observable market inputs. Prices from services are validated through comparison to trade data and internal
estimates of current fair value, generally developed using market observable inputs and economic indicators.

Level 3—Fair value is based on at least one or more significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. These inputs reflect
the Company’s assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Company’s Level 3 assets and liabilities primarily include: certain private fixed maturities and equity securities, certain
manually priced public equity securities and fixed maturities, certain highly structured over-the-counter derivative contracts, certain commercial mortgage loans, certain consolidated real estate funds for which the Company is the general partner,
and embedded derivatives resulting from certain products with guaranteed benefits. Prices are determined using valuation methodologies such as option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and other similar techniques. Non-binding broker
quotes, which are utilized when pricing service information is not available, are reviewed for reasonableness based on the Company’s understanding of the market, and are generally considered Level 3. Under certain conditions, based on its
observations of transactions in active markets, the Company may conclude the prices received from independent third party pricing services or brokers are not reasonable or reflective of market activity. In those instances, the Company may choose to
over-ride the third-party pricing information or quotes received and apply internally developed values to the related assets or liabilities. To the extent the internally developed valuations use significant unobservable inputs, they are classified
as Level 3. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, these over-rides on a net basis were not material.

Inactive Markets

—During 2009 and continuing through the first quarter of 2010, the Company observed that the volume and level
of activity in the market for asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages remained at historically low levels. This stood in particular contrast to the markets for other structured products with similar cash flow and credit
profiles. The Company also observed significant implied relative liquidity risk premiums, yields, and weighting of “worst case” cash flows for asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages in comparison with its own
estimates for such securities. In contrast, the liquidity of other spread-based asset classes, such as corporate bonds, high yield and consumer asset-backed securities, such as those collateralized by credit cards or autos, which were previously
more correlated with sub-prime securities, improved beginning in the second quarter of 2009. Based on this information, the Company concluded as of June 30, 2009, and continuing through March 31, 2010, that the market for asset-backed
securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages was inactive and also determined the pricing quotes it received were based on limited market transactions, calling into question their representation of observable fair value. As a result, the Company
considered both third-party pricing information and an internally developed price based on a discounted cash flow model in determining the fair value of certain of these securities as of June 30, 2009 through March 31, 2010. Based on the
unobservable inputs used in the discounted cash flow model and the limited observable market activity, the Company classified these securities within Level 3 as of June 30, 2009 through March 31, 2010.

Beginning in the second quarter of 2010, the Company observed
an increasingly active market, as evidence of orderly transactions in asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages became more apparent. Additionally, the valuation based on the pricing the Company received from independent pricing
services was not materially different from its internal estimates of current market value for these securities. As a result, where third party pricing information based on observable inputs was used to fair value the security, and based on the
assessment that the market has been becoming increasingly active, the Company reported fair values for these asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages in Level 2 since June 30, 2010. As of

customers, except to the extent of minimum guarantees made by the Company with respect to certain accounts. Separate account assets classified as Level 3 consist primarily of real estate and real estate investment funds. Separate account liabilities
are not included in the above table as they are reported at contract value and not fair value in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

The methods and assumptions the Company uses to estimate fair
value of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below. Information regarding Separate Account Assets is excluded as the risk of assets for these categories is primarily borne by our customers and
policyholders.

Fixed Maturity
Securities

—The fair values of the Company’s public fixed maturity securities are generally based on prices obtained from independent pricing services. Prices from pricing services are sourced from multiple vendors, and a vendor
hierarchy is maintained by asset type based on historical pricing experience and vendor expertise. The Company generally receives prices from multiple pricing services for each security, but ultimately uses the price from the pricing service highest
in the vendor hierarchy based on the respective asset type. To validate reasonability, prices are reviewed by internal asset managers through comparison with directly observed recent market trades and internal estimates of current fair value,
developed using market observable inputs and economic indicators. Consistent with the fair value hierarchy described above, securities with validated quotes from pricing services are generally reflected within Level 2, as they are primarily based on
observable pricing for similar assets and/or other market observable inputs. If the pricing information received from third party pricing services is not reflective of market activity or other inputs observable in the market, the Company may
challenge the price through a formal process with the pricing service. If the pricing service updates the price to be more consistent in comparison to the presented market observations, the security remains within Level 2.

If the Company ultimately concludes that pricing information
received from the independent pricing service is not reflective of market activity, non-binding broker quotes are used, if available. If the Company concludes the values from both pricing services and brokers are not reflective of market activity,
it may over-ride the information from the pricing service or broker with an internally developed valuation. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009 over-rides on a net basis were not material. Internally developed valuations or non-binding broker
quotes are also used to determine fair value in circumstances where vendor pricing is not available. These estimates may use significant unobservable inputs, which reflect our own assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing
the asset. Circumstances where observable market data are not available may include events such as market illiquidity and credit events related to the security. Pricing service over-rides, internally developed valuations and non-binding broker
quotes are generally included in Level 3 in our fair value hierarchy.

The fair value of private fixed maturities, which are primarily comprised of investments in private placement securities, originated by internal private asset managers, are primarily determined using a
discounted cash flow model. In certain cases these models primarily use observable inputs with a discount rate based upon the average of spread surveys collected from private market intermediaries who are active in both primary and secondary
transactions, taking into account, among other factors, the credit quality and industry sector of the issuer and the reduced liquidity associated with private placements. Generally, these securities have been reflected within Level 2. For certain
private fixed maturities, the discounted cash flow model may also incorporate significant unobservable inputs, which reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset. To the extent
management determines that such unobservable inputs are not significant to the price of a security, a Level 2 classification is made. Otherwise, a Level 3 classification is used.

(continued)

Private fixed maturities also include debt investments in funds that, in addition to a
stated coupon, pay a return based upon the results of the underlying portfolios. The fair values of these securities are determined by reference to the funds’ net asset value (“NAV”). Since the NAV at which the funds trade can be
observed by redemption and subscription transactions between third parties, the fair values of these investments have been reflected within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Trading Account Assets

—Trading account assets
(including trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities) consist primarily of public corporate bonds, treasuries, equity securities and derivatives whose fair values are determined consistent with similar instruments described above under
“Fixed Maturity Securities” and below under “Equity Securities” and “Derivative Instruments.” Other trading account assets also include certain assets originally purchased under TALF, as described below under
“Long-Term Debt.”

Equity
Securities

—Equity securities consist principally of investments in common and preferred stock of publicly traded companies, privately traded securities, as well as common stock mutual fund shares. The fair values of most publicly traded
equity securities are based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and are classified within Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Estimated fair values for most privately traded equity securities are determined using
valuation and discounted cash flow models that require a substantial level of judgment. In determining the fair value of certain privately traded equity securities the discounted cash flow model may also use unobservable inputs, which reflect the
Company’s assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset. Most privately traded equity securities are classified within Level 3. The fair values of common stock mutual fund shares that transact regularly (but do
not trade in active markets because they are not publicly available) are based on transaction prices of identical fund shares and are classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of preferred equity securities are based on
prices obtained from independent pricing services and, in order to validate reasonability, are compared with directly observed recent market trades. Accordingly, these securities are generally classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Commercial Mortgage and Other
Loans

—The fair value of commercial mortgage loans held for investment (i.e., interim portfolio) and accounted for using the Fair Value Option are determined based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the
appropriate U.S. Treasury rate, adjusted for the current market spread for similar quality loans. The quality ratings for these loans, a primary determinant of the appropriate credit spread and a significant component of the pricing input, are based
on internally developed methodology. As a result, these loans are included in Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

The fair value of loans held for sale (i.e., agency-backed loans) and accounted for using the Fair Value Option is determined utilizing
pricing indicators from the whole loan market, where investors are committed to purchase these loans at a pre-determined price, which is considered the principal exit market for these loans. The Company has evaluated the valuation inputs used for
these assets, including the existence of pre-determined exit prices, the terms of the loans, prevailing interest rates and credit risk, and deemed that the primary pricing inputs are Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy.

Other Long-Term Investments

—Other long-term
investments include limited partnerships which are consolidated because the Company is either deemed to exercise control or considered the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. These entities are considered investment companies and
follow specialized industry accounting whereby their assets are carried at fair value. The investments held by these entities include various feeder fund investments in underlying master funds (whose underlying holdings generally include public
fixed maturities and equity securities), as well as wholly-owned real estate held within other investment funds. The fair value of the feeder fund investments in master funds are generally determined by reference to the investments in the underlying
master funds.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

20.    FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

(continued)

The fair value of investments in funds holding publicly traded equity securities are
generally based on quoted prices in active markets for identical investments and are therefore reflected as Level 1. The fair value of investments in funds holding public fixed maturities are generally based on validated quotes from pricing services
or observable data as described above, and are reflected in Level 2. The fair value of investments in funds holding public fixed maturities that are subject to significant liquidity restrictions are reflected in Level 3.

The fair value of fund investments, where the fair value
option has been elected, is primarily determined by the fund managers. Since the valuations may be based on unobservable market inputs and cannot be validated by the Company, these investments have been included within Level 3 in the fair value
hierarchy.

The fair value of real estate held in
consolidated investment funds is determined through an independent appraisal process. The appraisals generally utilize a discounted cash flow model, following an income approach that incorporates various assumptions including rental revenue,
operating expenses and discount rates. The cash flow approach is supplemented with replacement cost estimates and comparable recent sales data when available. These appraisals and the related assumptions are updated at least annually, and
incorporate historical property experience and any observable market data, including any market transactions. Since many of the assumptions utilized are unobservable and are considered to be significant inputs to the valuation, the real estate
investments within other long-term investments have been reflected within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

Derivative Instruments

—Derivatives are recorded at fair value either as assets, within “Other trading account
assets,” or “Other long-term investments,” or as liabilities, within “Other liabilities,” except for embedded derivatives which are recorded with the associated host contract. The fair values of derivative contracts are
determined based on quoted prices in active exchanges or through the use of valuation models. The fair values of derivative contracts can be affected by changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, credit spreads, market
volatility, expected returns, non-performance risk and liquidity as well as other factors. Liquidity valuation adjustments are made to reflect the cost of exiting significant risk positions, and consider the bid-ask spread, maturity, complexity, and
other specific attributes of the underlying derivative position. Fair values can also be affected by changes in estimates and assumptions including those related to counterparty behavior used in valuation models.

The Company’s exchange-traded futures and options
include treasury futures, eurodollar futures, commodity futures, eurodollar options and commodity options. Exchange-traded futures and options are valued using quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1 in our fair value
hierarchy.

The majority of the Company’s
derivative positions are traded in the over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivative market and are classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. OTC derivatives classified within Level 2 are valued using models generally accepted in the
financial services industry that use actively quoted or observable market input values from external market data providers, third-party pricing vendors and/or recent trading activity. The fair values of most OTC derivatives, including interest rate
and cross currency swaps, currency forward contracts, commodity swaps, commodity forward contracts, single name credit default swaps, loan commitments held for sale and to-be-announced (or TBA) forward contracts on highly rated mortgage-backed
securities issued by U.S. government sponsored entities are determined using discounted cash flow models. The fair values of European style option contracts are determined using Black-Scholes option pricing models. These models’ key assumptions
include the contractual terms of the respective contract, along with significant observable inputs, including interest rates, currency rates, credit spreads, equity prices, index dividend yields, non-performance risk and volatility, and are
classified as Level 2.

OTC derivative contracts
are executed under master netting agreements with counterparties with a Credit Support Annex, or CSA, which is a bilateral ratings-sensitive agreement that requires collateral postings at established credit threshold levels. These agreements protect
the interests of the Company and its counterparties,



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

(continued)

should either party suffer a credit rating deterioration. The vast majority of the Company’s derivative agreements are with highly rated major international financial institutions. To
reflect the market’s perception of its own and the counterparty’s non-performance risk, the Company incorporates additional spreads over London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) into the discount rate used in determining the fair
value of OTC derivative assets and liabilities. However, the non-performance risk adjustment is applied only to the uncollateralized portion of the OTC derivative assets and liabilities, after consideration of the impacts of two-way collateral
posting. Most OTC derivative contract inputs have bid and ask prices that are actively quoted or can be readily obtained from external market data providers. The Company’s policy is to use mid-market pricing in determining its best estimate of
fair value and classify these derivative contracts as Level 2.

Derivatives classified as Level 3 include first-to-default credit basket swaps, look-back equity options and other structured products. These derivatives are valued based upon models with some significant
unobservable market inputs or inputs from less actively traded markets. The fair values of first-to-default credit basket swaps are derived from relevant observable inputs such as: individual credit default spreads, interest rates, recovery rates
and unobservable model-specific input values such as correlation between different credits within the same basket. Look-back equity options and other structured options and derivatives are valued using simulation models such as the Monte Carlo
technique. The input values for look-back equity options are derived from observable market indices such as interest rates, dividend yields, equity indices as well as unobservable model-specific input values such as certain volatility parameters.
Level 3 methodologies are validated through periodic comparison of the Company’s fair values to broker-dealer values.

Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

—Cash equivalents and short-term investments include money market instruments,
commercial paper and other highly liquid debt instruments. Money market instruments are generally valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible for identical assets and are primarily classified as Level 1. The remaining
instruments in the Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments category are typically not traded in active markets; however, their fair values are based on market observable inputs and, accordingly, these investments have been classified within
Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Other
Assets and Other Liabilities

—Other assets carried at fair value include U.S. Treasury bills held within our global commodities group whose fair values are determined consistent with similar securities described above under “Fixed
Maturity Securities.” Included in other liabilities are various derivatives contracts executed within our global commodities group, including exchange-traded futures, foreign currency and commodity contracts. The fair values of these derivative
instruments are determined consistent with similar derivative instruments described above under “Derivative Instruments.”

Future Policy Benefits

—The liability for future policy benefits includes general account liabilities for guarantees on
variable annuity contracts, including guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (“GMAB”), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (“GMWB”) and guaranteed minimum income and withdrawal benefits (“GMIWB”), accounted for as
embedded derivatives. The fair values of the GMAB, GMWB and GMIWB liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefit payments to customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative
feature. This methodology could result in either a liability or contra-liability balance, given changing capital market conditions and various policyholder behavior assumptions. Since there is no observable active market for the transfer of these
obligations, the valuations are calculated using internally developed models with option pricing techniques. The models are based on a risk neutral valuation framework and incorporate premiums for risks inherent in valuation techniques, inputs, and
the general uncertainty around the timing and amount of future cash flows. The determination of these risk premiums requires the use of management judgment.

The Company is also required to incorporate the market-perceived risk of its own non-performance in the valuation of the embedded
derivatives associated with its optional living benefit features. Since insurance

(continued)

liabilities are senior to debt, the Company believes that reflecting the financial strength ratings of the Company’s insurance subsidiaries in the valuation of the liability appropriately
takes into consideration the Company’s own risk of non-performance. To reflect the market’s perception of its non-performance risk, the Company incorporates an additional spread over LIBOR into the discount rate used in the valuations of
the embedded derivatives associated with its optional living benefit features. The additional spread over LIBOR is determined taking into consideration publicly available information relating to the financial strength of the Company’s insurance
subsidiaries, as indicated by the credit spreads associated with funding agreements issued by these subsidiaries. The Company adjusts these credit spreads to remove any liquidity risk premium. The additional spread over LIBOR incorporated into the
discount rate as of December 31, 2010 generally ranged from 50 to 150 basis points for the portion of the interest rate curve most relevant to these liabilities. This additional spread is applied at an individual contract level and only to
those embedded derivatives in a liability position and not to those in a contra-liability position.

Other significant inputs to the valuation models for the embedded derivatives associated with the optional living benefit features of the Company’s variable annuity products include capital market
assumptions, such as interest rate and implied volatility assumptions, as well as various policyholder behavior assumptions that are actuarially determined, including lapse rates, benefit utilization rates, mortality rates and withdrawal rates.
These assumptions are reviewed at least annually, and updated based upon historical experience and give consideration to any observable market data, including market transactions such as acquisitions and reinsurance transactions. Since many of the
assumptions utilized in the valuation of the embedded derivatives associated with the Company’s optional living benefit features are unobservable and are considered to be significant inputs to the liability valuation, the liability included in
future policy benefits has been reflected within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

Long-Term Debt

—Long-term debt included funding received from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on a non-recourse basis to finance the purchase of eligible asset-backed securities, under
TALF, as of December 31, 2009. The Company valued these liabilities using various inputs including the value of the collateral (eligible asset-backed securities), a comparison of the liabilities’ spread over LIBOR to the spreads in current
TALF offerings and various other market observable and non-observable inputs which incorporated significant management judgment. As a result, the pricing of the non-recourse liabilities were classified within Level 3 in the Company’s fair value
hierarchy. The pricing of the collateral assets (recorded in “other trading account assets”) was generally based on third party pricing information as discussed above, and included in Level 2 in the Company’s fair value hierarchy. See
Note 14 for additional information regarding the Company’s participation in TALF.

Transfers between Levels 1 and 2

—Periodically there are transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 for foreign common stocks held in the Company’s Separate Account. In certain periods, an
adjustment may be made to the fair value of these assets beyond the quoted market price to reflect events that occurred between the close of foreign trading markets and the close of U.S. trading markets for that day. If an adjustment is made in the
reporting period, these Separate Account assets are classified as Level 2. When an adjustment is not made, they are classified as Level 1. This type of adjustment was made at December 31, 2009, but not at December 31, 2010. As a result,
for the year ended December 31, 2010, $3.4 billion of transfers from Level 2 to Level 1 occurred for these Separate Account assets on a net basis.

Company’s Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

Transfers

—Transfers out of Level 3 for Fixed Maturities Available for Sale — Asset-Backed Securities and Trading Account Assets Supporting Insurance Liabilities — Asset-Backed
Securities include $4,974 million and $222 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2010 resulting from the Company’s conclusion that the market for asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages has been
becoming increasingly active, as evidenced by orderly transactions. The pricing received from independent pricing services could be validated by the Company, as discussed in detail above. Other transfers out of Level 3 were typically due to the use
of observable inputs in valuation methodologies as well as the utilization of pricing service information for certain assets that the Company was able to validate. Transfers into Level 3 were primarily the result of unobservable inputs utilized
within valuation methodologies and the use of broker quotes (that could not be validated) when previously, information from third party pricing services (that could be validated) was utilized.

Transfers

—Transfers into Level 3 for Fixed Maturities Available for Sale—Asset-Backed securities and Trading Account
Assets Supporting Insurance Liabilities—Asset-Backed securities include $4,583 million and $188 million, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2009, resulting from the Company’s conclusion that the market for asset-backed
securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages was an inactive market, as discussed above. Transfers into Level 3 for Fixed Maturities, Available for Sale—Commercial Mortgage-Backed securities for the year ended December 31, 2009 is
primarily the result of over-riding the third party pricing information downward with internally developed valuations for certain securities held in the Japanese insurance operations portfolio. Transfers into Level 3 for Commercial Mortgage and
Other Loans for the year ended December 31, 2009 is primarily due to downward credit migration of these loans. The downgrade in loans has resulted in the utilization of higher credit spreads, that are internally developed and not observable in
the market place. This increase in credit spreads is now considered a significant input in the fair value calculation for these loans. Transfers out of Level 3 for Other Trading Account Assets—Asset Backed securities were primarily the result
of the use of third party pricing for the securities purchased under TALF. In the first quarter of 2009, these assets were valued internally using a model.

Other transfers out of Level 3 were typically due to the use of observable inputs in valuation methodologies as well as the utilization of
pricing service information for certain assets that the Company was able to validate. Other transfers into Level 3 were primarily the result of unobservable inputs utilized within valuation methodologies and the use of broker quotes (that could not

Transfers

—Net transfers into Level 3 for Fixed Maturities Available for Sale totaled $382 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. Transfers into Level 3 for these investments was
primarily the result of unobservable inputs utilized within valuation methodologies and the use of broker quotes when previously information from third party pricing services was utilized. Partially offsetting these transfers into Level 3 were
transfers out of Level 3 due to the use of observable inputs in valuation methodologies as well as the utilization of pricing service information for certain assets that the Company was able to validate.

The net amount of transfers out of Level 3 for Trading
Account Assets Supporting Insurance Liabilities of $74 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 is due primarily to the use of observable inputs in valuation methodologies as well as pricing service information for certain assets that
the Company was able to validate. Partially offsetting these transfers out of Level 3 were transfers into Level 3 due to the use of unobservable inputs within the valuation methodologies and broker quotes, when previously information from third
party pricing services was utilized. The net amount of transfers into Level 3 for Equity Securities of $151 million is primarily related to investments in private mutual funds where the inputs used by the mutual funds were determined to be Level 3.
This activity was partially offset by transfers out of Level 3 as a result of the availability of third party pricing service information that was validated. Transfers of Commercial Mortgage and Other Loans into Level 3 totaled $81 million and
resulted from a reduction in the availability of market available prices during the year due to market illiquidity.

The net amount of Separate Account Assets transferred out of Level 3 for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $607 million. This
resulted from the use of vendor pricing information that the Company was able to

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements

—Certain
assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Nonrecurring fair value adjustments resulted in $73 million of losses being recorded for the year ended December 31, 2010 on certain commercial mortgage loans. The
carrying value of these loans as of December 31, 2010 was $267 million. Similar losses on commercial mortgage loans of $200 million and $36 million were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. The adjustments were based on
either discounted cash flows utilizing market rates or the fair value of the underlying real estate collateral and were classified as Level 3 in the hierarchy. In addition, losses of $38 million were recorded for the year ended December 31,
2008 related to commercial loans that were carried at the lower of cost or market. The fair value measurements were classified as Level 3 in the valuation hierarchy. The inputs utilized for these valuations are pricing indicators from the whole loan
market, which the Company considers its principal market for these loans.

Impairments of $6 million, $55 million and $26 million were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, on certain cost method investments. The carrying value as of
December 31, 2010 of these investments was $165 million. In addition, impairments of $4 million, $12 million and $14 million were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, on certain equity method
investments. These fair value adjustments were based on inputs classified as Level 3 in the valuation hierarchy. The inputs utilized were primarily discounted estimated future cash flows and, where appropriate, valuations provided by the general
partners taken into consideration with deal and management fee expenses.

Impairments of $6 million and $12 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, were recorded for mortgage servicing rights. The impairments were based on internal models and
were classified as Level 3 in the hierarchy. In addition, impairments of $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 were recorded for real estate investments, some of which were classified as discontinued operations. The impairments were
based on appraisal values or purchase agreements and were classified as Level 3 in the hierarchy.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

(continued)

For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recorded impairments of $316
million on certain equity method investments in operating joint ventures held within the international investments segment. The inputs used in determining these impairments were classified as Level 3 in the valuation hierarchy and consisted
primarily of market multiples and discounted cash flows.

As discussed in more detail in Note 9, the Company recorded goodwill impairments of $337 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. The inputs were classified as Level 3 and primarily consisted
of discounted cash flows and market multiples.

Fair Value Option

—The following table presents information regarding changes in fair values recorded in earnings for
commercial mortgage loans, other long-term investments and long-term debt, where the fair value option has been elected.

Changes in fair value are reflected in “Realized investment gains (losses), net” for commercial mortgage loans and “Asset management fees and other income” for other long-term
investments and long-term debt. Changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are estimated based on changes in credit spreads and quality ratings for the period reported.

Interest income on commercial mortgage loans is included in net investment income. For the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded $22 million, $37 million and $41 million of interest income, respectively, on these fair value option loans. Interest income on these loans is recorded based on the effective interest rates
as determined at the closing of the loan.

The
fair values and aggregate contractual principal amounts of commercial mortgage loans, for which the fair value option has been elected, were $364 million and $393 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2010, and $479 million and $556
million, respectively, as December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2010, such loans that were in nonaccrual status had fair values of $86 million and aggregate contractual principal amounts of $97 million. None of the loans where the fair
value option has been elected are more than 90 days past due and still accruing.

The fair value of other long-term investments was $258 million as of December 31, 2010.

As of the first quarter of 2010, the Company no longer had any outstanding debt that is carried at fair value under the fair value option.
The Company recorded $10 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 for long-term debt where the fair value option had been elected.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company is required by U.S. GAAP to disclose the fair value of certain financial instruments including those that are not carried at
fair value. For the following financial instruments the carrying amount equals or



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

20.    FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

(continued)

approximates fair value: fixed maturities classified as available for sale, trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities, other trading account assets, equity securities, securities
purchased under agreements to resell, short-term investments, cash and cash equivalents, accrued investment income, separate account assets, investment contracts included in separate account liabilities, securities sold under agreements to
repurchase, and cash collateral for loaned securities, as well as certain items recorded within other assets and other liabilities such as broker-dealer related receivables and payables. See Note 21 for a discussion of derivative instruments.

The following table discloses the Company’s
financial instruments where the carrying amounts and fair values may differ:

(1)

Includes items carried at fair value under the fair value option.

The fair values presented above for those financial instruments where the carrying amounts and fair values may differ have been determined
by using available market information and by applying market valuation methodologies, as described in more detail below.

Fixed Maturities, held to maturity

The fair values of public fixed maturity securities are generally based on prices from third party pricing services, which are reviewed to
validate reasonability. However, for certain public fixed maturity securities and investments in private placement fixed maturity securities, this information is either not available or not reliable. For these public fixed maturity securities the
fair value is based on non-binding broker quotes, if available, or determined using a discounted cash flow model or internally developed values. For private fixed maturities fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model, which utilizes
a discount rate based upon the average of spread surveys collected from private market intermediaries who are active in both primary and secondary transactions and takes into account, among other factors, the credit quality and industry sector of
the issuer and the reduced liquidity associated with private placements. In determining the fair value of certain fixed maturity securities, the discounted cash flow model may also use unobservable inputs, which reflect the Company’s own
assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the security.

Commercial Mortgage and Other Loans

The fair value of commercial mortgage and other loans, other than those held by the Company’s commercial mortgage operations, is primarily based upon the present value of the expected future cash
flows discounted at the appropriate U.S. Treasury rate or Japanese Government Bond rate for yen based loans, adjusted for the current market spread for similar quality loans.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

20.    FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

(continued)

The fair value of commercial mortgage and other loans held by the Company’s
commercial mortgage operations is based upon various factors, including the terms of the loans, the principal exit markets for the loans, prevailing interest rates, and credit risk.

Policy Loans

The fair value of U.S. insurance policy loans is calculated using a discounted cash flow model based upon current U.S. Treasury rates and
historical loan repayment patterns, while Japanese insurance policy loans use the risk-free proxy based on the Yen LIBOR. For group corporate-, bank- and trust-owned life insurance contracts and group universal life contracts, the fair value of the
policy loans is the amount due as of the reporting date.

Investment Contracts—Policyholders’ Account Balances

Only the portion of policyholders’ account balances
related to products that are investment contracts (those without significant mortality or morbidity risk) are reflected in the table above. For fixed deferred annuities, single premium endowments, payout annuities and other similar contracts without
life contingencies, fair values are derived using discounted projected cash flows based on interest rates that are representative of the Company’s financial strength ratings, and hence reflect the Company’s own non-performance risk. For
guaranteed investment contracts, funding agreements, structured settlements without life contingencies and other similar products, fair values are derived using discounted projected cash flows based on interest rates being offered for similar
contracts with maturities consistent with those of the contracts being valued. For those balances that can be withdrawn by the customer at any time without prior notice or penalty, the fair value is the amount estimated to be payable to the customer
as of the reporting date, which is generally the carrying value. For defined contribution and defined benefit contracts and certain other products the fair value is the market value of the assets supporting the liabilities.

Debt

The fair value of short-term and long-term debt, as well as debt of consolidated VIEs, is generally determined
by either prices obtained from independent pricing services, which are validated by the Company, or discounted cash flow models. With the exception of the debt of consolidated VIE’s, these fair values consider the Company’s own
non-performance risk. Discounted cash flow models predominately use market observable inputs such as the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for debt and financial instruments with similar terms and remaining maturities. For
commercial paper issuances and other debt with a maturity of less than 90 days, the carrying value approximates fair value. Debt of consolidated VIEs is reflected within “Other liabilities.”

A portion of the senior secured notes issued by Prudential
Holdings, LLC (the “IHC debt”) is insured by a third-party financial guarantee insurance policy. The effect of the third-party credit enhancement is not included in the fair value measurement of the IHC debt and the methodologies used to
determine fair value consider the Company’s own non-performance risk.

Bank Customer Liabilities

The carrying amount for certain deposits (interest and non-interest demand, savings and money market accounts) approximates or equals their fair values. Fair values for fixed-rate certificates of deposit
are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates being offered on certificates at the reporting dates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities. Bank customer liabilities are reflected within
“Other liabilities.”

21.    DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

Types of Derivative Instruments and Derivative Strategies used in a
non-dealer or broker capacity

Interest
rate swaps are used by the Company to manage interest rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities (including duration mismatches) and to hedge against changes in the value of assets it anticipates acquiring and other
anticipated transactions and commitments. Swaps may be attributed to specific assets or liabilities or may be used on a portfolio basis. Under interest rate swaps, the Company agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the
difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. Generally, no cash is exchanged at the outset of the contract and no principal payments are made by either party.
These transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that provide for a single net payment to be made by one counterparty at each due date.

Exchange-traded futures and options are used by the Company to reduce risks from changes in interest rates, to alter mismatches between
the duration of assets in a portfolio and the duration of liabilities supported by those assets, and to hedge against changes in the value of securities it owns or anticipates acquiring or selling. In exchange-traded futures transactions, the
Company agrees to purchase or sell a specified number of contracts, the values of which are determined by the values of underlying referenced investments, and to post variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal to the difference in the
daily market values of those contracts. The Company enters into exchange-traded futures and options with regulated futures commission’s merchants who are members of a trading exchange.

Equity index options are contracts which will settle in cash based on differentials in the underlying indices
at the time of exercise and the strike price. The Company uses combinations of purchases and sales of equity index options to hedge the effects of adverse changes in equity indices within a predetermined range. These hedges do not qualify for hedge
accounting.

Currency derivatives, including
exchange-traded currency futures and options, currency forwards and currency swaps, are used by the Company to reduce risks from changes in currency exchange rates with respect to investments denominated in foreign currencies that the Company either
holds or intends to acquire or sell. The Company also uses currency forwards to hedge the currency risk associated with net investments in foreign operations and anticipated earnings of its foreign operations.

Under currency forwards, the Company agrees with other
parties to deliver a specified amount of an identified currency at a specified future date. Typically, the price is agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for such a contract is made at the specified future date. As noted above, the
Company uses currency forwards to mitigate the risk that unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates will reduce U.S. dollar equivalent earnings generated by certain of its non-U.S. businesses, primarily its international insurance and
investments operations. The Company executes forward sales of the hedged currency in exchange for U.S. dollars at a specified exchange rate. The maturities of these forwards correspond with the future periods in which the non-U.S. earnings are
expected to be generated. These earnings hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting.

Under currency swaps, the Company agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between one currency and another at an exchange rate and calculated by reference to an
agreed principal amount. Generally, the principal amount of each currency is exchanged at the beginning and termination of the currency swap by each party. These transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that provide for a single
net payment to be made by one counterparty for payments made in the same currency at each due date.

Credit derivatives are used by the Company to enhance the return on the Company’s investment portfolio by creating credit exposure similar to an investment in public fixed maturity cash instruments.
With credit derivatives the Company sells credit protection on an identified name, or a basket of names in a first to default



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

21.    DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

(continued)

structure, and in return receives a quarterly premium. With single name credit default derivatives, this premium or credit spread generally corresponds to the difference between the yield on the
referenced name’s public fixed maturity cash instruments and swap rates, at the time the agreement is executed. With first to default baskets, the premium generally corresponds to a high proportion of the sum of the credit spreads of the names
in the basket. If there is an event of default by the referenced name or one of the referenced names in a basket, as defined by the agreement, then the Company is obligated to pay the counterparty the referenced amount of the contract and receive in
return the referenced defaulted security or similar security. See Note 23 for a discussion of guarantees related to these credit derivatives. In addition to selling credit protection, in limited instances the Company has purchased credit protection
using credit derivatives in order to hedge specific credit exposures in the Company’s investment portfolio.

The Company uses “to be announced” (“TBA”) forward contracts to gain exposure to the investment risk and return of
mortgage-backed securities. TBA transactions can help the Company to achieve better diversification and to enhance the return on its investment portfolio. TBAs provide a more liquid and cost effective method of achieving these goals than purchasing
or selling individual mortgage-backed pools. Typically, the price is agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for such a contract is made at a specified future date. Additionally, pursuant to the Company’s mortgage dollar roll
program, TBAs or mortgage-backed securities are transferred to counterparties with a corresponding agreement to repurchase them at a future date. These transactions do not qualify as secured borrowings and are accounted for as derivatives.

In its mortgage operations, the Company enters
into commitments to fund commercial mortgage loans at specified interest rates and other applicable terms within specified periods of time. These commitments are legally binding agreements to extend credit to a counterparty. Loan commitments for
loans that will be held for sale are recognized as derivatives and recorded at fair value. The determination of the fair value of loan commitments accounted for as derivatives considers various factors including, among others, terms of the related
loan, the intended exit strategy for the loans based upon either securitization valuation models or investor purchase commitments, prevailing interest rates, and origination income or expense. Loan commitments that relate to the origination of
mortgage loans that will be held for investment are not accounted for as derivatives and accordingly are not recognized in the Company’s financial statements. See Note 23 for a further discussion of these loan commitments.

The Company sells variable annuity products, which may
include guaranteed benefit features that are accounted for as embedded derivatives. These embedded derivatives are marked to market through “Realized investment gains (losses), net” based on the change in value of the underlying
contractual guarantees, which are determined using valuation models. The Company maintains a portfolio of derivative instruments that is intended to hedge the risks related to the above products’ features. The derivatives may include, but are
not limited to equity options, total return swaps, interest rate swap options, caps, floors, and other instruments. In addition, some variable annuity products feature an automatic rebalancing element to minimize risks inherent in the Company’s
guarantees which reduces the need for hedges.

The
Company sells synthetic guaranteed investment contracts which are investment-only, fee-based stable value products, to qualified pension plans. The assets are owned by the trustees of such plans, who invest the assets under the terms of investment
guidelines agreed to with the Company. The contracts contain a guarantee of a minimum rate of return on participant balances supported by the underlying assets, and a guarantee of liquidity to meet certain participant-initiated plan cash flow
requirements. These contracts are accounted for as derivatives and recorded at fair value.

The Company invests in fixed maturities that, in addition to a stated coupon, provide a return based upon the results of an underlying portfolio of fixed income investments and related investment
activity. The Company accounts for these investments as available for sale fixed maturities containing embedded derivatives. Such



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

embedded derivatives are marked to market through “Realized investment gains (losses), net,” based upon the change in value of the underlying portfolio.

The table below provides a summary of the gross notional
amount and fair value of derivatives contracts, excluding embedded derivatives which are recorded with the associated host, by the primary underlying. Many derivative instruments contain multiple underlyings.

(1)

Excludes embedded derivatives which contain multiple underlyings. The fair value of these embedded derivatives was a net liability of $70 million as of
December 31, 2010 and a net liability of $391 million as of December 31, 2009, included in “Future policy benefits” and “Fixed maturities, available for sale.”

Cash Flow, Fair Value and Net Investment Hedges

The primary derivative instruments used by the Company in
its fair value, cash flow, and net investment hedge accounting relationships are interest rate swaps, currency swaps and currency forwards. These instruments are only designated for hedge accounting in instances where the appropriate criteria are
met. The Company does not use futures, options, credit, equity or embedded derivatives in any of its fair value, cash flow or net investment hedge accounting relationships.

For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the ineffective portion of
derivatives accounted for using hedge accounting was not material to the Company’s results of operations and there were no material amounts reclassified into earnings relating to instances in which the Company discontinued cash flow hedge
accounting because the forecasted transaction did not occur by the anticipated date or within the additional time period permitted by the authoritative guidance for the accounting for derivatives and hedging. In addition, there were no instances in
which the Company discontinued fair value hedge accounting due to a hedged firm commitment no longer qualifying as a fair value hedge.

Presented below is a roll forward of current period cash flow hedges in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” before
taxes:

Using December 31, 2010
values, it is anticipated that a pre-tax loss of approximately $29 million will be reclassified from “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” to earnings during the subsequent twelve months ending December 31, 2011, offset by
amounts pertaining to the hedged items. As of December 31, 2010, the Company does not have any qualifying cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions other than those related to the variability of the payment or receipt of interest or foreign
currency amounts on existing financial instruments. The maximum length of time for which these variable cash flows are hedged is 13 years. Income amounts deferred in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” as a result of cash flow
hedges are included in “Net unrealized investment gains (losses)” in the Consolidated Statements of Equity.

For effective net investment hedges, the amounts, before applicable taxes, recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment account
within “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” were $(73) million in 2010, $127 million in 2009 and $268 million in 2008.

The following table sets forth the composition of the Company’s credit derivatives
where the Company has written credit protection excluding the credit derivative related to surplus notes issued by a subsidiary of Prudential Insurance and embedded derivatives contained in externally-managed investments in the European market, by
industry category as of the dates indicated.

(1)

Includes the following industries: food/beverage, aerospace/defense, chemical, and others.

(2)

Credit default baskets may include various industry categories.

The Company entered into a credit derivative that will require the Company to make certain payments in the event of deterioration in the
value of the surplus notes issued by a subsidiary of Prudential Insurance. The notional of this credit derivative is $500 million and the fair value as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a liability of $26 million and $22 million, respectively.
No collateral was pledged in either period.

The
Company holds certain externally-managed investments in the European market which contain embedded derivatives whose fair value are primarily driven by changes in credit spreads. These investments are medium term notes that are collateralized by
investment portfolios primarily consisting of investment grade European fixed income securities, including corporate bonds and asset-backed securities, and derivatives, as well as varying degrees of leverage. The notes have a stated coupon and
provide a return based on the performance of the underlying portfolios and the level of leverage. The Company invests in these notes to earn a coupon through maturity, consistent with its investment purpose for other debt securities. The notes are
accounted for under U.S. GAAP as available for sale fixed maturity securities with bifurcated embedded derivatives (total return swaps). Changes in the value of the fixed maturity securities are reported in Equity under the heading “Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)” and changes in the market value of the embedded total return swaps are included in current period earnings in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” The Company’s maximum exposure to loss
from these investments was $754 million and $723 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

In addition to writing credit protection, the Company has purchased credit protection using credit derivatives in order to hedge specific
credit exposures in the Company’s investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had $2.184 billion and $2.313 billion of outstanding notional amounts, respectively, reported at fair value as an asset of less than $1
million and an asset of $174 million, respectively.

Types
of Derivative Instruments and Derivative Strategies used in a dealer or broker capacity

Futures, forwards and options contracts, and swap agreements, are also used in a derivative dealer or broker capacity in the Company’s commodities operations to facilitate transactions of the
Company’s clients, hedge

proprietary trading activities and as a means of risk management. These derivatives allow the Company to structure transactions to manage its exposure to commodities and securities prices,
foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Risk exposures are managed through diversification, by controlling position sizes and by entering into offsetting positions. For example, the Company may manage the risk related to its precious metals
inventory by entering into an offsetting position in exchange traded futures contracts.

The fair value of the Company’s derivative contracts used in a derivative dealer or broker capacity is reported on a net-by-counterparty basis in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of
Financial Position when management believes a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement.

Realized and unrealized gains and losses from marking-to-market the derivatives used in proprietary positions are recognized on a trade
date basis and reported in “Asset management fees and other income.”

The following table sets forth the income statement impact of derivatives used in a dealer or broker capacity.

Credit Risk

The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event
of non-performance by counterparties to financial derivative transactions. The Company manages credit risk by entering into derivative transactions with highly rated major international financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties,
and by obtaining collateral where appropriate. Additionally, limits are set on single party credit exposures which are subject to periodic management review.

The credit exposure of the Company’s over-the-counter (OTC) derivative transactions is represented by the contracts with a positive
fair value (market value) at the reporting date. To reduce credit exposures, the Company seeks to (i) enter into OTC derivative transactions pursuant to master agreements that provide for a netting of payments and receipts with a single
counterparty (ii) enter into agreements that allow the use of credit support annexes (CSAs), which are bilateral rating-sensitive agreements that require collateral postings at established threshold levels. Likewise, the Company effects
exchange-traded futures and options transactions through regulated exchanges and these transactions are settled on a daily basis, thereby reducing credit risk exposure in the event of non-performance by counterparties to such financial instruments.

Under fair value measurements, the Company
incorporates the market’s perception of its own and the counterparty’s non-performance risk in determining the fair value of the portion of its OTC derivative assets and liabilities that are uncollateralized. Credit spreads are applied to
the derivative fair values on a net basis by counterparty. To reflect the Company’s own credit spread a proxy based on relevant debt spreads is applied to OTC derivative net liability positions. Similarly, the Company’s counterparty’s
credit spread is applied to OTC derivative net asset positions.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

21.    DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

(continued)

Certain of the Company’s derivative agreements with some of its counterparties
contain credit-risk related triggers. If the Company’s credit rating were to fall below a certain level, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request termination at the then fair value of the derivative or demand immediate
full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. If a downgrade occurred and the derivative positions were terminated, the Company anticipates it would be able to replace the derivative positions with other counterparties
in the normal course of business. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position were $590 million as of December 31, 2010. In the normal course of
business the Company has posted collateral related to these instruments of $517 million as of December 31, 2010. If the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered on December 31, 2010, the
Company estimates that it would be required to post a maximum of $73 million of additional collateral to its counterparties.

22.    SEGMENT INFORMATION

Segments

The Company has organized its principal operations into the
Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. Within the Financial Services Businesses, the Company operates through three divisions, which together encompass seven reportable segments. The Company’s real estate and relocation
services business as well as businesses that are not sufficiently material to warrant separate disclosure and divested businesses are included in Corporate and Other operations within the Financial Services Businesses. Collectively, the businesses
that comprise the three operating divisions and Corporate and Other are referred to as the Financial Services Businesses.

U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division.

The U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management division
consists of the Individual Annuities, Retirement, and Asset Management segments. The Individual Annuities segment manufactures and distributes individual variable and fixed annuity products, primarily to the U.S. mass affluent market. The Retirement
segment manufactures and distributes products and provides administrative services for qualified and non-qualified retirement plans and offers guaranteed investment contracts, funding agreements, institutional and retail notes, structured settlement
annuities and group annuities. The Asset Management segment provides a broad array of investment management and advisory services by means of institutional portfolio management, mutual funds, asset securitization activity and other structured
products, and proprietary investments. These products and services are provided to the public and private marketplace, as well as to other segments of the Company.

U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance Division.

The
U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance division consists of the Individual Life and Group Insurance segments. The Individual Life segment manufactures and distributes individual variable life, term life and universal life insurance products
primarily to the U.S. mass middle, mass affluent and affluent markets. The Group Insurance segment manufactures and distributes a full range of group life, long-term and short-term group disability, long-term care and group corporate-, bank- and
trust-owned life insurance in the U.S. primarily to institutional clients for use in connection with employee and membership benefit plans.

International Insurance and Investments Division.

The International Insurance and Investments division consists of the
International Insurance and International Investments segments. The International Insurance segment manufactures and distributes individual life insurance, retirement and related products to the mass affluent and affluent markets in Japan, Korea and
other foreign countries through its Life Planner operations. In addition, similar products are offered to the broad middle income market across Japan through Life Advisors, the proprietary distribution channel of the Company’s Gibraltar Life
operation. The International Investments segment offers proprietary and non-proprietary asset management, investment advice and services to retail and institutional clients in selected international markets.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

22.    SEGMENT INFORMATION

(continued)

In February 2010, the Company signed a definitive agreement to sell Prudential
Investment & Securities Co., Ltd. and Prudential Asset Management Co., Ltd, which together comprise the Company’s Korean asset management operations. As a result, the Company has reflected the results of its Korean asset management
operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented. This transaction closed on June 1, 2010.

Corporate and Other.

Corporate and Other includes corporate operations, after allocations to business segments, and real estate and
relocation services, as well as divested businesses. Corporate operations consist primarily of: (1) investment returns on capital that is not deployed in any business segments; (2) returns from investments not allocated to business
segments, including debt-financed investment portfolios, as well as tax credit investments and other tax enhanced investments financed by business segments; (3) capital debt that is used or will be used to meet the capital requirements of the
Company and the related interest expense; (4) income and expense from qualified pension and other employee benefit plans, after allocations to business segments; (5) corporate-level income and expense, after allocations to business
segments, including corporate governance, corporate advertising, philanthropic activities and deferred compensation; (6) certain retained obligations relating to pre-demutualization policyholders whom the Company had previously agreed to
provide insurance for reduced or no premium in accordance with contractual settlements related to prior individual life insurance sales practices remediation; (7) businesses that have been placed in wind-down status but have not divested;
(8) results of our capital protection strategies; and (9) the impact of transactions with other segments. The divested businesses consist primarily of the property and casualty insurance businesses, financial advisory business, and
commercial mortgage securitization operations.

Closed Block Business.

The Closed Block Business, which is managed separately from the Financial Services Businesses, was
established on the date of demutualization. It includes the Closed Block (as discussed in Note 12); assets held outside the Closed Block necessary to meet insurance regulatory capital requirements related to products included within the Closed
Block; deferred policy acquisition costs related to the Closed Block policies; the principal amount of the IHC debt (as discussed in Note 14) and certain related assets and liabilities.

Segment Accounting Policies.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
Note 2. Results for each segment include earnings on attributed equity established at a level which management considers necessary to support each segment’s risks. Operating expenses specifically identifiable to a particular segment are
allocated to that segment as incurred. Operating expenses not identifiable to a specific segment that are incurred in connection with the generation of segment revenues are generally allocated based upon the segment’s historical percentage of
general and administrative expenses.

Adjusted Operating
Income

In managing the Financial
Services Businesses, the Company analyzes the operating performance of each segment using “adjusted operating income.” Adjusted operating income does not equate to “income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and
equity in earnings of operating joint ventures” or “net income” as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP but is the measure of segment profit or loss used by the Company to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources, and
consistent with authoritative guidance, is the measure of segment performance presented below.

Adjusted operating income is calculated by adjusting each segment’s “income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures” for the
following items, which are described in greater detail below:

•

realized investment gains (losses), net, and related charges and adjustments;

•

net investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities
due to asset value changes;



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

22.    SEGMENT INFORMATION

(continued)

•

the contribution to income/loss of divested businesses that have been or will be sold or exited but that did not qualify for “discontinued
operations” accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP; and

•

equity in earnings of operating joint ventures and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.

These items are important to an understanding of overall
results of operations. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and the Company’s definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies. However, the
Company believes that the presentation of adjusted operating income as measured for management purposes enhances the understanding of results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability factors
of the Financial Services Businesses.

Effective
with the third quarter of 2010, the Company amended its definition of adjusted operating income as it relates to certain variable annuity contracts and defined contribution accounts that contain optional guaranteed living benefit features. Changes
in the fair value of these optional living benefit features, which are accounted for as embedded derivatives, are primarily driven by changes in the policyholders’ account balance and changes in the capital market and policyholder behavior
assumptions used in the valuation of the embedded derivatives, including equity market returns, interest rates, market volatility, benefit utilization, contract lapses, contractholder mortality, and withdrawal rates. The changes in fair value of the
embedded derivative liabilities also reflect an increase or decrease in the market-perceived risk of the Company’s non-performance. The Company hedges or limits its exposure to certain risks associated with these living benefit features through
a combination of product design elements and externally purchased hedging instruments. In addition, beginning in the second quarter of 2009, the Company expanded its hedging program to include a portion of the market exposure related to the overall
capital position of the variable annuity business. During the second quarter of 2010, the equity component of the capital hedge within the variable annuity business was replaced with a new capital hedge program that more broadly addressed equity
market exposure of the statutory capital within the Financial Services Businesses as a whole. Changes in the value of the embedded derivatives inclusive of the market-perceived risk of the Company’s non-performance, and the related hedge
positions are reported in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” Historically, adjusted operating income included the changes in fair value of these embedded derivatives and related hedge positions, in the period they occurred, and
also included the related impact to amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs.

Adjusted operating income under the amended definition excludes any amounts related to changes in the market value of the embedded derivatives and related hedge positions, and the related impact to
amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs. Adjusted operating income for all periods presented has been revised to conform to the amended definition. The Company views adjusted operating income under the amended definition as a
more meaningful presentation of its results for purposes of analyzing the operating performance of, and allocating resources to, its business segments, as the amended definition presents results on a basis more consistent with the economics of the
businesses. The accounting for these products and associated derivatives under U.S. GAAP has not changed.

Represents the net impact of living benefit guarantees, hedging activities, and related amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs associated with
certain defined contribution accounts, which are excluded from adjusted operating income under the amended definition.

Represents the net impact of capital hedge related activities and consolidating adjustments associated with these living benefit guarantees, which are excluded from

Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related charges and adjustments.

Adjusted operating income excludes realized investment gains (losses), net, except as indicated below. A significant
element of realized investment gains and losses are impairments and credit-related and interest rate-related gains and losses from sales of securities. Impairments and losses from sales of credit-impaired securities, the timing of which depends
largely on market credit cycles, can vary considerably across periods. The timing of other sales that would result in gains or losses, such as interest rate-related gains or losses, is largely subject to the Company’s discretion and influenced
by market opportunities, as well as the Company’s tax and capital profile. Trends in the underlying profitability of the Company’s businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of these transactions.

Charges that relate to realized investment gains (losses),
net, are also excluded from adjusted operating income. The related charges are associated with: policyholder dividends; amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, valuation of business acquired (“VOBA”), unearned revenue reserves
and deferred sales inducements; interest credited to policyholders’ account balances; reserves for future policy benefits; and payments associated with the market value adjustment features related to certain of the annuity products the Company
sells. The related charges associated with policyholder dividends include a percentage of the net increase in the fair value of specified assets included in Gibraltar Life’s reorganization plan that was paid as a special dividend to Gibraltar
Life policyholders. The liability related to this special dividend was fully paid as of June 30, 2010. Deferred policy acquisition costs, VOBA, unearned revenue reserves and deferred sales inducements for certain products are amortized based on
estimated gross profits, which include net realized investment gains and losses on the underlying invested assets including certain portions of the net realized

(continued)

investment gains and losses related to the embedded derivatives and related hedging positions associated with the living benefit features of certain products, as discussed above. The related
charge for these items represents the portion of this amortization associated with net realized investment gains and losses. The related charges for interest credited to policyholders’ account balances relate to certain group life policies that
pass back certain realized investment gains and losses to the policyholder. The reserves for certain policies are adjusted when cash flows related to these policies are affected by net realized investment gains and losses, and the related charge for
reserves for future policy benefits represents that adjustment. Certain of the Company’s annuity products contain a market value adjustment feature that requires us to pay to the contractholder or entitles us to receive from the contractholder,
upon surrender, a market value adjustment based on the crediting rates on the contract surrendered compared to crediting rates on newly issued contracts or based on an index rate at the time of purchase compared to an index rate at time of
surrender, as applicable. These payments mitigate the net realized investment gains or losses incurred upon the disposition of the underlying invested assets. The related charge represents the payments or receipts associated with these market value
adjustment features.

Adjustments to
“Realized investment gains (losses), net,” for purposes of calculating adjusted operating income, include the following:

Gains and losses pertaining to derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, other than derivatives used in the
Company’s capacity as a broker or dealer, are included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” This includes mark-to-market adjustments of open contracts as well as periodic settlements. As discussed further below, adjusted
operating income includes a portion of realized gains and losses pertaining to certain derivative contracts.

Adjusted operating income of the International Insurance segment and International Investments segment, excluding the global commodities
group, reflect the impact of an intercompany arrangement with Corporate and Other operations pursuant to which the segments’ non-U.S. dollar denominated earnings in all countries for a particular year, including its interim reporting periods,
are translated at fixed currency exchange rates. The fixed rates are determined in connection with a currency hedging program designed to mitigate the risk that unfavorable rate changes will reduce the segments’ U.S. dollar equivalent earnings.
Pursuant to this program, the Company’s Corporate and Other operations execute forward currency contracts with third parties to sell the net exposure of projected earnings from the hedged currency in exchange for U.S. dollars at a specified
exchange rate. The maturities of these contracts correspond with the future periods in which the identified non-U.S. dollar denominated earnings are expected to be generated. These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP and,
as noted above, all resulting profits or losses from such contracts are included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” When the contracts are terminated in the same period that the expected earnings emerge, the resulting positive
or negative cash flow effect is included in adjusted operating income (net losses of $93 million and $36 million, and net gains of $11 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively). As of December 31, 2010 and
2009, the fair value of open contracts used for this purpose were net liabilities of $252 million and $16 million, respectively.

The Company uses interest rate and currency swaps and other derivatives to manage interest and currency exchange rate exposures arising
from mismatches between assets and liabilities, including duration mismatches. For the derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, mark-to-market adjustments of open contracts as well as periodic settlements are included
in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” However, the periodic swap settlements, as well as other derivative related yield adjustments, are included in adjusted operating income to reflect the after-hedge yield of the underlying
instruments. In certain instances, when these derivative contracts are terminated or offset before their final maturity, the resulting realized gains or losses recorded within “Realized investment gains (losses), net” are recognized in
adjusted operating income over periods that generally approximate the expected terms of the derivatives or underlying instruments in order for adjusted operating income to reflect the after-hedge yield of the underlying instruments. Adjusted
operating

(continued)

income includes net gains of $243 million, $167 million and $66 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, due to periodic settlements and yield adjustments
of such contracts, and includes net gains of $35 million and $26 million, and net losses of $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to certain derivative contracts that were terminated or offset
in prior periods. The table below reflects the total deferred gain (loss) related to certain derivative contracts that were terminated or offset in prior periods that will be recognized in adjusted operating income in future periods for each
segment, as well as the weighted average period over which these deferred amounts will be recognized.

Adjustments are also
made for the purposes of calculating adjusted operating income for the following items:

The Company conducts certain activities for which “Realized investment gains (losses), net” are a principal source of earnings for its businesses and therefore included in adjusted operating
income, particularly within the Company’s Asset Management segment. For example, Asset Management’s proprietary investing business makes investments for sale or syndication to other investors or for placement or co-investment in the
Company’s managed funds and structured products. The “Realized investment gains (losses), net” associated with the sale of these proprietary investments, as well as related derivative results, are a principal activity for this
business and included in adjusted operating income. In addition, the “Realized investment gains (losses), net” associated with loans originated by the Company’s commercial mortgage operations, as well as related derivative results and
retained mortgage servicing rights, are a principal activity for this business and included in adjusted operating income. Net realized investment gains of $18 million, losses of $274 million and gains of $66 million for the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to these and other businesses were included in adjusted operating income as an adjustment to “Realized investment gains (losses), net.”

The Company has certain investments in its general account
portfolios that are classified as trading. These trading investments are carried at fair value and included in “Other trading account assets, at fair value” on the Company’s statements of financial position. Realized and unrealized
gains and losses for these investments are recorded in “Asset management fees and other income,” and interest and dividend income for these investments is recorded in “Net investment income.” Consistent with the exclusion of
realized investment gains and losses with respect to other investments managed on a consistent basis, the net gains or losses on these investments, which is recorded within “Asset management fees and other income,” is excluded from
adjusted operating income and is reflected as an adjustment to “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” In addition, prior to the Company’s repayment of the obligation in 2010, the secured financing received from the Federal Reserve
under TALF was reflected within “Long-term debt,” and carried at fair value under the fair value option under authoritative guidance around fair value. The changes in the fair value of this debt, which were recorded within “Asset
management fees and other income,” was also excluded from adjusted operating income and reflected as an adjustment to “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” This is consistent with the securities purchased with the proceeds from
this financing, which were carried at fair value and included in “Other trading account assets, at fair value” as discussed above. The net impact of these adjustments was to exclude from adjusted operating income net gains of $10 million
and $55 million, and net losses of $300 million, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

22.    SEGMENT INFORMATION

(continued)

The Company has certain assets and liabilities for which, under GAAP, the changes in
value, including those associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period, are recorded in “Asset management fees and other income.” To the extent the foreign currency exposure on these assets and liabilities is
economically hedged, the change in value included in “Asset management fees and other income” is excluded from adjusted operating income and is reflected as an adjustment to “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” The net
impact of these foreign currency related and certain other adjustments was to exclude from adjusted operating income net gains of $7 million, $199 million and $210 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

As a result of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition
filed by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (“Lehman Brothers”) on September 15, 2008, the Company experienced losses related to the unsecured portion of its counterparty exposure on derivative transactions it had entered into with Lehman
Brothers and its affiliates. These losses are recorded within “Asset management fees and other income” within the Company’s Corporate and Other operations and are excluded from adjusted operating income consistent with the adjusted
operating income treatment of similar credit-related losses that are recorded within “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” For the year ended December 31, 2008, $75 million of these losses were recorded in “Asset management
fees and other income” and are excluded from adjusted operating income as a related adjustment to “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” Any subsequent recoveries of these losses will also be excluded from adjusted operating
income. There were no adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2010 or 2009.

Investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes.

Certain products
included in the Retirement and International Insurance segments, are experience-rated in that investment results associated with these products are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. The investments supporting these experience-rated
products, excluding commercial mortgage and other loans, are classified as trading and are carried at fair value. These trading investments are reflected on the statements of financial position as “Trading account assets supporting insurance
liabilities, at fair value.” Realized and unrealized gains and losses for these investments are reported in “Asset management fees and other income.” Interest and dividend income for these investments is reported in “Net
investment income.” Commercial mortgage and other loans that support these experience-rated products are carried at unpaid principal, net of unamortized discounts and an allowance for losses, and are reflected on the statements of financial
position as “Commercial mortgage and other loans.”

Adjusted operating income excludes net investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities. This is consistent with the exclusion of realized investment gains and losses
with respect to other investments supporting insurance liabilities managed on a consistent basis. In addition, to be consistent with the historical treatment of charges related to realized investment gains and losses on investments, adjusted
operating income also excludes the change in contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes in the pool of investments (including changes in the fair value of commercial mortgage and other loans) supporting these experience-rated contracts,
which are reflected in “Interest credited to policyholders’ account balances.” The result of this approach is that adjusted operating income for these products includes net fee revenue and interest spread the Company earns on these
experience-rated contracts, and excludes changes in fair value of the pool of investments, both realized and unrealized, that are expected to ultimately accrue to the contractholders.

Divested businesses.

The contribution to income/loss of divested businesses that have been or will be
sold or exited, but that did not qualify for “discontinued operations” accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP, are excluded from adjusted operating income as the results of divested businesses are not relevant to understanding the
Company’s ongoing operating results. For the year ended December 31, 2009 divested businesses includes a $2.247 billion pre-tax gain from the sale of the Company’s interest in its retail securities brokerage joint venture with
Wachovia, and $104 million of certain related one-time compensation and other costs. See Note 7 for more information on the Company’s former investment in the Wachovia Securities joint venture.

Equity in earnings of operating joint ventures and earnings attributable to
noncontrolling interests.

Equity in earnings of operating joint ventures, on a pre-tax basis, are included in adjusted operating income as these results are a principal source of earnings. These earnings are reflected on a U.S. GAAP basis on an
after-tax basis as a separate line on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests are excluded from adjusted operating income. Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the portion of earnings from consolidated
entities that relates to the equity interests of minority investors, and are reflected on a U.S. GAAP basis as a separate line on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.

AND REGULATORY MATTERS

Commitments and Guarantees

The Company occupies leased office space
in many locations under various long-term leases and has entered into numerous leases covering the long-term use of computers and other equipment. Rental expense, net of sub-lease income, incurred for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
2008 was $230 million, $231 million and $191 million, respectively.

The following table presents, at December 31, 2010, the Company’s future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases along with associated sub-lease income:

being leased, the future rental expense net of any expected sub-lease income, and to release this reserve over the remaining commitment period. Of the total non-cancelable operating leases and
sub-lease income amounts listed above, $59 million and $55 million, respectively, has been accrued at December 31, 2010.

Commercial Mortgage Loan Commitments

In connection with the Company’s commercial mortgage operations, it originates commercial mortgage loans. Commitments for loans that will be held for sale are recognized as derivatives and recorded
at fair value. In certain of these transactions, the Company prearranges that it will sell the loan to an investor, including to governmental sponsored entities as discussed below, after the Company funds the loan.

Commitments to Purchase Investments (excluding Commercial Mortgage
Loans)

The Company has other commitments to purchase or fund investments, some of which are contingent upon events or circumstances not under the Company’s control, including those at the discretion of the
Company’s counterparties. The Company anticipates a portion of these commitments will ultimately be funded from its separate accounts. Some of the separate account commitments have recourse to Prudential Insurance if the separate accounts are
unable to fund the amounts when due.

Guarantees of Investee
Debt

A number of guarantees provided by the Company relate to real estate investments held in its separate accounts, in which entities that the separate account has invested in have borrowed funds, and the
Company has guaranteed their obligations. The Company provides these guarantees to assist these entities in obtaining financing. The Company’s maximum potential exposure under these guarantees is mostly limited to the assets of the separate
account. The exposure that is not limited to the separate account assets relates to guarantees limited to fraud, criminal activity or other bad acts. These guarantees generally expire at various times over the next fifteen years. At
December 31, 2010, the Company’s assessment is that it is unlikely payments will be required. Any payments that may become required under these guarantees would either first be reduced by proceeds received by the creditor on a sale of the
underlying collateral, or would provide rights to obtain the underlying collateral.

Guarantee of Retail Development Project Costs

The Company has provided a guarantee to a syndication of lenders in connection with a retail development project in Singapore that is 50% co-owned by the Company and an unconsolidated real estate fund
managed by the Company. The principal provisions in the guarantee require that the loan-to-value ratio of the retail development project be maintained at 60% or lower, based on an external appraisal. A loan-to-value ratio in excess of 60% would
require the Company and its co-owner to jointly and severally pay down the loan balance to the 60% level. The loan-to-value ratio, based on a December 2010 appraisal is 43.5%. Other obligations under the guarantee include guaranteeing the
interest-servicing on the loan on a proportionate basis and undertaking to complete the project and fund all development costs, including cost overruns. The Company’s exposure under the guarantee assumes the co-owner honors its joint guarantee.

On October 20, 2010, the Company entered
into a contract to sell the majority of its ownership interest in the project. The sale is expected to be completed during 2011, and is conditional on the completion of the development and on obtaining refinancing on the property upon maturity of
the current loan. The Company’s obligations under the guarantee to the existing lenders will expire upon refinancing of the current loan.

Indemnification of Securities Lending Transactions

In the normal course of business, the Company may facilitate securities lending transactions on behalf of mutual funds and separate accounts for which the Company is the investment advisor and/or the
asset manager. In certain of these arrangements, the Company has provided an indemnification to the mutual funds or separate accounts to hold them harmless against losses caused by counterparty (i.e., borrower) defaults associated with the
securities lending activity facilitated by the Company. Collateral is provided by the counterparty to the mutual fund or separate account at the inception of the loan equal to or greater than 102% of the fair value of the loaned securities and the
collateral is maintained daily at 102% or greater of the fair value of the loaned securities. The Company is only at risk if the counterparty to the securities lending transaction defaults and the value of the collateral held is less than the value
of the securities loaned to such counterparty. The Company believes the possibility of any payments under these indemnities is remote.

Credit Derivatives Written

LIABILITIES AND LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS

(continued)

As discussed in Note 21, the Company writes credit derivatives under which the Company
is obligated to pay the counterparty the referenced amount of the contract and receive in return the defaulted security or similar security. The Company’s maximum amount at risk under these credit derivatives listed above assumes the value of
the underlying referenced securities become worthless. These credit derivatives generally have maturities of five years or less.

Guarantees of Asset Values

Certain contracts underwritten by the Retirement segment include guarantees related to financial assets owned by the guaranteed party. These contracts are accounted for as derivatives and carried at fair
value. The collateral supporting these guarantees is not reflected on the Company’s balance sheet.

Guarantees of Credit Enhancements

The Company arranges for credit enhancements of certain debt instruments that provide financing primarily for affordable multi-family real estate assets, including certain tax-exempt bond financings. The
credit enhancements provide assurances to the debt holders as to the timely payment of amounts due under the debt instruments. The remaining contractual maturities for these guarantees are up to fifteen years. The Company’s obligations to
reimburse required credit enhancement payments are secured by mortgages on the related real estate. The Company receives certain ongoing fees for providing these enhancement arrangements and anticipates the extinguishment of its obligation under
these enhancements prior to maturity through the aggregation and transfer of its positions to a substitute enhancement provider.

Indemnification of Serviced Mortgage Loans

As part of the commercial mortgage activities of the Company’s Asset Management segment, the Company provides commercial mortgage origination, underwriting and servicing for certain government
sponsored entities, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Company has agreed to indemnify the government sponsored entities for a portion of the credit risk associated with certain of the mortgages it services through a delegated authority

arrangement. Under these arrangements, the Company originates multi-family mortgages for sale to the government sponsored entities based on underwriting standards they specify, and make payments
to them for a specified percentage share of losses they incur on certain loans serviced by the Company. The Company’s percentage share of losses incurred generally varies from 2% to 20% of the loan balance, and is typically based on a
first-loss exposure for a stated percentage of the loan balance, plus a shared exposure with the government sponsored entity for any losses in excess of the stated first-loss percentage, subject to a contractually specified maximum percentage. The
Company services $8,511 million of mortgages subject to these loss-sharing arrangements as of December 31, 2010, all of which are collateralized by first priority liens on the underlying multi-family residential properties. As of
December 31, 2010, these mortgages had an average debt service coverage ratio of 1.72 times and an average loan-to-value ratio of 72%. The Company’s total share of losses related to indemnifications that were settled were $3 million, $0
million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Contingent Consideration

As of December 31,


(in millions)

Maximum potential contingent consideration associated with acquisitions

$


In connection with certain acquisitions, the Company has agreed to pay additional consideration in future periods, contingent upon the attainment by the acquired entity of defined operating objectives.
These arrangements will be resolved over the following three years. Any such payments would result in increases in intangible assets, such as goodwill.

Other Guarantees

The Company is also subject to other financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements. The Company has provided indemnities and guarantees related to acquisitions, dispositions, investments and other
transactions that are triggered by, among other things, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by the Company. These obligations are typically subject to various time limitations, defined by the contract or by operation of
law, such as statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum potential obligation is subject to contractual limitations, while in other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable. Since certain of these obligations are not subject to
limitations, it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount due under these guarantees. The accrued liabilities identified above do not include retained liabilities associated with sold businesses.

Contingent Liabilities

On an ongoing basis, the Company’s internal supervisory
and control functions review the quality of sales, marketing and other customer interface procedures and practices and may recommend modifications or enhancements. From time to time, this review process results in the discovery of product
administration, servicing or other errors, including errors relating to the timing or amount of payments or contract values due to customers. In certain cases, if appropriate, the Company may offer customers remediation and may incur charges,
including the cost of such remediation, administrative costs and regulatory fines.

It is possible that the results of operations or the cash flow of the Company in a
particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected as a result of payments in connection with the matters discussed above or other matters depending, in part, upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period. Management
believes, however, that ultimate payments in connection with these matters, after consideration of applicable reserves and rights to indemnification, should not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position.

Litigation and Regulatory Matters

The Company is subject to legal and regulatory actions in
the ordinary course of its businesses. Pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings relating to aspects of the Company’s businesses and operations that are specific to it and proceedings that are typical of the businesses in which
it operates, including in both cases businesses that have been either divested or placed in wind-down status. Some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants. In certain of these matters, the
plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. The outcome of litigation or a regulatory matter, and the amount or range of potential loss at any particular time, is often inherently uncertain.

Individual Life and Group Insurance

In January 2011, a purported state-wide class
action,

Garcia v. The Prudential Insurance Company of America

was dismissed by the Second Judicial District Court, Washoe County, Nevada. The complaint is brought on behalf of Nevada beneficiaries of life insurance policies sold by the
Company for which, unless the beneficiaries elected another settlement method, death benefits were placed in retained asset accounts that earn interest and are subject to withdrawal in whole or in part at any time by the beneficiaries. The complaint
alleges that by failing to disclose material information about the accounts, the Company wrongfully delayed payment and improperly retained undisclosed profits, and seeks damages, injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees and prejudgment and
post-judgment interest. In February 2011, plaintiff appealed the dismissal. As previously reported, in December 2009, an earlier purported nationwide class action raising substantially similar allegations brought by the same plaintiff in the United
States District Court for the District of New Jersey,

Garcia v. Prudential Insurance Company of America,

was dismissed. In December 2010, a purported state-wide class action complaint,

Phillips v. Prudential Financial, Inc.,

was filed
in the Circuit Court of the First Judicial Circuit, Williamson County, Illinois. The complaint makes allegations under Illinois law, substantially similar to the

Garcia

cases, on behalf of a class of Illinois residents whose death benefits
were settled by retained assets accounts. In January 2011, the case was removed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. In July 2010, a purported nationwide class action that makes allegations similar to those in
the

Garcia

and

Phillips

actions relating to retained asset accounts of beneficiaries of a group life insurance contract owned by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA Contract”) that covers the lives of
members and veterans of the U.S. armed forces,

Lucey et al. v. Prudential Insurance Company of America,

was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The complaint challenges the use of retained asset
accounts to settle death benefit claims, asserting violations of federal and state law, breach of contract and fraud and seeking compensatory and treble damages and equitable relief. In October 2010, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint. In November 2010, a second purported nationwide class action brought on behalf of the same beneficiaries of the VA Contract,

Phillips v. Prudential Insurance Company of America and Prudential Financial, Inc.,

was filed in the
United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, and makes substantially the same claims. In November and December 2010, two additional actions brought on behalf of the same putative class, alleging substantially the same claims and the
same relief,

Garrett v. The Prudential Insurance Company of America

and

Prudential Financial, Inc. and Witt v. The Prudential Insurance Company of America

were filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.

Garrett and Witt

were transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of Massachusetts by the Judical Panel for Multi-District Litigation. In September 2010,

Huffman v. The Prudential Insurance Company,

a purported nationwide class action brought on behalf of beneficiaries of group life insurance contracts owned by ERISA-governed employee welfare benefit plans was filed in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleging that using retained asset accounts in employee welfare benefit plans to settle death benefit claims violates ERISA and seeking injunctive relief and disgorgement of profits. The
Company has moved to dismiss the complaint. In July 2010, the Company, along with other life insurance industry participants, received a formal request for information from the State of New York Attorney General’s Office in connection with its
investigation into industry practices relating to the use of retained asset accounts. In August 2010, the Company received a similar request for information from the State of Connecticut Attorney General’s Office. The Company is cooperating
with these investigations. The Company has also been contacted by state insurance regulators and other governmental entities, including the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Congressional committees regarding retained asset accounts. These
matters may result in additional investigations, information requests, claims, hearings, litigation and adverse publicity.

In April 2009, a purported nationwide class action,

Schultz v. The Prudential Insurance Company of America,

was filed in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. In January 2010, the court dismissed the complaint without prejudice. In February 2010, plaintiff sought leave to amend the complaint to add another plaintiff and to name the ERISA welfare
plans in which they were participants individually and as representatives of a purported defendant class of ERISA welfare plans for which Prudential offset benefits. The proposed amended complaint alleged that Prudential Insurance and the welfare
plans violated ERISA by offsetting family Social Security benefits against Prudential contract benefits and seeks a declaratory judgment that the offsets are unlawful as they are not “loss of time” benefits and recovery of the amounts by
which the challenged offsets reduced the disability payments. In August 2010, the court denied leave to amend as to Prudential and plaintiffs subsequently filed a third amended complaint asserting claims on behalf of a purported nationwide class
against a purported defendant class of ERISA welfare plans for which Prudential offset family Social Security benefits. The action, now captioned

Schultz v. Aviall, Inc. Long Term Disability Plan,

asserts the same ERISA violations. In
December 2010, an action alleging substantially similar ERISA violations as in the

Schultz

action,

Koehn v. Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company Long Term Disability Plan,

was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of California. The

Koehn

complaint, naming only the plan as defendant, asserts that the defendant plan’s long term disability benefits are insured by Prudential and that the terms of the plan were violated by offsetting family
Social Security benefits against Prudential contract benefits. The Company is indemnifying the defendant plans in both

From November 2002 to March 2005, eleven separate complaints were filed against the Company and the law firm of Leeds Morelli &
Brown in New Jersey state court. The cases were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in New Jersey Superior Court, Essex County and captioned

Lederman v. Prudential Financial, Inc., et al

. The complaints allege that an alternative dispute
resolution agreement entered into among Prudential Insurance, over 350 claimants who are current and former Prudential Insurance employees, and Leeds Morelli & Brown (the law firm representing the claimants) was illegal and that Prudential
Insurance conspired with Leeds Morelli & Brown to commit fraud, malpractice, breach of contract, and violate racketeering laws by advancing legal fees to the law firm with the purpose of limiting Prudential’s liability to the
claimants. In 2004, the Superior Court sealed these lawsuits and compelled them to arbitration. In May 2006, the Appellate Division reversed the trial court’s decisions, held that the cases were improperly sealed, and should be heard in court
rather than arbitrated. In March 2007, the court granted plaintiffs’ motion to amend the complaint to add over 200 additional plaintiffs and a claim under the New Jersey discrimination law but denied without prejudice plaintiffs’ motion
for a joint trial on liability issues. In June 2007, Prudential Financial and Prudential Insurance moved to dismiss the complaint. In November 2007, the court granted the motion, in part, and dismissed the commercial bribery and conspiracy to commit
malpractice claims, and denied the motion with respect to other claims. In January 2008, plaintiffs filed a demand pursuant to New Jersey law stating that they were seeking damages in the amount of

$6.5 billion. In February 2010, the New Jersey Supreme Court assigned the cases for centralized case management to the Superior Court, Bergen County. The Company participated in a court-ordered
mediation that has resulted in a settlement in principle.

Retirement Solutions and Investment Management

In October 2007, Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity Co. (“PRIAC”) filed an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,

Prudential Retirement
Insurance & Annuity Co. v. State Street Global Advisors,

in PRIAC’s fiduciary capacity and on behalf of certain defined benefit and defined contribution plan clients of PRIAC, against an unaffiliated asset manager, State Street
Global Advisors (“SSgA”) and SSgA’s affiliate, State Street Bank and Trust Company (“State Street”). This action seeks, among other relief, restitution of certain losses attributable to certain investment funds sold by SSgA
as to which PRIAC believes SSgA employed investment strategies and practices that were misrepresented by SSgA and failed to exercise the standard of care of a prudent investment manager. Given the unusual circumstances surrounding the management of
these SSgA funds and in order to protect the interests of the affected plans and their participants while PRIAC pursues these remedies, PRIAC implemented a process under which affected plan clients that authorized PRIAC to proceed on their behalf
have received payments from funds provided by PRIAC for the losses referred to above. The Company’s consolidated financial statements, and the results of the Retirement segment included in the Company’s U.S. Retirement Solutions and
Investment Management Division, for the year ended December 31, 2007 include a pre-tax charge of $82 million, reflecting these payments to plan clients and certain related costs. In September 2008, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York denied the State Street defendants’ motion to dismiss claims for damages and other relief under Section 502(a)(2) of ERISA, but dismissed the claims for equitable relief under Section 502(a)(3) of ERISA.
In October 2008, defendants answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims for contribution and indemnification, defamation and violations of Massachusetts’ unfair and deceptive trade practices law. In February 2010, State Street reached a
settlement with the SEC over charges that it misled investors about their exposure to subprime investments, resulting in significant investor losses in mid-2007. Under the settlement, State Street paid approximately $313 million in disgorgement,
pre-judgment interest, penalty and compensation into a Fair Fund that was distributed to injured investors and consequently, State Street paid PRIAC, for deposit into its separate accounts, approximately $52.5 million. By the terms of the
settlement, State Street’s payment to PRIAC does not resolve any claims PRIAC has against State Street or SSgA in connection with the losses in the investment funds SSgA managed, and the penalty component of State Street’s SEC settlement
(approximately $8.4 million) cannot be used to offset or reduce compensatory damages in the action against State Street and SSgA. In June 2010, PRIAC moved for partial summary judgment on State Street’s counterclaims. At the same time, State
Street moved for summary judgment on PRIAC’s complaint.

In June 2009, special bankruptcy counsel for Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (“LBHI”), Lehman Brothers Special Financing (“LBSF”) and certain of their affiliates made a demand of
Prudential Global Funding LLC (“PGF”), a subsidiary of the Company, for the return of a portion of the $550 million in collateral delivered by LBSF to PGF pursuant to swap agreements and a cross margining and netting agreement between PGF,
LBSF and Lehman Brothers Finance S.A. a/k/a Lehman Brothers Finance AG (“Lehman Switzerland”), a Swiss affiliate that is subject to insolvency proceedings in the United States and Switzerland. LBSF claims that PGF wrongfully applied the
collateral to Lehman Switzerland’s obligations in violation of the automatic stay in LBSF’s bankruptcy case, which is jointly administered under

In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc

. in the United States Bankruptcy Court in the
Southern District of New York (the “Lehman Chapter 11 Cases”). In August 2009, PGF filed a declaratory judgment action in the same court against LBSF, Lehman Switzerland and LBHI (as guarantor of LBSF and Lehman Switzerland under the swap
agreements) seeking an order that (a) PGF had an effective lien on the collateral that secured the obligations of both LBSF ($197 million) and Lehman

(continued)

Switzerland ($488 million) and properly foreclosed on the collateral leaving PGF with an unsecured $135 million claim against LBSF (and LBHI as guarantor) or, in the alternative, (b) PGF was
entitled, under the Bankruptcy Code, to set off amounts owed by Lehman Switzerland against the collateral and the automatic stay was inapplicable. The declaratory judgment action is captioned

Prudential Global Funding LLC v

.

Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., et al

. In addition, PGF filed timely claims against LBSF and LBHI in the Lehman Chapter 11 Cases for any amounts due under the swap agreements, depending on the results of the declaratory judgment action. In October 2009,
LBSF and LBHI answered in the declaratory judgment action and asserted counterclaims that PGF breached the swap agreement, seeking a declaratory judgment that PGF had a perfected lien on only $178 million of the collateral that could be applied only
to amounts owed by LBSF and no right of set off against Lehman Switzerland’s obligations, as well as the return of collateral in the amount of $372 million plus interest and the disallowance of PGF’s claims against LBSF and LBHI. LBSF and
LBHI also asserted cross-claims against Lehman Switzerland seeking return of the collateral. In December 2009, PGF filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings to resolve the matter in its favor. In February 2010, LBSF and LBHI cross-moved for
judgment on the pleadings.

Other Matters

Mutual Fund Market Timing Practices

In August 2006, Prudential Equity Group, LLC
(“PEG”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, reached a resolution of the previously disclosed regulatory and criminal investigations into deceptive market related activities involving PEG’s former Prudential Securities
operations. The settlements relate to conduct that generally occurred between 1999 and 2003 involving certain former Prudential Securities brokers in Boston and certain other branch offices in the U.S., their supervisors, and other members of the
Prudential Securities control structure with responsibilities that related to the market timing activities, including certain former members of Prudential Securities senior management. The Prudential Securities operations were contributed to a joint
venture with Wachovia Corporation in July 2003, but PEG retained liability for the market timing related activities. In connection with the resolution of the investigations, PEG entered into separate settlements with each of the United States
Attorney for the District of Massachusetts (“USAO”), the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Securities Division, SEC, the National Association of Securities Dealers, the New York Stock Exchange, the New Jersey Bureau of
Securities and the NYAG. These settlements resolved the investigations by the above named authorities into these matters as to all Prudential entities without further regulatory proceedings or filing of charges so long as the terms of the settlement
are followed and provided, in the case of the settlement agreement reached with the USAO, that the USAO has reserved the right to prosecute PEG if there is a material breach by PEG of that agreement during its five year term and in certain other
specified events. Under the terms of the settlements, PEG paid $270 million into a Fair Fund administered by the SEC to compensate those harmed by the market timing activities. In addition, $330 million was paid in fines and penalties. Pursuant to
the settlements, PEG retained, at PEG’s ongoing cost and expense, the services of an Independent Distribution Consultant acceptable to certain of the authorities to develop a proposed distribution plan for the distribution of Fair Fund amounts
according to a methodology developed in consultation with and acceptable to certain of the authorities. The plan has been accepted and distribution of the Fair Fund is substantially complete. In addition, as part of the settlements, PEG agreed,
among other things, to continue to cooperate with the above named authorities in any litigation, ongoing investigations or other proceedings relating to or arising from their investigations into these matters. In connection with the settlements, the
Company agreed with the USAO, among other things, to cooperate with the USAO and to maintain and periodically report on the effectiveness of its compliance procedures.

Corporate

In March 2009, a purported class action,

Bauer v.
Prudential Financial, et al

., was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The case names as defendants, the Company, certain Company Directors, the Chief Financial Officer, Controller and former Chief Executive
Officer and former Principal Accounting Officer, underwriters and the Company’s independent auditors. The complaint, brought on behalf of purchasers of the Company’s 9% Junior Subordinated Notes (retail hybrid subordinated debt), alleges
that the Company’s March 2006 Form S-3 Registration Statement and Prospectus and the June 2008 Prospectus Supplement, both of which incorporated other public filings, contained material misstatements or omissions. In light of the Company’s
disclosures in connection with its 2008 financial results, plaintiffs contend that the earlier offering documents failed to disclose impairments in the Company’s asset-backed securities collateralized with subprime mortgages and goodwill
associated with certain subsidiaries and other assets, and that the Company had inadequate controls relating to such reporting. The complaint asserts violations of the Securities Act of 1933, alleging Section 11 claims against all defendants,
Section 12(a)(2) claims against the Company and underwriters and Section 15 claims against the individual defendants, and seeks unspecified compensatory and rescission damages, interest, costs, fees, expenses and such injunctive relief as
may be deemed appropriate by the court. In April 2009, two additional purported class action complaints were filed in the same court,

Haddock v. Prudential Financial, Inc. et al. and Pinchuk v. Prudential Financial, Inc. et al

. The complaints
essentially allege the same claims and seek the same relief as

Bauer

. In June 2009,

Pinchuk

was voluntarily dismissed and the

Haddock

and

Bauer

matters were consolidated. In July 2009, an amended consolidated complaint
was filed that added claims regarding contingent liability relating to the auction rate securities markets and reserves relating to annuity contract holders. The complaint restates the claims regarding impairments related to mortgage backed
securities, but does not include prior claims regarding goodwill impairments. The complaint names all of the same defendants as the prior complaints, with the exception of the Company’s independent auditors. In September 2009, defendants filed
a motion to dismiss the complaint. In June 2010, the court dismissed without prejudice the claim relating to contingent liability in connection with auction rate securities and denied the motion with respect to the other claims. In July 2010,
plaintiffs filed an amended complaint restating their contingent liability claim and, in September 2010, defendants moved to dismiss the restated claim.

Securities Underwriting

Prudential Securities was a defendant in a number of industry-wide purported class actions in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York relating to its former securities underwriting business, captioned

In re: Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation

, alleging, among other things, that the underwriters engaged in a scheme involving tying
agreements, undisclosed compensation arrangements and research analyst conflicts to manipulate and inflate the prices of shares sold in initial public offerings in violation of the federal securities laws. In September 2009, the court entered a
final order approving settlement of the litigation. In October 2009, an appeal of the settlement was filed with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

Other

In October 2006, a purported class action lawsuit,

Bouder v. Prudential Financial, Inc

.

and
Prudential Insurance Company of America

, was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, claiming that Prudential failed to pay overtime to insurance agents in violation of federal and Pennsylvania law, and that
improper deductions were made from these agents’ wages in violation of state law. The complaint seeks back overtime pay and statutory damages, recovery of improper deductions, interest, and attorneys’ fees. In March 2008, the court
conditionally certified a nationwide class on the federal overtime claim. Separately, in March 2008, a purported nationwide class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the

(continued)

Southern District of California,

Wang v. Prudential Financial, Inc. and Prudential Insurance

, claiming that the Company failed to pay its agents overtime and provide other benefits in
violation of California and federal law and seeking compensatory and punitive damages in unspecified amounts. In September 2008,

Wang

was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and consolidated with the

Bouder

matter. Subsequent amendments to the complaint have resulted in additional allegations involving purported violations of an additional nine states’ overtime and wage payment laws. In February 2010, Prudential moved to decertify
the federal overtime class that had been conditionally certified in March 2008, and moved for summary judgment on the federal overtime claims of the named plaintiffs. In July 2010, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification of the state law
claims. In August 2010, the district court granted Prudential’s motion for summary judgment, dismissing the federal overtime claims. The motion for class certification of the state law claims is pending.

Summary

The Company’s litigation and regulatory matters are
subject to many uncertainties, and given their complexity and scope, their outcome cannot be predicted. It is possible that the Company’s results of operations or cash flow in a particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected
by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of pending litigation and regulatory matters depending, in part, upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period. In light of the unpredictability of the Company’s litigation and regulatory
matters, it is also possible that in certain cases an ultimate unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or regulatory matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. Management believes,
however, that, based on information currently known to it, the ultimate outcome of all pending litigation and regulatory matters, after consideration of applicable reserves and rights to indemnification, is not likely to have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial position.

administrative expenses” includes certain one-time costs related to the sale of the joint venture interest of $104 million for pre-tax compensation costs and costs related to increased contributions to the Company’s charitable foundation.
The total of these items is an after-tax gain of $1.389 billion, or $2.95 per share of Common Stock. See Note 7 for additional information.

Notes to Supplemental Combining Financial Information

1.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The supplemental combining financial information presents
the consolidated financial position and results of operations for Prudential Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries (together, the “Company”), separately reporting the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. The
Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business are both fully integrated operations of the Company and are not separate legal entities. The supplemental combining financial information presents the results of the Financial Services
Businesses and the Closed Block Business as if they were separate reporting entities and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company has outstanding two classes of common stock. The
Common Stock reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Class B Stock reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business.

The Closed Block Business was established on the date of demutualization and includes the assets and liabilities of the Closed Block (see
Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Closed Block). It also includes assets held outside the Closed Block necessary to meet insurance regulatory capital requirements related to products included within the Closed
Block; deferred policy acquisition costs related to the Closed Block policies; the principal amount of the IHC debt (as discussed below and in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and related unamortized debt issuance costs, as well as
an interest rate swap related to the IHC debt; and certain other related assets and liabilities. The Financial Services Businesses consist of the U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management, U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance, and
International Insurance and Investments divisions and Corporate and Other operations.

2.    ALLOCATION OF RESULTS

This supplemental combining financial information reflects
the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses directly attributable to the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, as well as allocations deemed reasonable by management in order to fairly present the financial position and
results of operations of the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business on a stand-alone basis. While management considers the allocations utilized to be reasonable, management has the discretion to make operational and financial
decisions that may affect the allocation methods and resulting assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of each business. In addition, management has limited discretion over accounting policies and the appropriate allocation of earnings between
the two businesses. The Company is subject to agreements which provide that, in most instances, the Company may not change the allocation methodology or accounting policies for the allocation of earnings between the Financial Services Businesses and
Closed Block Business without the prior consent of the Class B Stock holders or IHC debt bond insurer.

General corporate overhead not directly attributable to a specific business that has been incurred in connection with the generation of
the businesses’ revenues is generally allocated between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business based on the general and administrative expenses of each business as a percentage of the total general and administrative
expenses for all businesses.

PHLLC has
outstanding IHC debt, of which net proceeds of $1.66 billion were allocated to the Financial Services Businesses concurrent with the demutualization on December 18, 2001. The IHC debt is serviced by the cash flows of the Closed Block Business,
and the results of the Closed Block Business reflect interest expense associated with the IHC debt.

Income taxes are allocated between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business as if they were separate companies based on the taxable income or losses and other tax characterizations
of each business. If a business generates benefits, such as net operating losses, it is entitled to record such tax benefits to the extent they are expected to be utilized on a consolidated basis.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Supplemental Combining Financial Information

2.    ALLOCATION OF RESULTS

(continued)

Holders of Common Stock have no interest in a separate legal entity representing the
Financial Services Businesses; holders of the Class B Stock have no interest in a separate legal entity representing the Closed Block Business; and holders of each class of common stock are subject to all of the risks associated with an investment
in the Company.

In the event of a liquidation,
dissolution or winding-up of the Company, holders of Common Stock and holders of Class B Stock would be entitled to receive a proportionate share of the net assets of the Company that remain after paying all liabilities and the liquidation
preferences of any preferred stock.

The results
of the Financial Services Businesses are subject to certain risks pertaining to the Closed Block. These include any expenses and liabilities from litigation affecting the Closed Block policies as well as the consequences of certain potential adverse
tax determinations. In connection with the sale of the Class B Stock and IHC debt, the cost of indemnifying the investors with respect to certain matters will be borne by the Financial Services Businesses.

0.44% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.



Convertible Senior Notes

On December 12, 2007 and December 7, 2006, Prudential Financial issued in a private placement $3.0
billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, of floating rate convertible senior notes that are convertible by the holders at any time after issuance into cash and shares of Prudential Financial’s Common Stock, at a stated conversion price of
$132.39 and $104.21 per share, respectively. Holders of the notes may require Prudential Financial to repurchase the notes, at par plus accrued interest, on contractually specified dates. During 2009 and 2008, $2,147 million and $853 million,
respectively, of the $3.0 billion floating rate convertible senior notes were repurchased by Prudential Financial at the request of the holders or through individually negotiated transactions. In addition, during both 2010 and 2009, $2 million of
the $2.0 billion floating rate convertible senior notes were repurchased by Prudential Financial at the request of the holders. Prior to 2009, an aggregate amount of $1,996 million of the $2.0 billion floating rate convertible senior notes was
repurchased by the Company at the request of the holders. As of December 31, 2010, an aggregate amount of $0.4 million of these floating rate convertible senior notes remain outstanding.

Credit Facilities

As of December 31, 2010, Prudential Financial,
Prudential Insurance and Prudential Funding maintained an aggregate of $4,108 million of unsecured committed credit facilities, of which Prudential Financial is the sole borrower party to a $1,250 million credit facility. These facilities have terms
ranging from one to five years. There were no outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities as of December 31, 2010. Each of the facilities is available to the applicable borrowers up to the aggregate committed credit and may be used for
general corporate purposes, including as backup liquidity for the Company’s commercial paper programs, discussed above. Any borrowings under the credit facilities would mature no later than the respective expiration dates of the facilities and
would bear interest at the rates set forth in the applicable credit agreement.

These credit facilities contain representations and warranties, covenants and events of default that are customary for facilities of this type. The Company’s ability to borrow under the facilities is
conditioned on the continued satisfaction of customary conditions, including, for the facilities shared by Prudential Financial, Prudential Insurance and Prudential Funding, the maintenance at all times by Prudential Insurance of total adjusted
capital of at least $5.5 billion based on statutory accounting principles prescribed under New Jersey law and, in the case of each of the facilities, Prudential Financial’s maintenance of a prescribed minimum level of consolidated net worth.
For the credit facilities shared by Prudential Financial, Prudential Insurance and Prudential Funding, the minimum level of consolidated net worth of Prudential Financial is $12.5 billion, which for this purpose is based upon U.S. GAAP equity,
excluding net unrealized gains and losses on investments. For the credit facility on which Prudential Financial is the sole borrower party, the minimum level of consolidated net worth of Prudential Financial is $19.0 billion, which for this purpose
is based upon U.S. GAAP equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

As of December 31, 2010, Prudential Insurance’s total adjusted capital and Prudential Financial’s consolidated net worth (as defined in the applicable credit agreements) exceeded the
minimum amounts required to borrow under the facilities. The Company’s ability to borrow under the facilities is not contingent on its credit ratings nor subject to material adverse change clauses.

Long-term Debt

Junior Subordinated Notes

In June and July 2008, Prudential Financial issued $600
million of 8.875% fixed-to-floating rate junior subordinated notes to institutional investors and $920 million of 9.0% fixed-rate junior subordinated notes to retail investors. Both issuances are considered hybrid capital securities, which receive
enhanced equity treatment from the rating agencies. Both series of notes have a scheduled maturity of June 15, 2038 and a final maturity of June 15, 2068. Prudential Financial is required to use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to
market disruption events, to raise sufficient proceeds from the issuance of specified qualifying capital securities, which include hybrid capital securities, to repay the principal of the notes at their scheduled maturity. For the institutional
notes, interest is payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 8.875% until June 15, 2018, from which



date interest is payable quarterly at a floating rate of 3-month LIBOR plus 5.00%. Prudential Financial may redeem the institutional notes, subject to the terms of the replacement capital
covenant, or RCC, as discussed below, in whole or in part, on or after June 15, 2018 at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest or prior to June 15, 2018 at a make-whole price. Prudential Financial may redeem the retail
notes, subject to the terms of the RCC as discussed below, on or after June 15, 2013, in whole or in part, at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest or prior to June 15, 2013, in whole, at a make-whole price. Both
series of notes may also be redeemed in whole upon the occurrence of certain defined events. Prudential Financial has the right to defer interest payments on either or both series of notes for a period up to ten years, during which time interest
will be compounded. If Prudential Financial were to exercise its right to defer interest it will be required, commencing on the earlier of (i) the first interest payment date on which current interest is paid after the deferral period or
(ii) the fifth anniversary of the deferral period, to issue specified alternative payment securities, which include but are not limited to Common Stock, to satisfy its obligation with respect to the deferred interest. In connection with the
issuance of both series of notes, Prudential Financial entered into a RCC for the benefit of holders of the Company’s 6.625% Senior Notes due 2037. Under the RCC, Prudential Financial agrees that it will not repay, redeem, defease, or purchase
the notes prior to June 15, 2048, unless it has received proceeds from the issuance of specified replacement capital securities, which include but are not limited to hybrid capital securities as well as Common Stock. The RCC will terminate upon
the occurrence of certain events, including acceleration due to an event of default.

Other

In order to modify exposure to interest rate movements, Prudential Financial utilizes derivative instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt issues. The impact of
these derivative instruments are not reflected in the rates presented in the table above. For those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment, interest expense was decreased by $15 million and $5 million for the years ended
December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Undistributed Demutualization Consideration

“Other liabilities” include liabilities of $4 million and $5 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, for
undistributed demutualization consideration payable to eligible policyholders whom we have been or were unable to locate as of those dates. In 2010 and 2009, Prudential Financial paid $1 million and $1 million, respectively, in demutualization
consideration to eligible policyholders whom we have located since the time of demutualization and to governmental authorities in respect of other eligible policyholders whom we continue to be unable to locate. Prudential Financial remains obligated
to disburse $4 million of demutualization consideration to the governmental authorities if we are unable to establish contact with eligible policyholders within time periods prescribed by state unclaimed property laws.



4.    DIVIDENDS AND RETURNS OF CAPITAL

5.    GUARANTEES

Prudential Financial has issued a
subordinated guarantee covering a subsidiary’s domestic commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2010, there was $874 million outstanding under this commercial paper program.

Prudential Financial is also subject to other financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements, including those
made in the normal course of businesses guaranteeing the performance of, or representations made by, Prudential Financial subsidiaries. Prudential Financial has provided indemnities and guarantees related to acquisitions, dispositions, investments,
debt issuances and other transactions, including those provided as part of its on-going operations that are triggered by, among other things, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by Prudential Financial or its subsidiaries.
These obligations are typically subject to various time limitations, defined by the contract or by operation of law, such as statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum potential obligation is subject to contractual limitations, while in
other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable. Since certain of these obligations are not subject to limitations, it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount due under these guarantees. At December 31, 2010,
Prudential Financial has accrued liabilities of $2 million associated with all other financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements, which does not include retained liabilities associated with sold businesses.
