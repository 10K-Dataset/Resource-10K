PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Overview

Prudential Financial, Inc., a financial services leader with approximately $1.060 trillion of assets under management as of
December 31, 2012, has operations in the United States, Asia, Europe and Latin America. Through our subsidiaries and affiliates, we offer a wide array of financial products and services, including life insurance, annuities, retirement-related
services, mutual funds and investment management. We offer these products and services to individual and institutional customers through proprietary and third party distribution networks. Our principal executive offices are located in Newark, New
Jersey.

The businesses of Prudential Financial
are separated into the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. The Financial Services Businesses comprises our U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management division, U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance division, and
International Insurance division as well as our Corporate and Other operations. The Closed Block Business comprises the assets and related liabilities of the Closed Block described below and certain related assets and liabilities.

We maintain diversified investment portfolios in our
insurance companies to support our liabilities to customers in our Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, as well as our other general liabilities. Our investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity
securities, commercial mortgage and other loans, equity securities and other invested assets. As of December 31, 2012, the general account investment portfolio totaled $330.7 billion for the Financial Services Businesses and $67.9 billion for
the Closed Block Business. For additional information on our investment portfolio see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—General Account Investments” and Note 4 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Prudential
Financial has two classes of common stock outstanding. The Common Stock, which is publicly traded (NYSE:PRU), reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses, while the Class B Stock, which was issued through a private placement and
does not trade on any exchange, reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business. However, the market value of the Common Stock may not reflect solely the performance of the Financial Services Businesses.

Demutualization and Separation of the Businesses

Demutualization

On December 18, 2001, Prudential Insurance converted
from a mutual life insurance company owned by its policyholders to a stock life insurance company and became an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial. The demutualization was carried out under Prudential Insurance’s Plan of
Reorganization, dated as of December 15, 2000, as amended, which we refer to as the Plan of Reorganization. On the date of demutualization, eligible policyholders, as defined in the Plan of Reorganization, received shares of Prudential
Financial’s Common Stock or the right to receive cash or policy credits, which are increases in policy values or increases in other policy benefits, upon the extinguishment of all membership interests in Prudential Insurance. In addition, on
the date of demutualization, Prudential Holdings, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial that owns the capital stock of Prudential Insurance, issued $1.75 billion in senior secured notes, which we refer to as the IHC debt.



The Plan of Reorganization required us to establish and operate a regulatory mechanism known
as the Closed Block. The Closed Block is designed generally to provide for the reasonable expectations of holders of participating individual life insurance policies and annuities included in the Closed Block for future policy dividends after
demutualization by allocating assets that will be used for payment of benefits, including policyholder dividends, on these policies. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “—Closed Block Business” below for more
information on the Closed Block.

Separation of the Businesses

The businesses of Prudential Financial are
separated into the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business for financial statement purposes. For a discussion of the operating results of the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” See “—Financial Services Businesses” below for a more detailed discussion of the divisions comprising the Financial Services
Businesses. The Closed Block Business comprises the assets and related liabilities of the Closed Block and certain other assets and liabilities, including the IHC debt. We refer to the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business
collectively as the Businesses.

The following
diagram reflects the allocation of Prudential Financial’s consolidated assets and liabilities between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business:

There is no legal
separation of the two Businesses. The foregoing allocation of assets and liabilities does not require Prudential Financial, Prudential Insurance, any of their subsidiaries or the Closed Block to transfer any specific assets or liabilities to a
separate legal entity. Financial results of the Closed Block Business, including debt service on the IHC debt, will affect Prudential Financial’s consolidated results of operations, financial position and borrowing costs. In addition, any net
losses of the Closed Block Business, and any dividends or distributions on, or repurchases of, the Class B Stock, will reduce the assets of Prudential Financial legally available for dividends on the Common Stock. Accordingly, you should read the
financial information for the Financial Services Businesses together with the consolidated financial information of Prudential Financial.

In order to separately reflect the financial performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business since the date
of demutualization, we have allocated all our assets and liabilities and earnings between the two Businesses, and we account for them as if they were separate legal entities. All assets and liabilities of Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries
not included in the Closed Block Business constitute the assets and liabilities of the Financial Services Businesses. Assets and liabilities allocated to the Closed Block Business are those that we consider appropriate to operate that business. The
Closed Block Business consists principally of:

•

within Prudential Insurance, the Closed Block Assets, Surplus and Related Assets (see below), deferred policy acquisition costs and other assets in
respect of the policies included in the Closed Block and, with respect to liabilities, the Closed Block Liabilities;



•

within Prudential Holdings, LLC, dividends received from Prudential Insurance, certain tax benefits and reinvestment proceeds thereof, the principal
amount of the IHC debt, related unamortized debt issuance costs and hedging activities, and a guaranteed investment contract; and

•

within Prudential Financial, the Class B stock, dividends received from Prudential Holdings, LLC and any reinvestment proceeds thereof, and other
liabilities of Prudential Financial, in each case attributable the Closed Block Business.

The Closed Block Assets consist of (1) those assets initially allocated to the Closed Block including fixed maturities, equity
securities, commercial loans and other long- and short-term investments; (2) cash flows from such assets; (3) assets resulting from the reinvestment of such cash flows; (4) cash flows from the Closed Block Policies; and
(5) assets resulting from the investment of cash flows from the Closed Block Policies. The Closed Block Assets include policy loans, accrued interest on any of the foregoing assets and premiums due on the Closed Block Policies. The Closed Block
Liabilities are Closed Block Policies and other liabilities of the Closed Block associated with the Closed Block Assets. The Closed Block Assets and Closed Block Liabilities are supported by additional assets held outside of the Closed Block by
Prudential Insurance, to provide additional capital with respect to the Closed Block Policies, as well as invested assets held outside of the Closed Block that initially represented the difference between the Closed Block Assets and the sum of the
Closed Block Liabilities and the interest maintenance reserve, which collectively we refer to as the Surplus and Related Assets.

On the date of demutualization, the majority of the net proceeds from the issuances of the Class B Stock and the IHC debt was allocated to
our Financial Services Businesses. We believe that the proceeds from the issuances of the Class B Stock and IHC debt allocated to the Financial Services Businesses reflected capital in excess of that necessary to support the Closed Block Business
and that the Closed Block Business as established has sufficient assets and cash flows to service the IHC debt. The Closed Block Business was financially leveraged through the issuance of the IHC debt, and dividends on the Class B Stock are subject
to prior servicing of the IHC debt.

Within the
Closed Block Business, the assets and cash flows attributable to the Closed Block accrue solely to the benefit of the Closed Block policyholders through policyholder dividends after payment of benefits, expenses and taxes. The Surplus and Related
Assets accrue to the benefit of the holders of Class B Stock. The earnings on, and distribution of, the Surplus and Related Assets over time will be the source or measure of payment of the interest and principal of the IHC debt and of dividends on
the Class B Stock. The earnings of the Closed Block are reported as part of the Closed Block Business, although no cash flows or assets of the Closed Block accrue to the benefit of the holders of Common Stock or Class B Stock. The Closed Block
Assets are not available to service interest or principal of the IHC debt or dividends on the Class B Stock.

Inter-Business Transfers and Allocation Policies

Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors has adopted certain policies relating to payments, loans, capital contributions, transfers
of assets and other transactions between the Closed Block Business and the Financial Services Businesses; and the allocation between the two Businesses of tax costs and benefits. These inter-business transfer and allocation policies are set forth in
Exhibit 4.3 to this Annual Report. In the future, the Board of Directors may modify, rescind or add to any of these policies, subject to the Board of Directors’ general fiduciary duties. In addition, we have agreed with the investors in the
Class B Stock and the insurer of the IHC debt that, in most instances, the Board of Directors may not change these policies without their consent.

Cash payments for administrative purposes from the Closed Block Business to the Financial Services Businesses are based on formulas that
initially approximated the actual expenses incurred by the Financial Services Businesses to provide such services based on insurance and policies in force and statutory cash premiums. Administrative expenses recorded by the Closed Block Business,
and the related income tax effect, are based upon actual expenses incurred under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP, utilizing the Company’s methodology for the allocation of such expenses. Any difference in
the cash amount transferred and actual expenses incurred as reported under U.S. GAAP will be recorded, on an after-tax basis at the applicable current rate, as direct adjustments to the respective equity balances of the Closed Block Business and the
Financial Services Businesses, without the issuance of shares of either Business to the other Business. This direct equity adjustment modifies earnings available to each class of common stock for



earnings per share purposes. Internal investment expenses recorded and paid by the Closed Block Business, and the related income tax effect, are based upon actual expenses incurred under U.S.
GAAP and in accordance with internal arrangements governing recordkeeping, bank fees, accounting and reporting, asset allocation, investment policy and planning and analysis.

Financial Services Businesses

The Financial Services Businesses are comprised of three
divisions, containing six segments, and our Corporate and Other operations. The U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management division is comprised of the Individual Annuities, Retirement and Asset Management segments. The U.S. Individual Life
and Group Insurance division is comprised of the Individual Life and Group Insurance segments. The International Insurance division is comprised of the International Insurance segment.

See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for revenues, income and loss, and total assets by segment
of the Financial Services Businesses.

U.S.
Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division

The U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management division conducts its business through the Individual Annuities, Retirement and Asset Management segments.

Individual Annuities

Our Individual Annuities segment manufactures and
distributes individual variable and fixed annuity products, primarily to the U.S. mass affluent market. In general, we consider households with investable assets or annual income in excess of $100,000 to be mass affluent in the U.S. market. We focus
on innovative product design coupled with our risk management strategies, as discussed below.

Competition

We compete with other providers of retirement savings and accumulation products, including large, well-established insurance and financial services companies, primarily based on our innovative product
features and our risk management strategies. We also compete based on brand recognition, the breadth of our distribution platform and our customer service capabilities.

In recent years, we have experienced a dynamic competitive
landscape, prompted by challenging global financial markets. During 2012, we implemented variable annuity product modifications to scale back benefits, increase pricing and close a share class, and we suspended additional customer deposits for
variable annuities with certain optional living benefit riders that were no longer being offered. Similarly, certain of our competitors who had previously introduced more aggressive product designs and pricing, have now taken actions to implement
modifications which scale back benefits or to exit, or limit their presence in, the variable annuity marketplace. Despite these actions, our contract retention has been strong, and we believe our product offerings are competitive relative to
substitute products currently available in the marketplace.

Products

We offer variable annuities that provide our customers with tax-deferred asset accumulation together with a base death benefit and a suite
of optional guaranteed death and living benefits. The benefit features contractually guarantee the contractholder a return of no less than (1) total deposits made to the contract less any partial withdrawals (“return of net
deposits”), (2) total deposits made to the contract less any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return (“minimum return”), and/or (3) the highest contract value on a specified date minus any withdrawals (“contract
value”). We currently offer guarantees that are payable in the event of death, and withdrawal and income living benefits payable during specified periods. Our current optional living benefits guarantee includes, among other features, the
ability to make withdrawals based on the highest daily contract value plus a minimum return, credited for a period of time. This guaranteed contract value is a notional amount



that forms the basis for determination of periodic withdrawals for the life of the contractholder, and cannot be accessed as a lump-sum surrender value. Our current optional living benefits can
also be purchased with a companion optional death benefit, also based on a highest daily contract value. Certain inforce contracts include guaranteed benefits which are not currently offered, such as annuitization benefits and benefits payable at
specified dates during the accumulation period.

Our variable annuity investment options provide our customers with the opportunity to invest in proprietary and non-proprietary mutual
funds, frequently under asset allocation programs, and fixed-rate accounts. The investments made by customers in the proprietary and non-proprietary mutual funds generally represent separate account interests that provide a return linked to an
underlying investment portfolio. The fixed-rate accounts that are invested in the general account are credited with interest at rates we determine, subject to certain minimums. We also offer fixed annuities that provide a guarantee of principal and
interest credited at rates we determine, subject to certain contractual minimums. Certain investments made in the fixed-rate accounts of our variable annuities and certain fixed annuities impose a market value adjustment if the invested amount is
not held to maturity.

The primary risk exposures
of our variable annuity contracts relate to actual deviations from, or changes to, the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products, including equity market returns, interest rates, market volatility, contractholder
longevity/mortality, timing of annuitization and withdrawals, withdrawal efficiency and contract lapses. The return we realize from our variable annuity contracts will vary based on the extent of the differences between our actual experience and the
assumptions used in the original pricing of these products. Our returns can also vary due to the impact and effectiveness of our hedging program for any capital markets movements that we may hedge, the impact on that portion of our variable annuity
contracts with an automatic rebalancing element, also referred to as an asset transfer feature, the impact of risks we have retained and the impact of risks that are not able to be hedged.

Our risk management strategy helps to limit our exposure to certain of these risks, utilizing a combination of
product design elements and our living benefits hedging program. The product design elements we utilize for certain products include, among others, asset allocation restrictions, minimum issuance age requirements, and an automatic rebalancing
element. The objective of the automatic rebalancing element, included in the design of all currently-sold optional living benefits, is to mitigate our exposure to equity market risk and market volatility by transferring assets between certain
variable investments selected by the annuity contractholder and investments that are expected to be more stable (e.g., a separate account bond portfolio or fixed-rate account). The transfers are based on the static mathematical formula used with the
particular optional benefit which considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the impact of investment performance on the contractholder’s total account value. This occurs at the contractholder level, rather than at the fund
level, which we believe enhances our risk mitigation.

Through our living benefits hedging program, we also manage capital markets risk associated with certain of our optional living benefit guarantees. This program represents a balance among three
objectives: 1) provide severe scenario protection, 2) minimize net income volatility associated with an internally-defined hedge target, and 3) maintain capital efficiency. Through our hedge program, we purchase derivatives that seek to replicate
the net change in our hedge target. In addition to mitigating capital markets risk and income statement volatility, the hedging program is also focused on a long-term goal of accumulating assets that could be used to pay claims under these benefits
irrespective of market path, recognizing that, under the terms of the contracts, we do not expect to begin substantial payment of such claims until many years in the future.

For more information regarding the risks inherent in our
products and the mitigants we have in place to limit our exposure to these risks, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by
Segment—U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division—Individual Annuities.”

Marketing and Distribution

Our annuity products are distributed through a diverse group of independent financial planners, wirehouses, banks, and insurance agents, including Prudential Agents and the agency distribution force of
The Allstate Corporation, or Allstate. Our distribution efforts are supported by a network of 318 internal and external wholesalers as of December 31, 2012.



Underwriting and Pricing

We earn asset management and other fees determined as a
percentage of the average assets of the mutual funds in our variable annuity products, net of subadvisory expenses related to non-proprietary funds. Additionally, we earn mortality and expense fees and other fees for various insurance-related
options and features based on the average daily net asset value of the annuity separate accounts or the amount of guaranteed value under the optional living benefit, as applicable. We also receive administrative service fees from many of the
proprietary and non-proprietary mutual funds.

We
price our variable annuities based on an evaluation of the risks assumed and considering applicable hedging costs. Our pricing is also influenced by competition, and by assumptions regarding contractholder behavior, including persistency, and
benefit utilization and withdrawal timing and efficiency for contracts with living benefit features, as well as other assumptions. Significant deviations in actual experience from our pricing assumptions could have an adverse effect on the
profitability of our products. To encourage persistency, most of our variable and fixed annuities have surrender or withdrawal charges for a specified number of years. In addition, the living benefit features of our variable annuity products
encourage persistency because the potential value of the living benefit is fully realized only if the contract persists.

We price our fixed annuities as well as the fixed-rate accounts of our variable annuities based on many assumptions, including investment
returns, expenses, competition and persistency. We seek to maintain a spread between the return on our general account invested assets and the interest we credit on our fixed annuities and the fixed-rate accounts of our variable annuities. For
assets transferred to a fixed-rate account in the general account pursuant to the automatic rebalancing element, we earn a spread for the difference between the return on our general account invested assets and the interest credited, similar to our
fixed annuities.

Reserves

We establish actuarially-determined reserves for future
policy benefits that we believe will meet our future obligations for our inforce contracts, including any death benefit and living benefit guarantee features associated with these contracts. We base these reserves on assumptions we believe to be
appropriate for investment yield, persistency, expenses, withdrawal timing and efficiency and mortality rates. Certain of the living benefit guarantee features on variable annuity contracts are accounted for as embedded derivatives and are carried
at fair value. The fair values of these benefit features are calculated as the present value of future expected benefit payments to customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature, and are
based on assumptions a market participant would use in pricing these embedded derivative liabilities. For variable and fixed annuity contracts, we establish liabilities for contractholders’ account balances that represent cumulative gross
premium payments plus credited interest and/or fund performance, less withdrawals, and all applicable mortality and expense charges.

Retirement

Our Retirement segment, which we refer to in the marketplace as Prudential Retirement, provides retirement investment and income products
and services to retirement plan sponsors in the public, private, and not-for-profit sectors. Our full service business provides recordkeeping, plan administration, actuarial advisory services, tailored participant education and communication
services, trustee services and institutional and retail investments. We service defined contribution, defined benefit and non-qualified plans. For clients with combinations of defined contribution, defined benefit and non-qualified plans, we offer
integrated recordkeeping services. We also provide certain brokerage services through our broker-dealer, Prudential Investment Management Services LLC, and trust services through our bank, Prudential Bank & Trust, FSB
(“PB&T”). In 2012, PB&T divested its bank deposits in connection with the previously announced decision to limit its operations to trust-only services. Our institutional investment products business offers investment-only stable
value products, pension risk transfer products, guaranteed investment contracts, or GICs, funding agreements, institutional and retail notes, structured settlement annuities and other group annuities, for defined contribution plans, defined benefit
plans, non-qualified plans, and individuals.



Competition

The Retirement segment competes with other large,
well-established insurance companies, asset managers, recordkeepers and diversified financial institutions. In our full service business, we compete primarily based on pricing, the breadth of our service and investment offerings, investment
performance, and our ability to offer product features to meet the retirement income needs of our clients. In recent years, we have seen a trend towards unbundling of the purchase decision related to the recordkeeping and investment offerings, where
the variety and flexibility of available funds and their performance are key selection criteria to plan sponsors and intermediaries. Additionally, changes in the regulatory environment have driven more transparent fee disclosures, which have
heightened pricing pressures. We have also seen slow case turnover in our mid to large case target markets.

In our institutional investment products business, we compete primarily based on our pricing and structuring capabilities, as well as our
ability to offer innovative product solutions. Sales of institutional investment products are affected by competitive factors such as investment performance, company credit and financial strength ratings, product design, marketplace visibility,
distribution capabilities, fees, crediting rates, and customer service. In recent years, we have established ourselves as a leader in the stable value wrap market. Additionally, in 2012, we completed two significant pension risk transfer
transactions, positioning ourselves as innovators in providing pension risk management solutions to plan sponsors. We believe this emerging market offers attractive opportunities that are aligned with our expertise. For certain of our traditional
institutional investment products, economic conditions and other competitive factors have resulted in maturing contracts outpacing new issuances.

Products and Services

Full Service.

Our full service business offers plan sponsors and their participants a broad range of
products and services to assist in the delivery and administration of defined contribution, defined benefit, and non-qualified plans, including recordkeeping and administrative services, comprehensive investment offerings and consulting services to
assist plan sponsors in managing fiduciary obligations. As part of our investment products, we offer a variety of general and separate account stable value products and other fee-based separate accounts, as well as retail mutual funds and
institutional funds advised by affiliated and non-affiliated investment managers. In addition, certain products that are designed for the benefit of participants are marketed and sold on an investment-only basis through our full service distribution
channels.

Our full service general account and
separate account stable value products contain an obligation to pay interest at a specified rate for a specific period of time and to repay account balances or market value upon contract termination. These stable value products are either fully or
partially participating, with annual or semi-annual rate resets giving effect to previous investment experience. We earn administrative fees for providing recordkeeping and other administrative services for these products. In addition, we earn
profits from partially participating products from the spread between the rate of return we earn on the investments and the interest rates we credit, less expenses.

We also offer fee-based products, through which customer
funds are held in a separate account, retail mutual funds, institutional funds, or a client-owned trust. These products generally pass all of the investment results to the customer. In certain cases, these contracts are subject to a minimum interest
rate guarantee backed by the general account. Additionally, we offer guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits associated with certain defined contribution accounts, and hedge certain of the related risks utilizing externally purchased hedging
instruments.

Our full service fee-based advisory
offerings are supported by participant communications and education programs, and a broad range of plan consulting services, including non-discrimination testing, plan document services, signature-ready documents for required filings, and full
actuarial support for defined benefit plans. Additional services include non-qualified deferred compensation plan administration, including executive benefit solutions and financing strategies, investment advisory services, and merger and
acquisition support.

Institutional Investment
Products.

Our institutional investment products business primarily offers products to the stable value and payout annuity markets.



Stable Value Markets.

Our stable value area manufactures
investment-only products for use in retail and institutional capital markets and qualified plan markets. Our primary stable value product offerings are investment-only wraps through which customers’ funds are held in a client-owned trust. These
are participating contracts for which we pass investment results through to the customer, subject to a minimum interest rate guarantee backed by the general account, and earn fees for providing this guarantee. For contracts currently in force, the
minimum interest rate is floored at zero. The fees we earn for providing this guarantee may be reset as defined by the underlying contracts. Contractholders are provided with flexible fund investment alternatives, and assets may be managed by
Prudential Financial’s asset management unit or third party asset managers.

We also offer investment-only general account products in the form of GICs, funding agreements, retail notes and institutional notes. These products contain an obligation to pay interest at a specified
rate and to repay principal at maturity or following contract termination. Because these obligations are backed by our general account, we bear the investment and asset/liability management risk associated with these contracts. Generally, profits
from our general account products result from the spread between the rate of return we earn on the investments and the interest rates we credit, less expenses.

Payout Annuity Markets.

Our payout annuity area offers innovative pension risk transfer products, as well as
traditional general and separate account products designed to provide a predictable source of monthly income, generally for the life of the participant.

Our innovative pension risk transfer products include portfolio-protected products and a longevity reinsurance product. Our
portfolio-protected products are non-participating group annuity contracts which we issue to pension plan sponsors and assume all of the investment and actuarial risk associated with a group of specified participants within a plan. These products
have economic features similar to our traditional general account annuity contracts, discussed below, but may also offer the added protection of an insulated separate account. Our longevity reinsurance product is a reinsurance contract from which we
earn a fee for assuming the longevity risk of pension plans that have been insured by third-parties.

During 2012, we completed two significant non-participating group annuity pension risk transfer transactions. Premiums associated with
these transactions represented approximately 38% of Prudential Financial’s total consolidated revenue for 2012. These premiums were largely offset by a corresponding increase in policyholders’ benefits, including the change in policy
reserves.

Our traditional general and separate
account products include structured settlements, voluntary income products and other group annuities, which fulfill the payment guarantee needs of the personal injury lawsuit settlement market, the distribution needs of defined contribution
participants and the payment obligations of defined benefit plans, respectively. For our general account products, we bear all of the investment, mortality, retirement, asset/liability management, and expense risk associated with these contracts.
Our profits result from the emerging experience related to investment returns, timing of mortality, timing of retirement, and the level of expenses being more or less favorable than assumed in the original pricing. Our separate account products
include both participating and non-participating contracts. Our participating contracts are fee-based products that cover payments to retirees to be made by defined benefit plans. These contracts permit a plan sponsor to retain the risks and rewards
of investment and actuarial results while receiving a general account guarantee for all annuity payments covered by the contract. Our non-participating contracts provide pension benefit guarantees to defined benefit plan participants. Under U.S.
GAAP, these contracts are treated as general account products, and have economic features similar to our general account annuity contracts, but offer the added protection of an insulated separate account.

Marketing and Distribution

We distribute our products through a variety of channels. In
our full service business, our dedicated sales and support teams manage our distribution efforts in offices across the country. We sell our products and services through third-party financial advisors, brokers, and benefits consultants and, to a
lesser extent, directly to plan sponsors.

In our
stable value area within our institutional investment products business, we utilize our direct sales force and intermediaries to distribute investment-only stable value wraps and traditional GICs to plan sponsors



and stable value fund managers, and to distribute funding agreements and retail and institutional notes to investors. We also manage a global Funding Agreement Notes Issuance Program, or FANIP,
pursuant to which a statutory trust issues medium-term notes secured by funding agreements issued to the trust by Prudential Insurance. Prudential Insurance may also issue funding agreements directly to the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York
(“FHLBNY”).

In our payout annuity area
within our institutional investment products business, our pension risk transfer products are distributed through actuarial and third-party brokers. Structured settlements are distributed through structured settlement specialists. Voluntary income
products are distributed through the defined contribution portion of our full service business, directly to plan sponsors, or as part of annuity shopping services. Other traditional group annuities and participating separate account annuity products
are typically distributed through actuarial consultants and third-party brokers.

Underwriting and Pricing

We set our rates for our stable value products within our full service and institutional investment products businesses using pricing models that consider the investment environment and our risk, expense
and profitability assumptions. In addition, for products within our payout annuity area, our models also use assumptions for mortality and early retirement risks. These assumptions may be less predictable in emerging markets, and significant
deviations in actual experience from pricing assumptions could affect the profitability of these products. For our investment-only stable value wrap product, our pricing risk is mitigated by the fact that the fees we earn for providing a guaranteed
rate of return may be reset, as defined by the underlying contracts. Additionally, the contracts allow participants to withdraw funds at book value, while contractholder withdrawals occur at market value immediately or at book value over time.

Reserves

We establish actuarially-determined reserves for future
policy benefits that we believe will meet our future obligations for our in force annuity products. We base these reserves on assumptions we believe to be appropriate for investment yield, expenses, mortality rates, retirement age and other
behavioral assumptions, as well as margins for adverse deviation as appropriate. For accumulation products, we establish liabilities for policyholders’ account balances and additional reserves for investment experience that will accrue to the
customer but have not yet been reflected in credited rates.

Asset Management

The Asset Management segment provides a broad array of investment management and advisory services by means of institutional portfolio
management, mutual funds, asset securitization activity and other structured products. These products and services are provided to the public and private marketplace, as well as other segments of our Financial Services Businesses and the Closed
Block Business. We also invest in asset management and investment distribution businesses in targeted countries, including through investments in operating joint ventures, to expand our mass affluent customer base outside the U.S. and to increase
our global assets under management.

We earn asset
management fees which are typically based upon a percentage of assets under management. In certain asset management arrangements, we also receive performance-based incentive fees when the return on the managed assets exceeds certain benchmark
returns or other performance targets. Transaction fees are earned as a percentage of the transaction price associated with the sale or purchase of assets in certain funds, primarily related to real estate. In addition, we earn investment results
from strategic investing and revenues from commercial mortgage origination and servicing.

Competition

The Asset Management segment competes with numerous asset managers and other financial institutions. For our asset management products, we compete based on a number of factors, including investment
performance, strategy and process, talent, organizational stability and client relationships. We offer products



across multiple asset classes, with specialized investment teams that employ approaches designed to add value in each product area or asset class. Our organizational stability and robust
institutional and retail businesses have helped attract and retain talent critical to delivering investment results for clients. Our private placement and commercial mortgage businesses compete based on price, terms, execution and the strength of
our relationship with the borrower. Competition will vary depending on the product or service being offered.

Products and Services

We offer asset management services for public and private fixed income, public equity and real estate, as well as commercial mortgage origination and servicing, and mutual funds and other retail services
through the following eight businesses:

Prudential Fixed Income.

Prudential Fixed Income manages fixed income portfolios for U.S. and international,
institutional and retail clients, as well as for our general account. Our products include traditional broad market fixed income and single-sector strategies. We manage traditional as well as customized asset-liability strategies. We also manage
hedge strategies and collateralized loan obligations and also serve as a non-custodial securities lending agent.

Portfolios are managed by seasoned portfolio managers across six sector specialist teams: Corporate, Leveraged Finance, Emerging
Markets, Global Rates and Securitized Products, Municipals and Money Markets. A separate team is dedicated to securities lending activities. All strategies are managed using a research-based approach, supported by significant credit research,
quantitative research, and risk management organizations.

Jennison Associates.

Jennison Associates LLC, a wholly-owned registered investment adviser, provides discretionary and non-discretionary asset management services by managing
a range of publicly-traded equity, balanced and fixed income portfolios that span market capitalizations, investment styles and geographies. Jennison Associates uses fundamental, team-based research to manage portfolios for institutional, private
and subadvisory clients, including mutual funds.

Quantitative Management Associates.

Quantitative Management Associates LLC, a wholly-owned registered
investment adviser, provides discretionary and non-discretionary asset management services to a wide range of clients by managing a broad array of publicly-traded equity asset classes using various investment styles. Quantitative Management
Associates manages equity and asset allocation portfolios for institutional and subadvisory clients, including mutual funds, using proprietary quantitative processes tailored to meet client objectives.

Prudential Capital
Group.

Prudential Capital Group provides asset management services by investing in private placement investment grade and below investment grade debt and mezzanine debt securities, with a majority of the private placement
investments being originated by our staff. These investment capabilities are utilized by our general account and institutional clients through direct advisory accounts, insurance company separate accounts, and private fund structures.

Prudential Mortgage Capital
Company

.    Prudential Mortgage Capital Company provides commercial mortgage origination, asset management and servicing for our general account, institutional clients, and government-sponsored entities such as Fannie Mae,
the Federal Housing Administration, and Freddie Mac, and beginning in 2011, as a minority interest joint venture partner and service provider to originate commercial mortgages for future securitization. Through the third quarter of 2008, we had
originated shorter-term interim loans for spread lending that are collateralized by assets generally under renovation or lease up. Our interim loans are generally paid off through refinancing or the sale by the borrower of the underlying collateral.

Prudential Real Estate
Investors

.    Prudential Real Estate Investors provides asset management services for single-client and commingled private and public real estate portfolios and manufactures and manages a variety of real estate investment
vehicles investing in private and public real estate, primarily for institutional clients through 22 offices worldwide. Our domestic and international real estate investment vehicles range from fully



diversified open-end funds to specialized closed-end funds that invest in specific types of properties or designated geographic regions or follow other specific investment strategies. Our global
real estate organization has an established presence in the U.S., Europe, Asia and Latin America.

Prudential Investments

.    We manufacture, distribute and service investment management products primarily utilizing proprietary asset management expertise in the U.S. retail
market. Our products are designed to be sold primarily by financial professionals including both Prudential Agents and third party advisors. We offer a family of retail investment products consisting of 57 mutual funds as of December 31, 2012.
These products cover a wide array of investment styles and objectives designed to attract and retain assets of individuals with varying objectives and to accommodate investors’ changing financial needs. Additionally, we offer banks and other
financial services organizations a wealth management platform, which permits such banks and organizations to provide their retail clients with services including asset allocation, investment manager research and access, clearing, trading services,
and performance reporting.

Prudential
International Investments

.    Prudential International Investments manufactures proprietary products and distributes both proprietary and non-proprietary products, tailored to meet client needs. Our international investment
operations primarily consist of our asset management operations in Japan, India and Taiwan, and our operating joint ventures in Italy and Brazil which are accounted for under the equity method. These results were formerly included in our
International Insurance segment.

In addition, we
make strategic investments to support the creation and management of funds offered to third-party investors in private and public real estate, fixed income and public equities asset classes. Certain of these investments are made primarily for
purposes of co-investment in our managed funds and structured products. Other strategic investments are made with the intention to sell or syndicate to investors, including our general account, or for placement in funds and structured products that
we offer and manage (seed investments). We also make loans to, and guarantee obligations of, our managed funds that are secured by equity commitments from investors or assets of the funds.

Marketing and Distribution

We provide investment management services for our
institutional customers through a proprietary sales force organized by each asset management business. Each business has an independent marketing and client service team working with clients. Institutional asset management services are also offered
through the Retirement segment of our Financial Services Businesses.

Most of the retail customer assets under management are invested in our mutual funds and our variable annuities and variable life insurance products. These assets are gathered by other segments of our
Financial Services Businesses and third party networks. Additionally, we work with third party product manufacturers and distributors to include our investment options in their products and platforms.

We also provide investment management services across a broad
array of asset classes for our general account, as described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—General Account Investments.”

U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance Division

The U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance
division conducts its business through the Individual Life and Group Insurance segments.

Individual Life

Our Individual Life segment manufactures and distributes individual variable life, term life and universal life insurance products primarily to the U.S. mass middle, mass affluent and affluent markets. In
general, we consider households with investable assets or annual income in excess of $100,000 to be mass affluent and households with investable assets in excess of $250,000 to be affluent in the U.S. market. Our life products are distributed
through independent third party distributors and Prudential Agents.



On January 2, 2013, we acquired The Hartford’s individual life insurance business
through a reinsurance transaction. Under the agreement, we paid The Hartford cash consideration of $615 million, primarily in the form of a ceding commission to provide reinsurance for approximately 700,000 life insurance policies with a net
retained face amount in force of approximately $135 billion. This acquisition increases our scale in the U.S. individual life insurance market, particularly universal life products, and provides complementary distribution opportunities through
expanded wirehouse and bank distribution channels.

Competition

The Individual Life segment competes with large, well-established life insurance companies in a mature market. We compete primarily based
on price, service, distribution channel relationships, brand recognition and financial strength. Due to the large number of competitors, pricing is competitive. Factors that could influence our ability to competitively price products while achieving
targeted returns include: the cost and availability of financing for statutory reserves required for certain term and universal life insurance policies, the availability, utilization and timing of tax deductions associated with statutory reserves,
product designs which impact the amount of statutory reserves and the associated tax deductions, and the level and volatility of interest rates. The current environment of low interest rates and volatile equity markets has resulted in a greater
demand for dividend-paying whole life products across the industry which we no longer offer.

Products

Our primary insurance products are variable life, term life and universal life and represent 40%, 49% and 10%, respectively, of our face amount of individual life insurance in force, net of reinsurance at
the end of 2012. Changing marketplace demand has shifted our sales mix towards primarily term life and universal life products.

Variable Life Insurance.

We offer several individual variable life insurance products that provide a return
linked to an underlying investment portfolio selected by the policyholder while providing the policyholder with the flexibility to change both the death benefit and premium payments. The policyholder generally has the option of investing premiums in
a fixed-rate option that is part of our general account or investing in separate account investment options consisting of equity and fixed income funds. Funds invested in the fixed-rate option will accrue interest at rates we determine that vary
periodically based on our portfolio rate, subject to certain contractual minimums. In the separate accounts, the policyholder bears the fund performance risk. We also offer a variable life product that allows for a more flexible guarantee against
lapse where policyholders can select the guarantee period. While variable life insurance continues to be an important product, marketplace demand continues to favor term and universal life insurance. However, a significant portion of Individual
Life’s profits is associated with our large in force block of variable policies. Profit patterns on these policies are not level and as the policies age, insureds generally begin paying reduced policy charges. This reduction in policy charges,
coupled with net policy count and insurance in force runoff over time, reduces our expected future profits from this product line.

Term Life Insurance.

We offer a variety of term life insurance products that provide coverage for a
specified time period. Most term products include a conversion feature that allows the policyholder to convert the policy into permanent life insurance coverage. We also offer term life insurance that provides for a return of premium if the insured
is alive at the end of the level premium period. There continues to be significant demand for term life insurance protection.

Universal Life Insurance.

We offer universal life insurance products that feature flexible premiums, a
choice of guarantees against lapse, and a fixed crediting rate that we determine and that may vary periodically based on portfolio returns, subject to certain contractual minimums. In addition, we offer a universal life insurance product that allows
the policyholder to allocate a portion of their account balance into an index account that provides a return consistent with the S&P 500 index performance over the following year, subject to certain contractual minimums and maximums. Individual
Life’s profits from universal life insurance are impacted by mortality and expense margins and net interest spread.



Marketing and Distribution

Third Party Distribution.

Our individual life products are offered through a
variety of third party channels, including independent brokers, general agencies and producer groups. We focus on sales through independent intermediaries who provide life insurance solutions to protect individuals, families and businesses and
support estate and wealth transfer planning.

Prudential Agents.

Our Prudential Agents distribute Prudential variable, term and universal life insurance,
variable and fixed annuities and investment products with proprietary and non-proprietary investment options as well as selected insurance and investment products manufactured by others primarily to customers in the U.S. mass and mass affluent
markets, as well as small business owners. Prudential Agents also have access to non-proprietary property and casualty products under distribution agreements entered into with the purchasers of our property and casualty insurance operations, which
we sold in 2003, and other third party providers. While these agreements provide an opportunity for additional compensation to the Individual Life segment based on multi-year profitability of the products sold, we do not expect the profit from these
arrangements to be significant in the future. The number of Prudential Agents was 2,615, 2,529 and 2,471 at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

As mentioned above, the Individual Life segment distributes products offered by the Annuities and Asset Management segments and is paid a
market rate by these businesses to distribute their products. These payments may be more or less than the associated distribution costs, and any profit or loss is included in the results of the Individual Life segment.

Underwriting and Pricing

Underwriters generally follow detailed policies and
procedures to assess and quantify the risk of our individual life insurance products based on the age, gender, health and occupation of the applicant and amount of insurance requested. We base premiums and policy charges for individual life
insurance on expected death benefits, surrender benefits, expenses and required reserves. We use assumptions for mortality, interest rates, expenses, policy persistency, premium payment patterns and separate account fund performance as well as the
level, cost and availability of financing certain statutory reserves in pricing policies. Deviations in actual experience from our pricing assumptions may adversely or positively impact the profitability of our products.

Reserves

We establish actuarially-determined reserves for future
policy benefits that we believe will meet our future obligations for in force life policies. We base these reserves on assumptions we believe to be appropriate for investment yield, persistency, expenses, mortality and morbidity rates, the cost of
financing certain statutory reserves, as well as margins for adverse deviation. Reserves also include claims reported but not yet paid, and claims incurred but not yet reported. For variable and interest-sensitive life insurance contracts, we
establish liabilities for policyholders’ account balances that represent cumulative gross premium payments plus credited interest or fund performance, less withdrawals, expenses and cost of insurance charges.

Reinsurance

The Individual Life segment uses reinsurance as a means of
managing mortality volatility and risk capacity, which can impact product profitability. On policies sold since 2000, we have reinsured a significant portion of the mortality risk assumed. As of the end of 2012, the maximum exposure we retained for
new business was $30 million on single life policies and $35 million on second-to-die policies. However, in 2013, we prospectively reduced this maximum exposure limit to $20 million on both single life and second-to-die policies. Over time we have
accumulated policies with higher retained exposure which may result in earnings volatility. In addition, certain transactions, such as assumed reinsurance or acquisitions of inforce contracts, may cause us to temporarily or permanently exceed these
limits on an aggregate basis. If a third party reinsurer is, for some reason, unable to meet its obligations, we remain liable. On a Company wide basis, we evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and monitor the concentration of counterparty
risk to mitigate this exposure.



Group Insurance

Our Group Insurance segment manufactures and distributes a
full range of group life, long-term and short-term group disability, and group corporate-, bank- and trust-owned life insurance in the U.S. primarily to institutional clients for use in connection with employee and membership benefits plans. We also
sell accidental death and dismemberment and other ancillary coverage, and provide plan administrative services in connection with our insurance coverages.

Competition

We compete with other large, well-established life and health insurance providers in the U.S. markets, and are a top provider of both
group life and disability insurance. Due to the maturity of the markets in which we compete, competition is primarily based on price, strong brand recognition, service capabilities, customer relationships, financial stability and range of product
offerings. Because of the large number of competitors, pricing is competitive. The majority of our premiums are derived from large corporations, affinity groups or other organizations with over 10,000 insured individuals. We have a strong portfolio
of products and the capability to offer customized benefit solutions, providing opportunities for continuing stabilized premiums and growth. Employee-paid coverage has become increasingly important as employers attempt to control costs and shift
benefit decisions/funding to employees who continue to value benefits offered at the workplace. Our profitability is dependent in part on penetration in the voluntary coverage marketplace, which will be affected by future employment and compensation
rates.

Products

Group Life Insurance.

Our
portfolio of group life insurance products consists of employer-paid (basic) and employee-paid (voluntary) coverages, including basic and supplemental term life insurance for employees, optional term life insurance for employees’ dependents and
group universal life insurance. We also offer group variable universal life insurance, basic and voluntary accidental death and dismemberment insurance and business travel accident insurance. Many of our employee-paid coverages allow employees to
retain their coverage when they change employers or retire.

Group Disability Insurance.

We offer short- and long-term group disability insurance, which protects against loss of wages due to illness or injury, as well as short- and
long-term disability management, and absence management services. Disability benefits are limited to a portion, generally 50% to 70%, of the insured’s earned income up to a specified maximum benefit. Short-term disability generally provides a
weekly benefit for three to six months, while long-term disability benefits are paid monthly, following a waiting period (usually 90 or 180 days, during which short-term disability may be provided) and generally continue until the insured reaches
normal retirement age.

Group Corporate-, Bank-
and Trust-owned Life Insurance.

Our group corporate-, bank- and trust-owned life insurance products are group variable life insurance contracts utilizing separate accounts, and are typically used by large corporations to
fund deferred compensation plans and benefit plans for retired employees.

Marketing and Distribution

Group Insurance has its own dedicated sales force that is organized around products and market segments and distributes primarily through employee benefits brokers and consultants.

Underwriting and Pricing

We follow standard underwriting practices and procedures,
and have developed standard rating systems for each product line based on Company or industry experience. We assess the risk profile of prospective insured groups; however, certain voluntary products or coverages may require underwriting on an
individual basis. We are not obligated to accept any policy applications, and may require a prospective insured to submit evidence of insurability.



We base pricing of group insurance products on the expected pay-out of benefits and other
costs that we calculate using assumptions for mortality, morbidity, interest, expenses and persistency, depending upon the specific product features. For certain policies, we determine premiums on a retrospective experience-rated basis, in which
case the group contractholder bears some of the risk, or receives some of the benefit, associated with claim experience fluctuations. For policies that are not eligible to receive experience-based refunds, our profitability is more subject to
fluctuations. In addition, we provide multiple year rate guarantees on many of our group contracts, which can also contribute to fluctuations in profitability.

Reserves

We establish actuarially-determined reserves for future policy benefits that we believe will meet our future obligations. We base these
reserves on actuarially-recognized methods using morbidity and mortality tables in general use in the U.S., which we modify to reflect our actual experience when appropriate. Reserves also include claims reported but not yet paid, and claims
incurred but not yet reported. We also establish a liability for policyholders’ account balances that represent cumulative deposits plus credited interest and/or fund performance, less withdrawals, expenses and cost of insurance charges, as
applicable.

Reinsurance

We use reinsurance to limit losses from large exposures, and
in response to client requests. If a third party reinsurer is, for some reason, unable to meet its obligations, we remain liable. On a Company wide basis, we evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and monitor concentration of counterparty
risk to mitigate this exposure.

International
Insurance Division

The International
Insurance division conducts its business through the International Insurance segment.

International Insurance

Our International Insurance segment manufactures and distributes individual life insurance, retirement and related products, including certain health products with fixed benefits. We provide these
products to the broad middle income market across Japan through multiple distribution channels including banks, independent agencies and Life Consultants, who are associated with our Gibraltar Life operations. We also provide similar products to the
mass affluent and affluent markets in Japan, Korea and other countries outside the U.S. through our Life Planner operations. We commenced sales in non-U.S. markets through our Life Planner operations, as follows: Japan, 1988; Taiwan, 1990; Italy,
1990; Korea, 1991; Brazil, 1998; Argentina, 1999; Poland, 2000; and Mexico, 2006. We continue to seek opportunities for expansion into high-growth markets in targeted countries.

For the year ended December 31, 2012, our Life Planner
operation in Japan and our Gibraltar Life operations represented 23% and 71%, respectively, of the net premiums, policy charges and fee income of the International Insurance segment, and in aggregate, represented 35% of the net premiums, policy
charges and fee income of the Financial Services Businesses, translated on the basis of weighted average monthly exchange rates.

In addition to the operations discussed above, we have a 26% interest in a joint venture in India, the maximum currently allowed by
regulation in India. We also had an investment in China through a consortium of investors that held a minority interest in China Pacific Insurance (Group) Co, Ltd. Through December 31, 2012, this consortium sold approximately 85% of its
holdings in China Pacific Group and sold its remaining interest in 2013.

We manage each operation on a stand-alone basis with local management and sales teams, with oversight by senior executives based in Asia, Latin America and Newark, New Jersey. Each operation has its own
marketing, underwriting, claims, investment management, and actuarial functions. In addition, significant portions of the general account investment portfolios are managed by certain of our international investment subsidiaries and, to



a lesser extent, by our domestic asset management subsidiaries. Operations generally invest in local currency securities, primarily bonds issued by the local government or its agencies. In our
larger operations, we have more diversified portfolios that also include U.S. dollar-denominated investments in large part to support products issued in U.S. dollars and as part of our foreign exchange hedging strategy. In addition, our Gibraltar
Life operations have Australian dollar-denominated investments that support products issued in that currency.

Acquisition of the Star and Edison Businesses

On February 1, 2011, Prudential Financial completed the
acquisition from American International Group, Inc., or AIG, of the “Star and Edison Businesses” pursuant to the stock purchase agreement dated September 30, 2010 between Prudential Financial and AIG. The Star and Edison companies
were merged into Gibraltar Life on January 1, 2012. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Competition

The life insurance markets in Japan and Korea are mature and pricing is competitive. Rather than competing based on price, we generally
compete on the basis of customer service, including our needs-based approach to selling, the quality and diversity of our distribution capabilities, and our financial strength. The aging population throughout Asia creates an increasing need for
product innovation, introducing insurance products which allow for savings and income as the population transitions to retirement. The ability to sell through multiple and complementary distribution channels is a competitive advantage. However,
competition for sales personnel, as well as access to third party distribution channels, is intense.

Products

Our international insurance operations have a diversified product mix, primarily denominated in local currencies and emphasizing death protection while supporting the growing demand for retirement and
savings products. We offer various traditional whole life, term, endowment (which provide for payment on the earlier of death or maturity) and retirement income life insurance products that combine an insurance protection element similar to that of
term life policies with a retirement income feature, including our single premium reduced death benefit whole life product. This product is sold on a simplified underwriting basis and pays a lower death benefit in the first five policy years. This
product has a higher savings component than a recurring premium whole life insurance product and may be more vulnerable to lapses if interest rates increase. Premiums associated with this product represented approximately 10% of the Company’s
total consolidated revenue for 2012.

In most of
our operations, we also offer certain health products with fixed benefits, some of which include a high savings element, as well as annuity products, which are primarily represented by U.S. and Australian dollar-denominated fixed annuities in our
Gibraltar Life operations. Sales and surrenders of non-yen products are sensitive to foreign currency relationships which are impacted by, among other things, the comparative interest rates in the respective countries. Our annuity products impose a
market value adjustment if the invested amount is not held to maturity.

Marketing and Distribution

Our International Insurance segment distributes its products through multiple distribution channels. This includes two captive agent models, Life Planners and Life Consultants, as well as bank and
independent agency third party distribution channels. For additional information on headcount for our captive agents, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations for
Financial Services Businesses by Segment—International Insurance Division.”

Life Planners.

Our Life Planner model differentiates us from competitors in the countries where we do business by focusing on selling protection-oriented life insurance
products on a needs basis to mass affluent and affluent customers, as well as retirement-oriented products to small businesses. We believe that our recruiting and selection process, training programs and compensation package are key to the Life
Planner model and have helped our Life Planner operations achieve higher rates of agent retention, agent productivity and policy persistency than our local competitors. The attributes considered when recruiting new Life Planners include but



are not limited to: University/College degree, no prior life insurance sales experience, a minimum of two years of sales or sales management experience, and a pattern of job stability and
success. The number of Life Planners as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 were 7,058 and 6,792, respectively.

Life Consultants.

Our Life Consultants are the proprietary distribution force for products offered by our
Gibraltar Life operations. Their focus is to provide individual protection products to the broad middle income market in Japan, particularly through relationships with affinity groups. Our Life Consultant operation is based on a variable
compensation plan designed to improve productivity and persistency that is similar to compensation plans in our Life Planner operations. The number of Life Consultants as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 were 11,333 and 12,791, respectively.

Bank Distribution
Channel.

Our Gibraltar Life operation has been selling its products through banks since 2006. Bank distribution channel sales primarily consist of products intended to provide savings features and premature death
protection, such as our yen-denominated single premium reduced death benefit whole life product, and retirement income as well as fixed annuity products primarily denominated in U.S. and Australian dollars. Recent sales in this channel have been
highly concentrated in single pay or limited pay contracts, including our single premium reduced death benefit whole life product discussed above, which tend to be larger policies and therefore have higher average premiums per policy.

Historically, a significant portion of our sales in Japan
through our bank channel distribution were derived through a single Japanese mega-bank. More recently, however, certain of our other bank channel relationships are making an increasing contribution to sales growth and we have expanded our number of
partnerships. We now have relationships with Japan’s four largest banks and we continue to explore opportunities to expand our distribution capabilities through this channel.

Independent Agency Distribution
Channel.

Our independent agency channel sells protection products and high cash value products for retirement benefits through the business market and sells a variety of other products including protection, medical and
fixed annuity products through the individual market. Our focus is to maintain a diverse mix of independent agency relationships including accounting firms, corporate agencies and independent agencies with a balanced focus on individual and business
markets. We differentiate ourselves by providing quality service to producers in this distribution channel.

Underwriting and Pricing

Our International Insurance segment is subject to substantial local regulation that is generally more restrictive for product offerings, pricing and structure than U.S. insurance regulation. Each
International Insurance operation has its own underwriting department that employs variations of U.S. practices in underwriting individual policy risks. In setting underwriting limits, we also consider local industry standards to prevent adverse
selection and to stay abreast of industry trends. In addition, we set underwriting limits together with each operation’s reinsurers.

Pricing of similar products is generally consistent in each of our countries. The profitability of our products is impacted by differences
between actual mortality and morbidity experience and the assumptions used in pricing these policies and as a result, can fluctuate from period to period. However, we anticipate over the long-term to achieve the aggregate mortality and morbidity
levels reflected in the assumptions used in pricing.

Reserves

We establish actuarially-determined reserves for future policy benefits that we believe will meet our future obligations. We base these
reserves on assumptions we believe to be appropriate for investment yield, persistency, expenses, mortality and morbidity rates, as well as margins for adverse deviation. For variable and interest-sensitive life products, as well as annuity
products, we establish liabilities for policyholders’ account balances that represent cumulative gross premiums collected plus interest or investment results credited less surrenders, and charges for cost of insurance and administration fees.



Reinsurance

International Insurance reinsures portions of its insurance
risks, primarily mortality, with both selected third party reinsurers and Prudential Insurance. For example, International Insurance buys catastrophe reinsurance that covers multiple deaths from a single occurrence in some of our insurance
operations and has a coinsurance agreement with Prudential Insurance for the U.S. dollar-denominated business in our Japanese Life Planner insurance operations. If a third party reinsurer is, for some reason, unable to meet its obligations, we
remain liable. On a Company-wide basis, we evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and monitor the concentration of credit risk to mitigate this exposure.

Corporate and Other

Corporate and Other includes corporate operations, after
allocations to our business segments, and divested businesses except for those that qualify for “discontinued operations” accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP.

Corporate Operations

Corporate operations consist primarily of:
(1) investment returns on capital that is not deployed in any business segments; (2) returns from investments not allocated to business segments, including debt-financed investment portfolios, as well as tax credit investments and other
tax enhanced investments financed by business segments; (3) capital debt that is used or will be used to meet the capital requirements of the Company and the related interest expense; (4) income and expense from qualified pension and other
employee benefit plans, after allocations to business segments; (5) corporate-level income and expense, after allocations to business segments, including corporate governance, corporate advertising, philanthropic activities, deferred
compensation, and costs related to certain contingencies; (6) certain retained obligations relating to pre-demutualization policyholders whom we had previously agreed to provide insurance for reduced or no premium in accordance with contractual
settlements related to prior individual life insurance sales practices remediation; (7) results related to a life insurance joint venture and an asset management joint venture in China; (8) results related to our Capital Protection
Framework; and (9) the impact of transactions with and between other segments.

Corporate operations include results related to our Capital Protection Framework, which includes, among other initiatives, the following:

•

Our capital hedge program which broadly addresses the equity market exposure of the statutory capital of the Company as a whole, under stress
scenarios, as described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital—Capital Protection Framework.”

•

The capital consequences of our decision to manage the interest rate risk associated with various operations of the Financial Services Businesses by
holding capital against a portion of the interest rate exposure rather than fully hedging the risk.

•

The capital consequences associated with certain risks associated with our variable annuity products through our living benefit hedging program, which
is described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division—Individual Annuities.” We maintain access to on-balance
sheet capital and contingent sources of capital that are available to meet capital needs that may arise related to this hedging program.

We assess the composition of these hedging programs on an ongoing basis, and we may change them from time to time based on our evaluation
of the Company’s risk position or other factors.

Divested
Businesses

Divested Businesses reflect the
results of the following businesses that have been or will be sold or exited, including businesses that have been placed in wind down, that did not qualify for “discontinued operations”



accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP. We exclude these results from our adjusted operating income. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Consolidated Results of Operations—Segment Measures” for an explanation of adjusted operating income.

Long-Term Care.

In July 2012, we announced our decision to cease sales of group long-term care insurance
reflecting the challenging economics of the long-term care market including the continued low interest rate environment as well as our desire to focus our resources on our core group life and disability businesses. We discontinued sales of group
long-term care products effective August 1, 2012, or a later date as may be required by specific state law. We notified our clients of our intent to continue to accept enrollments on existing group long-term care contracts through June 30,
2013 or later as required by contractual provisions. In March 2012, we discontinued sales of our individual long-term care products.

We establish actuarially-determined reserves for future policy benefits that we believe will meet our future obligations. We base these
reserves on actuarially-recognized methods using morbidity and mortality tables in general use in the U.S., which we modify to reflect our actual experience when appropriate. Reserves also include claims reported but not yet paid and claims incurred
but not yet reported. We also include interest rate assumptions which are based on actual and expected net investment returns. Our assumptions for reserves for future policy benefits related to these products have factored in our best estimate of
the timing and amount of anticipated and yet-to-be-filed premium increases which will require state approval. Our actual experience obtaining pricing increases could be materially different than what we have assumed, resulting in further policy
liability increases which could be material.

Residential Real Estate Brokerage Franchise and Relocation Services.

In 2011, we sold our real estate
brokerage franchise and relocation services businesses to Brookfield Asset Management, Inc. (“Brookfield”), but retained ownership of a financing subsidiary with debt and equity investments in a limited number of real estate brokerage
franchises. Also, we agreed to provide certain Brookfield affiliates with transitional financing for the transferred relocation services through three credit facilities, which were fully repaid and terminated in 2012.

Financial Advisory.

In 2008, we
announced our intention to exit our financial advisory business, which consisted of our investment in a retail securities brokerage and clearing operations joint venture which was sold on December 31, 2009. Certain expenses relating to the
businesses we originally contributed to the joint venture were retained, primarily for litigation and regulatory matters.

Property and Casualty Insurance.

In 2003, we sold our property and casualty insurance companies to Liberty
Mutual Group, or Liberty Mutual. We have reinsured Liberty Mutual for adverse loss development for specific property and casualty risks that Liberty Mutual did not want to retain. We believe that we have adequately reserved for our remaining
property and casualty obligations under these reinsurance contracts based on the current information available.

Individual Health and Disability Insurance.

We ceased writing individual disability income policies in 1992,
and a year later ceased writing hospital expense and major medical policies. Most of our individual disability income policies are non-cancelable; however, we reinsured all of these policies as of July 1999. For our hospital expense and major
medical policies, the 1997 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act guarantees renewal. Under certain circumstances, with appropriate approvals from state regulatory authorities, we are permitted to change the premiums charged for these
policies if we can demonstrate the premiums have not been sufficient to pay claims. We establish actuarially-determined reserves for future policy benefits that we believe will meet our future obligations.

Other.

In addition to the
businesses described above, the results of Divested Businesses also include the following:

•

In 2000, we announced a restructuring of Prudential Securities’ activities and subsequently exited the lead-managed equity underwriting business
for corporate issuers and the institutional fixed income business.

•

We have not actively engaged in the assumed life reinsurance market in the United States since the early 1990s; however, we remain subject to mortality
risk for certain assumed individual life insurance policies



under the terms of the reinsurance treaties. In 2000, we sold our interest in Prudential of America Life Insurance Company, or PALIC, but remain subject to mortality risk for certain assumed
individual life insurance policies sold by PALIC under the terms of the reinsurance treaties. We establish actuarially-determined reserves for future policy benefits consistent with our methodologies for yearly renewable term life policies, which
are less than the net amount at risk. As of December 31, 2012, the net amount at risk was $17 million.

•

In addition to the above, we indemnified the purchaser of PALIC for certain liabilities with respect to claims related to sales practices or market
conduct issues arising from operations prior to the sale.

Discontinued Operations

Discontinued operations reflect the results of the following businesses which qualified for “discontinued operations” accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP:

•

We discontinued our Mexican asset management operations in the second quarter of 2009 and subsequently sold these operations in the fourth quarter of
2009;

•

We discontinued our Korean asset management operations in the first quarter of 2010 and subsequently sold these operations in the second quarter of
2010;

•

We discontinued our global commodities operations in the second quarter of 2011 and subsequently sold these operations in the third quarter of 2011;
and

•

Direct real estate investments that are sold or held for sale may require “discontinued operations” accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP.

Closed Block Business

In connection with the demutualization in
2001, we ceased offering domestic participating individual life insurance and annuity products, under which policyholders are eligible to receive policyholder dividends reflecting experience. The liabilities for our individual in force participating
products were segregated, together with assets used exclusively for the payment of benefits and policyholder dividends, expenses and taxes with respect to these products, in the Closed Block. We selected the amount of Closed Block Assets that were
expected to generate sufficient cash flow, together with anticipated revenues from the Closed Block Policies, over the life of the Closed Block to fund payments of all expenses, taxes, and policyholder benefits and to provide for the continuation of
the policyholder dividend scales in effect in 2000, assuming experience underlying such scales continued. For accounting purposes, we also segregated the Surplus and Related Assets that we needed to hold outside the Closed Block to meet capital
requirements related to the policies included within the Closed Block at the time of demutualization. No policies sold after demutualization will be added to the Closed Block, and its in force business is expected to decline as we pay policyholder
benefits in full. We also expect the proportion of our business represented by the Closed Block to decline as we grow other businesses. The Closed Block forms the principal component of the Closed Block Business. As of December 31, 2012, total
attributed equity of the Closed Block Business represented 4% of the Company’s total attributed equity. For additional discussion of the Closed Block Business, see “—Demutualization and Separation of the Businesses—Separation of
the Businesses.”

As discussed in Note 12 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements, if the performance of the Closed Block is more or less favorable than we originally assumed in funding, total dividends paid to Closed Block policyholders in the future may be greater or less than the total
dividends that would have been paid to these policyholders if the policyholder dividend scales in effect in 2000 had been continued. Any cash flows in excess of amounts assumed may be available for distribution over time to Closed Block
policyholders as part of policyholder dividends unless offset by future Closed Block experience that is less favorable than expected. These cash flows will not be available to shareholders. A policyholder dividend obligation liability is established
for any excess cash flows. Each year, the Board of Directors of Prudential Insurance determines the dividends payable on participating policies for the following year based on the experience of the Closed Block, including investment income, net
realized and unrealized investment gains, mortality experience and other factors. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for revenues, income and loss, and total assets of the Closed Block Business.



Our strategy for the Closed Block Business is to maintain the Closed Block as required by
our Plan of Reorganization over the time period of its gradual diminishment as policyholder benefits are paid in full. We are permitted under the Plan of Reorganization, with the prior consent of the New Jersey Commissioner of Banking and Insurance,
to enter into agreements to transfer to a third party all or any part of the risks under the Closed Block policies. The long-term risks associated with the Closed Block Business are 90% reinsured (subject to certain caps) including, as of
January 1, 2013, 17% reinsured by two wholly-owned subsidiaries. We also reinsure 90% of the short-term risks associated with the Closed Block Business to another wholly-owned subsidiary. Reinsurance of the Closed Block Business is reported in
the Corporate and Other operations within the Financial Services Businesses. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for more information on the
Closed Block reinsurance arrangements, as well as Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on the accounting for these reinsurance arrangements.

Intangible and Intellectual Property

We capture and protect the innovation in
our financial services products by applying for federal business method patents and implementing trade secret controls, as appropriate. We also use numerous federal, state, common law and foreign servicemarks. We believe that the goodwill associated
with many of our patents and trade secrets, and the goodwill associated with many of our servicemarks, particularly
“Prudential

®

,” “Prudential Financial

®

,” the Prudential logo and our “Rock” symbol, are significant competitive assets in the U.S.

On April 20, 2004, we entered into a servicemark and trademark agreement with Prudential plc of the United
Kingdom, with whom we have no affiliation, concerning the parties’ respective rights worldwide to use the names “Prudential” and “Pru.” Under the agreement, there are restrictions on our use of the “Prudential”
name and mark in a number of countries outside the Americas, including Europe and most parts of Asia. Where these limitations apply, we combine our “Rock” symbol with alternative word marks. We believe that these limitations do not
materially affect our ability to operate or expand internationally.

Competition

In each of our businesses, we face intense competition from insurance companies, asset managers and diversified financial institutions in the U.S. and abroad. Many of our competitors are large and
well-established and some have greater market share or breadth of distribution, offer a broader range of products, services or features, assume a greater level of risk, have lower profitability expectations or have higher financial strength or
credit ratings than we do. We compete in our businesses based on a number of factors including brand recognition, reputation, quality of service, quality of investment advice, investment performance of our products, product features, scope of
distribution and distribution arrangements, price, risk management capabilities, capital management capabilities, and financial strength and credit ratings. The relative importance of these factors varies across our products, services and the
markets we serve. The competitive landscape is, and will be, impacted by the various frameworks applied to us and our competitors.

Competition for personnel in our businesses is intense, including for executive officers and management personnel, Prudential Agents, Life
Planners, Life Consultants and other sales personnel, and our investment managers. In the ordinary course of business, we lose personnel from time to time in whom we have invested significant training. We direct substantial efforts to recruit and
retain our insurance agents and employees and to increase their productivity. Competition for desirable non-affiliated distribution channels is also intense.

Additional factors affecting the competitive landscape for our products and services are discussed within the descriptions of our business
segments above.



Regulation

Overview

Our businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision. The purpose of these regulations is
primarily to protect our customers and the overall financial system and not necessarily our shareholders. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are regularly re-examined, and existing or future laws and regulations may become more
restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations. The financial market dislocations in recent years produced, and are expected to continue to produce, extensive changes in existing laws and regulations, and regulatory frameworks, applicable
to our businesses in the U.S. and internationally, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act discussed below.

Regulation Affecting Prudential Financial

Prudential Financial is the holding company for all of our operations and is subject to regulation as an insurance holding company under
applicable insurance laws. On October 31, 2012, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”) approved Prudential Financial’s application to deregister as a savings and loan holding company and Prudential Financial
is no longer subject to regulation as a savings and loan holding company. As a company with publicly-traded securities, Prudential Financial is subject to legal and regulatory requirements applicable generally to public companies, including the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) relating to public reporting and disclosure, securities trading, accounting and financial reporting, and corporate
governance matters.

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”) subjects us to substantial additional federal regulation. Dodd-Frank directs government agencies and bodies to conduct certain studies and promulgate regulations implementing the law, a
process that is underway and expected to continue. We cannot predict with any certainty the results of the studies or the requirements of the regulations recently or not yet adopted or how Dodd-Frank and such regulations will affect the financial
markets generally, impact our business, credit or financial strength ratings, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition or make it advisable or require us to hold or raise additional capital.

Key aspects of Dodd-Frank’s impact on us include:

•

Dodd-Frank established a Financial Stability Oversight Council (“Council”) which is authorized to subject non-bank financial companies such
as Prudential Financial to stricter prudential standards and to supervision by the FRB (a “Designated Financial Company”) if the Council determines that material financial distress at the company or the scope of the company’s
activities could pose a threat to the financial stability of the U.S. On October 19, 2012, Prudential Financial received notice that it is under consideration by the Council for a proposed determination that it should be designated as a
Designated Financial Company. The Council may determine to issue to Prudential Financial a written notice of determination that it is a Designated Financial Company, in which event we would be entitled to request a nonpublic evidentiary hearing
before the Council and further court review. We cannot predict whether Prudential Financial or a subsidiary will ultimately be designated as a Designated Financial Company.

If we are determined to be a Designated Financial Company, we would become subject to stricter prudential
standards that are the subject of ongoing rule-making, including proposed stricter requirements and limitations relating to risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity and credit exposure, as well as overall risk management requirements, management
interlock prohibitions and a requirement to submit to the FRB (and periodically update) a plan for rapid and orderly dissolution in the event of severe financial distress. In December 2011, the FRB published for comment proposed rules implementing
certain of these standards. Under the proposed rules, a Designated Financial Company would be required to calculate its minimum risk-based capital and leverage requirements as if it were a bank holding company in accordance with capital requirements
published by the FRB for bank holding companies (as further discussed below) and be subject to a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4%, a total risk-based



capital ratio of 8% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. However, the proposed rules indicate that the FRB may consider that adjustments to such requirements may be appropriate with respect to
Designated Financial Companies. Designated Financial Companies of our size would be required to submit annual capital plans to the FRB demonstrating their ability to satisfy the required capital ratios under baseline and stressed conditions. The FRB
has indicated that it intends to issue, in addition to such capital requirements, a proposal requiring a risk-based capital surcharge for such companies, or a subset thereof. The proposed rules also include enhanced liquidity requirements, which
would require Designated Financial Companies to maintain a liquidity buffer of highly liquid unencumbered assets sufficient to meet projected cash flows under required stress-testing, and to establish and maintain a contingency funding plan and
concentration and other exposure limits to address liquidity needs and risk. Under the proposed rules, a Designated Financial Company would be required to limit its credit exposure to any unaffiliated entity (including sovereign issuers) to no more
than 25% of its consolidated capital stock and surplus or to no more than 10% with respect to any “major counterparty,” which includes any Designated Financial Company or bank holding company with more than $500 billion of total
consolidated assets.

The proposed rules
implement, as required by Dodd-Frank, the establishment of an “early remediation” regime, whereby failure to meet defined measures of financial condition (including exceeding certain capital and leverage ratios or market indicator
thresholds, the occurrence of adverse stress test results or other financial triggers) would result in remedial action by the FRB. Depending on the degree of financial distress, such remedial action could result in: heightened FRB supervisory
review; limitations or prohibitions on capital distributions, acquisitions and/or asset growth; requirements to raise additional capital or take other actions to improve capital adequacy; limitations on transactions with affiliates; restrictions on
product offerings and/or requirements to sell assets; or recommendation for resolution under the special orderly liquidation process discussed further below. The proposed rules would require that a Designated Financial Company determined by the
Council to pose a grave threat to financial stability of the U.S., maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of no more than 15-to-1 until the limitation is no longer necessary. We cannot predict the form in which these proposed regulations ultimately will be
adopted. Dodd-Frank authorizes the FRB to tailor its application of enhanced prudential standards to different companies on an individual basis or by category, taking into consideration financial activities involved and other factors. The FRB has
stated that it expects to take into account the differences among bank holding companies and Designated Financial Companies, including insurance companies, when applying these enhanced prudential standards. Nevertheless, we cannot predict how the
FRB will apply these prudential standards to us if we are designated as a Designated Financial Company.

•

In 2012, the FRB published a number of notices of proposed rulemaking that would substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements applicable to
bank holding companies compared to the current general risk-based capital rules. The proposals include provisions affecting the calculation of regulatory capital ratios and the use of credit ratings for valuation purposes and implementing the
Collins Amendment’s requirement that the current general risk based capital rules serve as a “floor” for specified institutions. Although these proposals do not address Designated Financial Companies, the FRB has indicated that the
proposals will become a key part of the enhanced prudential standards for covered companies, including Designated Financial Companies, described above. In addition, regulations that have been adopted to date include a modification to the general
risk-based capital rules in order to address appropriate capital requirements for low-risk assets held by non-bank financial companies such as Prudential Financial, and would permit flexibility in the application of certain capital requirements
imposed by Dodd-Frank to non-bank financial companies. We cannot predict what capital regulations the FRB will promulgate under these authorizations, either generally or as applicable to Prudential Financial were it to become a Designated Financial
Company.

•

If designated as a Designated Financial Company, we will be subject to stress tests to be promulgated by the FRB to determine whether, on a
consolidated basis, we have the capital necessary to absorb losses as a result of adverse economic conditions. If so designated, we would be required to submit to annual stress tests conducted by the FRB and to conduct internal annual and
semi-annual stress tests to be provided to the FRB. Under final rules published by the FRB in October 2012, Designated Financial Companies must comply with these requirements the calendar year after the year in which a company first becomes subject



to the FRB’s minimum regulatory capital requirements discussed above, although the FRB has the discretion to accelerate or extend the effective date. The final rules require baseline,
adverse and severely adverse scenarios to be used. The FRB will provide the scenarios to be used in the internal annual stress tests, although companies will be required to develop their own scenarios for the internal semi-annual stress tests. The
FRB has indicated that it may tailor the application of the stress test requirements to Designated Financial Companies on an individual basis or by category. Summary results of such stress tests would be required to be publicly disclosed. We cannot
predict the manner in which the stress tests would ultimately be designed, conducted and disclosed were Prudential Financial to become a Designated Financial Company or whether the results of such designation will cause us to alter our business
practices or affect the perceptions of regulators, rating agencies, customers, counterparties or investors of our financial strength.

•

The Council may recommend that state insurance regulators or other regulators apply new or heightened standards and safeguards for activities or
practices we and other insurers or other financial services companies engage in. We cannot predict whether any such recommendations will be made or their effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

•

If Prudential Financial is designated as a Designated Financial Company, we could be subject, pursuant to future FRB rulemaking, to additional capital
requirements for, and quantitative limits on, proprietary trading and sponsorship of, and investment in, hedge, private equity and other covered funds.

•

Dodd-Frank creates a new framework for regulation of the over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives markets which could impact various activities
of Prudential Global Funding (“PGF”), Prudential Financial and our insurance subsidiaries, which use derivatives for various purposes (including hedging interest rate, foreign currency and equity market exposures). Dodd-Frank generally
requires swaps, subject to a determination by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) or SEC as to which swaps are covered, entered into by all counterparties except non-financial end users to be executed through a centralized
exchange or regulated facility and to be cleared through a regulated clearinghouse. Swap dealers and major swap participants (“MSPs”) are subject to capital and margin (i.e., collateral) requirements that will be imposed by the applicable
prudential regulator or the CFTC or SEC, as well as business conduct rules and reporting requirements. In November 2012, the Secretary of the Treasury determined to exclude most foreign currency swaps and forwards from the foregoing requirements. We
believe Prudential Financial, PGF and our insurance subsidiaries should not be considered dealers or MSPs subject to registration and the capital and margin requirements. In August 2012, the CFTC published for comment a proposed rule to exempt
certain affiliated entities within a corporate group from the foregoing centralized exchange execution and clearing requirements. We cannot predict whether or in what final form the proposed rule will be adopted. The SEC and CFTC have issued
regulations defining “swaps” and are required to determine whether and how “stable value contracts” should be treated as swaps and, although we believe otherwise, various other products offered by our insurance subsidiaries might
be treated as swaps; if regulated as swaps, we cannot predict how the rules would be applied to such products or the effect on their profitability or attractiveness to our clients. Finally, the new regulatory scheme imposed on all market
participants may increase the costs of hedging generally and, because banking institutions will be required to conduct at least a portion of their OTC derivatives businesses outside their depositary institutions, may affect the credit risk these
counterparties pose to us and the degree to which we are able to enter into transactions with such counterparties. We cannot predict the effect of the foregoing on our hedging costs, our hedging strategy or implementation thereof or whether we will
need or choose to increase and/or change the composition of the risks we do not hedge.

•

Dodd-Frank established a Federal Insurance Office (“FIO”) within the Department of the Treasury headed by a director appointed by the
Secretary of the Treasury. While not having a general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the FIO director performs various functions with respect to insurance, including serving as a non-voting member of the Council
and making recommendations to the Council regarding insurers (including the Company) to be named as Designated Financial Companies and coordinating with the FRB in the application of any stress tests required to be conducted with respect to an
insurer. The FIO director is also required to conduct a study on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the United States, including by increased national uniformity through either a federal charter or effective action by
the states.



•

Title II of Dodd-Frank provides that a financial company may be subject to a special orderly liquidation process outside the federal bankruptcy code,
administered by the FDIC as receiver, upon a determination (with the approval of the FIO director if—as is true with respect to Prudential Financial—the largest United States subsidiary is an insurer) that the company is in default or in
danger of default and presents a systemic risk to U.S. financial stability. Were Prudential Financial subject to such a proceeding, our U.S. insurance subsidiaries would remain subject to rehabilitation and liquidation proceedings under state law,
although the FDIC has discretion and authority to initiate resolution of an insurer under state law if its state insurance regulator has not filed the appropriate judicial action within 60 days of a systemic risk determination. However, our
non-insurance U.S. subsidiaries engaged in financial activities would be subject to any special orderly liquidation process so commenced.

•

Dodd-Frank includes various securities law reforms that may affect our business practices and the liabilities and/or exposures associated therewith. In
January 2011, the SEC staff issued a study that recommends that the SEC adopt a uniform federal fiduciary standard of conduct for registered broker-dealers and investment advisers that provide retail investors personalized investment advice about
securities.

We cannot predict
with any certainty whether these possible outcomes will occur or the effect they may have on the financial markets or on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

International Regulatory Initiatives

In addition to the adoption of Dodd-Frank in the United
States, lawmakers around the world are actively reviewing the causes of the financial crisis and exploring steps to avoid similar problems in the future. In many respects, this work is being led by the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”),
consisting of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations. The G20, the FSB and related governmental bodies have developed proposals to address such issues as financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards,
systemic economic risk, corporate governance including executive compensation, and a host of related issues associated with responses to the financial crisis. The FSB, for example, has proposed to designate certain companies as systematically
significant, similar to the approach the Council may take in connection with Designated Financial Companies. The lawmakers and regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions in which we do business have already begun introducing legislative and
regulatory changes consistent with G20 and FSB recommendations, including proposals governing consolidated regulation of insurance holding companies by the Financial Services Agency (“FSA”) in Japan. In addition, the prudential regulation
of insurance and reinsurance companies across the European Economic Area (“EEA”) is due for significant change under the Solvency II Directive. This new regime will effect a full revision of the insurance industry’s solvency framework
and prudential regime (in particular minimum capital and solvency requirements, governance requirements, risk management and public reporting standards) and will impose, among other things, group level supervision mechanisms. The impact of the
implementation of Solvency II on Prudential cannot be determined at this time. There can be no assurance that Solvency II will not, at a minimum, result in increased supervisory, capital and disclosure burdens on Prudential’s EEA operations
with potential broader collateral consequences to Prudential Financial.

The foregoing requirements and developments could impact the manner in which we deploy our capital, structure and manage our businesses, and otherwise operate both within and outside the U.S. The
possibility of inconsistent and conflicting regulation of the Prudential Financial “group” of companies also exists as law makers and regulators in multiple jurisdictions simultaneously pursue these initiatives.

Other U.S. Federal Regulation

U.S. Tax Legislation

The American Taxpayer’s Relief Act (the
“Act”) was signed into law on January 2, 2013. The Act permanently extended the reduced Bush-era individual tax rates for certain taxpayers and permanently increased those rates for higher income taxpayers. Higher tax rates increase
the benefits of tax deferral on the build-up of value of annuities and life insurance. The Act also made permanent the current $5 million (indexed for inflation) per person estate tax exemption and increased the top estate tax rate from 35% to 40%.
In addition, the Act extended various business tax provisions through the end of 2013 that had expired at the end of 2011. One such



provision provides tax deferral for investment income earned by a foreign insurance operation until the income is repatriated to the U.S. If this provision had not been extended, the Company
would have been subject to current U.S. tax on investment income earned by its foreign insurance subsidiaries.

Notwithstanding the passage of the Act, there continues to be uncertainty regarding U.S. taxes, both for individuals and corporations.
There continues to be discussions in Washington concerning the need to reform the tax code, primarily by lowering tax rates and broadening the base by reducing or eliminating certain tax expenditures. Reducing or eliminating certain expenditures
could make our products less attractive to customers. It is unclear whether or when Congress may take up overall tax reform and what would be the impact of reform on the Company and its products. However, even in the absence of overall tax reform,
the large federal deficit increases the possibility that Congress will raise revenue by enacting legislation to increase the taxes paid by individuals and/or corporations. This can be accomplished by either raising rates or otherwise changing the
tax rules.

Current U.S. federal income tax laws
generally permit certain holders to defer taxation on the build-up of value of annuities and life insurance products until payments are actually made to the policyholder or other beneficiary and to exclude from taxation the death benefit paid under
a life insurance contract. Congress from time to time considers legislation that could make our products less attractive to consumers, including legislation that would reduce or eliminate the benefit of this deferral on some annuities and insurance
products.

Additionally, legislative or regulatory
changes could also impact the amount of taxes that we pay, thereby affecting our consolidated net income. For example, the U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service intend to address through guidance the methodology to be followed in
determining the dividends received deduction, or DRD, related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts. The DRD reduces the amount of dividend income subject to U.S. tax and is a significant component of the difference between our actual tax
expense and expected tax amount determined using the federal statutory tax rate of 35%. For the last several years, the revenue proposals included in the Obama Administration’s budgets (the Administration’s Revenue Proposals) included a
proposal that would change the method used to determine the amount of the DRD. A change in the DRD, including the possible retroactive or prospective elimination of this deduction through guidance or legislation, could increase actual tax expense
and reduce the Company’s consolidated net income.

Furthermore, the Administration’s Revenue Proposals also included items that would change the method by which U.S. multinationals claim foreign tax credits and the timing of the deduction for
interest expense that is allocable to foreign source income.

For additional discussion of possible tax legislative and regulatory risks that could affect our business, see “Risk Factors.”

Proposed Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee

The Administration’s Revenue Proposal includes a proposal that would impose a Financial Crisis
Responsibility Fee, or FCRF, on certain financial institutions with over $50 billion in consolidated assets, including the Company. The amount of the FCRF that would be imposed upon the Company under this proposal, in the event it is enacted into
law, is unclear, but could be substantial.

ERISA

ERISA is a comprehensive federal statute that applies to U.S. employee benefit plans sponsored by private employers and labor unions.
Plans subject to ERISA include pension and profit sharing plans and welfare plans, including health, life and disability plans. ERISA provisions include reporting and disclosure rules, standards of conduct that apply to plan fiduciaries and
prohibitions on transactions known as “prohibited transactions,” such as conflict-of-interest transactions and certain transactions between a benefit plan and a party in interest. ERISA also provides for a scheme of civil and criminal
penalties and enforcement. Our insurance, asset management and retirement businesses provide services to employee benefit plans subject to ERISA, including services where we may act as an ERISA fiduciary. In addition to ERISA regulation of
businesses providing products and services to



ERISA plans, we become subject to ERISA’s prohibited transaction rules for transactions with those plans, which may affect our ability to enter transactions, or the terms on which
transactions may be entered, with those plans, even in businesses unrelated to those giving rise to party in interest status.

USA Patriot Act

The USA Patriot Act of 2001, enacted in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, contains anti-money laundering and
financial transparency laws applicable to broker-dealers and other financial services companies, including insurance companies. The Patriot Act seeks to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in
identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. Anti-money laundering laws outside of the U.S. contain provisions that may be different, conflicting or more rigorous. The increased obligations of financial institutions to
identify their customers, watch for and report suspicious transactions, respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and share information with other financial institutions require the implementation
and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls.

Holding Company Regulation

Prudential Financial is subject to the insurance holding company laws in the states where our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, which
currently include New Jersey, Arizona, Connecticut, Indiana and Iowa, or are treated as commercially domiciled, such as New York. These laws generally require each insurance company directly or indirectly owned by the holding company to register
with the insurance department in the insurance company’s state of domicile and to furnish annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company system. Generally, all transactions affecting the
insurers in the holding company system must be fair and reasonable and, if material, require prior notice and approval or non-disapproval by the state’s insurance department.

Most states, including the states in which our U.S. insurance
companies are domiciled, have insurance laws that require regulatory approval of a direct or indirect change of control of an insurer or an insurer’s holding company. Laws such as these that apply to us prevent any person from acquiring control
of Prudential Financial or of our insurance subsidiaries unless that person has filed a statement with specified information with the insurance regulators and has obtained their prior approval. Under most states’ statutes, acquiring 10% or more
of the voting stock of an insurance company or its parent company is presumptively considered a change of control, although such presumption may be rebutted. Accordingly, any person who acquires 10% or more of the voting securities of Prudential
Financial without the prior approval of the insurance regulators of the states in which our U.S. insurance companies are domiciled will be in violation of these states’ laws and may be subject to injunctive action requiring the disposition or
seizure of those securities by the relevant insurance regulator or prohibiting the voting of those securities and to other actions determined by the relevant insurance regulator. In addition, many state insurance laws require prior notification to
state insurance departments of a change in control of a non-domiciliary insurance company doing business in that state.

Currently, there are several proposals to amend state insurance holding company laws to increase the scope of regulation of insurance
holding companies (such as Prudential Financial). The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, has promulgated model laws for adoption in the United States that would provide for “group wide” supervision of Prudential
Financial as an insurance holding company in addition to the current regulation of Prudential Financial’s insurance subsidiaries. In addition, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, or IAIS, is developing a model framework for
the regulation of internationally active insurance groups that also contemplates “group wide supervision” across national boundaries. While the timing of their adoption and content will vary by jurisdiction, we have identified the
following areas of focus in these model laws: (1) uniform standards for insurer corporate governance; (2) group-wide supervision of insurance holding companies; (3) adjustments to risk-based capital calculations to account for
group-wide risks; and (4) additional regulatory and disclosure requirements for insurance holding companies. At this time, we cannot predict with any degree of certainty what additional capital requirements, compliance costs or other burdens
these requirements would impose on Prudential Financial if adopted.

In 2012, Prudential Bank & Trust, FSB, (“PB&T”) limited its operations to trust services. On October 31, 2012, the FRB approved Prudential Financial’s application to
deregister as a savings and loan holding company



and Prudential Financial and Prudential IBH Holdco, Inc. are no longer considered to be savings and loan holding companies subject, in that capacity, to the examination, enforcement and
supervisory authority of the FRB. As a trust-only organization, PB&T does not have access to a Federal Reserve credit line, is not permitted to issue commercial loans or checking accounts and all or substantially all deposits, if any, must be
trust funds received in a fiduciary capacity. PB&T is now regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) as a federal savings association and Prudential Financial is subject to supervision by the OCC as to whether
it serves as a source of strength to PB&T. We also provide trust services through Prudential Trust Company, a state-chartered trust company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Federal and state banking laws generally
provide that no person may acquire control of Prudential Financial, and gain indirect control of either PB&T or Prudential Trust Company, without prior regulatory approval. Generally, beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the voting securities
of Prudential Financial would be presumed to constitute control. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of Prudential Financial, including through transactions, and in particular
unsolicited transactions, that some shareholders of Prudential Financial might consider desirable.

Insurance Operations

State insurance laws regulate all aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and state insurance departments in the fifty states, the District of Columbia and various U.S. territories and possessions
monitor our insurance operations. Prudential Insurance is domiciled in New Jersey and its principal insurance regulatory authority is the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance. Our other U.S. insurance companies are principally regulated by
the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled. Generally, our insurance products must be approved by the insurance regulators in the state in which they are sold. Our insurance products are substantially affected by federal and
state tax laws.

State Insurance Regulation

State insurance authorities have broad
administrative powers with respect to all aspects of the insurance business including: licensing to transact business; licensing agents; admittance of assets to statutory surplus; regulating premium rates for certain insurance products; approving
policy forms; regulating unfair trade and claims practices; establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards; fixing maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans and minimum accumulation or surrender values; regulating the type,
amounts and valuations of investments permitted and other matters; and regulating reinsurance transactions, including the role of captive reinsurers.

State insurance laws and regulations require our U.S. insurance companies to file financial statements with state insurance departments
everywhere they do business, and the operations of our U.S. insurance companies and accounts are subject to examination by those departments at any time. Our U.S. insurance companies prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with
accounting practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by these departments.

State insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the books and records, financial reporting, policy filings and market conduct of insurance companies domiciled in their states, generally once
every three to five years. Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the NAIC. In February 2013, the New Jersey insurance regulator, along with the insurance
regulators of Arizona, Connecticut, Indiana and Iowa substantially completed a coordinated risk focused financial examination for the five year period ended December 31, 2011 for all of our U.S. domestic insurance companies as part of the
normal five year examination and found no material deficiencies as of the date of this filing.

Financial Regulation

Dividend Payment Limitations.

The New Jersey insurance law and the insurance laws of the other states in which our insurance companies are domiciled regulate the amount of
dividends that may be paid by Prudential Insurance and our other U.S. insurance companies. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.



Risk-Based Capital.

In order to enhance the regulation of
insurers’ solvency, the NAIC adopted a model law to implement risk-based capital requirements for life, health and property and casualty insurance companies. All states have adopted the NAIC’s model law or a substantially similar law. The
risk-based capital, or RBC, calculation, which regulators use to assess the sufficiency of an insurer’s statutory capital, measures the risk characteristics of a company’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. In
general, RBC is calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and reserve items. Within a given risk category, these factors are higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for items with lower underlying
risk. Insurers that have less statutory capital than the RBC calculation requires are considered to have inadequate capital and are subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending upon the level of capital inadequacy.

Insurance Reserves and Regulatory
Capital.

State insurance laws require us to analyze the adequacy of our reserves annually. The respective appointed actuaries for each of our life insurance companies must each submit an opinion that our reserves, when
considered in light of the assets we hold with respect to those reserves, make adequate provision for our contractual obligations and related expenses.

The NAIC has developed a principles-based reserving approach for life insurance products. The timing and the effect of these changes are
still uncertain since the changes have to be adopted by each state and the approach can be further modified prior to adoption.

Solvency Modernization Initiative.

State insurance regulators have focused attention on U.S. insurance
solvency regulation pursuant to the NAIC’s “Solvency Modernization Initiative.” The Solvency Modernization Initiative focuses on the entire U.S. financial regulatory system and all aspects of financial regulation affecting insurance
companies. Though broad in scope, the NAIC has stated that the Solvency Modernization Initiative will focus on: (1) capital requirements; (2) corporate governance and risk management; (3) group supervision; (4) statutory
accounting and financial reporting; and (5) reinsurance. This initiative has resulted in the recent adoption of the NAIC Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment model act which, following enactment at the state level, will require
larger insurers to, at least annually beginning in 2015, assess the adequacy of its and its group’s risk management and current and future solvency position. We cannot predict the additional capital requirements or compliance costs these
requirements may impose.

IRIS
Tests.

The NAIC has developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System, or IRIS, to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of U.S. insurance
companies and identifying companies that require special attention or action by insurance regulatory authorities. Generally, regulators will begin to investigate or monitor an insurance company if its ratios fall outside usual ranges for four or
more of the ratios. If an insurance company has insufficient capital, regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance it can issue. None of our U.S. insurance companies is currently subject to regulatory scrutiny based on these ratios.

Market Conduct Regulation

State insurance laws and regulations include numerous
provisions governing the marketplace activities of insurers, including provisions governing the form and content of disclosure to consumers, illustrations, advertising, sales practices and complaint handling. State regulatory authorities generally
enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations.

Insurance Guaranty Association Assessments

Each state has insurance guaranty association laws under which insurers doing business in the state are members and may be assessed by state insurance guaranty associations for certain obligations of
insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Typically, states assess each member insurer in an amount related to the member insurer’s proportionate share of the business written by all member insurers in the state. For the
years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we paid approximately $2.4 million, $3.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively, in assessments pursuant to state insurance guaranty association laws. Many states offer a reimbursement of such
assessments in the form of credits against future years’ premium taxes. In addition, in 2011, we agreed to make a voluntary contribution of $20 million to an insurance industry solvency fund, related to Executive Life Insurance Company of New
York. While we cannot predict the amount and timing of any



future assessments on our U.S. insurance companies under these laws, we have established reserves that we believe are adequate for future assessments relating to insurance companies that are
currently subject to insolvency proceedings.

Federal and
State Securities Regulation Affecting Insurance Operations

Our variable life insurance products, as well as our variable annuity and mutual fund products, generally are “securities” within the meaning of federal securities laws, that may be required to
be registered under the federal securities laws and subject to regulation by the SEC and FINRA. Federal and some state securities regulation similar to that discussed below under “—Investment Products and Asset Management Operations”
and “—Securities and Commodities Regulation” affect investment advice, sales and related activities with respect to these products.

Our mutual funds, and in certain states our variable life insurance and variable annuity products, are “securities” within the
meaning of state securities laws. As securities, these products are subject to filing and certain other requirements. Also, sales activities with respect to these products generally are subject to state securities regulation. Such regulation may
affect investment advice, sales and related activities for these products

.

Investment and Retirement Products and Asset Management Operations

Our investment products and services are subject to federal and state securities, fiduciary, including ERISA, and other laws and
regulations. The SEC, FINRA, CFTC, state securities commissions, state banking and insurance departments and the United States Department of Labor are the principal U.S. regulators that regulate our asset management operations. For a discussion of
Dodd-Frank’s impact on our investment products and asset management operations, see “—Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act” above.

Some of the separate account, mutual fund and other pooled
investment products offered by our businesses, in addition to being registered under the Securities Act, are registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the shares of certain of these entities are
qualified for sale in some states and the District of Columbia. Separate account investment products are also subject to state insurance regulation as described above. We also have several subsidiaries that are registered as broker-dealers under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and are subject to federal and state regulation. In addition, we have several subsidiaries that are investment advisers registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as
amended. Our Prudential Agents and other employees, insofar as they sell products that are securities, are subject to the Exchange Act and to examination requirements and regulation by the SEC, FINRA and state securities commissioners. Regulation
and examination requirements also extend to various Prudential entities that employ or control those individuals. The federal securities laws could also require re-approval by customers of our investment advisory contracts to manage mutual funds,
including mutual funds included in annuity products, upon a change in control.

Congress from time to time considers pension reform legislation that could decrease or increase the attractiveness of certain of our retirement products and services to retirement plan sponsors and
administrators, or have an unfavorable or favorable effect on our ability to earn revenues from these products and services. Over time, these changes could hinder our sales of defined benefit pension products and services and cause sponsors to
discontinue existing plans for which we provide asset management, administrative, or other services, but could increase the attractiveness of certain products we offer in connection with terminating or ongoing pension plans.

Securities and Commodities Regulation

We have subsidiaries that are broker-dealers, investment
advisers, commodity pool operators or commodity trading advisers. The SEC, the CFTC, state securities authorities, FINRA, the National Futures Association (“NFA”), the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, and similar authorities are the
principal regulators of these subsidiaries.



Our broker-dealer and commodities affiliates are members of, and are subject to regulation
by, “self-regulatory organizations,” including FINRA and the NFA. Self-regulatory organizations conduct examinations of, and have adopted rules governing, their members. In addition, state securities and certain other regulators have
regulatory and oversight authority over our registered broker-dealers. Broker-dealers and their sales forces in the U.S. and in certain other jurisdictions are subject to regulations that cover many aspects of the securities business, including
sales methods and trading practices. The regulations cover the suitability of investments for individual customers, use and safekeeping of customers’ funds and securities, capital adequacy, recordkeeping, financial reporting and the conduct of
directors, officers and employees. The SEC, CFTC and other governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S., have the power to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure,
fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or suspension, termination or limitation of the activities of a broker-dealer, an investment adviser or commodities firm or its employees. Our U.S. registered broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to
federal net capital requirements that may limit the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends to Prudential Financial.

Privacy Regulation

We are subject to federal and state law and regulation that require financial institutions and other businesses to protect the security
and confidentiality of personal information, including health-related and customer information, and to notify customers and other individuals about their policies and practices relating to their collection and disclosure of health-related and
customer information and their practices relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. State laws regulate use and disclosure of social security numbers. Federal and state laws require notice to affected individuals,
law enforcement, regulators and others if there is a breach of the security of certain personal information, including social security numbers, and require holders of certain personal information to protect the security of the data. Federal
regulations require financial institutions and creditors to implement effective programs to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft. Federal and state laws and regulations regulate the ability of financial institutions to make telemarketing
calls and to send unsolicited e-mail or fax messages to consumers and customers. Federal law and regulation regulate the permissible uses of certain personal information, including consumer report information. Federal and state governments and
regulatory bodies may be expected to consider additional or more detailed regulation regarding these subjects and the privacy and security of personal information.

Environmental Considerations

Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations
apply to our ownership and operation of real property. Inherent in owning and operating real property are the risks of hidden environmental liabilities and the costs of any required clean-up. Under the laws of certain states, contamination of a
property may give rise to a lien on the property to secure recovery of the costs of clean-up, which could adversely affect our commercial mortgage lending business. In several states, this lien has priority over the lien of an existing mortgage
against such property. In addition, in some states and under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, we may be liable, in certain circumstances, as an “owner” or
“operator,” for costs of cleaning-up releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at a property mortgaged to us. We also risk environmental liability when we foreclose on a property mortgaged to us, although Federal legislation
provides for a safe harbor from CERCLA liability for secured lenders that foreclose and sell the mortgaged real estate, provided that certain requirements are met. However, there are circumstances in which actions taken could still expose us to
CERCLA liability. Application of various other federal and state environmental laws could also result in the imposition of liability on us for costs associated with environmental hazards.

We routinely conduct environmental assessments prior to taking title to real estate, whether through
acquisition for investment, or through foreclosure on real estate collateralizing mortgages that we hold. Although unexpected environmental liabilities can always arise, we seek to minimize this risk by undertaking these environmental assessments
and complying with our internal procedures, and as a result, we believe that any costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations or any clean-up of properties would not have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations.



Unclaimed Property Laws

We are subject to the laws and regulations of states and
other jurisdictions concerning the identification, reporting and escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned funds, and we are subject to audit and examination for compliance with these requirements. For additional discussion of these matters, see Note 23
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Regulation of our
International Businesses

Our international
businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision. As in the U.S., the purpose of these regulations is primarily to protect our customers and not necessarily our shareholders. These regulations may apply heightened scrutiny to
non-domestic companies, which can reduce our flexibility as to intercompany transactions, investments and other aspects of business operations and adversely affect our liquidity and profitability. Many of the laws and regulations to which our
international businesses are subject are regularly re-examined, in some instances resulting in comprehensive restatements of applicable laws, regulations and reorganization of supervising authorities. Existing or future laws or regulations may
become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations as regulators seek to protect their financial systems from perceived systemic risk. Solvency regulatory approaches developed in Europe are being considered or adopted in
jurisdictions such as Japan and Mexico. It is likely that the recent financial market dislocations will lead to changes in existing laws and regulations and regulatory frameworks, affecting our international business. In some instances, such
jurisdictions may also impose different, conflicting or more rigorous laws and requirements, including regulations governing privacy, consumer protection, employee protection, corporate governance and capital adequacy. Changes such as these can
increase compliance costs and potential regulatory exposure.

In addition, our international operations face political, legal, operational and other risks that we do not face in the U.S., including the risk of discriminatory regulation, labor issues in connection
with workers’ associations and trade unions, nationalization or expropriation of assets, dividend limitations, price controls and currency exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out
of the countries in which they operate or converting local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies. Some jurisdictions in which we operate joint ventures restrict our maximum percentage of ownership, which exposes us to joint
venture partner risks and limits our array of potential remedies.

Our international insurance operations are principally supervised by regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate, including the Japanese Ministry of Finance and Financial Services
Agency. We operate insurance companies in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Italy and Poland and have insurance operations in India and China through joint ventures. The insurance regulatory bodies for these businesses typically
oversee such issues as company licensing, the licensing of insurance sales staff, insurance product approvals, sales practices, claims payment practices, permissible investments, solvency and capital adequacy, and insurance reserves, among other
items. In some jurisdictions, for certain products, regulators will also mandate premium rates (or components of pricing) or minimum guaranteed interest rates. Periodic examinations of insurance company books and records, financial reporting
requirements, market conduct examinations and policy filing requirements are among the techniques used by these regulators to supervise our non-U.S. insurance businesses.

In order to monitor insurers’ solvency, regulatory
authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate outside the U.S. generally establish some form of minimum solvency margin requirements for insurance companies, similar in concept to the RBC ratios that are employed by U.S. insurance regulators.
These solvency margins are used by regulators to assess the sufficiency of an insurer’s capital and claims-paying ability and include the impact of transactions with affiliated entities. The solvency margin ratios in certain jurisdictions are
required to be disclosed to the public. Insurers that have less solvency margin than the regulators require are considered to have inadequate capital and are subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending upon the level of capital
inadequacy.

The Financial Services Agency, the
insurance regulator in Japan, has implemented revisions to the solvency margin requirements that revised risk charges for certain assets and changed the manner in which an insurance company’s core capital is calculated. These changes were
effective for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012. We anticipate further changes in solvency regulation from jurisdiction to jurisdiction based on regulatory



developments in the U.S., the European Union, and recommendations by an international standard setting body for the insurance industry, as well as regulatory requirements for those companies
deemed to be systemically important financial institutions (similar to Designated Financial Companies under Dodd-Frank).

The insurance regulatory bodies in some of the countries where our international insurance businesses are located regulate the amount of
dividends that they can pay to shareholders. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the ability of our international subsidiaries to pay dividends to Prudential Financial.

Our international operations are also supervised primarily by
regulatory authorities in the countries in which they operate. We operate investment-related businesses in, among other jurisdictions, Japan, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Mexico, India, Germany and Singapore, and participate in
investment-related joint ventures in Brazil, Italy and China. These businesses may provide investment-related products such as investment management products and services, mutual funds, and separately managed accounts. The regulatory authorities for
these businesses typically oversee such issues as company licensing, the licensing of investment product sales staff, sales practices, solvency and capital adequacy, mutual fund product approvals and related disclosures, securities, commodities and
related laws, among other items. In some cases, our international investment operations are also subject to U.S. securities laws and regulations.

Our international businesses may also be subject to U.S. laws governing businesses controlled by U.S. companies such as the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act and certain regulations issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Asset Controls. In addition, under current U.S. law and regulations we may be prohibited from dealing with certain individuals or entities in certain circumstances
and we may be required to monitor customer activities, which may affect our ability to attract and retain customers. Furthermore, certain of our businesses, particularly those with operations in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), are also
subject to the U.K.’s Anti-Bribery Law, which governs interactions with both governmental and private commercial entities.

Certain of our international insurance operations, including those in Japan, may be subject to assessments, generally based on their
proportionate share of business written in the relevant jurisdiction, for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. As we cannot predict the timing of future assessments, they may materially affect the
results of operations of our international insurance operations in particular quarterly or annual periods. Under the Japanese insurance guaranty law, substantially similar to such laws in the U.S., all licensed life insurers in Japan are required to
be members and are assessed, on a pre-funded basis, by the Japan Policyholders Protection Corporation, or PPC. These assessments generate a collective fund which is used to satisfy certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to
policyholders and claimants. The PPC assesses each member in an amount related to its proportionate share of new business written by all member insurers. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we paid approximately $31 million,
$29 million and $16 million, respectively, in assessments pursuant to Japanese insurance guaranty association laws.

Our international businesses are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the countries in which they are organized and in which they
operate. Foreign governments from time to time consider legislation that could impact the amount of taxes that we pay or impact the sales of our products.

In 2010, Taiwan reduced the corporate tax rate from 20% to 17% for tax years beginning in or after 2010. On November 30, 2011, Japan
enacted the 2011 corporate tax reform that decreased the national corporate tax rate from 30% to 28.05%, after taking into account the special reconstruction corporate tax, for tax years beginning on or after April, 1, 2012, and to 25.5% for tax
years beginning on or after April 1, 2015. The carryforward period for net operating losses in Japan was increased from 7 to 9 years. Under the new legislation net operating losses can only offset 80% of a company’s taxable income. On
December 31, 2011 Korea rescinded the corporate tax decrease to 22% that was to be effective in 2012. Therefore, the Korean corporate tax rate remains at 24.2% for 2012 and thereafter.

Our international operations are often subject to value added tax and similar taxes in the countries in which
they operate. On August 10, 2012, Japan enacted legislation to increase the 5% consumption tax to 8% in April 2014 and to 10% in October 2015. An increase to such tax rates could reduce our consolidated net income.



On April 27, 2012, the Japan National Tax Authority (NTA) reduced the corporate tax
deductibility of premiums paid for cancer products. Such a change has resulted in a decrease in the sale of such products in Japan.

Employees

As of December 31, 2012, we had 48,498 employees and sales associates, including 29,547 located outside of the U.S. We believe our
relations with our employees and sales associates are satisfactory.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the following risks. These risks are not exclusive, and additional risks to which we are subject include,
but are not limited to, the factors mentioned under “Forward-Looking Statements” above and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Risks Relating to Economic, Market and Political Conditions

Market fluctuations and general economic, market and political conditions
may adversely affect our business and profitability.

Our businesses and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and by economic conditions generally.

Even under relatively favorable market conditions, our
insurance, annuity and investment products, as well as our investment returns and our access to and cost of financing, are sensitive to fixed income, equity, real estate and other market fluctuations and general economic, market and political
conditions. These fluctuations and conditions could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity, including in the following respects:

•

The profitability of many of our insurance and annuity products depends in part on the value of the separate accounts supporting these products, which
fluctuate substantially depending on the foregoing conditions.

•

Market conditions resulting in reductions in the value of assets we manage or lower transaction volume have an adverse effect on the revenues and
profitability of our asset management business, which depends on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management or transaction volume, and could further decrease the value of our strategic investments.



•

A change in market conditions, such as high inflation and high interest rates, could cause a change in consumer sentiment and behavior adversely
affecting sales and persistency of our savings and protection products. Conversely, low inflation and low interest rates could cause persistency of these products to vary from that anticipated and adversely affect profitability (as further described
below). Similarly, changing economic conditions and unfavorable public perception of financial institutions can influence customer behavior, including increasing claims or surrenders in certain product lines.

•

Sales of our investment-based and asset management products and services may decline, and lapses and surrenders of variable life and annuity products
and withdrawals of assets from other investment products may increase if a market downturn, increased market volatility or other market conditions result in customers becoming dissatisfied with their investments or products.

•

A market decline could further result in guaranteed minimum benefits contained in many of our variable annuity products being higher than current
account values or our pricing assumptions would support, requiring us to materially increase reserves for such products, and may cause customers to retain contracts in force in order to benefit from the guarantees, thereby increasing their cost to
us. Any increased cost may or may not be more than offset by the favorable impact of greater persistency from prolonged fee streams. Our valuation of the liabilities for the minimum benefits contained in many of our variable annuity products
requires us to consider the market perception of our risk of non-performance, and a decrease in our own credit spreads resulting from ratings upgrades or other events or market conditions could cause the recorded value of these liabilities to
increase, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.

•

Market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase. Accordingly, we may be forced to incur additional
expenses for reinsurance or may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms which could adversely affect the profitability of future business or our willingness to write future business.

•

Derivative instruments we hold to hedge and manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate and equity risks associated with our products and businesses,
and other risks might not perform as intended or expected resulting in higher realized losses and unforeseen stresses on liquidity. Market conditions can limit availability of hedging instruments, require us to post additional collateral, and also
further increase the cost of executing product related hedges and such costs may not be recovered in the pricing of the underlying products being hedged. Our derivative-based hedging strategies also rely on the performance of counterparties to such
derivatives. These counterparties may fail to perform for various reasons resulting in losses on uncollateralized positions.

•

We have significant investment and derivative portfolios, including but not limited to corporate and asset-backed securities, foreign government
securities (primarily that of the Japanese government), equities and commercial real estate. Economic conditions as well as adverse capital market conditions, including a lack of buyers in the marketplace, volatility, credit spread changes,
benchmark interest rate changes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and declines in value of underlying collateral will impact the credit quality, liquidity and value of our investments and derivatives, potentially resulting in higher
capital charges and unrealized or realized losses. Valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may have significant period to period changes which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition, and
in certain cases under U.S. GAAP such period to period changes in the value of investments are not recognized in our results of operations or consolidated statements of financial position.

•

Opportunities for investment of available funds at appropriate returns may be limited, including due to the current low interest rate environment, a
diminished securitization market or other factors, with a possible negative impact on our overall results. Limited opportunities for attractive investments may lead to holding cash for long periods of time and increased use of derivatives for
duration management and other portfolio management purposes. The increased use of derivatives may increase the volatility of our U.S. GAAP results and our statutory capital.

•

Regardless of market conditions, certain investments we hold, including private bonds and commercial mortgages, are relatively illiquid. If we needed
to sell these investments, we may have difficulty doing so in a timely manner at a price that we could otherwise realize.



•

Certain features of our products and components of investment strategies depend on active and liquid markets, and, if market liquidity is strained,
these may not perform as intended.

•

Fluctuations in our operating results and the impact on our investment portfolio may impact the Company’s tax profile and its ability to optimally
utilize tax attributes.

Adverse
developments in the Japanese economy, including but not limited to the effects of higher inflation, interest rate volatility, changes in the Japan sovereign credit rating, and material changes in yen/U.S. Dollar exchange rates may adversely affect
the value of our investments, results of operations and financial condition.

Adverse European market, economic and financial conditions have had, and are likely to continue to have, a negative impact on global economic activity and financial markets. These conditions, should they
persist or worsen, could adversely affect our investment results, results of operations and financial position.

Adverse developments in the U.S. or global economy resulting from the continuing uncertainty about the Federal Reserve’s monetary
policy and the ongoing debate over the federal debt ceiling and its temporary suspension, sequestration (the automatic reduction in defense and non-defense spending) and the funding of the U.S. government operating under a temporary resolution could
adversely affect our investment results, results of operations and financial position.

Interest rate fluctuations or prolonged periods of low interest rates could adversely affect our businesses and profitability and require us to increase reserves and statutory capital.

Our insurance and annuity products and certain of our
investment products, and our investment returns, are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, and changes in interest rates could adversely affect our investment returns and results of operations, including in the following respects:

•

Some of our products expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce the spread between the amounts that we are required to pay under
the contracts and the rate of return we are able to earn on our general account investments supporting the contracts. When interest rates decline, we have to reinvest in lower yielding instruments, potentially reducing net investment income. Since
many of our policies and contracts have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates or limit the resetting of interest rates, the spreads could decrease and potentially become negative, or go further negative. When interest rates rise, we may not
be able to replace the assets in our general account as quickly with the higher yielding assets needed to fund the higher crediting rates necessary to keep these products and contracts competitive. In addition, rising interest rates could cause a
decline in the market value of fixed income assets the Company manages which in turn could result in lower asset management fees earned.

•

Changes in interest rates can also result in potential losses in our investment activities in which we borrow funds and purchase investments to earn
additional spread income on the borrowed funds.

•

When interest rates rise, policy loans and surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts may increase as policyholders
seek to buy products with perceived higher returns, requiring us to sell investment assets potentially resulting in realized investment losses, or requiring us to accelerate the amortization of DAC, DSI or VOBA (each defined below). In addition,
increasing interest rates could cause capital strain for Japanese statutory reporting because the carrying value of bonds classified as available-for-sale would decline while the carrying value of liabilities would generally remain unchanged.

•

A decline in interest rates accompanied by unexpected prepayments of certain investments could require us to reinvest at lower rates and reduce our
profitability. An increase in interest rates accompanied by unexpected extensions of certain lower yielding investments could reduce our profitability.

•

Changes in interest rates coupled with accelerated client withdrawals for certain products can result in increased costs associated with our
guarantees.

•

Changes in the relationship between long-term and short-term interest rates could adversely affect the profitability of some of our products.

•

Changes in interest rates could increase our costs of financing.



•

Our mitigation efforts with respect to interest rate risk are primarily focused on maintaining an investment portfolio with diversified maturities that
has a weighted average duration that is approximately equal to the duration of our estimated liability cash flow profile. However, this estimate of the liability cash flow profile is complex and could turn out to be inaccurate, especially during
volatile times. In addition, there are practical and capital market limitations on our ability to accomplish this matching. Due to these and other factors we may need to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a loss in order to satisfy
liabilities or be forced to reinvest funds in a lower rate environment. Although we take measures to manage the economic risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, we may not be able to effectively mitigate, and we may sometimes
choose based on economic considerations and other factors not to fully mitigate, the interest rate risk of our assets relative to our liabilities.

•

For certain of our products, a delay between the time we make changes in interest rate and other assumptions used for product pricing and the time we
are able to reflect these assumptions in products available for sale could negatively impact the long-term profitability of products sold during the intervening period.

Recent periods have been characterized by low interest rates. A prolonged period during which interest rates
remain at levels lower than those anticipated in our pricing may result in greater costs associated with certain of our product features which guarantee death benefits or income streams for stated periods or for life; higher costs for derivative
instruments used to hedge certain of our product risks; or shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting policy obligations, each of which may require us to record charges to increase reserves. In addition to compressing spreads and reducing
net investment income, such an environment may cause policies to remain in force for longer periods than we anticipated in our pricing, potentially resulting in greater claims costs than we expected and resulting in lower overall returns on business
in force. Reflecting these impacts in recoverability and loss recognition testing under U.S. GAAP may require us to accelerate the amortization of DAC, DSI or VOBA as noted above, as well as to increase required reserves for future policyholder
benefits. In addition, certain statutory capital and reserve requirements are based on formulas or models that consider interest rates, and a prolonged period of low interest rates may increase the statutory capital we are required to hold as well
as the amount of assets we must maintain to support statutory reserves.

Adverse capital market conditions could significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, our access to capital and our cost of capital, including capital that may be required by our
subsidiaries. Under such conditions, we may seek additional debt or equity capital but may be unable to obtain such.

Adverse capital market conditions could affect the availability and cost of borrowed funds and could impact our ability to refinance
existing borrowings, thereby ultimately impacting our profitability and ability to support or grow our businesses. We need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, interest on our debt and dividends on our capital stock and replace certain maturing
debt obligations. During times of market stress, our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and some of our alternative sources of liquidity, such as commercial paper issuance, securities lending and repurchase arrangements and
other forms of borrowings in the capital markets, may be unavailable to us.

Disruptions, uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets may force us to delay raising capital, issue shorter tenor securities than would be optimal, bear an unattractive cost of capital or be
unable to raise capital at any price, which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility.

We may seek additional debt or equity financing to satisfy our needs. However, the availability of additional financing depends on a
variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, and our credit ratings and credit capacity. We may not be able to successfully obtain additional
financing on favorable terms, or at all. Actions we might take to access financing may in turn cause rating agencies to reevaluate our ratings. Further, any future equity offerings would dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders.

Disruptions in the capital markets could
adversely affect Prudential Financial’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to access sources of liquidity, as well as threaten to reduce our capital below a level that is consistent with our existing ratings objectives. Therefore, we may need
to take actions, which may include but are not limited to: (1) further access external sources of capital, including the debt or equity markets; (2) reduce or eliminate future



shareholder dividends on our Common Stock; (3) undertake additional capital management activities, including reinsurance transactions; (4) limit or curtail sales of certain products
and/or restructure existing products; (5) undertake further asset sales or internal asset transfers; (6) seek temporary or permanent changes to regulatory rules; and (7) maintain greater levels of cash balances or for longer periods
thereby reducing investment returns. Certain of these actions may require regulatory approval and/or agreement of counterparties which are outside of our control or have economic costs associated with them.

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our
profitability, financial condition and cash flow, as well as increase the volatility of our results of operations under U.S. GAAP.

As a U.S.-based company with significant business operations outside the U.S., particularly in Japan, we are exposed to foreign currency
exchange risks that could reduce the U.S. dollar equivalent earnings and equity of these operations. We enter into derivative contracts in order to hedge the future income of certain of our international subsidiaries. Further, our Japanese
subsidiaries hold U.S. dollar-denominated assets as a way for us to mitigate the effect of fluctuations in the yen exchange rate on our U.S. dollar-equivalent investment in these subsidiaries. We seek to mitigate any volatility in the local solvency
margins of our Japanese subsidiaries due to holding these U.S. dollar-denominated investments by entering into inter-company currency derivatives. Currency fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial
condition as a result of these derivative positions or due to foreign income or equity investments that are not hedged. A significant strengthening of the yen could adversely impact the value of our hedges and U.S. dollar-denominated
investments held in our Japanese subsidiaries and could result in additional liquidity or capital needs for our International Insurance operations.

Our Japanese insurance operations offer products denominated in non-yen currencies, with the liabilities for these products supported by
investments denominated in the corresponding currencies. While the impact from foreign currency exchange rate movements on these non-yen denominated assets and liabilities are economically matched, the accounting for changes in the value of these
assets and liabilities due to changes in foreign currency exchange rate movements differs, resulting in volatility in our net income under U.S. GAAP. For example, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments, including those arising
from foreign currency exchange rate movements, are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” or AOCI, whereas the non-yen denominated liabilities are remeasured for foreign currency exchange rate movements, and the
related changes in value are recorded in earnings within “Asset management fees and other income.”

We hold investments denominated in foreign currencies in the general account of our domestic insurance subsidiaries. We generally seek to
hedge this foreign currency exposure but there is no assurance that we will fully hedge this exposure or that such hedges will be effective. The value and liquidity of our foreign currency investments could be adversely affected by local adverse
market, economic and financial conditions. For example, our investments denominated in euro could be adversely affected by the recent unfavorable economic conditions in Europe, including due to potential changes in the euro or to the structure or
membership of the European Monetary Union.

Risks Relating to Estimates, Assumptions and Valuations

Our profitability may decline if mortality experience, longevity
experience, morbidity experience, persistency experience or utilization experience differ significantly from our pricing expectations.

We set prices for many of our insurance and annuity products based upon expected claims and payment patterns, using assumptions for
mortality rates, or likelihood of death, longevity rates, or likelihood of survival (including the effect of improvement in life expectancy trends), and morbidity rates, or likelihood of sickness or disability, of our policyholders. In addition to
the potential effect of natural or man-made disasters, significant changes in mortality, longevity, or morbidity could emerge gradually over time, due to changes in the natural environment, the health habits of the insured population, treatment
patterns and technologies for disease or disability, the economic environment, or other factors. Pricing of our insurance and deferred annuity products are also based in part upon expected persistency of these products, which is the probability that
a policy or contract will remain in force from one period to the next. Persistency within our Individual Annuities business may be significantly impacted by the value of guaranteed minimum benefits contained in many of our variable annuity



products being higher than current account values in light of poor equity market performance or extended periods of low interest rates as well as other factors. Persistency could be adversely
affected generally by developments affecting client perception of us, including perceptions arising from adverse publicity. Many of our products also provide our customers with wide flexibility with respect to the amount and timing of premium
deposits and/or the amount and timing of withdrawals from the policy’s value. Results may vary based on differences between actual and expected premium deposits and withdrawals for these products, especially if these product features are
relatively new to the marketplace. The pricing of certain of our variable annuity products that contain optional living benefit guarantees is also based on assumptions about utilization rates, or the percentage of contracts that will utilize the
benefit during the contract duration, including the timing of the first lifetime income withdrawal. Results may vary based on differences between actual and expected occurrence and timing of the benefit utilization. The development of a secondary
market for life insurance, including life settlements or “viaticals” and investor owned life insurance, and third-party investor strategies in the annuities business, could adversely affect the profitability of existing business and our
pricing assumptions for new business.

Significant
deviations in actual experience from our pricing assumptions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our products. Although some of our products permit us to increase premiums or adjust other charges and credits during the life of the
policy or contract, the adjustments permitted under the terms of the policies or contracts may not be sufficient to maintain profitability or may cause the policies or contracts to lapse. For our long-term care insurance products, our assumptions
for reserves for future policy benefits have factored in our best estimate of the timing and amount of anticipated and yet-to-be-filed premium increases which will require state approval. Our actual experience obtaining pricing increases could be
materially different than what we have assumed, resulting in further policy liability increases which could be material. Many of our products do not permit us to increase premiums or adjust other charges and credits or limit those adjustments during
the life of the policy or contract. Even if permitted under the policy or contract, we may not be able or willing to raise premiums or adjust other charges sufficiently, or at all, for regulatory or competitive reasons.

If our reserves for future policyholder benefits and claims are
inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserves, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We establish actuarially-determined reserves to pay future policyholder benefits and claims. Our reserves do not represent an exact
calculation of liability, but rather are actuarial or statistical estimates based on data and models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain and involve the exercise of significant judgment, including as to the
levels of and/or timing of receipt or payment of premiums, benefits, claims, expenses, interest credits, investment results (including equity market returns), retirement, mortality, longevity, morbidity and persistency. We cannot determine with
precision the ultimate amounts that we will pay for, or the timing of payment of, actual benefits, claims and expenses or whether the assets supporting our policy liabilities, together with future premiums, will be sufficient for payment of benefits
and claims. If we conclude that our reserves, together with future premiums, are insufficient to cover future policy benefits and claims, we would be required to increase premiums where we are able to do so or increase our reserves and incur income
statement charges, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

For certain of our products, market performance and interest rates (as well as the regulatory environment, as discussed further below) impact the level of statutory reserves and statutory capital we are
required to hold, and may have an adverse effect on returns on capital associated with these products. We finance noneconomic reserves associated with our Individual Life business. Marketplace capacity for reserve funding structures may be limited
as a result of market conditions generally. Our ability to efficiently manage capital and economic reserve levels may be impacted, thereby impacting profitability and return on capital.

We may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC, deferred sales inducements,
or DSI, or value of business acquired, or VOBA, or recognize impairment in the value of our goodwill or certain investments, or be required to establish a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets, any of which could adversely affect
our results of operations and financial condition.

Deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC, represent the costs that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance and annuity contracts, and we amortize these costs
over the expected lives of the contracts. Deferred sales inducements, or DSI, represent amounts that are credited to a policyholder’s account balance as an inducement to purchase the contract, and we amortize these costs over the expected lives



of the contracts. Value of business acquired, or VOBA, represents the present value of future profits embedded in acquired insurance, annuity and investment-type contracts and is amortized over
the expected effective lives of the acquired contracts. Management, on an ongoing basis, tests the DAC, DSI and VOBA recorded on our balance sheet to determine if these amounts are recoverable under current assumptions. In addition, we regularly
review the estimates and assumptions underlying DAC, DSI and VOBA for those products for which we amortize DAC, DSI and VOBA in proportion to gross profits or gross margins. Given changes in facts and circumstances, these tests and reviews could
lead to reductions in DAC, DSI and/or VOBA that could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations and our financial condition. Among other things, significant or sustained equity market declines as well as investment losses could result
in acceleration of amortization of the DAC, DSI and VOBA related to variable annuity and variable universal life contracts, resulting in a charge to income. As discussed earlier, the amortization of DAC, DSI and VOBA are also sensitive to changes in
interest rates.

Goodwill represents the excess of
the amounts we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is assessed annually for potential impairment, or more frequently if conditions warrant, by comparing the
carrying value (equity attributed to a business to support its risk) of a business to its estimated fair value at that date. As of December 31, 2012, we had goodwill balances related to our Retirement reporting unit, our Asset Management
reporting unit and our International Insurance reporting unit. Market declines or other events impacting the fair value of these businesses, or increases in the level of equity required to support these businesses, could result in goodwill
impairments, resulting in a charge to income.

We
have operating equity method investments within our International Insurance and Asset Management segments and Corporate and Other operations. Declines in the fair value of these investments may require that we review the remaining carrying value of
these investments for potential impairment, and such review could result in impairments and charges to income.

Deferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax
assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if they are realizable. Factors in management’s determination include the performance of the business including the geographic and legal entity source of our income, the ability to
generate capital gains from a variety of sources, and tax planning strategies. If based on available information, it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized then a valuation allowance must be established with
a corresponding charge to net income. Such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.

Changes in our discount rate, expected rate of return, life expectancy and expected compensation increase assumptions for our pension and other
postretirement benefit plans may result in increased expenses and reduce our profitability.

We determine our pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs based on assumed discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, life expectancy of plan participants and expected increases
in compensation levels and trends in health care costs. Changes in these assumptions, including from the impact of a sustained low interest rate environment, may result in increased expenses and reduce our profitability.

Our valuation of fixed maturity, equity and trading securities may include
methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.

During periods of market disruption, it may be difficult to
value certain of our investment securities, such as sub-prime mortgage-backed securities, if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be cases where certain assets in normally active markets with
significant observable data become inactive with insufficient observable data due to the current financial environment or market conditions. As a result, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater
estimation and judgment as well as valuation methods which are more complex. These values may not be ultimately realizable in a market transaction, and such values may change very rapidly as market conditions change and valuation assumptions are
modified. Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.



The decision on whether to record an other-than-temporary impairment or write-down is
determined in part by management’s assessment of the financial condition and prospects of a particular issuer, projections of future cash flows and recoverability of the particular security. Management’s conclusions on such assessments are
highly judgmental and include assumptions and projections of future cash flows which may ultimately prove to be incorrect as assumptions, facts and circumstances change.

Credit and Counterparty Risks

An inability to access our credit facilities could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

We maintain committed unsecured revolving credit facilities. We rely on these credit facilities as a potential source of liquidity which could be critical in enabling us to meet our obligations as they
come due, particularly during periods when alternative sources of liquidity are limited. Our ability to borrow under these facilities is conditioned on our satisfaction of covenants and other requirements contained in the facilities, such as
Prudential Financial’s maintenance of a prescribed minimum level of consolidated net worth calculated in accordance with the applicable credit agreement. Our failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the credit facilities
would restrict our access to the facilities when needed and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

A downgrade or potential downgrade in our financial strength or credit
ratings could limit our ability to market products, require us to post collateral, increase our borrowing costs and/or hurt our relationships with creditors, trading counterparties or reinsurers and restrict our access to alternative sources of
liquidity.

A downgrade in our financial
strength or credit ratings could potentially, among other things, limit our ability to market products, reduce our competitiveness, increase the number or value of policy surrenders and withdrawals, increase our borrowing costs and potentially make
it more difficult to borrow funds, adversely affect the availability of financial guarantees, such as letters of credit, cause additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements, allow counterparties to terminate
derivative agreements, and/or hurt our relationships with creditors, distributors, reinsurers or trading counterparties thereby potentially negatively affecting our profitability, liquidity and/or capital. In addition, we consider our own risk of
non-performance in determining the fair value of our liabilities, including insurance liabilities that are classified as embedded derivatives under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, changes in our credit or financial strength ratings may affect the fair value
of our liabilities.

A downgrade in the credit or
financial strength ratings of Prudential Financial or its rated subsidiaries could result in additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements, including derivative agreements, which are eligible to be satisfied
in cash or by posting securities held by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements. A ratings downgrade of three ratings levels from the ratings levels at December 31, 2012 (relating to financial strength ratings in certain cases and credit
ratings in other cases) would result in estimated collateral posting requirements or payments under such agreements of approximately $77 million. In addition, a ratings downgrade by A.M. Best to “A-” for our domestic life insurance
companies would require Prudential Insurance to post a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $1.7 billion, based on the level of statutory reserves related to the variable annuity business acquired from Allstate, that we estimate would
result in annual cash outflows of approximately $14 million, or collateral posting in the form of cash or securities to be held in a trust.

Prudential Insurance has been a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, or FHLBNY, since June 2008. Membership allows Prudential
Insurance access to FHLBNY’s financial services, including the ability to obtain collateralized loans, and to issue collateralized funding agreements that can be used as an alternative source of liquidity. Under FHLBNY guidelines, if Prudential
Insurance’s financial strength ratings decline below A/A2/A Stable by S&P, Moody’s and Fitch, respectively, and the FHLBNY does not receive written assurances from the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance regarding Prudential
Insurance’s



solvency, new borrowings from the FHLBNY would be limited to a term of 90 days or less. Although Prudential Insurance’s ratings are currently at or above the required minimum levels, there
can be no assurance that the ratings will remain at these levels in the future.

We cannot predict what additional actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which could adversely affect our business. As with other
companies in the financial services industry, our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without notice by any rating agency.

Losses due to defaults by others, including issuers of investment securities or reinsurance, bond insurers and derivative instrument counterparties,
downgrades in the ratings of securities we hold or of bond insurers, insolvencies of insurers in jurisdictions where we write business and other factors affecting our counterparties or the value of their securities could adversely affect the value
of our investments, the realization of amounts contractually owed to us, result in assessments or additional statutory capital requirements or reduce our profitability or sources of liquidity.

Issuers and borrowers whose securities or loans we hold,
customers, vendors, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts, reinsurers, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries and guarantors, including bond insurers, may default on
their obligations to us or be unable to perform service functions that are significant to our business due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud or other reasons. Such defaults, could
have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. A downgrade in the ratings of bond insurers could also result in declines in the value of our fixed maturity investments supported by guarantees from bond insurers.

In addition, we use derivative instruments to
hedge various risks, including certain guaranteed minimum benefits contained in many of our variable annuity products. We enter into a variety of derivative instruments, including options, forwards, interest rate, credit default and currency swaps
with a number of counterparties. Amounts that we expect to collect under current and future contracts, including, but not limited to reinsurance contracts, are subject to counterparty risk. Our obligations under our products are not changed by our
hedging activities and we are liable for our obligations even if our derivative counterparties, including reinsurers, do not pay us. Such defaults could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Under state insurance guaranty association laws and similar
laws in international jurisdictions, we are subject to assessments, based on the share of business we write in the relevant jurisdiction, for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants.

We use reinsurance as part of our capital management with
respect to our Closed Block Business. Ratings downgrades or financial difficulties of reinsurers may require us to utilize additional capital with respect to the business.

Certain Product Related Risks

Guarantees within certain of our products that protect policyholders may
decrease our earnings or increase the volatility of our results of operations or financial position under U.S. GAAP if our hedging or risk management strategies prove ineffective or insufficient.

Certain of our products, particularly our variable annuity
products, include guarantees of income streams for stated periods or for life. Downturns in equity markets, increased equity volatility, or (as discussed above) reduced interest rates could result in an increase in the valuation of liabilities
associated with such products, resulting in increases in reserves and reductions in net income. We use a variety of hedging and risk management strategies, including product features, to mitigate these risks in part. These strategies may, however,
not be fully effective. We may also choose not to fully hedge these risks. Hedging instruments may not effectively offset the costs of guarantees or may otherwise be insufficient in relation to our obligations. Hedging instruments also may



not change in value correspondingly with associated liabilities due to equity market or interest rate conditions or other reasons. We sometimes choose to hedge these risks on a basis that does
not correspond to their anticipated or actual impact upon our results of operations or financial position under U.S. GAAP. Changes from period to period in the valuation of these policy benefits, and in the amount of our obligations effectively
hedged, will result in volatility in our results of operations and financial position under U.S. GAAP. Estimates and assumptions we make in connection with hedging activities may fail to reflect or correspond to our actual long-term exposure in
respect of our guarantees. Further, the risk of increases in the costs of our guarantees not covered by our hedging and other capital and risk management strategies may become more significant due to changes in policyholder behavior driven by market
conditions or other factors. The above factors, individually or collectively, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

We may not be able to mitigate the reserve strain associated with
Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX, potentially resulting in a negative impact on our capital position or in a need to increase prices and/or reduce sales of term or universal life products.

The states of domicile of our domestic insurance
subsidiaries have in place a regulation entitled “Valuation of Life Insurance Policies,” commonly known as “Regulation XXX,” and a supporting Guideline entitled “The Application of the Valuation of Life Insurance
Policies,” commonly known as “Guideline AXXX.” The Regulation and supporting Guideline require insurers to establish statutory reserves for term and universal life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees that are
consistent with the statutory reserves required for other individual life insurance policies with similar guarantees. Many market participants believe that this level of reserves is excessive, and we have implemented reinsurance and capital
management actions to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX on our term and universal life insurance business. As we continue to underwrite term and universal life business, we expect to have borrowing needs to finance statutory
reserves required under Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX. However, if we are unsuccessful in obtaining additional financing as a result of market conditions or otherwise, this could require us to increase prices and or/reduce our sales of term or
universal life products and/or have a negative impact on our capital position.

We may experience difficulty in marketing and distributing products through our current and future distribution channels.

Although we distribute our products through a wide variety
of distribution channels, we do maintain relationships with certain key distributors. For example, a significant amount of our sales in Japan through banks is derived through a single major Japanese bank and a significant portion of our sales in
Japan through Life Consultants is derived through a single association relationship. We periodically negotiate the terms of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. An
interruption in certain key relationships could materially affect our ability to market our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Distributors may elect to reduce or terminate
their distribution relationships with us, including for such reasons as adverse developments in our business, adverse rating agency actions or concerns about market-related risks. We are also at risk that key distribution partners may merge, change
their business models in ways that affect how our products are sold, or terminate their distribution contracts with us, or that new distribution channels could emerge and adversely impact the effectiveness of our distribution efforts. An increase in
bank and broker-dealer consolidation activity could increase competition for access to distributors, result in greater distribution expenses and impair our ability to market products through these channels. Consolidation of distributors and/or other
industry changes may also increase the likelihood that distributors will try to renegotiate the terms of any existing selling agreements to terms less favorable to us.

When our products are distributed through unaffiliated firms,
we may not be able to monitor or control the manner of their distribution despite our training and compliance programs. If our products are distributed by such firms in an inappropriate manner, or to customers for whom they are unsuitable, we may
suffer reputational and other harm to our business.



Regulatory and Legal Risks

Our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability.

Our businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and
supervision. The purpose of this regulation is primarily to protect our customers and not necessarily our shareholders. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject, including those to which our international businesses are subject, are
regularly re-examined, and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations. The financial market dislocations we have experienced have produced, and are expected to continue to
produce, extensive changes in existing laws and regulations, and regulatory frameworks, applicable to our businesses in the U.S. and internationally.

Prudential Financial is subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE relating to public reporting and disclosure,
securities trading, accounting and financial reporting, and corporate governance matters. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules and regulations adopted in furtherance of that Act have substantially increased the requirements in these and other
areas for public companies such as Prudential Financial. Our internal controls over financial reporting may have gaps or other deficiencies and there is no assurance that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls may not
occur in the future. Any such gaps or deficiencies may require significant resources to remediate and may also expose the Company to litigation, regulatory fines or penalties or other losses.

Many insurance regulatory and other governmental or self-regulatory bodies have the authority to review our
products and business practices and those of our agents and employees and to bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our agents or employees, are improper. These actions can result in
substantial fines, penalties or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations or financial condition.

Congress from time to time enacts pension reform legislation that could decrease or increase the attractiveness
of certain of our retirement products and services to retirement plan sponsors and administrators, or have an unfavorable or favorable effect on our ability to earn revenues from these products and services. Over time, these changes could hinder our
sales of defined benefit pension products and services and cause sponsors to discontinue existing plans for which we provide asset management, administrative, or other services.

Insurance regulators have implemented changes in the way in
which companies must determine statutory reserves for variable annuities and products with similar guarantees as of the end of 2009. Insurance regulators continue to proceed to develop a principles based reserving approach for life insurance
products. The timing and the effect of these changes are still uncertain.

Insurance regulators are reviewing life insurers’ use of captive reinsurance companies. We cannot predict what, if any, changes may result from this review. If applicable insurance laws are changed
in a way that impairs the use of captive reinsurance companies, our financial results and liquidity and capital position may be adversely affected. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Captive Reinsurance Companies” for information on our use of captive reinsurance companies.

The NAIC is reviewing life insurers’ use of separate accounts that are insulated (where assets of the separate account equal to the
reserves and other contract liabilities with respect to the account may not be charged with liabilities arising out of any other business of the company) for products that are not variable, which might lead to a recommendation against the allowance
of insulation for certain products. We cannot predict what, if any, changes may result from this review and possible recommendations. If applicable insurance laws are changed in a way that impairs the use of insulation for certain contracts, our
ability to compete effectively in certain markets may be adversely affected. In addition, our financial results and liquidity and capital position may also be adversely affected.

The failure of Prudential Insurance and our other domestic
insurance subsidiaries to meet applicable Risk Based Capital, or RBC, requirements or minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements could subject those subsidiaries to further examination or corrective action by state insurance regulators. The
failure to maintain the



RBC ratios of Prudential Insurance and our other domestic insurance subsidiaries at desired levels could also adversely impact our competitive position, including as a result of downgrades to our
financial strength ratings. Our international insurance companies are subject to conceptually similar measures of capital adequacy, including solvency margin ratios for our Japanese insurance companies, and we face similar risks as those described
for our domestic companies in the event that we are unable to maintain these measures at adequate levels. Further, adverse financial performance in the Closed Block Business in Prudential Insurance, including adverse investment performance, may
adversely affect Prudential Insurance’s RBC ratios, although dividends to Closed Block policyholders may be subsequently adjusted to reflect such performance.

Currently, there are several proposals to amend state
insurance holding company laws to increase the scope of the regulation of insurance holding companies (such as Prudential Financial). These proposals include imposing standards for insurer corporate governance, risk management, group-wide
supervision of insurance holding companies, adjustments to risk-based capital calculations to account for group-wide risks, and additional regulatory and disclosure requirements for insurance holding companies. In addition, state insurance
regulators have focused attention on U.S. insurance solvency regulation pursuant to the NAIC’s “Solvency Modernization Initiative”, including regulatory review of companies’ risk management practices and analyses. At this time,
we cannot predict with any degree of certainty what additional capital requirements, compliance costs or other burdens these requirements may impose on Prudential Financial.

Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time
consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance and other expenses of doing business, thus having a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results
of operations.

See
“Business—Regulation” for discussion of regulation of our businesses.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act has and will subject us to substantial additional federal regulation and we cannot predict the effect on our business, results of
operations, cash flows or financial condition.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”), subjects us to substantial federal regulation.
Dodd-Frank directs existing and newly-created government agencies and bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law, a process that is underway and expected to continue over the next few years. We cannot predict with any certainty the
requirements of the regulations recently or not yet adopted or how Dodd-Frank and such regulations will affect the financial markets generally, impact our business, credit or financial strength ratings, results of operations, cash flows or financial
condition or advise or require us to hold or raise additional capital. Key aspects of Dodd-Frank’s impact on us include:

•

On October 19, 2012, we received notice that we are under consideration by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“Council”) for a
proposed determination that Prudential Financial should be subject to stricter prudential regulatory standards and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”) pursuant to Dodd-Frank as a “Designated
Financial Company.” We cannot predict whether Prudential Financial will be designated as a Designated Financial Company. If so designated, we would become subject to stricter prudential standards, including stricter requirements and limitations
relating to risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity and credit exposure, and a requirement to maintain a plan for rapid and orderly dissolution in the event of severe financial distress. Failure to meet defined measures of financial condition could
result in substantial restrictions on our business and capital distributions. We would also become subject to stress tests to be promulgated by the FRB which could cause us to alter our business practices or affect the perceptions of regulators,
rating agencies, customers, counterparties or investors of our financial strength.

•

If designated, we could also be subject, pursuant to future FRB rulemaking, to additional capital requirements for, and quantitative limits on,
proprietary trading and sponsorship of, and investment in, hedge, private equity and other covered funds.

•

The Council could recommend new or heightened standards and safeguards for activities or practices we and other financial services companies engage in.
We cannot predict whether any such recommendations will be made or their effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.



•

Dodd-Frank creates a new framework for regulation of the over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives markets which could impact various activities
of Prudential Global Funding (“PGF”), Prudential Financial and our insurance subsidiaries, which use derivatives for various purposes (including hedging interest rate, foreign currency and equity market exposures). Final regulations
adopted could substantially increase the cost of hedging and related operations, affect the profitability of our products or their attractiveness to our clients or cause us to alter our hedging strategy or implementation thereof or increase and/or
change the composition of the risks we do not hedge.

•

Title II of Dodd-Frank provides that a financial company such as Prudential Financial may be subject to a special orderly liquidation process outside
the federal bankruptcy code, administered by the FDIC as receiver, upon a determination that the company is in default or in danger of default and presents a systemic risk to U.S. financial stability. We cannot predict how creditors of Prudential
Financial or its insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries, including the holders of Prudential Financial debt, will evaluate this potential or whether it will impact our financing or hedging costs.

See “Business—Regulation” for further
discussion of the impact of Dodd-Frank on our businesses.

Foreign governmental actions could subject us to substantial additional regulation.

In addition to the adoption of Dodd-Frank in the United States, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), consisting
of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations, and the G20 have issued a series of proposals intended to produce significant changes in how financial companies, particularly companies that are members of large and complex
financial groups, should be regulated. The lawmakers and regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions in which we do business have already begun introducing legislative and regulatory changes consistent with G20 and FSB recommendations,
including proposals governing consolidated regulation of insurance holdings companies by the Financial Services Agency (FSA) in Japan, proposals governing executive compensation by the financial regulators in Germany (BaFIN) and the United Kingdom.
In addition, the prudential regulation of insurance and reinsurance companies across the European Economic Area (EEA) is due for significant change under the Solvency II Directive, which was adopted on November 25, 2009 and could come into
force as early as January 2014. This new regime will effect a full revision of the insurance industry’s solvency framework and prudential regime and may have significant implications for non-European insurance groups, like ourselves, that have
established insurance undertakings within the EEA. Additionally, the IAIS is currently evaluating whether certain insurance groups, such as Prudential Financial, should be designated as global systemically important insurers or GSIIs. Insurance
groups designated as GSIIs will be subject to enhanced group supervision, higher capital requirements and enhanced resolution regimes.

We cannot predict with any certainty the effect these initiatives may have on the financial markets or on our business, results of
operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Adverse market, economic and financial conditions in Europe have given rise to a perceived risk of defaults on the government securities
of certain European countries and potentially by financial institutions with significant direct or indirect exposure to such government securities. Further regulatory initiatives may develop in response to these conditions and related political and
economic events such as possible changes in the euro or to the structure or membership of the European Monetary Union.

Changes in accounting requirements could negatively impact our reported results of operations and our reported financial position.

Accounting standards are continuously evolving and subject
to change. For example, consideration has been given to requiring companies like Prudential Financial to report financial results in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board rather than U.S. GAAP. Regardless of whether the SEC requires IFRS, U.S. GAAP may undergo extensive changes as a result of current standard setting initiatives of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. These and other
changes in accounting standards may impose special demands on issuers in areas such as corporate governance, internal controls and disclosure. Changes in accounting standards, or their interpretation, may negatively affect our reported results of
operations and our reported financial condition.



Changes in U.S. federal income tax law or in the income tax laws of other jurisdictions in which we
operate could make some of our products less attractive to consumers and increase our tax costs.

There is uncertainty regarding U.S. taxes both for individuals and corporations. Discussions in Washington continue concerning the need to
reform the tax code, primarily by lowering the tax rates and broadening the base by reducing or eliminating certain tax expenditures. Reducing or eliminating certain tax expenditures could make our products less attractive to customers. It is
unclear whether or when Congress may take up overall tax reform and what would be the impact of reform on the Company and its products.

However even in the absence of overall tax reform, the large federal deficit, as well as the budget constraints faced by many states and
localities, increases the likelihood that Congress and state and local governments will raise revenue by enacting legislation increasing the taxes paid by individuals and corporations. This can be accomplished either by raising rates or otherwise
changing the tax rules.

Congress from time to
time considers legislation that could make our products less attractive to consumers. Current U.S. federal income tax laws generally permit certain holders to defer taxation on the build-up of value of annuities and life insurance products until
payments are actually made to the policyholder or other beneficiary and to exclude from taxation the death benefit paid under a life insurance contract. While higher tax rates increase the benefits of tax deferral on the build-up of value of
annuities and life insurance, making our products more attractive to consumers, legislation that reduces or eliminates deferral would have a potential negative effect on our products. In addition, changes in the tax rules that result in higher
corporate taxes will increase the Company’s actual tax expense, thereby reducing earnings.

Congress, as well as state and local governments, also considers from time to time legislation that could increase the amount of corporate taxes we pay, thereby reducing earnings. For example, changes in
the law relating to tax reserving methodologies for term life or universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees or other products could result in higher current taxes.

The Obama Administration’s Revenue Proposals include
proposals which, if enacted, would affect the taxation of life insurance companies and certain life insurance products. In particular, the proposals would affect the treatment of corporate owned life insurance policies, or COLI, by limiting the
availability of certain interest deductions for companies that purchase those policies. The proposals would also change the method used to determine the amount of dividend income received by a life insurance company on assets held in separate
accounts used to support products, including variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts that is eligible for the dividends received deduction, or DRD. The DRD reduces the amount of dividend income subject to tax and is a significant
component of the difference between our actual tax expense and the expected tax amount determined using the federal statutory tax rate of 35%. If proposals of this type were enacted, the Company’s sale of COLI, variable annuities, and variable
life insurance products could be adversely affected and the Company’s actual tax expense could increase, thereby reducing earnings.

The Administration’s Revenue Proposals also include changes to the method by which U.S. multinational corporations claim foreign tax
credits and the timing of the deduction for interest expense that is allocable to foreign-source income. If proposals of this type were enacted, the Company’s actual tax expense could increase, thereby reducing earnings.

The products we sell have different tax characteristics, in
some cases generating tax deductions. The level of profitability of certain of our products is significantly dependent on these characteristics and our ability to continue to generate taxable income, which is taken into consideration when pricing
products and is a component of our capital management strategies. Accordingly, changes in tax law, our ability to generate taxable income, or other factors impacting the availability or value of the tax characteristics generated by our products,
could impact product pricing and returns or require us to reduce our sales of these products or implement other actions that could be disruptive to our businesses. In addition, the adoption of “principles based” approaches for statutory
reserves may lead to significant changes to the way tax reserves are determined and thus reduce future tax deductions.



Our ability to meet obligations, pay shareholder dividends, and to engage in share repurchases may be
adversely affected by limitations imposed on dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries.

Prudential Financial is the holding company for all our operations, and dividends, returns of capital and interest income from its
subsidiaries are the principal source of funds available to Prudential Financial to pay shareholder dividends, to make share repurchases and to meet its other obligations. These sources of funds may be complemented by Prudential Financial’s
access, if available, to the capital markets and bank facilities. As described under “Business—Regulation” and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, our domestic and foreign insurance and various other subsidiary
companies, are subject to regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends and on other transfers of funds to Prudential Financial. In addition to these regulatory limitations, the terms of the IHC debt contain restrictions potentially limiting
dividends by Prudential Insurance applicable to the Financial Services Businesses in the event the Closed Block Business is in financial distress and under other circumstances. Finally, our management of our subsidiaries to have capitalization
consistent with their ratings objectives itself may constrain their payment of dividends. These restrictions on Prudential Financial’s subsidiaries may limit or prevent such subsidiaries from making dividend payments to Prudential Financial in
an amount sufficient to fund Prudential Financial’s obligations, shareholder dividends and share repurchases. From time to time, the NAIC and various state and foreign insurance regulators have considered, and may in the future consider,
proposals to further limit dividend payments that an insurance company may make without regulatory approval.

Legal and regulatory actions are inherent in our businesses and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial position or harm our businesses or reputation.

We are, and in the future may be, subject to legal and
regulatory actions in the ordinary course of our businesses, including in businesses that we have divested or placed in wind-down status. Some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants. In certain of
these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. Legal liability or adverse publicity in respect of these or future legal or regulatory actions could have an adverse affect on us
or cause us reputational harm, which in turn could harm our business prospects.

Material pending litigation and regulatory matters affecting us, and certain risks to our businesses presented by such matters, are discussed under “Commitments and Guarantees, Contingent Liabilities
and Litigation and Regulatory Matters” in the Note 23 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our litigation and regulatory matters are subject to many uncertainties, and given their complexity and scope, their outcome cannot be predicted. Our
reserves for litigation and regulatory matters may prove to be inadequate. It is possible that our results of operations or cash flow in a particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of
pending litigation and regulatory matters depending, in part, upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period. In light of the unpredictability of the Company’s litigation and regulatory matters, it is also possible that in certain
cases an ultimate unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or regulatory matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position.

We may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject
to infringement claims.

We rely on a
combination of contractual rights with third parties and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. Although we endeavor to protect our rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate
our intellectual property. We may have to litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability. This would represent a diversion of resources that may
be significant and our efforts may not prove successful. The inability to secure or protect our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete.

We may be subject to claims by third parties for
(i) patent, trademark or copyright infringement, (ii) breach of copyright, trademark or license usage rights, or (iii) misappropriation of trade secrets. Any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant expense
and liability for damages. If we were found to have infringed or misappropriated a third-party patent or other intellectual property right, we could in some circumstances be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or
from utilizing and



benefiting from certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses. Alternatively, we could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties
or implement a costly work around. Any of these scenarios could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Operational Risks

Our risk management policies and procedures and our minority investments in joint ventures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk,
which could adversely affect our businesses or result in losses.

Our policies, procedures and controls to monitor and manage risks, including hedging programs that utilize derivative financial instruments, may not be fully effective in achieving their purposes and may
leave us exposed to unidentified and unanticipated risks. The Company uses models in its hedging programs and many other aspects of its operations, including but not limited to the estimation of actuarial reserves, the amortization of DAC and VOBA,
and the valuation of certain other assets and liabilities. These models rely on assumptions and projections that are inherently uncertain. Management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies, procedures and
controls to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies, procedures and controls may not be fully effective.

Past or future misconduct by our employees or employees of our vendors could result in violations of law by us, regulatory sanctions
and/or serious reputational or financial harm and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Although we employ controls and procedures designed to monitor associates’ business decisions and
prevent us from taking excessive or inappropriate risks, there can be no assurance that these controls and procedures are or may be effective. We review our compensation policies and practices as part of our overall risk management program, but it
is possible that our compensation policies and practices could inadvertently incentivize excessive or inappropriate risk taking. If our associates take excessive or inappropriate risks, those risks could harm our reputation and have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

In our investments in which we hold a minority interest, or that are managed by third parties, we lack management and operational control over operations, which may prevent us from taking or causing to be
taken actions to protect or increase the value of those investments. In those jurisdictions where we are constrained by law from owning a majority interest in jointly owned operations, our remedies in the event of a breach by a joint venture partner
may be limited (e.g., we may have no ability to exercise a “call” option).

Interruption in telecommunication, information technology and other operational systems, or a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems,
could harm our business.

We depend heavily
on our telecommunication, information technology and other operational systems and on the integrity and timeliness of data we use to run our businesses and service our customers. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a
result of events or circumstances wholly or partly beyond our control. Further, we face the risk of operational and technology failures by others, including clearing agents, exchanges and other financial intermediaries and of vendors and parties to
which we outsource the provision of services or business operations. If these parties do not perform as anticipated, we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and other adverse effects on our business. These risks are heightened by
our offering of increasingly complex products, such as those that feature automatic asset transfer or re-allocation strategies, and by our employment of complex investment, trading and hedging programs.

Despite our implementation of a variety of security measures,
our information technology and other systems could be subject to physical or electronic break-ins, unauthorized tampering or other security breaches, resulting in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data,
including personal information relating to customers, or in the misappropriation of our intellectual property or proprietary information.



Interruption in telecommunication, information technology and other operational systems, or
a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems, whether due to actions by us or others, could delay or disrupt our ability to do business and service our customers, harm our reputation,
subject us to regulatory sanctions and other claims, lead to a loss of customers and revenues and otherwise adversely affect our business.

We face risks arising from acquisitions, divestitures and restructurings, including client losses, surrenders and withdrawals, difficulties in
integrating and realizing the projected results of acquisitions and contingent liabilities with respect to dispositions.

We face a number of risks arising from acquisition transactions, including the risk that, following the acquisition or reorganization of a
business, we could experience client losses, surrenders or withdrawals or other results materially different from those we anticipate, as well as difficulties in integrating and realizing the projected results of acquisitions and restructurings and
managing the litigation and regulatory matters to which acquired entities are party. We have retained insurance or reinsurance obligations and other contingent liabilities in connection with our divestiture or winding down of various businesses, and
our reserves for these obligations and liabilities may prove to be inadequate. These risks may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.

Other Risks

The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters could adversely affect our
operations, results of operations and financial condition.

The occurrence of natural disasters, including hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, fires, explosions, pandemic disease and man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism and military
actions, could adversely affect our operations, results of operations or financial condition, including in the following respects:

•

Catastrophic loss of life due to natural or man-made disasters could cause us to pay benefits at higher levels and/or materially earlier than
anticipated and could lead to unexpected changes in persistency rates.

•

A natural or man-made disaster could result in disruptions in our operations, losses in our investment portfolio or the failure of our counterparties
to perform, or cause significant volatility in global financial markets.

•

A terrorist attack affecting financial institutions in the United States or elsewhere could negatively impact the financial services industry in
general and our business operations, investment portfolio and profitability in particular.

•

Pandemic disease, caused by a virus such as H5N1, the “avian flu” virus, or H1N1, the “swine flu” virus, could have a severe
adverse effect on Prudential Financial’s business. The potential impact of such a pandemic on Prudential Financial’s results of operations and financial position is highly speculative, and would depend on numerous factors, including: the
effectiveness of vaccines and the rate of contagion; the regions of the world most affected; the effectiveness of treatment for the infected population; the rates of mortality and morbidity among various segments of the insured population; the
collectability of reinsurance; the possible macroeconomic effects of a pandemic on the Company’s asset portfolio; the effect on lapses and surrenders of existing policies, as well as sales of new policies; and many other variables.

There can be no assurance that
our business continuation plans and insurance coverages would be effective in mitigating any negative effects on our operations or profitability in the event of a terrorist attack or other disaster.

Climate change, and its regulation, may affect the prospects
of companies and other entities whose securities we hold and other counterparties, including reinsurers, and affect the value of investments, including real estate investments we hold or manage for others. Our current evaluation is that the near
term effects of climate change and climate change regulation on the Company are not material, but we cannot predict the long term impacts on us from climate change or its regulation.



We have substantial international operations and our international operations face political, legal,
operational and other risks that could adversely affect those operations or our profitability.

A substantial portion of our revenues and income from continuing operations is derived from our operations outside the U.S., primarily Japan and Korea. These operations are subject to restrictions on
transferring funds out of the countries in which they are located. Some of our foreign insurance and investment management operations are, and are likely to continue to be, in emerging markets where this risk, as well as risks of discriminatory
regulation, labor issues in connection with workers’ associations and trade unions, price controls, currency exchange controls, nationalization or expropriation of assets, are heightened. If our business model is not successful in a particular
country, we may lose all or most of our investment in building and training our sales force in that country.

Many of our insurance products sold in international markets, including Japan, provide for the buildup of cash values for the policyholder
at contractually fixed guaranteed interest rates. Actual returns on the underlying investments may not necessarily support the guaranteed interest rates and there may be times when the spread between the actual investment returns and these
guaranteed rates of return to the policyholder is negative and in which this negative spread may not be offset by the mortality, morbidity and expense charges we earn on the products.

Our international businesses are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the countries in which they are
organized and in which they operate. Foreign governments from time to time consider legislation that could increase the amount of taxes that we pay or impact the sales of our products. Such changes could result in a decrease in sales of our products
or in our profits.

Our international operations
are regulated in the jurisdictions in which they are located or operate. These regulations may apply heightened scrutiny to non-domestic companies, which can reduce our flexibility as to intercompany transactions, investments and other aspects of
business operations and adversely affect our liquidity, profitability, and regulatory capital.

Intense competition, including the impact of government sponsored programs and other actions on us and our competitors, could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share or
profitability.

In each of our businesses we
face intense competition from domestic and foreign insurance companies, asset managers and diversified financial institutions, both for the ultimate customers for our products and, in many businesses, for distribution through non-affiliated
distribution channels. We compete based on a number of factors including brand recognition, reputation, quality of service, quality of investment advice, investment performance of our products, product features, scope of distribution and
distribution arrangements, price, perceived financial strength and credit and financial strength ratings. A decline in our competitive position as to one or more of these factors could adversely affect our profitability and assets under management.
Many of our competitors are large and well-established and some have greater market share or breadth of distribution, offer a broader range of products, services or features, assume a greater level of risk, have lower profitability expectations or
have higher financial strength or credit ratings than we do. The proliferation and growth of non-affiliated distribution channels puts pressure on our captive sales channels to increase their productivity and reduce their costs in order to remain
competitive, and we run the risk that the marketplace will make a more significant or rapid shift to non-affiliated or direct distribution alternatives than we anticipate or are able to achieve ourselves, potentially adversely affecting our market
share and results of operations. In certain international markets in which we operate, we face competition from government owned entities that benefit from pricing or other competitive advantages. The competitive landscape in which we operate may be
further affected by government sponsored programs, as well as by longer term fiscal policies, adopted in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. in response to dislocations in financial markets and the economy. Competitors that receive governmental
financing or other assistance or subsidies, including governmental guarantees of their obligations, or that are not subject to the same regulatory constraints, may have or obtain pricing or other competitive advantages. Changes in laws and
regulations in response to adverse market and economic conditions may result in us being classified differently than competitors for purposes of capital and other requirements, potentially affecting our ability to compete and the competitive
landscape generally.



Competition for personnel in all of our businesses is intense, including for executive
officers and management personnel, Prudential Agents, Life Planners, Life Consultants and other sales personnel, and our investment managers. We devote significant efforts to talent management and development and are subject to the risk that
executive, management and other personnel will be hired or recruited by competitors. Competition for desirable non-affiliated distribution channels is also intense. The loss of key personnel or non-affiliated distribution channels could have an
adverse effect on our business and profitability.

Regulatory
requirements could delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider in their best interests.

Various states in which our insurance companies are domiciled, including New Jersey, must approve any direct or indirect change of control
of insurance companies organized in those states. The U.S. federal securities laws could also require reapproval by customers of our investment advisory contracts to manage mutual funds, including mutual funds included in annuity products, upon a
change in control. In addition, the New Jersey Business Corporation Act prohibits certain business combinations with interested shareholders. These regulatory and other restrictions may delay a potential merger or sale of Prudential Financial, even
if the Board of Directors decides that it is in the best interests of shareholders to merge or be sold.

Holders of our Common Stock are subject to risks due to the issuance of our Class B Stock, a second class of common stock.

The businesses of Prudential Financial are separated into
the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, and our Common Stock reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Class B Stock reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business. There are a number of
risks to holders of our Common Stock by virtue of this dual common stock structure, including:

•

Even though we allocate all our consolidated assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flow between the Financial Services Businesses and the
Closed Block Business for financial statement purposes, there is no legal separation between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. Holders of Common Stock have no interest in a separate legal entity representing the
Financial Services Businesses; holders of the Class B Stock have no interest in a separate legal entity representing the Closed Block Business; and therefore holders of each class of common stock are subject to all of the risks associated with an
investment in the Company.

•

The financial results of the Closed Block Business, including debt service on the IHC debt, will affect Prudential Financial’s consolidated
results of operations, financial position and borrowing costs.

•

The market value of our Common Stock may not reflect solely the performance of the Financial Services Businesses.

•

We cannot pay cash dividends on our Common Stock for any period if we choose not to pay dividends on the Class B Stock in an aggregate amount at least
equal to the lesser of the CB Distributable Cash Flow or the Target Dividend Amount on the Class B Stock for that period. See “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity
Securities” for the definition of these terms. Any net losses of the Closed Block Business, and any dividends or distributions on, or repurchases of the Class B Stock, would reduce the assets of Prudential Financial legally available for
dividends on the Common Stock.

•

Holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock vote together as a single class of common stock under New Jersey law, except as otherwise required
by law and except that the holders of the Class B Stock have class voting or consent rights with respect to specified matters directly affecting the Class B Stock.

•

Shares of Class B Stock are entitled to a higher proportionate amount upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Prudential Financial than
shares of Common Stock.

•

We may exchange the Class B Stock for shares of Common Stock at any time, and the Class B Stock is mandatorily exchangeable in the event of a sale of
all or substantially all of the Closed Block Business or a “change of control” of Prudential Financial, as discussed under “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity
Securities.”



Our Board of Directors has adopted certain policies regarding inter-business transfers and
accounting and tax matters, including the allocation of earnings, with respect to the Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business. Although the Board of Directors may change any of these policies, any such decision is subject to the
Board of Directors’ general fiduciary duties, and we have agreed with investors in the Class B Stock and the insurer of the IHC debt that, in most cases, the Board of Directors may not change these policies without their consent.

ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

General

Prudential Financial’s Common Stock was issued to
eligible policyholders in Prudential Insurance’s demutualization and sold to investors in Prudential Financial’s initial public offering. The Common Stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “PRU” on
December 13, 2001. The following table presents the high and low closing prices for the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange during the periods indicated and the dividends declared per share during such periods:

On January 31, 2013,
there were 1,742,501 registered holders of record for the Common Stock and 463 million shares outstanding.

The Class B Stock was issued to institutional investors (two subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. and Pacific Life Corp.) in
a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 on the date of demutualization. There is no established public trading market for the Class B Stock. During the fourth quarter of 2012 and 2011, Prudential Financial
paid an annual dividend of $9.625 per share of Class B Stock. On January 31, 2013, there were three holders of record for the Class B Stock and 2 million shares outstanding.

Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors currently intends to continue to declare and pay dividends on
the Common Stock and Class B Stock. Beginning in the first quarter of 2013, Prudential Financial will move to a quarterly Common Stock dividend schedule. Future dividend decisions will be based on, and affected by, a number of factors including the
financial performance of the Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business; our overall financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements and future prospects; regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by Prudential
Financial’s subsidiaries; and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant. Dividends payable by Prudential Financial are limited to the amount that would be legally available for payment under New Jersey corporate law. For
additional information on dividends and related regulatory restrictions, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

For additional information about our exchangeable surplus notes see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

See Item 12 for information about our equity
compensation plans.

Common Stock and Class B
Stock

The Common Stock and the Class B Stock
are separate classes of common stock under New Jersey corporate law.



Holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock will be entitled to dividends if and when declared
by Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors out of funds legally available to pay those dividends. To the extent dividends are paid on the Class B Stock, shares of Class B Stock are repurchased or the Closed Block Business has net losses, the
amount legally available for dividends on the Common Stock will be reduced. In addition, payment of dividends will be subject to the following additional conditions:

•

Common Stock will be entitled to receive dividends, if and when declared by Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors, only out of assets of the
Financial Services Businesses legally available for the payment of dividends under the New Jersey Business Corporation Act as if the Financial Services Businesses were a separate New Jersey corporation; and

•

Class B Stock will be entitled to receive dividends, if and when declared by Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors, only out of assets of the
Closed Block Business legally available for the payment of dividends under the New Jersey Business Corporation Act, as if the Closed Block Business were a separate New Jersey corporation.

Dividends declared and paid on the Common Stock will depend
upon the financial performance of the Financial Services Businesses. Dividends declared and paid on the Class B Stock will depend upon the financial performance of the Closed Block Business and, as the Closed Block matures, the holders of the Class
B Stock will receive the surplus of the Closed Block Business no longer required to support the Closed Block for regulatory purposes. Dividends on the Class B Stock will be payable in an aggregate amount per year at least equal to the lesser of
(1) a “Target Dividend Amount” of $19.25 million or (2) the “CB Distributable Cash Flow,” as defined below, for such year, which is a measure of the net cash flows of the Closed Block Business. Notwithstanding this
formula, as with any common stock, we retain the flexibility to suspend dividends on the Class B Stock; however, if CB Distributable Cash Flow exists for any period and Prudential Financial chooses not to pay dividends on the Class B Stock in an
aggregate amount at least equal to the lesser of the CB Distributable Cash Flow or the Target Dividend Amount for that period, then cash dividends cannot be paid on the Common Stock with respect to such period. The principal component of “CB
Distributable Cash Flow” will be the amount by which Surplus and Related Assets, determined according to statutory accounting principles, exceed surplus that would be required for the Closed Block Business considered as a separate insurer;
provided, however, that “CB Distributable Cash Flow” counts such excess only to the extent distributable as a dividend by Prudential Insurance under specified, but not all, provisions of New Jersey insurance law. Subject to the discretion
of the Board of Directors of Prudential Financial, we currently anticipate paying dividends on the Class B Stock at the Target Dividend Amount for the foreseeable future.

“CB Distributable Cash Flow” means, for any
quarterly or annual period, the sum of (i) the excess of (a) the Surplus and Related Assets over (b) the “Required Surplus” applicable to the Closed Block Business within Prudential Insurance, to the extent that Prudential
Insurance is able to distribute such excess as a dividend to Prudential Holdings, LLC (“PHLLC”) under New Jersey law without giving effect, directly or indirectly, to the “earned surplus” requirement of Section 17:27A-4c.(3)
of the New Jersey Insurance Holding Company Systems Law, plus (ii) any amount held by PHLLC allocated to the Closed Block Business in excess of remaining debt service payments on the IHC debt. For purposes of the foregoing, “Required
Surplus” means the amount of surplus applicable to the Closed Block Business within Prudential Insurance that would be required to maintain a quotient (expressed as a percentage) of (i) the “Total Adjusted Capital” applicable to
the Closed Block Business within Prudential Insurance (including any applicable dividend reserves) divided by (ii) the “Company Action Level RBC” applicable to the Closed Block Business within Prudential Insurance, equal to 100%,
where “Total Adjusted Capital” and “Company Action Level RBC” are as defined in the regulations promulgated under the New Jersey Dynamic Capital and Surplus Act of 1993. These amounts are determined according to statutory
accounting principles.

The shares of Common Stock
will vote together with the shares of Class B Stock on all matters (one share, one vote) except as otherwise required by law and except that holders of the Class B Stock will have class voting or consent rights with respect to specified matters
directly affecting the Class B Stock.

Prudential
Financial may, at its option, at any time, exchange all outstanding shares of Class B Stock into such number of shares of Common Stock as have an aggregate average market value equal to 120% of the appraised fair market value of the outstanding
shares of Class B Stock. Holders of Class B Stock may exchange



their shares of Class B Stock into such number of shares of Common Stock as have an aggregate average market value equal to 100% of the appraised fair market value of the outstanding shares of
Class B Stock (1) in the holder’s sole discretion, in the year 2016 or at any time thereafter, and (2) at any time in the event of certain federal income tax or regulatory events. If Prudential Financial sells or otherwise disposes of
all or substantially all of the Closed Block Business or a change of control of Prudential Financial occurs, Prudential Financial must exchange all outstanding shares of Class B Stock into such number of shares of Common Stock as have an aggregate
average market value of 120% of the appraised fair market value of such shares of Class B Stock. For further information on the exchange provisions of the Class B Stock, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of Prudential Financial included as Exhibit 3.1 to this report, and the “Description of Capital Stock” contained in the Registration Statement included as Exhibit 2.1 to this report.

Any exchange of Class B Stock into Common Stock could occur
at a time when either or both of the Common Stock and Class B Stock may be considered to be overvalued or undervalued.

If shares of Class B Stock are outstanding at the time of a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Prudential Financial, each share of
Common Stock and Class B Stock will be entitled to a share of net liquidation proceeds in proportion to the respective liquidation units of such class. Each share of Common Stock will have one liquidation unit, and each share of Class B Stock will
have 2.83215 liquidation units.

Issuer
Purchases of Equity Securities

ITEM 6.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

We derived the selected consolidated income statement data for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 and the selected
consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 from our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein. We derived the selected consolidated income statement data for the years ended December 31, 2009 and
2008 and the selected consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 from consolidated financial statements not included herein.

Results for the year ended December 31, 2012 include approximately $32 billion of premiums reflecting two recently completed
significant pension risk transfer transactions. On November 1, 2012, we issued a non-participating group annuity contract to the General Motors Salaried Employees Pension Trust, and assumed responsibility for providing specified benefits to
certain participants. On December 10, 2012, we issued a non-participating group annuity contract to the Verizon Management Pension Plan and assumed responsibility for providing specified benefits to certain participants. The premiums from these
transactions were largely offset by a corresponding increase in policyholders’ benefits, including the change in policy reserves.



On February 1, 2011, we acquired the Star and Edison Businesses from American
International Group, Inc. The results of these companies are reported with the Gibraltar Life operations and are included in the results presented below from the date of acquisition. The Star and Edison companies were merged into Gibraltar Life on
January 1, 2012.

On December 31, 2009,
we completed the sale of our minority joint venture interest in Wachovia Securities. In 2009, “Equity in earnings of operating joint ventures, net of taxes” includes a pre-tax gain on the sale of $2.247 billion. In addition, “General
and administrative expenses” includes certain one-time costs related to the sale of the joint venture interest of $104 million for pre-tax compensation costs and costs related to increased contributions to the Company’s charitable
foundation. The total of these items is an after-tax gain of $1.389 billion, or $2.95 per share of Common Stock.

On May 1, 2009, we acquired Yamato Life, a Japanese life insurance company that declared bankruptcy in October 2008, and renamed The
Prudential Gibraltar Financial Life Insurance Company, Ltd. Results presented below include the results of this company from the date of acquisition.

The 2009 income tax provision includes a benefit of $272 million from a reduction to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and
related interest, primarily related to tax years prior to 2002 as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations for the 2002 and 2003 tax years.

Our Gibraltar Life operations use a November 30 fiscal year end. Consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2012, 2011,
2010, 2009 and 2008 includes Gibraltar Life assets and liabilities as of November 30. Consolidated income statement data for 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009 and 2008 includes Gibraltar Life results for the twelve months ended November 30, 2012,
2011, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



This selected consolidated financial information should be read in conjunction with
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein.



(1)

For purposes of this computation, earnings are defined as income from continuing operations before income taxes excluding undistributed income (loss) from equity method
investments, fixed charges and interest capitalized. Also excludes earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. Fixed charges are the sum of gross interest expense, interest credited to policyholders’ account balances and an estimated
interest component of rent expense. Due to the Company’s loss for the year ended December 31, 2008, the ratio coverage was less than 1:1 and is therefore not presented. Additional earnings of $1,133 million would have been required for the
year ended December 31, 2008 to achieve a ratio of 1:1.

The historical information presented in the table above has been revised to reflect the impact of retrospective adoption of the amended guidance related to the deferral of acquisition costs as well as the
impact of retrospective application of a change in method of an accounting principle for the Company’s pension plans. For further information, see “—Accounting Policies and Pronouncements—Adoption of New Accounting
Pronouncements” and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

You should read the following analysis of our
consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the Forward-Looking Statements included below the Table of Contents, “Risk Factors,” “Selected Financial Data” and the Consolidated Financial
Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Overview

Prudential Financial has two classes of common stock outstanding. The Common Stock, which is publicly traded (NYSE:PRU), reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses, while the Class B
Stock, which was issued through a private placement and does not trade on any exchange, reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business. The Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business are discussed below.

Financial Services Businesses

Our Financial Services Businesses consist of three operating
divisions, which together encompass six segments, and our Corporate and Other operations. The U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management division consists of our Individual Annuities, Retirement and Asset Management segments. The U.S.
Individual Life and Group Insurance division consists of our Individual Life and Group Insurance segments. The International Insurance division consists of our International Insurance segment. Our Corporate and Other operations include corporate
items and initiatives that are not allocated to business segments, as well as businesses that have been or will be divested.

We attribute financing costs to each segment based on the amount of financing used by each segment, excluding financing costs associated
with corporate debt which are reflected in Corporate and Other operations. The net investment income of each segment includes earnings on the amount of capital that management believes is necessary to support the risks of that segment.



We seek growth internally and through acquisitions, joint ventures or other forms of
business combinations or investments. Our principal acquisition focus is in our current business lines, both domestic and international.

Closed Block Business

In connection with the demutualization, we ceased offering domestic participating products. The liabilities for our traditional domestic
in force participating products were segregated, together with assets, in a regulatory mechanism referred to as the “Closed Block.” The Closed Block is designed generally to provide for the reasonable expectations for future policy
dividends after demutualization of holders of participating individual life insurance policies and annuities included in the Closed Block by allocating assets that will be used exclusively for payment of benefits, including policyholder dividends,
expenses and taxes with respect to these products. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “Business—Demutualization and Separation of Business” for more information on the Closed Block.

Revenues and Expenses

We earn our revenues principally from insurance premiums;
mortality, expense, asset management and administrative fees from insurance and investment products; and investment of general account and other funds. We earn premiums primarily from the sale of individual life insurance, group life and disability
insurance, and certain annuity contracts. We earn mortality, expense, and asset management fees primarily from the sale and servicing of separate account products including variable life insurance and variable annuities, and from the sale and
servicing of other products including universal life insurance. We also earn asset management and administrative fees from the distribution, servicing and management of mutual funds, retirement products and other asset management products and
services. Our operating expenses principally consist of insurance benefits provided and reserves established for anticipated future insurance benefits, general business expenses, dividends to policyholders, commissions and other costs of selling and
servicing the various products we sell and interest credited on general account liabilities.

Profitability

Our profitability depends principally on our ability to price our insurance and annuity products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the costs associated with providing benefits and
administering those products. Profitability also depends on, among other items, our actuarial and policyholder behavior experience on insurance and annuity products, our ability to attract and retain customer assets, generate and maintain favorable
investment results, effectively deploy capital and utilize our tax capacity, and manage expenses.

Historically, the participating products included in the Closed Block have yielded lower returns on capital invested than many of our other businesses. As we have ceased offering domestic participating
products, we expect that the proportion of the traditional participating products in our in force business will gradually diminish as these older policies age, and we grow other businesses. However, the relatively lower returns to us on this
existing block of business will continue to affect our consolidated results of operations for many years. Our Common Stock reflects the performance of our Financial Services Businesses, but there can be no assurance that the market value of the
Common Stock will reflect solely the performance of these businesses.

See “Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks that have affected and may affect in the future our business, results of operations or financial condition, cause the trading price of our Common
Stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.

Executive Summary

Prudential Financial, a financial services leader with
approximately $1.060 trillion of assets under management as of December 31, 2012, has operations in the United States, Asia, Europe and Latin America. Through our subsidiaries and affiliates, we offer a wide array of financial products and
services, including life



insurance, annuities, retirement-related services, mutual funds, and investment management. We offer these products and services to individual and institutional customers through one of the
largest distribution networks in the financial services industry.

Industry Trends

Our U.S. and international businesses are impacted by financial markets, economic conditions, regulatory oversight, and a variety of
trends that affect the industries where we compete.

U.S.
Businesses

Financial and Economic
Environment

.    Although economic and financial conditions continue to show signs of improvement, global market conditions and uncertainty continue to be factors in the markets in which we operate. This uncertainty,
particularly in the equity markets, has led to, among other things, increased demand for guaranteed retirement income, fixed income and stable value products, and defined benefit risk transfer solutions.

The continued low interest rate environment continues to
negatively impact our portfolio income yields, as discussed further below, and continued high unemployment rates and limited growth in salaries also continue to be factors impacting certain business drivers, including contributions to defined
contribution plans and the costs of group disability claims.

Regulatory Environment

.    Financial market dislocations have produced, and are expected to continue to produce, extensive changes in existing laws and regulations, and
regulatory frameworks applicable to our businesses. In addition, state insurance laws regulate all aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses and our insurance products are substantially affected by federal and state tax laws. Insurance regulators
have begun to implement significant changes in the way in which industry participants must determine statutory reserves and statutory capital, particularly for products with embedded options and guarantees such as variable annuities and universal
life products with secondary guarantees.

Demographics.

Income protection, wealth accumulation and the needs of retiring baby boomers continue to
shape the insurance industry. Retirement security is one of the most critical issues in the U.S. for individuals and the investment professionals and institutions that support them. The risk and responsibility of retirement savings continues to
shift to employees, away from the government and employers. Life insurance ownership among U.S. households has reached its lowest point in fifty years, with consumers citing other financial priorities and cost of insurance as reasons for the lack of
coverage.

Competitive
Environment

.    For the annuities business, traditional competitors continue to take actions to either exit the marketplace or de-risk products in response to recent market volatility. New non-traditional competitors are
beginning to enter this marketplace. In 2012, we implemented modifications to scale back benefits and increase pricing for certain product features. We believe our current product offerings are competitively positioned and that our differentiated
risk management strategies will provide us with an attractive risk and profitability profile. All of our new variable annuity sales, as well as a significant portion of our in force business, where an optional living benefit has been elected,
include an automatic rebalancing feature, which is a feature that is valued in the variable annuity market.

Our retirement and asset management businesses compete on price, service and investment performance. The full service retirement markets
are mature, with few dominant players. We have seen a trend toward unbundling of the purchase decision related to the recordkeeping and investment offerings, where the variety of available funds and their performance are the key selection criteria
of plan sponsors and intermediaries. Additionally, changes in the regulatory environment have driven more transparent fee disclosures, which have heightened pricing pressures and may accelerate the trend toward unbundling of services. Market
disruption and rating agency downgrades have caused some of our institutional investment product competitors to withdraw from the market, creating significant growth opportunities for us in certain markets, including the investment-only stable value
market. The recovery of the equity, fixed income, and commercial real estate markets has positively impacted asset managers by increasing assets under management and corresponding fee levels. In



addition, institutional fixed income managers have generally experienced positive flows as investors have re-allocated assets into fixed income to reduce risk, including the reduction of risk in
pension plans. In 2012, we closed two significant pension risk transfer transactions, which potentially changes the landscape for how plan sponsors consider their pension risk alternatives. The longevity risk associated with these transactions
complements our mortality risk businesses.

The
individual life and group life and disability markets are mature and, due to the large number of competitors, competition is driven mainly by price and service. The economy has exacerbated pressure on pricing, creating a challenge of maintaining
pricing discipline. In the individual life market, many of our competitors took pricing actions in 2012 in response to the low interest rate environment, following our own price increases implemented in 2009 and 2010. Our individual life sales in
2012 benefited from a strong competitive position as a result of these competitor actions. Maintaining this competitive positioning is dependent on sources of financing for the reserves associated with this business and timely utilization of the
associated tax benefits. For group products, rate guarantees have become the industry norm, with rate guarantee durations trending upward, primarily for group life insurance, as a general industry practice. There is also an increased demand from
clients for bundling of products and services to streamline administration and save costs by dealing with fewer carriers. As employers are attempting to control costs and shift benefit decisions and funding to employees, who continue to value
benefits offered in the workplace, employee-pay (voluntary) product offerings and services are becoming increasingly important in the group market. For the long-term care business, many companies, including Prudential, have taken actions in response
to the continued low interest rate environment including exiting the marketplace, seeking premium rate increases and changing plan designs. In 2012, we announced our decision to cease sales of long-term care products reflecting our desire to focus
our efforts on our core group life and disability lines of business.

International Businesses

Financial and Economic Environment

.    Our international insurance operations, especially in Japan, continue to operate in the low interest rate environment described below.
However, the local market has adapted to the low rate environment in Japan. The continued low interest rate environment in the U.S. may impact the attractiveness of U.S. dollar-denominated products in Japan relative to yen-denominated products. We
are also subject to financial impacts associated with movements in foreign currency rates, particularly the Japanese yen. Fluctuations in the value of the yen will continue to impact the relative attractiveness of non-yen products marketed in Japan.

Regulatory
Environment

.    In April 2012, Japanese tax law changed to reduce deductibility of premiums on certain insurance products. This resulted in dislocations in the tax sensitive marketplace and elevated sales of these products
prior to the effective date of the tax law change and reduced sales thereafter. The Financial Services Agency, the insurance regulator in Japan, has implemented revisions to the solvency margin requirements for certain assets and has changed the
manner in which an insurance company’s core capital is calculated. These changes were effective for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012. We anticipate further changes in solvency regulation from jurisdiction to jurisdiction based on
regulatory developments in the U.S., the European Union, and recommendations by an international standard setting body for the insurance regulators, as well as regulatory requirements for those companies deemed to be systemically important financial
institutions, or SIFIs, in the U.S. or abroad. In addition, local regulators, including in Japan, may apply heightened scrutiny to non-domestic companies. Internationally, regulators are also increasingly adopting measures to provide greater
consumer protection and privacy rights.

Demographics.

Japan has an aging population as well as a large pool of household assets invested in low
yielding deposit and savings vehicles. The aging of Japan’s population as well as strains on government pension programs have led to a growing demand for insurance products with a significant savings element to meet savings and retirement needs
as the population transitions to retirement. These products have higher premiums with more of a savings component. We are seeing a similar shift to retirement oriented products in Korea and Taiwan, each of which also has an aging population.

Competitive
Environment

.    The life insurance markets in Japan and Korea are mature. We generally compete more on distribution capabilities and service provided to customers than on price. The aging of



Japan’s population creates an increasing need for product innovation, introducing insurance products which allow for savings and income as the population transitions to retirement. In our
Japanese bank channel we experienced elevated sales of yen-denominated single premium reduced death benefit whole life products during periods when competitors capped their sales of similar investment-oriented products. The ability to sell through
multiple and complementary distribution channels is a competitive advantage. However, competition for sales personnel as well as access to third party distribution channels is intense.

Impact of Low Interest Rate Environment

The low interest rate environment in the U.S. has resulted
in our current reinvestment yields being lower than the overall portfolio income yield, primarily for our investments in fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans. With the Federal Reserve Board’s intention to keep interest rates
low through at least 2014, our portfolio income yields are expected to continue to decline in future periods.

For the domestic Financial Services Businesses’ general account, we expect annual scheduled payments and pre-payments to be
approximately 10% of the fixed maturity security and commercial mortgage loan portfolios through 2014. The domestic Financial Services Businesses’ general account has approximately $152 billion of such assets (based on net carrying value) as of
December 31, 2012. As these assets mature, the current average portfolio income yield for fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loans of approximately 5% is expected to decline due to reinvesting in a lower interest rate environment.

The reinvestment of scheduled payments and
pre-payments at rates below the current portfolio yield, including in some cases, at rates below those guaranteed under our insurance contracts, will impact future operating results to the extent we do not, or are unable to, reduce crediting rates
on in-force blocks of business, or effectively utilize other asset-liability management strategies described below, in order to maintain current net interest margins. As of December 31, 2012, our domestic Financial Services Businesses have
approximately $143 billion of insurance liabilities and policyholder account balances. Of this amount, approximately $41 billion represents contracts with guaranteed minimum crediting rates. The following table sets forth our contracts in the
domestic Financial Services Businesses with guaranteed minimum crediting rates, and the related range of the difference between interest rates being credited to contractholders on these balances as of December 31, 2012 and the respective
minimum guaranteed rates.

For the contracts above
guaranteed minimum crediting rates, although we have the ability to lower crediting rates, our willingness to do so may be limited by competitive pressures.

Our domestic Financial Services Businesses also have approximately $14 billion of insurance liabilities and policyholder account balances
representing participating contracts for which the investment income risk is expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. The crediting rates for these contracts are periodically adjusted based on the yield earned on the related assets. The
remaining $88 billion of the $143 billion of insurance liabilities and policyholder account balances in our domestic Financial Services Businesses represents long duration products such as group annuities, structured settlements and other insurance
products that do not have stated crediting rate guarantees, but have fixed and guaranteed terms, for which underlying assets may have to be reinvested at interest rates that are lower than portfolio rates. We seek to mitigate the impact of a
prolonged low interest rate environment on these contracts through asset-liability management, as discussed further below.

For the domestic Financial Services Businesses’ general account, assuming a hypothetical scenario where the average 10-year U.S.
Treasury rate is 1.75% for the period from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2014,



and credit spreads remain unchanged from levels as of December 31, 2012, we estimate that the unfavorable impact to net interest margins included in pre-tax adjusted operating income of
reinvesting in such an environment, compared to reinvesting at current average portfolio income yields, would be approximately $51 million in 2013 and $154 million in 2014. This impact is largely concentrated in the Retirement and Individual
Annuities segments. This hypothetical scenario only reflects the impact related to the approximately $41 billion of contracts with guaranteed minimum crediting rates shown above, and does not reflect: i) any benefit from potential changes to the
crediting rates on the corresponding contractholder liabilities where the Company has the contractual ability to do so, or other potential mitigants such as changes in investment mix that we may implement as funds are reinvested; ii) any impact
related to assets that do not directly support our liabilities; iii) any impact from other factors, including but not limited to, new business, contractholder behavior, changes in competitive conditions, and changes in capital markets; and/or
iv) any impact from other factors described below.

In order to mitigate the unfavorable impact that the current interest rate environment has on our net interest margins, we employ a
proactive asset-liability management program, which includes strategic asset allocation and derivative strategies within a disciplined risk management framework. These strategies seek to match the characteristics of our products, and to closely
approximate the interest rate sensitivity of the assets with the estimated interest rate sensitivity of the product liabilities. Our asset-liability management program also helps manage duration gaps, currency and other risks between assets and
liabilities through the use of derivatives. We adjust this dynamic process as products change, as customer behavior changes and as changes in the market environment occur. As a result, our asset-liability management process has permitted us to
manage interest-sensitive products successfully through several market cycles.

Our interest rate exposure is also mitigated by our business mix, as we have relatively limited exposure to lines of business in which net interest margin plays a more prominent role in product
profitability, such as fixed annuities and universal life, which represents a limited portion of our individual life business in force. In addition, within our Retirement business, a substantial portion of our stable value account values have very
low crediting rate floors.

Our Japanese insurance
operations have experienced a prolonged low interest rate environment for many years. These operations issue recurring payment and single premium products that are denominated in both Japanese yen and U.S. dollars, as well as fixed annuity products
that are denominated in U.S. dollars. For the Japanese yen-denominated products, the exposure to decreased interest rates is limited as our Japanese insurance operations have considered the prolonged low interest rate environment in product pricing,
and a rigorous asset-liability management program, which includes our duration management and crediting rate strategies, further limits our exposure. For the U.S. dollar-denominated recurring payment products, our exposure to low interest rates in
the U.S. is also limited by our asset-liability management program. For the U.S. dollar-denominated single premium and fixed annuity products, the risk of reduced interest rates is limited, as new fixed annuity contracts are re-priced frequently and
pricing for other products is reviewed and updated regularly to reflect current market interest rates.

Current Developments

Effective January 1, 2012, the Company adopted, retrospectively, the amended authoritative guidance issued by the FASB to address which costs relating to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance
contracts qualify for deferral. The Company has applied the retrospective method of adoption. In addition, in December 2012, the Company adopted retrospectively a change in method of applying an accounting principle for the Company’s pension
plans. The change in accounting method relates to the calculation of market related value of pension plan assets used to determine net periodic pension cost. All historical financial information presented has been revised to reflect these changes.
For further information, see “—Accounting Policies and Pronouncements—Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements” and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

On June 1, 2012, we announced the signing of an agreement with General Motors Co., pursuant to which we
would assume certain of its pension benefit obligations to U.S. salaried retiree plan participants and beneficiaries that are covered by the agreement. At closing on November 1, 2012, we issued a non-participating group annuity



contract to the General Motors Salaried Employees Pension Trust, and assumed responsibility for providing specified benefits to certain participants. In addition, on October 17, 2012, we
signed an agreement with Verizon Communications Inc., pursuant to which we will assume certain of its pension benefit obligations to U.S. salaried retiree plan participants and beneficiaries that are covered by the agreement. At closing on
December 10, 2012, we issued a non-participating group annuity contract to the Verizon Management Pension Plan, and assumed responsibility for providing specified benefits to certain participants. These pension risk transfer transactions
significantly expand the size of our existing payout annuity business.

On June 12, 2012, Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase at management’s discretion up to $1.0 billion of its outstanding Common Stock during the
period from July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2013. As of December 31, 2012, 2.7 million shares of our Common Stock were repurchased under this authorization for a total cost of $150 million. The Company exhausted an earlier $1.5
billion share repurchase authorization established in June 2011 including 8.8 million shares purchased in the first six months of 2012 at a total cost of $500 million.

In July 2012, we announced our decision to cease sales of
group long-term care insurance reflecting the challenging economics of the long-term care market including the continued low interest rate environment as well as our desire to focus our resources on our core group life and disability businesses. In
March 2012, we also discontinued sales of our individual long-term care products. As a result of our decision to wind down this business, we have reflected the results of the long-term care insurance business, previously reported within the Group
Insurance segment, as a divested business for all periods presented.

On September 27, 2012, we announced that Prudential Insurance agreed to acquire The Hartford’s individual life insurance business through a reinsurance transaction. This transaction closed on
January 2, 2013. The total cash consideration was $615 million consisting primarily of a ceding commission to provide reinsurance for approximately 700,000 life insurance policies with net retained face amount in force of approximately $135
billion.

On October 19, 2012, Prudential
Financial received notice that it is under consideration by the Council for a proposed determination that it should be subject to stricter prudential regulatory standards and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act (as a “Covered Company”). The notice of consideration indicates that Prudential Financial is being reviewed in stage 3 of the three-stage process described in the Council’s interpretative guidance for
Covered Company determinations and does not constitute a notice of a proposed determination. The Company is entitled, under the applicable regulations, to contest such consideration. Nevertheless, the Council may determine to issue to Prudential
Financial a written notice of determination that it is a Covered Company, in which event we would be entitled to request a nonpublic evidentiary hearing before the Council. The prudential standards under the Dodd-Frank Act include requirements
regarding risk-based capital and leverage, liquidity, stress-testing, overall risk management, resolution plans, early remediation, and credit concentration; and may also include additional standards regarding capital, public disclosure, short-term
debt limits, and other related subjects as appropriate. See “Business—Regulation” and “Risk Factors” for more information regarding the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the Company, including as a result of these
stricter prudential standards.

Prudential
Bank & Trust, FSB has limited its operations to trust services. On October 31, 2012, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System approved Prudential Financial’s application to deregister as a savings and loan holding
company, effective as of that date.

On
November 7, 2012, Prudential Financial declared an annual dividend for 2012 of $1.60 per share of Common Stock, reflecting an increase of approximately 10% from the 2011 Common Stock dividend. On February 12, 2013, Prudential Financial
declared a dividend for the first quarter of 2013 of $0.40 per share of Common Stock reflecting our previously announced plan to move to a quarterly Common Stock dividend schedule in 2013.



Outlook

Management expects that results in 2013 will continue to reflect the quality of our individual businesses and their prospects, as well as
our overall business mix and effective capital management. In 2013, we continue to focus on long-term strategic positioning and growth opportunities, including the following:

•

U.S. Retirement and Investment Management Market.

We seek to capitalize on the growing need of baby boomers for products
that provide guaranteed income for longer retirement periods. In addition, we continue to focus on our clients’ increasing needs for retirement income security given volatility in the financial markets. We also seek to provide products that
respond to the needs of plan sponsors to manage risk and control their benefit costs.

•

U.S. Insurance Market.

We continue to focus on writing high-quality business and expect to continue to benefit from
expansion of our distribution channels and deepening our relationships with third-party distributors. We also seek to capitalize on opportunities for additional voluntary life purchases in the group insurance market, as institutional clients are
focused on controlling their benefit costs.

•

International Markets.

We continue to concentrate on deepening our presence in the markets in which we currently operate,
such as Japan, and expanding our distribution capabilities, including through the integration of the acquired Star and Edison Businesses. We seek to capitalize on opportunities arising in international markets as changing demographics and public
policy have resulted in a growing demand for retirement income products.



Results of Operations

Net income of our Financial Services Businesses attributable
to Prudential Financial, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $428 million compared to $3,420 million for 2011.

We analyze performance of the segments and Corporate and Other operations of the Financial Services Businesses using a measure called
adjusted operating income. See “—Consolidated Results of Operations—Segment Measures” for a discussion of adjusted operating income and its use as a measure of segment operating performance.

Pre-tax adjusted operating income for the Financial Services
Businesses for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $3,949 million compared to $3,836 million for 2011. Shown below are the contributions of each segment and Corporate and Other operations to our adjusted operating income for the years ended
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 and a reconciliation of adjusted operating income of our segments and Corporate and Other operations to income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures.

Revenues exclude Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments. See “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses.”

(2)

Revenues exclude related charges resulting from payments related to market value adjustment features of certain of our annuity products and the impact of Realized
investment gains (losses), net, on the amortization of unearned revenue reserves. Benefits and expenses exclude related charges that represent the impact of Realized investment gains (losses), net, on the amortization of deferred policy acquisition
costs, and other costs.

(3)

Revenues exclude net investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities. See “—Experience-Rated Contractholder
Liabilities, Trading Account Assets Supporting Insurance Liabilities and Other Related Investments.”

Equity in earnings of operating joint ventures are included in adjusted operating income but excluded from income from continuing operations before income taxes and
equity in earnings of operating joint ventures as they are reflected on a U.S. GAAP basis on an after-tax basis as a separate line in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests are excluded from
adjusted operating income but included in income from continuing operations before taxes and equity earnings of operating joint ventures as they are reflected on a U.S. GAAP basis as a separate line in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests represent the portion of earnings from consolidated entities that relates to the equity interests of minority investors.

Results for 2012 presented above reflect the following:

Individual Annuities.

Segment
results for 2012 increased in comparison to 2011, reflecting the favorable comparative impact of changes in the estimated profitability of the business, driven by the net impacts of market performance, and annual reviews and updates of economic and
actuarial assumptions and other refinements. Excluding these items, results increased in comparison to 2011, reflecting higher asset-based fee income, driven by higher average variable annuity account values, net of an increased level of
distribution and amortization costs, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization.

Retirement.

Segment results for 2012 increased in comparison to 2011. The increase primarily reflects the
favorable impact of a legal settlement in 2012, as well as higher asset-based fee income and net investment spread results. These increases were partially offset by costs to write-off an intangible asset related to an acquired business, higher
general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, and an unfavorable comparative reserve impact from case experience.

Asset Management.

Segment results declined in 2012 in comparison to 2011 reflecting less favorable results
from the segment’s strategic investing activities, which reflect charges for the current year on real estate investments, compared to a gain in the prior year on the partial sale of a real estate seed investment. The lower contribution from
these activities, as well as higher expenses in the current year and the comparative impact of a gain on the sale of an operating joint venture in 2011 offset the benefit from higher asset management fees.

Individual Life.

Segment
results declined from 2011 primarily driven by the unfavorable comparative impact from our annual reviews and updates of economic and actuarial assumptions as well as costs incurred in 2012 associated with our acquisition of The Hartford’s
individual life insurance business.

Group
Insurance.

Segment results declined in 2012 in comparison to 2011 primarily due to less favorable group life and disability underwriting results and higher expenses.

International Insurance.

Segment results for 2012 increased in comparison to 2011
in both our Life Planner and Gibraltar Life and Other operations including a net favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. Results from the segment’s Life Planner operations primarily reflect business growth driven by sales results
and continued strong persistency. Improved results from the segment’s Gibraltar Life and Other operations were primarily driven by business growth, additional synergies and lower integration costs associated with our acquisition of the former
Star and Edison businesses, and the absence of claims and expenses associated with the 2011 earthquake in Japan. Offsetting these favorable items was a greater benefit in the prior year from partial sales of our indirect investment in China Pacific
Group.

Corporate and Other
operations.

The results for 2012 as compared to 2011 reflect an increased loss primarily due to a higher level of expenses in other corporate activities and greater interest expense, net of investment income, driven
primarily from higher levels of capital debt.

Closed Block Business.

Income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $150 million in 2012
compared to 2011, primarily reflecting lower net realized investment gains and net investment income, partially offset by a decline in the policyholder dividend obligation expense.



Accounting Policies & Pronouncements

Application of Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. Management, on an ongoing basis, reviews estimates and
assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements. If management determines that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate given current facts and circumstances, results of operations and financial position as reported in
the Consolidated Financial Statements could change significantly.

The following sections discuss the accounting policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions and require
management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.

Deferred Policy Acquisition and Other Costs

We capitalize costs that are directly related to the
acquisition or renewal of insurance and annuity contracts. These costs primarily include commissions, as well as costs of policy issuance and underwriting and certain other expenses that are directly related to successfully negotiated contracts. See
Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the new authoritative guidance adopted effective January 1, 2012, regarding which costs relating to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts qualify for deferral.
We have also deferred costs associated with sales inducements related to our variable and fixed annuity contracts primarily within our Individual Annuities segment. Sales inducements are amounts that are credited to the policyholder’s account
balance as an inducement to purchase the contract. For additional information about sales inducements, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We amortize these deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC, and deferred sales
inducements, or DSI, over the expected lives of the contracts, based on our estimates of the level and timing of gross margins, gross profits, or gross premiums, depending on the type of contract. As described in more detail below, in calculating
DAC and DSI amortization, we are required to make assumptions about investment returns, mortality, persistency, and other items that impact our estimates of the level and timing of gross margins, gross profits, or gross premiums. We also
periodically evaluate the recoverability of our DAC and DSI. For certain contracts, this evaluation is performed as part of our premium deficiency testing, as discussed further below in “—Policyholder Liabilities.” As of
December 31, 2012, DAC and DSI in our Financial Services Businesses were $13.7 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, and DAC in our Closed Block Business was $412 million.

Amortization methodologies

DAC associated with the traditional participating products
of our Closed Block Business is amortized over the expected lives of those contracts in proportion to estimated gross margins. Gross margins consider premiums, investment returns, benefit claims, costs for policy administration, changes in reserves,
and dividends to policyholders. We evaluate our estimates of future gross margins and adjust the related DAC balance with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the effects of actual gross margins and changes in our expected
future gross margins. DAC adjustments generally have not created significant volatility in our results of operations since many of the factors that affect gross margins are also included in the determination of our dividends to these policyholders
and, during most years, the Closed Block has recognized a cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense in “Policyholders’ dividends,” for the excess of actual cumulative earnings over expected cumulative earnings as determined
at the time of demutualization. However, if actual cumulative earnings fall below expected cumulative earnings in future periods, thereby eliminating the cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense, changes in gross margins and DAC
amortization would result in a net impact to the Closed Block Business results of operations. As of December 31, 2012, the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was $885 million.

DAC associated with the non-participating whole life and term
life policies of our Individual Life segment and the whole life, term life, endowment and health policies of our International Insurance segment is amortized in proportion to gross premiums.



DAC and DSI associated with the variable and universal life policies of our Individual Life
and International Insurance segments and the variable and fixed annuity contracts of our Individual Annuities and International Insurance segments are amortized over the expected life of these policies in proportion to total gross profits. In
calculating gross profits, we consider mortality, persistency, and other elements as well as rates of return on investments associated with these contracts and the costs related to our guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefits.
Total gross profits include both actual experience and estimates of gross profits for future periods. We regularly evaluate and adjust the related DAC and DSI balances with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the impact
of actual gross profits and changes in our assumptions regarding estimated future gross profits on our DAC and DSI amortization rates. Adjustments to the DAC and DSI balances include the impact to our estimate of total gross profits of the annual
review of assumptions, our quarterly adjustments for current period experience, and our quarterly adjustments for market performance. Each of these adjustments is further discussed below in “—Annual assumptions review and quarterly
adjustments.”

We include the impact of the
embedded derivatives associated with certain of the optional living benefit features of our variable annuity contracts and related hedging activities in actual gross profits used as the basis for calculating current period amortization. We include
only certain of these impacts in our best estimate of gross profits used to determine DAC and DSI amortization rates. Beginning in 2012, we include the difference between the change in the fair value of hedge positions and the change in the value of
an internally-defined hedge target in our best estimate of total gross profits used for determining amortization rates each quarter, without regard to the permanence of the changes. In 2011 and the second half of 2010, we included these impacts only
to the extent this net amount was determined by management to be other-than-temporary. Prior to changing our hedging strategy to incorporate the internally-defined hedge target in the second half of 2010, we considered the change in the fair value
of hedge positions and the change in the embedded derivative liability as defined under U.S. GAAP, excluding the impact of the market-perceived risk of our own non-performance, each quarter in determining amortization rates. These changes over
time reflect our regular review of the estimated profitability of our business, changes in our hedging strategy and other factors. For additional information on our internally-defined hedge target, as well as the current period impact of resetting
amortization rates for this activity, see “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division—Individual Annuities—Variable Annuity Living
Benefits Hedging Program Results.”

Annual
assumptions review and quarterly adjustments

Annually, during the third quarter, we perform a comprehensive review of the assumptions used in estimating gross profits for future
periods. Although we review these assumptions on an ongoing basis throughout the year, we generally only update these assumptions and adjust the DAC and DSI balances during the third quarter, unless a material change that we feel is indicative of a
long term trend is observed in an interim period. Over the last several years, the Company’s most significant assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future gross profits and the amortization of DAC and DSI have been related to
lapse experience and other contractholder behavior assumptions, mortality, and revisions to expected future rates of returns on investments. We expect these assumptions to be the ones most likely to cause potential significant changes in the future.
The impact on our results of operations of changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time.

The quarterly adjustments for current period experience
referred to above reflect the impact of differences between actual gross profits for a given period and the previously estimated expected gross profits for that period. To the extent each period’s actual experience differs from the previous
estimate for that period, the assumed level of total gross profits may change. In these cases, we recognize a cumulative adjustment to all previous periods’ amortization, also referred to as an experience true-up adjustment.

The quarterly adjustments for market performance referred to
above reflect the impact of changes to our estimate of total gross profits to reflect actual fund performance. A significant portion of gross profits for our variable annuity contracts and, to a lesser degree, our variable life policies are
dependent upon the total rate of return on assets held in separate account investment options. This rate of return influences the fees we earn, costs we incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit
features



related to our variable annuity contracts, as well as other sources of profit. Returns that are higher than our expectations for a given period produce higher than expected account balances,
which increase the future fees we expect to earn and decrease the future costs we expect to incur associated with the guaranteed minimum death and guaranteed minimum income benefit features related to our variable annuity contracts. The opposite
occurs when returns are lower than our expectations. The changes in future expected gross profits are used to recognize a cumulative adjustment to all prior periods’ amortization.

The near-term future rate of return assumptions used in evaluating DAC and DSI for our domestic variable
annuity and variable life insurance products are derived using a reversion to the mean approach, a common industry practice. Under this approach, we consider the actual historical economic returns over a period of time and initially adjust future
projected returns over the next four years (the “near-term”) so that the assets are projected to grow at the long-term expected rate of return for the entire period. If the near-term projected future rate of return is greater than our
near-term maximum future rate of return, we use our maximum future rate of return.

The weighted average rate of return assumptions for these businesses consider many factors specific to each business, including asset durations, asset allocations and other factors. We update the near
term rates of return and our estimate of total gross profits each quarter to reflect the result of the reversion to the mean approach, which assumes a convergence to the long-term expected rates of return. These market performance related
adjustments to our estimate of total gross profits result in cumulative adjustments to prior amortization, reflecting the application of the new required rate of amortization to all prior periods’ gross profits. The new required rate of
amortization is also applied prospectively to future gross profits in calculating amortization in future periods.

As of December 31, 2012, our variable annuities business utilizes distinct rates of return for equity and fixed income investments.
Assumptions for this business reflect an 8.0% long-term equity expected rate of return and a near-term mean reversion equity rate of return of 9.1%. As of December 31, 2012, all contract groups within our variable annuities business utilized
these rates, as the near-term mean reversion equity rate of return was less than our 13% maximum. Fixed income expected rates of return include a risk-free return plus a credit spread and consider the duration and credit profile of the respective
bond funds. Fixed income returns reflect a grading from current rates up to long term rates over a ten year period. The weighted average fixed income expected rate of return after the ten year grading period is 5.4%.

As of December 31, 2012, our variable life insurance
business utilizes blended rates of return, which are based on a long-term expected distribution of funds between equity and fixed income funds. Assumptions for this business reflect a long-term blended expected rate of return of 6.5%, which includes
an 8.1% long-term equity expected rate of return and a 4.5% fixed income expected rate of return. The 4.5% fixed income expected rate of return is a levelized rate, which blends current rates and long-term expected returns. Assumptions also reflect
a near-term mean reversion blended rate of return of 5.9%. As of December 31, 2012, all contract groups within our variable life insurance business utilize these rates, as the near-term equity rate of return was less than our 13% maximum.

Sensitivity

For the variable and universal life policies of our
Individual Life segment, a significant portion of our gross profits is derived from mortality margins. As a result, our estimates of future gross profits are significantly influenced by our mortality assumptions. Our mortality assumptions represent
our expected claims experience over the life of these policies and are developed based on Company experience or standard industry tables. Unless a material change in mortality experience that we feel is indicative of a long term trend is observed in
an interim period, we generally update our mortality assumptions annually in the third quarter. Updates to our mortality assumptions in future periods could have a significant adverse or favorable effect on the results of our operations in the
Individual Life segment.

The DAC balance
associated with the variable and universal life policies of our Individual Life segment as of December 31, 2012 was $1.7 billion. The following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of that DAC balance relative to our future
mortality assumptions by quantifying the adjustments that would be required, assuming both an increase and decrease in our future mortality rate by 1%. While the information below is for



illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future mortality assumptions, it is a near-term, reasonably likely hypothetical change that illustrates the potential
impact of such a change. This information considers only the direct effect of changes in our mortality assumptions on the DAC balance, with no changes in any other assumptions such as persistency, future rate of return, or expenses included in our
evaluation of DAC, and does not reflect changes in reserves, such as the unearned revenue reserve, which would partially offset the adjustments to the DAC balance reflected below. The impact of the unearned revenue reserve is discussed in more
detail below in “—Policyholder Liabilities.”

For a discussion of DAC
adjustments related to our Individual Life segment for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, see “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance
Division—Individual Life.”

For variable
annuity contracts, DAC and DSI are more sensitive to changes in our future rate of return assumptions due primarily to the significant portion of our gross profits that is dependent upon the total rate of return on assets held in separate account
investment options, and the shorter average life of the contracts. The DAC and DSI balances associated with our domestic variable annuity contracts were $3.8 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2012. The following
table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of each of these balances relative to our future rate of return assumptions by quantifying the adjustments to each balance that would be required assuming both an increase and decrease in our future
rate of return by 100 basis points. The sensitivity includes an increase and decrease of 100 basis points to both the near-term future rate of return assumptions used over the next four years, and the long-term expected rate of return used
thereafter. While the information below is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future rate of return assumptions, it is a near-term, reasonably likely hypothetical change that illustrates the potential
impact of such a change. This information considers only the direct effect of changes in our future rate of return on the DAC and DSI balances and not changes in any other assumptions such as persistency, mortality, or expenses included in our
evaluation of DAC and DSI. Further, this information does not reflect changes in reserves, such as the reserves for the guaranteed minimum death and optional living benefit features of our variable annuity products, or the impact that changes in
such reserves may have on the DAC and DSI balances.

For a discussion of DAC and
DSI adjustments related to our Individual Annuities segment for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, see “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment
Management Division—Individual Annuities.”

Value of Business Acquired

In addition to DAC and DSI, we also recognize an asset for value of business acquired, or VOBA. VOBA includes an explicit adjustment to reflect the cost of capital attributable to the acquired insurance
contracts, and represents an adjustment to the stated value of inforce insurance contract liabilities to present them at fair value, determined as of the acquisition date. As of December 31, 2012, VOBA was $3,248 million, and included
$2,865 million related to the acquisition from AIG of the Star and Edison Businesses on February 1, 2011. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisition from AIG of the Star and
Edison Businesses. The remaining $383 million relates to previously-acquired traditional life, deferred annuity, defined contribution and defined benefit businesses. VOBA is amortized over the expected life



of the acquired contracts. For additional information about VOBA including details on items included in our estimates of future cash flows for the various acquired businesses and its bases for
amortization, see Note 2 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. VOBA is also subject to recoverability testing at the end of each reporting period to ensure that the balance does not exceed the present value of anticipated gross
profits.

Goodwill

As of December 31, 2012, our goodwill balance of $873
million is reflected in the following four reporting units: $444 million related to our Retirement Full Service business, $238 million related to our Asset Management business, $171 million related to our Gibraltar Life and Other operations and $20
million related to our International Insurance Life Planner business.

We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, as of December 31 of each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the potential for impairment is more likely than not. The
goodwill impairment analysis is performed at the reporting unit level which is equal to or one level below our operating segments. This analysis includes a qualitative assessment, for which reporting units may elect to bypass in accordance with
accounting guidance, and a quantitative analysis consisting of two steps. For additional information on goodwill and the process for testing goodwill for impairment, see Note 2 and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The International Insurance’s Life Planner business and
the Asset Management segment elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and complete their impairment analysis using an earnings multiple approach. The earnings multiple approach indicates the value of a business based on comparison to
publicly-traded comparable companies in similar lines of business. Each comparable company is analyzed based on various factors, including, but not limited to, financial risk, size, geographic diversification, profitability, adequate financial data,
and an actively traded stock price. A multiple of price to earnings is developed for the comparable companies using independent analysts’ consensus estimates for each company’s 2013 forecasted earnings. The multiples are then aggregated
and a mean and median multiple is calculated for the group. The lower of the mean or median multiple is then applied to the 2013 forecasted earnings of the reporting unit to develop a value. A control premium is then added to determine a total
estimated fair value for the reporting unit.

The
Retirement Full Service business and Gibraltar Life and Other operations also elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and complete their impairment analysis using a discounted cash flow approach. The discounted cash flow approach calculates the
value of a business by applying a discount rate reflecting the market expected weighted average rate of return to the projected future cash flows of the reporting unit. These projected future cash flows were based on our internal forecasts, an
expected growth rate and a terminal value. The weighted average rate of return, or WARR, represents the required rate of return on total capitalization. It is comprised of a required rate of return on equity of a company and the current tax-affected
cost of debt, which are then weighted by the relative percentages of equity and debt assumed in the capital structure. To estimate the return on equity, we applied the Capital Asset Pricing Model, or CAPM. The CAPM is a generally accepted method for
estimating an equity investor’s return requirement, and hence a company’s cost of equity capital. CAPM is determined by beginning with the long-term risk-free rate of return then applying adjustments that consider the equity risk premium
required for large company common stock investments as well as company specific adjustments to address volatility, small company premiums and other risks particular to a specific company. The WARR calculation is applied to a group of companies
considered peers of the reporting unit to develop a weighted average rate of return for the peer group which is then used to estimate the market expected weighted average rate of return for the reporting unit. This process resulted in a discount
rate of 12% which was then applied to the expected future cash flows of the Retirement Full Service business and Gibraltar Life and Other operations to estimate its fair value.

After completion of Step 1 of the quantitative tests, it was
determined that fair values exceeded the carrying amounts for each of the four reporting units and it was concluded there was no impairment as of December 31, 2012. The Asset Management, International Insurance’s Life Planner, Gibraltar
Life and Other operations and Retirement Full Service businesses had estimated fair values that exceeded their carrying amounts by 460%, 100%, 52%, and 11%, respectively.



Estimating the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process that involves the use
of significant estimates by management. The Retirement Full Service business’ quantitative test is sensitive to a number of key assumptions. For example, a decline in its forecasted cash flows of 10%, an increase in the discount rate above
13.1%, or an increase in the equity attributed to support this business (representing the carrying value) of 11.1% could result in failing Step 1 of the quantitative test and therefore require a Step 2 assessment. Regarding all reporting units
tested, further market declines or other events impacting the fair value of these businesses, including discount rates, interest rates and growth rate assumptions or increases in the level of equity required to support these businesses, could result
in goodwill impairments, resulting in a charge to income.

As of December 31, 2012, the Company experienced a market capitalization that was below its consolidated book value. An analysis was performed in order to confirm the reasonableness of the reporting
unit fair values calculated in the goodwill impairment tests discussed above. The Company considered the fact that certain reporting units that do not contain goodwill have lower estimated fair values due to the nature of the risks in their
businesses and also considered the negative impact of our Corporate & Other operations on the overall fair value of the Company. The Company also considered the amount of control premium necessary to estimate a fair value equal to book
value. When comparing this control premium to actual control premiums experienced in recent insurance company acquisitions, as well as the impact of the lower market environment which can increase industry control premiums, the Company concluded
that the calculated control premium reflected an amount which we believe is within a range of reasonableness. Based on these factors, the Company concluded that the reporting unit fair values calculated in the goodwill impairment test were
reasonable.

Valuation of Investments, Including
Derivatives, and the Recognition of Other-than-Temporary Impairments

Our investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans, equity securities, other invested assets, and derivative financial instruments.
Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices or the values of securities or commodities. Derivative financial instruments we generally use include swaps, futures,
forwards and options and may be exchange-traded or contracted in the over-the-counter market. We are also party to financial instruments that contain derivative instruments that are “embedded” in the financial instruments. Management
believes the following accounting policies related to investments, including derivatives, are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. Each of these policies is discussed further within other relevant disclosures related to
the investments and derivatives, as referenced below.

•

Valuation of investments, including derivatives

•

Recognition of other-than-temporary impairments

•

Determination of the valuation allowance for losses on commercial mortgage and other loans

We present our investments classified as available-for-sale,
including fixed maturity and equity securities, our investments classified as trading, such as our trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities, our derivatives, and our embedded derivatives at fair value in the statements of financial
position. For additional information regarding the key estimates and assumptions surrounding the determination of fair value of fixed maturity and equity securities, as well as derivative instruments, embedded derivatives and other investments, see
Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “—Valuation of Assets and Liabilities—Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities.”

For our investments classified as available-for-sale, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in
“Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” or “AOCI,” a separate component of equity. For our investments classified as trading, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded within “Asset management fees and other
income.” In addition, investments classified as available-for-sale, as well as those classified as held-to-maturity, are subject to impairment reviews to identify when a decline in value is other-than-temporary. For a discussion of our policies
regarding other-than-temporary declines in investment value and the related methodology for recording other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturity and equity securities, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “—Realized
Investment Gains and Losses—Other-than-Temporary Impairments —Fixed Maturity Securities” and “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses—Other-than-Temporary Impairments—Equity Securities.”



Commercial mortgage and other loans are carried primarily at unpaid principal balances, net
of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and expenses and unamortized premiums or discounts and a valuation allowance for losses. For a discussion of our policies regarding the valuation allowance for commercial mortgage and other loans see
“—General Account Investments—Commercial Mortgage and Other Loans—Commercial Mortgage and Other Loan Quality.”

Policyholder Liabilities

Future Policy Benefit Reserves, other than Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses

We establish reserves for future policy benefits to, or on
behalf of, policyholders in the same period in which the policy is issued, using methodologies prescribed by U.S. GAAP. In applying these methodologies, we are required to make certain reserve assumptions. For most contracts, we utilize best
estimate assumptions as of the date the policy is issued or acquired with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation. After these reserves are initially established, we perform premium deficiency tests using best estimate assumptions as of the
testing date without provisions for adverse deviation. If reserves determined based on these best estimate assumptions are greater than the net liabilities (i.e., reserves net of any DAC asset), the existing net liabilities are adjusted by
first reducing the DAC asset by the amount of the deficiency or to zero through a charge to current period earnings. If the deficiency is more than the DAC balance, we then increase the reserve by the excess, again through a charge to current
period earnings. We typically update our actuarial assumptions, such as mortality, morbidity, retirement and policyholder behavior assumptions, annually in the third quarter of each year, unless a material change is observed in an interim period
that we feel is indicative of a long term trend. Generally, we do not expect trends to change significantly in the short-term and, to the extent these trends may change, we expect such changes to be gradual over the long-term. In a sustained low
interest rate environment, there is an increased likelihood that the reserves determined based on best estimate assumptions may be greater than the net liabilities. The following paragraphs provide additional details about our reserves for our
Closed Block Business and Financial Services Businesses.

The future policy benefit reserves for the traditional participating life insurance products of our Closed Block Business, which as of December 31, 2012, represented 24% of our total future policy
benefit reserves are determined using the net level premium method. Under this method, the future policy benefit reserves are accrued as a level proportion of the premium paid by the policyholder. In applying this method, we use mortality
assumptions to determine our expected future benefits and expected future premiums, and apply an interest rate to determine the present value of both the expected future benefit payments and the expected future premiums. The mortality assumptions
are based on data from the standard industry mortality tables that were used to determine the cash surrender value of the policies, and the interest rates used are the contractually guaranteed interest rates used to calculate the cash surrender
value of the policies. Gains or losses in our results of operations resulting from deviations in actual experience compared to the experience assumed in establishing our reserves for this business are recognized in the determination of our annual
dividends to these policyholders. These gains or losses generally have not created significant volatility in our results of operations since, during most years, the Closed Block has recognized a cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense in
“Policyholders’ dividends,” for the excess of actual cumulative earnings over expected cumulative earnings as determined at the time of demutualization. However, if actual cumulative earnings fall below expected cumulative earnings in
future periods, thereby eliminating the cumulative policyholder dividend obligation expense, these gains or losses could result in greater volatility in the Closed Block Business results of operations.

The future policy benefit reserves for our International
Insurance segment and Individual Life segment, which as of December 31, 2012, represented 47% of our total future policy benefit reserves combined, relate primarily to non-participating whole life and term life products and endowment contracts,
and are determined as the present value of expected future benefits to, or on behalf of, policyholders plus the present value of future maintenance expenses less the present value of future net premiums. The expected future benefits and expenses are
determined using assumptions about mortality, lapse, and maintenance expense. These assumptions are determined by product group. Mortality assumptions are generally based on the Company’s historical experience or standard industry tables, as
applicable; our expense assumptions are based on current levels of maintenance costs, adjusted for the effects of inflation; and our interest rate assumptions are based on current and expected net investment returns.



The reserves for future policy benefits of our Retirement segment, which as of
December 31, 2012 represented 23% of our total future policy benefit reserves, primarily relate to our non-participating life contingent group annuity and structured settlement products. These reserves are generally determined as the present
value of expected future benefits and expenses based on assumptions about mortality, retirement, maintenance expense, and interest rates. These assumptions are determined by product group. Our mortality and retirement assumptions are based on
Company or industry experience; our expense assumptions are based on current levels of maintenance costs, adjusted for the effects of inflation; and our interest rate assumptions are based on current and expected net investment returns.

The reserves for future policy benefits of our
Corporate & Other operations, which as of December 31, 2012 represented 2% of our total future policy benefit reserves, primarily relate to our long-term care products. These reserves are generally determined as the present value of
expected future benefits and expenses less future premiums, based on assumptions about interest rates, morbidity, mortality, lapses, premium rate increases, and maintenance expenses. Our morbidity and mortality assumptions are based on industry
experience, and may include certain adjustments for Company experience. Our lapse assumptions are based upon Company experience, our expense assumptions are based on current levels of maintenance costs, adjusted for the effects of inflation, and our
interest rate assumptions are based on current and expected net investment returns. Our premium rate increase assumptions are based on our projected experience, which considers state regulatory standards for inforce rate increases, as well as our
historical experience with filing for such increases.

The remaining 4% of the reserves for future policy benefits as of December 31, 2012 primarily represent reserves for the guaranteed minimum death benefit (“GMDB”) and optional living
benefit features of the variable annuity products in our Individual Annuities segment, and group life and disability benefits in our Group Insurance segment. The optional living benefits are primarily accounted for as embedded derivatives, with fair
values calculated as the present value of future expected benefit payments to customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature. For additional information regarding the valuation of these
optional living benefit features, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “—Valuation of Assets and Liabilities—Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities—Variable Annuity Optional Living Benefit Features.”

In establishing reserves for GMDBs and guaranteed
minimum income benefits (“GMIB”s) related to variable annuity contracts, we must make estimates and assumptions about the timing of annuitization, contract lapses and contractholder mortality, as well as interest rates and equity market
returns. Assumptions relating to contractholder behavior, such as the timing of annuitization and contract lapses, are based on our experience by contract group, and vary by product type and year of issuance. We adjust base lapse rate assumptions at
the contract level based on a comparison of the actuarially-calculated value and the current policyholder account value, as well as other factors, such as the applicability of any surrender charges. This dynamic lapse rate adjustment reduces the
base lapse rate when the guaranteed amount is greater than the account value, as in-the-money contracts are less likely to lapse. Lapse rates are also generally assumed to be lower for the period where surrender charges apply. Mortality assumptions
are generally based on standard industry tables, which we adjust based on our historical experience, and also incorporate a mortality improvement assumption. These mortality assumptions vary by contract group. Over the last several years, the
Company’s most significant assumption updates that have resulted in changes to our reserves for GMDBs and GMIBs have been related to lapse experience and other contractholder behavior assumptions and revisions to expected future rates of
returns on investments. The Company expects these assumptions to be the ones most likely to cause significant changes in the future. Changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and can also impact our DAC and other balances as discussed above.
For additional information on the calculation of these reserves, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The future rate of return assumptions used in establishing reserves for GMDBs and GMIBs related to variable annuity contracts are derived
using a reversion to the mean approach, a common industry practice. For additional information regarding our future expected rate of return assumptions and our reversion to the mean approach see, “—Deferred Policy Acquisition and Other
Costs.” The following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of the reserves for GMDBs and GMIBs related to variable annuity contracts relative to our future rate of return assumptions by quantifying the adjustments to these reserves
that would be required assuming both a 100 basis point increase and decrease in our future rate of return. The sensitivity includes an increase and decrease of 100 basis points to both the near-term future rate of return assumptions used over the
next four years,



and the long-term expected rate of return used thereafter. While the information below is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future rate of return
assumptions, it is a near-term, reasonably likely change that illustrates the potential impact of such a change. This information considers only the direct effect of changes in our future rate of return on operating results due to the change in the
reserve balance and not changes in any other assumptions such as persistency, mortality, or expenses included in our evaluation of the reserves, or any changes on DAC or other balances, discussed above in “—Deferred Policy Acquisition and
Other Costs.”

For a discussion of
adjustments to the reserves for GMDBs and GMIBs related to our Individual Annuities segment for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, see “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—U.S.
Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division—Individual Annuities.”

Unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses

Our liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses of $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2012 is reported as a component of “Future policy benefits” and relates primarily to the
group long-term disability products of our Group Insurance segment. This liability represents our estimate of future disability claim payments and expenses as well as estimates of claims that we believe have been incurred, but have not yet been
reported as of the balance sheet date. We do not establish loss liabilities until a loss has occurred. As prescribed by U.S. GAAP, our liability is determined as the present value of expected future claim payments and expenses. Expected future claim
payments are estimated using assumed mortality and claim termination factors and an assumed interest rate. The mortality and claim termination factors are based on standard industry tables and the Company’s historical experience. Our interest
rate assumptions are based on factors such as market conditions and expected investment returns. Of these assumptions, our claim termination assumptions have historically had the most significant effect on our level of liability. We compare our
claim termination assumptions to actual terminations annually. These studies review actual claim termination experience over a number of years with more weight placed on the actual experience in the more recent years. If actual experience results in
a different assumption, we adjust our liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses accordingly with a charge or credit to current period earnings. In recent years, we have experienced an increase in the volume of new long-term
disability claims, as well as unfavorable claim termination experience, driven by the economic downturn. During 2012, our claim termination experience has shown improvement, but has been outpaced by a continued increase in new claims. We are
investing in our claims management process which, over time, should drive improvements in this area.

Unearned revenue reserves for universal life and investment contracts

Our unearned revenue reserve, or URR, reported as a component of “Policyholders’ account
balances,” is $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2012. This reserve primarily relates to variable and universal life products within our Individual Life segment and represents policy charges for services to be provided in future periods. The
charges are deferred as unearned revenue and amortized over the expected life of the contract in proportion to the product’s estimated gross profits, similar to DAC as discussed above.

For the variable and universal life policies of our Individual Life segment, a significant portion of our gross
profits is derived from mortality margins. As a result, our estimates of future gross profits are significantly influenced by our mortality assumptions. Our mortality assumptions represent our expected claims experience over the life of these
policies and are developed based on Company experience or standard industry tables. Unless a material change in mortality experience that we feel is indicative of a long term trend is observed in an interim period, we generally update our mortality
assumptions annually in the third quarter. Updates to our mortality assumptions in future periods could have a significant adverse or favorable effect on the results of our operations in the Individual Life segment.



The URR balance associated with the variable and universal life policies of our Individual
Life segment as of December 31, 2012 was $0.8 billion. The following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of that URR balance relative to our future mortality assumptions by quantifying the adjustments that would be required,
assuming both an increase and decrease in our future mortality rate by 1%. While the information below is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future mortality assumptions, it is a near-term, reasonably
likely hypothetical change that illustrates the potential impact of such a change on the URR balance and does not reflect the offsetting impact of such a change on the DAC balance as discussed above in “—Deferred Policy Acquisition and
Other Costs.” This information considers only the direct effect of changes in our mortality assumptions on the URR balance and not changes in any other assumptions such as persistency, future rate of return, or expenses included in our
evaluation of URR.

For a discussion of URR
adjustments related to our Individual Life segment for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, see “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance
Division—Individual Life.”

Pension and Other
Postretirement Benefits

We sponsor
pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering employees who meet specific eligibility requirements. Our net periodic costs for these plans consider an assumed discount (interest) rate, an expected rate of return on plan assets and expected
increases in compensation levels and trends in health care costs. Of these assumptions, our expected rate of return assumptions, and to a lesser extent our discount rate assumptions, have historically had the most significant effect on our net
period costs associated with these plans.

We
determine our expected rate of return on plan assets based upon a building block approach that considers inflation, real return, term premium, credit spreads, equity risk premium and capital appreciation as well as expenses, expected asset manager
performance and the effect of rebalancing for the equity, debt and real estate asset mix applied on a weighted average basis to our pension asset portfolio. See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for our actual asset allocations by
asset category and the asset allocation ranges prescribed by our investment policy guidelines for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Our assumed long-term rate of return for 2012 was 6.75% for our domestic pension plans and
7.00% for our other postretirement benefit plans. Given the amount of plan assets as of December 31, 2011, the beginning of the measurement year, if we had assumed an expected rate of return for both our pension and other postretirement benefit
plans that was 100 basis points higher or 100 basis points lower than the rates we assumed, the change in our net periodic costs would have been as shown in the table below. The information provided in the table below considers only changes in our
assumed long-term rate of return given the level and mix of invested assets at the beginning of the measurement year, without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any
changes in our assumed long-term rate of return.

We determine our discount
rate, used to value the pension and postretirement benefit obligations, based upon rates commensurate with current yields on high quality corporate bonds. See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the
December 31, 2011 methodology we employed to determine our discount rate for 2012. Our assumed discount rate for 2012 was 4.85% for our domestic pension plans and 4.60% for our other postretirement benefit plans. Given the amount of pension and
postretirement obligations as of December 31, 2011, the beginning of the measurement year, if we had assumed a discount rate for both our



pension and other postretirement benefit plans that was 100 basis points higher or 100 basis points lower than the rates we assumed, the change in our net periodic costs would have been as shown
in the table below. The information provided in the table below considers only changes in our assumed discount rate without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes
in our assumed discount rate.

Given the application of the
authoritative guidance for accounting for pensions, and the deferral and amortization of actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in our assumed discount rate, the change in net periodic pension cost arising from an increase in the assumed
discount rate by 100 basis points would not be expected to equal the change in net periodic pension cost arising from a decrease in the assumed discount rate by 100 basis points.

For a discussion of our expected rate of return on plan
assets and discount rate for our qualified pension plan in 2012, see “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—Corporate and Other.”

For purposes of calculating pension income from our own
qualified pension plan for the year ended December 31, 2013, we will decrease the discount rate to 4.05% from 4.85% in 2012. The expected rate of return on plan assets will decrease to 6.25% in 2013 from 6.75% in 2012, and the assumed rate of
increase in compensation will remain unchanged at 4.5%.

In addition to the effect of changes in our assumptions, the net periodic cost or benefit from our pension and other postretirement benefit plans may change due to factors such as actual experience being
different from our assumptions, special benefits to terminated employees, or changes in benefits provided under the plans.

At December 31, 2012, the sensitivity of our pension and postretirement obligations to a 100 basis point change in discount rate was
as follows:

Taxes on Income

Our effective tax rate is based on income, non-taxable and
non-deductible items, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities and
expectations about future outcomes. The Company provides for U.S. income taxes on unremitted foreign earnings of its operations in Japan and certain operations in India, Germany and Taiwan. In addition, beginning in 2012, the Company provides for
U.S. income taxes on a portion of the current year foreign earnings for its insurance operations in Korea.

Items required by tax regulations to be included in the tax return may differ from the items reflected in the financial statements. As a
result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements may be different than the actual rate applied on the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some
differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as valuation of insurance reserves. Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally



represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities generally
represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expenditures for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet been recognized in our financial statements.

The application of U.S. GAAP requires us to evaluate the
recoverability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if necessary to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether a
valuation allowance is necessary, and if so, the amount of such valuation allowance. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance we consider many factors, including: (1) the nature of the deferred tax assets and liabilities;
(2) whether they are ordinary or capital; (3) in which tax jurisdictions they were generated and the timing of their reversal; (4) taxable income in prior carryback years as well as projected taxable earnings exclusive of reversing
temporary differences and carryforwards; (5) the length of time that carryovers can be utilized in the various taxing jurisdictions; (6) any unique tax rules that would impact the utilization of the deferred tax assets; and (7) any
tax planning strategies that we would employ to avoid a tax benefit from expiring unused. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be
realized.

An increase or decrease in our
effective tax rate by one percent of income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures, would have resulted in an increase or decrease in our consolidated income from continuing
operations before equity in earnings of operating joint ventures in 2012 of $7 million.

U.S. GAAP prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to
take on tax returns. The application of this guidance is a two-step process, the first step being recognition. We determine whether it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the tax position will be sustained upon examination.
If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second step is measurement. We measure the tax position as the largest amount of benefit
that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. This measurement considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be
realized upon ultimate settlement using the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date.

The Company’s liability for income taxes includes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and interest that relate to tax years
still subject to review by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or other taxing authorities. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the impact in 2010, 2011 and 2012 of changes to our total unrecognized
tax benefits. We do not anticipate any significant changes within the next 12 months to our total unrecognized tax benefits related to tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired.

The Company’s affiliates in Japan and Korea file
separate tax returns and are subject to audits by the local taxing authority. The general statute of limitations for Japan and Korea are five years from when the return is filed.

Reserves for Contingencies

A contingency is an existing condition that involves a
degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved upon the occurrence of future events. Under U.S. GAAP, reserves for contingencies are required to be established when the future event is probable and its impact can be reasonably estimated,
such as in connection with an unresolved legal matter. The initial reserve reflects management’s best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and,
ultimately, when the matter is brought to closure.



Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements

Effective January 1, 2012, the Company adopted, retrospectively, new authoritative guidance to address
which costs relating to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts qualify for deferral. All prior period financial information has been revised to reflect the retrospective adoption of the amended guidance. The impact of the
retrospective adoption of this guidance on previously reported December 31, 2011 balances was a reduction in deferred policy acquisition costs by $4.1 billion for the Financial Services Businesses and by $0.2 billion for the Closed Block
Business, an increase in policy reserves for certain limited pay contracts by $0.2 billion for the Financial Services Businesses, and a reduction in total equity by $2.8 billion for the Financial Services Businesses and $0.2 billion for the Closed
Block Business. The impact of the retrospective adoption of this guidance on previously reported income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was a decrease of $262 million and $282
million for the Financial Services Businesses, respectively, and an increase of $17 million and $21 million for the Closed Block Business, respectively. The lower level of costs now qualifying for deferral will be only partially offset by a lower
level of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, and, as such, will initially result in lower earnings in future periods, primarily within the International Insurance and Individual Annuities segments. The impact to the International
Insurance segment largely reflects lower deferrals of allocated costs of its proprietary distribution system, while the impact to the Individual Annuities segment mainly reflects lower deferrals of its wholesaler costs. While the adoption of this
amended guidance changes the timing of when certain costs are reflected in the Company’s results of operations, it has no effect on the total acquisition costs to be recognized over time and will have no impact on the Company’s cash flows.

See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for a complete discussion of newly issued accounting pronouncements, including further discussion of the new authoritative guidance addressing which costs relating to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts qualify for
deferral, as well as our retrospective adoption of a change in method of applying an accounting principle for the Company’s pension plans.



Consolidated Results of Operations

The following table summarizes net income for the Financial
Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business for the periods presented.

Results of Operations—Financial
Services Businesses

2012 to 2011
Annual Comparison.

Income from continuing operations for the Financial Services Businesses decreased $2,968 million from 2011 to 2012. Results for 2012 compared to 2011 reflect the following:

•

Lower pre-tax earnings of $2,377 million resulting from the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on certain non-yen denominated assets
and liabilities within our Japanese insurance operations which are economically matched and offset in AOCI, driven by the weakening of the Japanese yen (see “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by
Segment—International Insurance Division—Impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on earnings—U.S. GAAP earnings impact of products denominated in non-local currencies” for additional information);

•

A $666 million unfavorable variance, before income taxes, reflecting the net impact from market value changes on our embedded derivatives and related
hedge positions associated with certain variable annuities, primarily driven by the impact of non-performance risk, partially offset by the impact of amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs as well as market value changes
associated with certain derivatives under our capital hedge program (see “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division—Individual
Annuities—Variable Annuity Living Benefits Hedging Program Results” for additional information);



•

A $639 million unfavorable variance, before taxes, from adjustments to deferred policy acquisition and other costs and the reserves for our long-term
care products, reflecting updates to the estimated profitability of the business, driven by changes to our long-term interest rate and morbidity assumptions, partially offset by expected future premium increases;

•

Lower net pre-tax realized gains of $432 million, excluding the impact of the hedging program associated with certain variable annuities as described
above, primarily reflecting lower gains from changes in the market value of derivatives used to manage duration in our general account investment portfolios as a result of changes in interest rates. Also contributing to the decline is the
comparative impact of changes in the market value of currency derivatives used to hedge portfolio assets due to foreign currency exchange rate movements;

•

The comparative impact of a $237 million pre-tax benefit in 2011 compared to a pre-tax benefit of $60 million in 2012 reflecting partial sales of our
indirect interest in China Pacific Insurance Group; and

•

The absence of a $96 million pre-tax gain in 2011 reflecting the sale of our investment in Afore XXI, an operating joint venture in our Asset
Management segment.

Partially
offsetting these decreases in income from continuing operations were the following items:

•

A decrease in income tax expense of $1,237 million primarily reflecting the decrease in pre-tax income from continuing operations;

•

A $303 million favorable variance, before taxes, from adjustments to deferred policy acquisition and other costs and the reserves for guaranteed
minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products, reflecting updates to the estimated profitability of the business, primarily resulting from market performance and the impact of an annual review and update of assumptions;
and

•

The absence of a $93 million pre-tax charge recorded in 2011 for estimated payments arising from use of new Social Security Master Death File matching
criteria to identify deceased policy and contract holders.

In addition to the items above, premiums increased $41,154 million, primarily driven by higher premiums in our Retirement segment reflecting two significant pension risk transfer transactions in 2012 as
well as higher premiums in our International Insurance segment reflecting sales growth in Gibraltar’s bank distribution channel. These increases are largely offset by corresponding increases in policyholder benefits, including changes in
reserves.

2011 to 2010 Annual
Comparison.

Income from continuing operations for the Financial Services Businesses increased $972 million from 2010 to 2011. Results for 2011 compared to 2010 reflect the following:

•

Higher net pre-tax gains of $717 million associated with our general account portfolio, excluding the impact of the hedging program associated with
certain variable annuities as discussed below, primarily reflecting higher gains from changes in the market value of derivatives used to manage the investment portfolio duration resulting from declining interest rates in 2011, and higher gains from
changes in the market value of currency derivatives used to hedge portfolio assets due to foreign currency exchange rate movements;

•

Higher net pre-tax earnings of $686 million reflecting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on certain non-yen denominated assets and
insurance liabilities within our Japanese insurance operations which are economically matched and the offset is included in “Other Comprehensive Income (loss)”, driven by the strengthening of the yen during 2011;

•

A $237 million pre-tax benefit in 2011 compared to a $66 million pre-tax benefit in 2010 on sales of portions of our indirect interest in China Pacific
Insurance (Group) Co., Ltd;

•

A $96 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our investment in Afore XXI, an operating joint venture in our Asset Management segment; and

•

A net increase in premiums and policy charges and fee income, net of an increase in policyholders’ benefits, including changes in reserves,
reflecting business growth, as well as the impact of favorable currency fluctuations.



Partially offsetting these increases in income from continuing operations were the following
items:

•

A $588 million unfavorable variance, before taxes, reflecting the net impact from market value changes on our embedded derivatives, including the
impact of non-performance risk, and related hedge positions associated with certain variable annuities, the impact on amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs and the impact of temporarily hedging to an amount that differs from
our hedge target definition;

•

A $558 million unfavorable variance, before taxes, from adjustments to deferred policy acquisition and other costs and the reserves for guaranteed
minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products, reflecting updates to the estimated profitability of the business primarily resulting from market performance and the impact of an annual review and update of assumptions;

•

Higher income tax expense of $429 million primarily reflecting the increase in pre-tax income from continuing operations; and

•

A $93 million pre-tax expense for estimated payments arising from use of new Social Security Master Death File matching criteria to identify deceased
policy and contract holders.

Segment Measures

Adjusted Operating Income.

In
managing our business, we analyze operating performance separately for our Financial Services Businesses and our Closed Block Business. For the Financial Services Businesses, we analyze our segments’ operating performance using “adjusted
operating income.” Results of the Closed Block Business for all periods are evaluated and presented only in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted operating income does not equate to “income (loss) from continuing operations before income
taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures” or “net income” as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP but is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources, and
consistent with authoritative guidance, is our measure of segment performance. The adjustments to derive adjusted operating income are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute
for income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies. However, we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management
purposes enhances understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of the Financial Services Businesses.

See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the presentation of segment
results and our definition of adjusted operating income.

Annualized New Business Premiums.

In managing certain of our businesses, we analyze annualized new business premiums, which do not correspond to revenues under U.S. GAAP.
Annualized new business premiums measure the current sales performance of the business, while revenues primarily reflect the renewal persistency of policies written in prior years and net investment income, in addition to current sales. Annualized
new business premiums include 10% of first year premiums or deposits from single pay products. No other adjustments are made for limited pay contracts.

Assets Under Management.

In managing our Asset Management business, we analyze assets under management,
which do not correspond to U.S. GAAP assets, because the principal source of revenues is fees based on assets under management. Assets under management represents the fair market value or account value of assets which we manage directly in
proprietary products, such as mutual funds and variable annuities, in separate accounts, wrap-fee products and the general account, and assets invested in investment options included in our products that are managed by third party sub-managers
(i.e., the non-proprietary investment options in the Company’s products).



Account Values.

For our Individual Annuity and Retirement
businesses, assets are reported at account value, which do not correspond to U.S. GAAP assets. Net sales (redemptions) in our Individual Annuity business and net additions (withdrawals) in our Retirement business do not correspond to revenues under
U.S. GAAP, but are used as a relevant measure of business activity.

U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division

Individual Annuities

The Individual Annuities segment offers variable and fixed
annuities that provide our customers with tax—deferred asset accumulation together with a base death benefit and a suite of optional guaranteed death and living benefits. As the investment return on the contractholder funds is generally
attributed directly to the contractholder, we derive our revenue mainly from fee income generated on variable annuity account values, investment income earned on fixed annuity account values, and certain other management fees. Our expenses primarily
consist of interest credited and other benefits to contractholders, amortization of deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”) and other costs, expenses related to the selling and servicing of the various products we offer, costs of hedging our
risk associated with these products and the eventual payment of benefit guarantees and other general business expenses. These drivers of our business results are generally included in adjusted operating income, with exceptions related to certain
guarantees, as discussed below.

The U.S. GAAP
accounting and our adjusted operating income treatment for our guarantees differs depending upon the specific feature. The reserves for our guaranteed minimum death benefit (“GMDB”) and guaranteed minimum income benefit (“GMIB”)
features are calculated based on our best estimate of actuarial and capital markets return assumptions. The risks associated with these benefit features are retained and results are included in adjusted operating income. In contrast, certain of our
optional guaranteed living benefit features are accounted for as embedded derivatives and reported at fair value. Under U.S. GAAP, the fair values of these benefit features are based on assumptions a market participant would use in pricing these
embedded derivative liabilities. We hedge or limit our exposure to certain risks associated with these features through our living benefits hedging program and product design elements. Adjusted operating income, as discussed below in
“—Adjusted Operating Income” and “—Revenues, Benefits and Expenses” excludes amounts related to these changes in the market value of the embedded derivatives and related hedge positions, and the related impact to
amortization of DAC and other costs. The items excluded from adjusted operating income are discussed below in “—Variable Annuity Living Benefits Hedging Program Results.”

Account Values

Account values are a significant driver of our operating results. Since most policy fees are determined by the level of separate account
assets, fee income varies according to the level of account values. Additionally, our fee income drives other items such as our pattern of amortization of DAC and other costs. Account values are primarily driven by net flows from new business sales,
surrenders and withdrawals, and benefit payments, as well as the impact of market changes on account values. The following tables set forth account value information for the periods indicated.



(1)

Includes variable and fixed annuities sold as retail investment products. Investments sold through defined contribution plan products are included with such products
within the Retirement segment. Variable annuity account values were $131.6 billion, $109.7 billion and $102.3 billion as of December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Fixed annuity account values were $3.7 billion, $3.8 billion and $3.8
billion as of December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

(2)

As of December 31, 2012, includes variable annuity account values of $75 billion, or 57%, invested in equity portfolios, $41 billion, or 31%, invested in bond
portfolios, $8 billion, or 6%, invested in market value adjusted or fixed-rate accounts and $8 billion, or 6%, invested in money market funds.

As shown above, our account values are significantly impacted by net sales and the impact of market performance on customers’
accounts. Our sales levels were relatively flat between 2012 and 2011, reflecting the dynamic competitive landscape we have experienced over this period. During 2012, we suspended additional customer deposits for variable annuities with certain
optional living benefit riders that were no longer being offered and implemented variable annuity product modifications for new sales to scale back benefits, increase pricing and close a share class in the third quarter. Certain of our competitors
have taken actions to implement product modifications that scale back benefits and to exit, or limit their presence in, the variable annuity marketplace. Our results in future periods may continue to be impacted by the dynamic competitive landscape.
The decrease in surrenders and withdrawals for 2012 compared to 2011 primarily reflects the continued retention of contracts with guarantees that are in-the-money and the attractiveness of our inforce contracts relative to substitute products
currently available in the marketplace.

The
decrease in gross sales for 2011 compared to 2010 reflects the impacts of modifications we implemented in the first quarter of 2011 to scale back benefits and increase pricing, and increased competition as certain of our competitors became more
aggressive in product design and pricing. Surrenders and withdrawals were relatively flat despite the increase in account values, reflecting a decline in withdrawal rates.

Operating Results

The following table sets forth the Individual Annuities
segment’s operating results for the periods indicated.

Adjusted Operating Income

2012 to 2011 Annual
Comparison.

Adjusted operating income increased $377 million. Excluding the impacts of changes in the estimated profitability of the business, discussed below, adjusted operating income increased $74 million. This increase
was driven by higher asset-based fees due to growth in average variable annuity account values, as discussed in “—Account Values” above, net of an increased level of distribution and amortization costs. The increase was partially
offset by higher general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, reflecting increased costs to support business initiatives, including a $9 million charge related to an impairment of capitalized software costs in the fourth quarter of
2012, based on a review of recoverability.

The
impacts of changes in the estimated profitability of the business include adjustments to the reserves for the GMDB and GMIB features of our variable annuity products and to the amortization of DAC and other costs. These adjustments reflect the
impacts of market performance, current period experience and the annual review and update of assumptions performed in the third quarter. These changes resulted in an $81 million net benefit in 2012, and a $222 million net charge in 2011. The $81
million net benefit in 2012 was primarily driven by the impact of positive market performance on customer accounts relative to our assumptions, partially offset by the



impact of annual assumption updates. These annual assumption updates were driven by updates to our economic assumptions, primarily reflecting reductions to our long-term interest and equity rate
of return assumptions, as well as updates to actuarial assumptions and other refinements. The $222 million net charge in 2011 was primarily driven by the impact of negative market performance on customer accounts relative to our assumptions.

In addition to these current period impacts, the
changes to the estimated profitability of our business also drive changes in our future accrual rates for GMDB and GMIB reserves and amortization rates for DAC and other costs, which will impact results in future periods. Additionally, we include
certain results of our living benefits hedging program in our best estimate of gross profits used to determine amortization rates, which also drives changes in the amortization of DAC and other costs in future periods. The results above exclude the
fourth quarter impacts of resetting the amortization rates for this item, as both the results of our living benefits hedging program and related amortization of DAC and other costs are excluded from adjusted operating income in the quarter realized,
as described below in “—Variable Annuity Living Benefits Hedging Program Results.” However, adjusted operating income in future periods includes the impact on amortization of applying the new rates to actual gross profits. The
inclusion of net unfavorable results from our living benefits hedging program in our best estimate of gross profits drove increases in amortization rates and, therefore, an increase in amortization expense included in adjusted operating income in
2012. While a decrease in our best estimate of total gross profits accelerates amortization and decreases income in a given period, it does not affect our cash flow or liquidity position.

For weighted average rate of return assumptions and additional information on our policy for amortizing DAC and
other costs, and for estimating future expected claims costs associated with the GMDB and GMIB features of our variable annuity products as of December 31, 2012, see “—Accounting Policies & Pronouncements—Application of
Critical Accounting Estimates.”

2011 to
2010 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income decreased $288 million. Excluding the impacts of changes in the estimated profitability of the business on the reserves for the GMDB and GMIB features of our variable
annuity products and on the amortization of DAC and other costs, discussed below, adjusted operating income increased $270 million. This increase was driven by higher asset-based fees due to growth in average variable annuity account values, net of
an increased level of distribution costs. The increase was partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, reflecting increased costs to support business growth and higher financing expenses, and the impact of
a $25 million benefit in 2010 from refinements based on a review and settlement of reinsurance contracts related to acquired business.

The impacts of changes in the estimated profitability of the business resulted in a $222 million net charge in 2011, and a $336 million
net benefit in 2010. The $222 million net charge in 2011 was primarily driven by the impact of negative market performance on customer accounts relative to our assumptions. The $336 million net benefit in 2010 reflected the impacts of annual
assumption updates, driven by reductions to lapse rate assumptions and more favorable assumptions relating to fee income, as well as the impacts of favorable market performance on customer accounts relative to our assumptions, and favorable claims,
lapse and fee experience.

Revenues, Benefits
and Expenses

2012 to 2011 Annual
Comparison.

Revenues, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased $345 million, primarily driven by a $384 million increase in policy charges and fee income, and asset management fees
and other income, due to growth in average variable annuity account values.

Benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” decreased $32 million. Absent the $303 million net decrease related to the impacts of certain changes in our
estimated profitability of the business, discussed above, benefits and expenses increased $271 million. General and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, increased $211 million, driven by higher asset-based trail commissions, reflecting
account value growth, as well as higher costs to support business initiatives. The amortization of DAC increased $92 million driven by higher gross profits primarily related to the increase in fee income discussed above, and higher amortization
rates driven primarily by the inclusion of unfavorable results from our living benefits hedging program in our best estimate of total gross profits used to determine amortization rates.

2011 to 2010 Annual Comparison.

Revenues increased $443 million. Policy charges
and fees and asset management fees and other income increased $576 million driven by growth in average variable annuity account



values. Partially offsetting the increase in revenues was a decrease in net investment income of $88 million, reflecting lower average annuity account values in the general account primarily
resulting from net transfers from the general account to the separate accounts, driven by an automatic rebalancing element in some of our optional living benefit features.

Benefits and expenses increased $731 million. Absent the $558
million net increase related to the impacts of certain changes in our estimated profitability of the business, discussed above, benefits and expenses increased $173 million. General and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, increased $195
million, driven by higher distribution and asset management costs, reflecting business and account value growth. The amortization of DAC increased $78 million driven by higher gross profits primarily related to the increase in fee income discussed
above. Interest expense also increased $46 million driven by higher borrowings to fund costs related to new business sales. Interest credited to policyholders’ account balances decreased $107 million primarily due to lower average annuity
account values in the general account partially offset by higher amortization of deferred sales inducements reflecting the impact of higher gross profits.

Variable Annuity Risks and Risk Mitigants

The primary risk exposures of our variable annuity contracts relate to actual deviations from, or changes to, the assumptions used in the
original pricing of these products, including capital markets assumptions, such as equity market returns, interest rates and market volatility, and actuarial assumptions, such as contractholder longevity/mortality, the timing of annuitization and
withdrawals, and contract lapses. For our actuarial assumptions, we have retained the risk that actual experience will differ from the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products. For our capital markets assumptions, we hedge or limit
our exposure to the risk created by capital markets fluctuations through a combination of product design elements, such as an automatic rebalancing element, also referred to as an asset transfer feature, and inclusion of certain optional living
benefits in our living benefits hedging program.

Our automatic rebalancing element occurs at the contractholder level, and transfers assets between certain variable investments selected
by the annuity contractholder and, depending on the benefit feature, the fixed-rate account in the general account or a bond portfolio within the separate accounts. The automatic rebalancing element associated with currently-sold products uses a
designated bond portfolio within the separate accounts. The transfers are based on the static mathematical formula used with the particular benefit which considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the impact of investment
performance on the contractholder’s total account value. The objective of the automatic rebalancing element is to mitigate our exposure to equity market risk and market volatility. Other product design elements we utilize include, among others,
asset allocation restrictions and minimum issuance age requirements. In addition, certain fees are based on a benefit guarantee amount rather than the account value, which helps preserve certain revenue streams when market fluctuations cause account
values to decline.

We use our living benefits
hedging program to manage the risk associated with certain of our optional living benefit guarantees. This program represents a balance among three objectives: 1) provide severe scenario protection, 2) minimize net income volatility associated with
an internally-defined hedge target, and 3) maintain capital efficiency. Through our hedge program, we purchase derivatives that seek to replicate the net change in our hedge target, discussed further below. In addition to mitigating capital markets
risk and income statement volatility, the hedging program is also focused on a long-term goal of accumulating assets that could be used to pay claims under these benefits irrespective of market path, recognizing that, under the terms of the
contracts, we do not expect to begin substantial payment of such claims until many years in the future. For additional information regarding this program see “—Variable Annuities Living Benefits Hedging Program Results” below.

For our optional living benefits features, claims
will primarily be paid in the form of lifetime contractholder withdrawal payments. These payments commence only after the cumulative withdrawals have first exhausted the policy account value. Due to the age of the block, no such claims payments have
occurred to date, nor are they expected to occur within the next five years. The timing and amount of actual future claims depend on actual returns on contractholder account value and actual policyholder behavior relative to our assumptions.

The majority of our variable annuity contracts
with optional living benefit features, and all new contracts sold with these features, include an automatic rebalancing element and are also included in our living benefits



hedging program. The guaranteed benefit features of certain legacy products that were sold prior to our implementation of the automatic rebalancing element product feature are included in our
living benefits hedge program. Certain legacy guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit (GMAB) products include the automatic rebalancing element, but are not included in the hedging program. Our contracts with the GMIB feature have neither risk
mitigant, as we have retained the associated risk.

For our GMDBs, we provide a benefit payable in the event of death that, together with the existing contractholder’s account balance,
is equal to a return of cumulative deposits less any partial withdrawals, or the greater of a minimum return on the contract value or an enhanced value. We have retained the risk that the total amount of death benefit payable may be greater than the
contractholder account value. However, a substantial portion of the account values associated with GMDBs are subject to an automatic rebalancing element because the contractholder also selected a living benefit feature which includes an automatic
rebalancing element. All of the variable annuity account values with living benefit features also contain GMDBs. The living and death benefit features for these contracts cover the same insured life, and we have insured both the mortality and
longevity risk on these lives.

The following
table sets forth the risk profile of our optional living benefits and GMDB features as of the periods indicated.

(1)

All contracts with optional living benefit guarantees also contain GMDB features, covering the same insured life.

(2)

Reflects contracts that only include a GMDB feature and do not have an automatic rebalancing element.

The increase in account values that include both risk
mitigants as of December 31, 2012 compared to prior periods primarily reflects sales of our latest product offerings which, include an automatic rebalancing element and are also included in our living benefits hedging program.

Variable Annuity Living Benefits Hedging Program Results

Under U.S. GAAP, the liability for certain
optional living benefit features is accounted for as an embedded derivative and recorded at fair value, based on assumptions a market participant would use in pricing these features. The fair value is calculated as the present value of future
expected benefit payments to customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the applicable living benefit features using option pricing techniques. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information regarding the methodology and assumptions used in calculating the fair value under U.S. GAAP.

As noted within “—Variable Annuity Risks and Risk Mitigants” above, we maintain a hedge program to manage the risk
associated with these guarantees. Prior to the third quarter of 2010, our hedging strategy sought to generally match certain estimated capital markets sensitivities of the embedded derivative liability as defined by U.S. GAAP, excluding the impact
of the market’s perception of our own non-performance risk (“NPR”). Since then, our program has utilized an internally-defined hedge target that is grounded in a U.S. GAAP/capital markets valuation framework, with three notable
modifications.

1.

The impact of NPR is excluded to maximize protection against the entire projected claim irrespective of the possibility of our own default.



2.

A credit spread is added to the risk-free rate of return assumption used under U.S. GAAP to estimate future growth of bond investments in the customer separate account
funds in order to better replicate the projected returns within those funds.

3.

The equity volatility assumption is adjusted to remove certain risk margins required under U.S. GAAP valuation which are used in the projection of customer account
values, as we believe the impact of these margins is highly sensitive to short-term market conditions and does not reflect the long-term nature of these guarantees.

Due to these modifications, we expect differences each period
between the change in the value of the embedded derivative as defined by U.S. GAAP and the change in the value of the hedge positions used to replicate the hedge target, thus potentially increasing volatility in U.S. GAAP earnings. The following
table provides a reconciliation between the fair value of the embedded derivative as defined by U.S. GAAP and the value of our hedge target as of the periods indicated.

We seek to replicate the
changes in our hedge target by entering into a range of exchange-traded and over the counter equity and interest rate derivatives to hedge certain capital market risks present in our hedge target. The instruments include, but are not limited to,
interest rate swaps, swaptions, floors and caps as well as equity options, total return swaps and equity futures. The following table sets forth the market and notional values of these instruments as of December 31, 2012.

Due to cash flow timing
differences between our hedging instruments and the corresponding hedge target, as well as other factors, including updates to actuarial valuation assumptions, the amount of hedge assets compared to our hedge target measured as of any specific point
in time may be different and is not expected to be fully offsetting.

In addition to the hedge assets held as part of the hedging program, we have cash, other invested assets and affiliated receivables available to cover the future claims payable under these guarantees and
other liabilities. For additional information on the liquidity needs associated with our hedging program, see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Liquidity associated with other activities—Hedging activities associated with living
benefit guarantees.”



While we actively manage our hedge positions, changes in the fair value of these positions
may not completely offset changes in the fair value of the hedge target. Additionally, updates to actuarial valuation assumptions, which typically occur annually in the third quarter, are generally not hedged and may result in differences between
the hedge positions and the hedge target. The primary sources of the differences between the changes in the fair value of the hedge positions and the hedge target, other than actuarial valuation assumption updates, fall into one of three categories:

•

Fund Performance—In order to project future account value growth, we must make certain assumptions about how each underlying fund will perform. We
map customer funds to indices that we believe are comparable, are readily tradeable and have active derivative markets. The difference between the modeled fund performance and actual fund performance results in basis differences that can be either
positive or negative.

•

Liability Basis—We experience differences between the actual changes in the hedge target and the expected changes we have modeled and attempt to
replicate with the hedge program.

•

Rebalancing Costs and Volatility—There are costs associated with rebalancing hedge positions for basis differences between the hedge positions and
the hedge target. Our hedge program is also subject to the impact of realized market volatility in excess of, or lower than, our long-term volatility assumptions.

The net impact of both the change in the fair value of the
embedded derivative associated with our living benefit features and the change in the fair value of the related hedge positions are included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments” and the related impact to
the amortization of DAC and other costs is included in “Related charges,” both of which are excluded from adjusted operating income. The following table shows the net impact of changes in the embedded derivative and related hedge
positions, as well as the related amortization of DAC and other costs, for the periods indicated.

(1)

Positive amount represents income; negative amount represents a loss.

(2)

Excludes $101 million, $(1,662) million and $306 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, representing the impact of managing interest rate risk by holding capital
against a portion of the interest rate exposure associated with these contracts. Because this decision is based on the capital considerations of the Company as a whole, the impact is reported in Corporate & Other operations. See
“—Corporate & Other.”

(3)

Represents the impact attributable to the difference between the value of the hedge target and the value of the embedded derivative as defined by U.S. GAAP, before
adjusting for NPR, as discussed above.

Results for 2012 generally reflected improved capital markets performance, as well as lower levels of volatility. The $743 million net benefit related to the net hedging impact, excluding assumption
updates, primarily reflected positive fund performance. The $912 million net charge related to the impact of assumption



updates was driven by updates to our policyholder behavior assumptions, primarily related to lapse and mortality rates, as well as policyholder utilization assumptions. The $754 million net
charge from the change in the NPR adjustment was primarily driven by a tightening of our NPR credit spreads. We also included these items in gross profits used to calculate the amortization of DAC, which resulted in a net benefit of $981 million,
including a $388 million net benefit from the current period impact of incorporating the net hedging impact into our best estimate of gross profits used to set amortization rates.

Results for 2011 reflected significant capital markets
volatility in the second half of the year. The $1,297 million net charge related to the net hedging impact, excluding assumption updates, primarily reflected liability basis differences and rebalancing costs and volatility. The $4,786 million
benefit due to the change in the NPR adjustment was driven by increases in the base embedded derivative liability before NPR primarily due to significant declines in risk-free interest rates and the impact of account value performance, as well as
the widening of our NPR credit spreads. We also included these items in gross profits used to calculate the amortization of DAC, which resulted in a net charge of $1,591 million, including a $130 million net charge from the current period impact of
incorporating the cumulative net hedging impact into our best estimate of gross profits used to set amortization rates.

Results for 2010 primarily reflected a $902 million net charge related to the impact of assumption updates, reflecting reductions in the
expected lapse rate assumption based on actual experience. This net charge was partially offset by a $412 million benefit due to the change in the NPR adjustment, reflecting increases in the base embedded derivative liability before NPR primarily
due to lower interest rates.

For information
regarding the Capital Protection Framework we use to evaluate and support the risks of our hedging program, see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital—Capital Protection Framework.”

Retirement

Operating Results

The following table sets forth the Retirement segment’s
operating results for the periods indicated.

Adjusted Operating Income

2012 to 2011 Annual
Comparison.

Adjusted operating income increased $44 million. The increase includes $78 million related to a legal settlement in 2012, in which we recovered losses previously incurred related to reimbursements of client
losses on certain investment funds managed by an unaffiliated asset manager. The increase also includes a $6 million favorable comparative impact from certain changes in our estimated profitability of the business on the amortization of DAC and
VOBA, which resulted in net charges of $18 million and $24 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. These changes were primarily related to our annual review and update of assumptions performed in the third quarter, driven by a reduction to long-term
interest and equity rate of return assumptions in 2012, and driven by changes to expense and net cash flow assumptions in 2011. Partially offsetting these increases in adjusted operating income was a $29 million charge in 2012 to write off an
intangible asset due to the impact of the prolonged economic downturn on the expected results of a business we acquired in 2008, as well as a $9 million charge in 2012 from costs related to the divestiture of bank deposits in connection with our
decision to limit the operations of Prudential Bank & Trust, FSB (“PB&T”) to trust services.



Excluding these items, adjusted operating income decreased $2 million, as higher asset-based
fee income and net investment spread results were more than offset by higher general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, and an unfavorable comparative reserve impact from case experience. The increase in asset-based fee income
primarily reflects higher investment-only stable value account values driven by net additions, partially offset by lower full service fee income primarily due to outflows of contracts earning higher than average margins. The increase in net
investment spread results primarily reflects higher institutional investment products account values, driven by two significant pension risk transfer transactions within our non-participating group annuity product offering in the fourth quarter of
2012. Also contributing to net investment spread results were increases from the impacts of crediting rate reductions, higher full service general account stable value account values and higher income from alternative investments, partially offset
by decreases from the impacts of lower reinvestment rates and the divestiture of bank deposits in 2012. Higher general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, primarily reflect increased costs to support strategic initiatives and
business expansion, partially offset by lower costs related to legal matters. The unfavorable comparative reserve impact from case experience was primarily driven by unfavorable mortality experience in 2012. For additional information on the two
significant pension risk transfer transactions in the fourth quarter of 2012, see “—Executive Summary—Current Developments.”

2011 to 2010 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income increased $29 million. The increase includes a $17
million unfavorable comparative impact from certain changes in our estimated profitability of the business on the amortization of DAC and VOBA, which resulted in net charges of $24 million and $7 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. These changes
were driven by quarterly adjustments for current period experience, as well our annual review and update of assumptions performed in the third quarter, driven by changes to expense and net cash flow assumptions in 2011, and driven by changes in
lapse rate and fee-based profit margin assumptions in 2010.

Excluding these items, AOI increased $46 million, primarily reflecting higher asset-based fee income, partially offset by lower net investment spread results and higher general and administrative
expenses, net of capitalization. Higher asset-based fee income was driven by an increase in investment-only stable value account values driven by net additions, and higher average full service fee-based account values driven by market appreciation.
Lower net investment spread results were driven by lower reinvestment rates, and the unfavorable impact of changes in the market values of alternative investments and equity investments in certain separate accounts. Partially offsetting these
declines were the impacts of crediting rate reductions and higher full service general account stable value account values. Higher general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, were driven by costs related to legal matters and
strategic initiatives, partially offset by a decline in charges related to certain cost reduction initiatives.

Revenues, Benefits and Expenses

2012 to 2011 Annual Comparison.

Revenues, as shown in the table above under “—Operating
Results,” increased $31,724 million. Premiums increased $31,622 million, primarily driven by the significant pension risk transfer transactions discussed above. The increase in premiums resulted in a corresponding increase in
policyholders’ benefits, including the change in policy reserves, discussed below. Policy charges and fee income, and asset management fees and other income increased $77 million, primarily from higher asset-based fees on investment-only stable
value account values and higher income from alternative investments accounted for under the fair value option, partially offset by lower asset-based fees on full service fee-based account values. Net investment income increased $25 million primarily
reflecting the impacts of higher institutional investment products account values, driven by the significant pension risk transfer transactions, higher full service general account stable value account values, and a favorable impact from changes in
the market values of equity-method alternative investments, partially offset by the impacts of lower portfolio yields and the divestiture of bank deposits in 2012.

Benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under
“—Operating Results,” increased $31,680 million. Policyholders’ benefits, including the change in policy reserves, increased $31,723 million, driven by the significant pension risk transfer transactions associated with the
increase in premiums discussed above. Absent this increase and the $46 million net decrease associated with the legal settlement, changes in our estimated profitability of the business on the amortization of DAC and VOBA, intangible asset write off
and costs related



to the divestiture of bank deposits, discussed above, benefits and expenses increased $3 million. General and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, increased $12 million, primarily
reflecting increased costs to support strategic initiatives and business expansion, partially offset by lower costs related to legal matters. The amortization of DAC increased $6 million, reflecting an increase from the amortization of acquisition
costs related to the significant pension risk transfer transactions, partially offset by a decrease related to a refinement associated with certain structured settlements recorded in 2011. Interest credited to policyholders’ account balances
decreased $20 million primarily driven by the impacts of crediting rate reductions and the divestiture of bank deposits in 2012, partially offset by the impact of higher full service general account stable value account values and an increase
related to a refinement associated with certain structured settlements recorded in 2011.

2011 to 2010 Annual Comparison.

Revenues decreased $312 million. Premiums decreased $286 million, driven by lower life-contingent structured settlement and single-premium
annuity sales, partially offset by higher pension risk transfer transactions within our non-participating group annuity product offering. The decrease in premiums resulted in a corresponding decrease in policyholders’ benefits, including the
change in policy reserves, discussed below. Net investment income decreased $60 million primarily reflecting lower portfolio yields and the unfavorable impact of changes in the market values of equity-method alternative investments and equity
investments in certain separate accounts, partially offset by higher full service general account stable value account values. Policy charges and fee income and asset management fees and other income increased $34 million, primarily driven by
an increase in asset-based fees due to an increase in investment-only stable value account values and average full service fee-based account values. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in the market values of
certain alternative investments accounted for under the fair value option.

Benefits and expenses decreased $341 million. Absent the $17 million increase from the impact of changes in our estimated profitability of the business on the amortization of DAC and VOBA discussed above,
benefits and expenses decreased $358 million. Policyholders’ benefits, including the change in policy reserves, decreased $254 million, primarily reflecting a decrease in change in policy reserves associated with the decrease in premiums
discussed above. Interest credited to policyholders’ account balances decreased $119 million including a refinement associated with certain structured settlements recorded in 2011. Also contributing to the decrease were the impacts of crediting
rate reductions, partially offset by the impact of higher full service general account stable value account values. The amortization of DAC increased $22 million primarily driven by a refinement associated with certain structured settlement
contracts recorded in 2011.



Account Values

Our account values are a significant driver of our operating
results, and are primarily driven by net additions (withdrawals) and the impact of market changes. For our fee-based products, the income we earn varies with the level of fee-based account values, since many policy fees are determined by these
values. For our spread-based products, both the investment income and interest we credit to policyholders vary with the level of general account values. To a lesser extent, changes in account values impact our pattern of amortization of DAC and
VOBA, and general and administrative expenses. The following table shows the changes in the account values and net additions (withdrawals) of Retirement segment products for the periods indicated. Net additions (withdrawals) are deposits and sales
or additions, as applicable, minus withdrawals and benefits. Account values include both internally- and externally-managed client balances as the total balances drive revenue for the Retirement segment. For more information on internally-managed
balances see “—Asset Management.”

(1)

Ending total account value for the full service business includes assets of Prudential’s retirement plan of $6.6 billion, $6.3 billion and $5.8 billion as of
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

(2)

Change in market value, interest credited and interest income and other activity includes $(1.4) billion for 2012 representing the divestiture of bank deposits held by
PB&T, as a result of our decision to limit its operations to trust services. Other activity also includes $469 million in 2011 representing the addition of Prudential’s non-qualified pension plan transferred from a third-party
administrator.

(3)

Ending total account value for the institutional investment products business includes assets of Prudential’s retirement plan of $6.1 billion, $5.8 billion
and $5.4 billion as of December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Ending total account value for the institutional investment products business also includes $1.9 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2012, 2011
and 2010, respectively, related to collateralized funding agreements issued to the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (FHLBNY), and $0.5 billion and $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, related to affiliated funding
agreements issued to Prudential Financial. For additional information, see Note 10 and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(4)

Additions include $1,008 million in 2012 representing transfers of externally-managed client balances to accounts we manage. These additions are offset within Other.

(5)

Withdrawals and benefits include $(902) million, $(78) million and $(752) million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, representing transfers of client balances from
accounts we manage to externally-managed accounts. These withdrawals are offset within Other.

(6)

Other includes $(106) million, $78 million and $752 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, representing net transfers of externally-managed client balances
from/(to) accounts we manage. These transfers are offset within Additions or Withdrawals and benefits.

(7)

Ending total account value for the institutional investment products business includes investment-only stable value account values of $60.8 billion, $41.3 billion and
$17.7 billion as of December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $33.7 billion as of December 31, 2012 related to the two significant pension risk transfer transactions in the fourth quarter of 2012.

(8)

Net additions for the institutional investment products business include investment-only stable value net additions of $17.5 billion, $22.3 billion and $12.6
billion for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and $33.6 billion for 2012 related to the two significant pension risk transfer transactions in the fourth quarter of 2012.



2012 to 2011 Annual Comparison.

The increase in full service
account values primarily reflects equity market appreciation in 2012, partially offset by net withdrawals and the divestiture of bank deposits discussed above. The increase in net withdrawals was primarily due to an increase in the value of
participant withdrawals, driven by the impact of equity market appreciation on account values.

The increase in institutional investment products account values primarily reflects net additions and increases in the market value of customer funds driven by declines in fixed income yields. The
increase in net additions was driven by the two significant pension risk transfer transactions discussed above, partially offset by a decrease in sales of our investment-only stable value product, resulting from some of our existing intermediary
relationships nearing saturation levels.

to 2010 Annual Comparison.

The decrease in full service account values was primarily driven by net withdrawals over the last twelve months. The decrease in net additions (withdrawals) primarily reflects a lower volume of
large new plan sales and higher plan lapses, driven by higher account values and a higher volume of large plan lapses.

The increase in institutional investment products account values was driven by additions of our investment-only stable value and
structured settlements products, as well as sales of our longevity reinsurance product, which we introduced in 2011. To a lesser extent, the increase in account values was also driven by increases in the market value of customer funds primarily from
declines in fixed income yields, partially offset by decreases in account values from declines in general account guaranteed investment product account values. The increase in net additions primarily reflects higher sales of our investment-only
stable value and longevity reinsurance products, and lower general account guaranteed investment product scheduled withdrawals.

Asset Management

Operating Results

The following table sets forth the Asset Management segment’s operating results for the periods indicated.

Adjusted Operating Income

2012 to 2011 Annual
Comparison.

Adjusted operating income decreased $279 million. The decrease reflects a $131 million lower contribution from the segment’s strategic investing activities in 2012 largely due to $69 million of
declines in values in two real estate investments, one of which was sold in 2012, while strategic investing activities in 2011 included a $64 million gain on a partial sale of a real estate seed investment. The decrease in adjusted operating income
also reflects the absence of a $96 million gain on sale of our investment in an operating joint venture in 2011, as discussed below. Additionally, results for 2012 reflect an increase in operating expenses reflecting business growth, increased
expenses related to new fund launches and increased compensation costs.

These decreases were partially offset by an increase in asset management fees, before associated expenses, primarily from institutional and retail customer assets as a result of higher asset values due to
positive net asset flows and market appreciation in 2012.



2011 to 2010 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income
increased $276 million. Results in 2011 reflect an increase in asset management fees, before associated expenses, of $215 million primarily from retail and institutional customer assets as a result of higher asset values due to positive net asset
flows primarily into fixed income accounts as well as market appreciation in 2011. Also contributing to the increase was a $96 million gain on sale of our investment in an operating joint venture, Afore XXI, a pension fund manager in Mexico.
Results from the segment’s commercial mortgage activities increased $77 million primarily driven by lower net credit and valuation-related charges on interim loans of $64 million resulting primarily from loan payoffs in 2011 and $20 million of
higher gains on sales of foreclosed commercial real estate assets in 2011. Also, results of the segment’s strategic investing activities increased $68 million primarily due to a $64 million gain resulting from the partial sale of a real estate
seed investment in 2011 as discussed above.

These
increases were partially offset by increased operating expenses, primarily related to compensation as well as other costs supporting the business.

Revenues and Expenses

The following table sets forth the Asset Management segment’s revenues, presented on a basis consistent with the table above under
“—Operating Results,” by type.

(1)

Consists of fees from: (a) individual mutual funds and both variable annuities and variable life insurance asset management revenues from our separate accounts;
(b) funds invested in proprietary mutual funds through our defined contribution plan products; and (c) third-party sub-advisory relationships. Revenues from fixed annuities and the fixed-rate accounts of both variable annuities and
variable life insurance are included in the general account.

(2)

Includes mortgage origination and spread lending revenues of our commercial mortgage origination and servicing business.

(3)

Includes payments from Wells Fargo under an agreement dated as of July 30, 2004 implementing arrangements with respect to money market mutual funds in connection
with the combination of our retail securities brokerage and clearing operations with those of Wells Fargo. The agreement extends for ten years after termination of the Wachovia Securities joint venture, which occurred on December 31, 2009. The
revenue from Wells Fargo under this agreement was $66 million in 2012, $74 million in 2011 and $66 million in 2010.

2012 to 2011 Annual Comparison.

Revenues, as shown in the table above under “—Operating
Results,” decreased $133 million. Strategic investing revenues decreased $130 million reflecting $69 million of declines in values in two real estate investments, one of which was sold in 2012, while strategic investing activities in 2011
include the gain on a partial sale of a real estate seed investment, as discussed above. Service, distribution and other revenues decreased $127 million primarily due to the absence of the gain on the sale of our investment in Afore XXI in 2011.
Performance-based incentive fees decreased $35 million primarily reflecting lower net asset values from institutional real estate funds resulting from market value declines. A portion of incentive-based fees are offset in incentive compensation
expense in accordance with the terms of contractual agreements. Certain of our incentive fees continue to be subject to positive or negative future adjustment based on cumulative fund performance in relation to specified benchmarks. As of
December 31, 2012, $84 million in cumulative incentive



fee revenue, net of compensation, is subject to future adjustment. Future incentive, transaction, strategic investing and commercial mortgage revenues will be impacted by the level and
diversification of our strategic investments, the commercial real estate market, and other domestic and international market conditions.

Partially offsetting the decreases in revenue above was an increase in asset management fees of $126 million primarily from the
management of institutional and retail customer assets as a result of higher asset values. In addition commercial mortgage revenues increased $28 million primarily reflecting higher origination volume.

Expenses, as shown in the table above under
“—Operating Results,” increased $146 million primarily driven by business growth, increased expenses related to new fund launches and increased compensation costs.

2011 to 2010 Annual
Comparison.

Revenues increased $526 million including a $215 million increase in asset management fees primarily from institutional and retail customer assets as a result of higher asset values. Service, distribution and
other revenues increased $182 million primarily from the gain on the sale of our investment in Afore XXI and higher mutual fund service fees, a portion of which are offset with a corresponding increase in expenses. Service, distribution and other
revenues also includes higher revenues from certain consolidated funds, which were fully offset by higher expenses related to noncontrolling interest in these funds. Commercial mortgage revenues increased $69 million primarily reflecting lower net
credit and valuation-related charges on interim loans and higher gains on sales of foreclosed real estate assets, as discussed above. Strategic investing revenues increased $69 million resulting from the gain on a partial sale of a real estate seed
investment discussed above.

Partially offsetting
these increases was a decrease in performance-based incentive fees of $21 million primarily driven by lower net asset values of institutional real estate funds reflecting the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on these funds in the prior year,
a portion of which has been hedged since late 2010, as well as a decline in real estate values in 2011. A portion of incentive-based fees are offset in incentive compensation expense in accordance with the terms of contractual agreements.

Expenses increased $250 million primarily driven
by increased compensation costs, from increased revenues, as discussed above, and increased headcount, as well as increases in other costs supporting the business. In addition, expenses related to revenues associated with certain consolidated funds
and mutual funds services increased, as discussed above.

Assets Under Management

The following table sets forth assets under management by asset class and source as of the dates indicated.



(1)

Consists of third party institutional assets and group insurance contracts.

(2)

As of December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, includes $37.2 billion, $29.7 billion, and $17.7 billion, respectively, of assets under management related to
investment-only stable value products.

(3)

Consists of: (a) individual mutual funds and both variable annuities and variable life insurance assets in our separate accounts; (b) funds invested in
proprietary mutual funds through our defined contribution plan products; and (c) third-party sub-advisory relationships. Fixed annuities and the fixed-rate accounts of both variable annuities and variable life insurance are included in the
general account.

The following
table sets forth the component changes in assets under management by asset source for the periods indicated.

(1)

Institutional third-party net additions include net additions into fixed income accounts of $6.4 billion and $10.0 billion related to investment-only stable value
products for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

(2)

Retail affiliated net additions (withdrawals) primarily represent asset transfers in or (out) of fixed income funds due to the automatic rebalancing feature within
certain variable annuities products.

(3)

General account affiliated net additions (withdrawals) includes net additions of $31.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012 from two significant pension
risk transfer transactions in the Retirement segment and net additions of $40.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 from the acquisition of the Star and Edison Businesses.

(4)

Other includes the effect of foreign exchange rate changes and net money market activity. Other in 2011 also includes the sale of our investment in the Afore XXI
operating joint venture and transfers from the Retirement segment as a result of changes in the client contract form.

Strategic Investments

The following table sets forth the strategic investments of the Asset Management segment at carrying value (including the value of
derivative instruments used to mitigate equity market and currency risk) by asset class and source as of the dates indicated.



In addition to the strategic investments above, the Asset Management segment’s
commercial mortgage operations maintains an interim loan portfolio. See “—General Account Investments—Invested Assets of Other Entities and Operations—Commercial Mortgage and Other Loans” below for additional details.

U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance Division

Individual Life

Operating Results

The following table sets forth the Individual Life
segment’s operating results for the periods indicated.

Adjusted Operating
Income

2012 to 2011 Annual
Comparison.

Adjusted operating income decreased $98 million including a $54 million unfavorable comparative change from the impact of certain changes in the estimated profitability of the business on the amortization
of DAC and unearned revenue reserves (“URR”) as well as the impact on the reserve for the GMDB feature in certain contracts. These changes were based on the annual review and update of economic and actuarial assumptions, which resulted in
a net charge of $27 million in 2012 driven by a reduction to long-term interest rate and equity return assumptions and a net benefit of $27 million in 2011, driven by more favorable lapse and mortality experience.

Absent the effect of these items, adjusted operating income
decreased $44 million driven by $20 million of transaction and other costs associated with our acquisition of The Hartford’s individual life insurance business and a $13 million decrease in earnings reflecting the impact of mortality
experience, net of reinsurance, which was more unfavorable in the current period, in comparison to 2011. Also contributing to the decrease in adjusted operating income was a decline in earnings from our variable products primarily due to the
continued expected run-off of variable policies in force and lower net investment results from declines in portfolio reinvestment rates. These unfavorable items were partially offset by greater contributions from our universal life insurance
products reflecting business growth.

For weighted
average rate of return assumptions and additional information on our policy for amortizing DAC and URR, and for estimating future expected claims costs associated with the GMDB feature of our variable and universal life insurance products as of
December 31, 2012, see “—Accounting Policies & Pronouncements—Application of Critical Accounting Estimates.”

2011 to 2010 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income was unchanged from 2010 due to a number of
offsetting items. Results in 2011 included a $27 million benefit reflecting the impact of certain changes in the estimated profitability of the business related to the annual review and update of economic and actuarial assumptions, as discussed
above, compared to a $28 million benefit from the annual review in 2010. Results for 2011 also benefitted from business growth associated with our universal life insurance products and mortality experience, net of reinsurance, which was $12 million
less unfavorable compared to 2010. Partially offsetting these favorable items was an $11 million expense resulting from changes in our estimates of total gross profits arising from separate account fund performance, largely reflecting the
comparative impact of equity markets on separate account fund performance. Lower than expected market returns in 2011 resulted in a net expense of $4 million whereas higher than expected market returns in 2010 resulted in a $7 million net
benefit.



Revenues, Benefits and Expenses

2012 to 2011 Annual
Comparison.

Revenues, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased $467 million. This increase was primarily driven by a $403 million increase in policy charges and fees and asset
management fees and other income including $227 million from higher amortization of URR. The increase in amortization of URR reflects the impact of the annual reviews and update of economic and actuarial assumptions partially offset by the impact of
changes in our estimates of total gross profits primarily reflecting more favorable market conditions on separate account fund performance. The increase in policy charges and fees and asset management fees and other income also reflects a $73
million increase in income on an affiliated note received as part of a financing transaction for certain regulatory capital requirements which was offset by higher interest expense, as described below, as well as growth in our universal life
insurance business and higher income from alternative investments. These favorable items were partially offset by the ongoing impact of run-off of variable life insurance inforce. Net investment income increased $55 million reflecting business
growth, partially offset by the impact of lower portfolio reinvestment rates.

Benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased $565 million, including the impact of $300 million associated with annual reviews conducted in both
periods. Absent these annual reviews, the increase in benefits and expenses was $265 million which includes higher interest expense of $102 million reflecting higher costs associated with the financing of regulatory capital requirements, of which
$73 million related to a financing transaction associated with certain universal life insurance policies is offset in revenues. Policyholders’ benefits increased $80 million driven by growth in our term and universal life blocks of business.
The increase in benefits and expenses also included $52 million of higher general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, including the impact of increased sales and $20 million of transaction and other costs associated with our
acquisition of The Hartford’s individual life insurance business. In addition, interest credited to policyholders’ account balances increased $30 million primarily reflecting higher universal life account balances from policyholder
deposits. These unfavorable items were partially offset by a $28 million benefit on DAC amortization resulting from more favorable market conditions on separate account fund performance in comparison to 2011.

2011 to 2010 Annual
Comparison.

Revenues increased $83 million driven by higher net investment income of $75 million reflecting higher asset balances resulting from increased policyholder deposits and higher regulatory capital requirements
associated with our universal life insurance product. Policy charges and fees and asset management fees and other income increased $6 million, including a $24 million reduction in amortization of URR reflecting the impact of the annual reviews and
update of economic and actuarial assumptions, as discussed above. These favorable items were partially offset by a decline in revenue from our variable insurance products primarily due to the run-off of variable policies inforce.

Benefits and expenses increased $83 million driven by higher
interest expense of $52 million primarily reflecting higher borrowings related to the financing of regulatory capital requirements associated with certain term and universal life insurance policies which was offset in revenues. Insurance and annuity
benefits, including interest credited to policyholders’ account balances, increased $16 million primarily reflecting an increase in interest credited to policyholders from higher universal life account balances from increased policyholder
deposits and increases in policyholder reserves driven by growth in our term and universal life blocks of business. This was partially offset by less unfavorable mortality experience of $12 million in 2011 compared to 2010. Additionally,
amortization of DAC increased $15 million driven by the comparative impact of less favorable market conditions on separate account fund performance.



Sales Results

The following table sets forth individual life insurance
annualized new business premiums for the periods indicated.

(1)

Excludes corporate-owned life insurance.

2012 to 2011 Annual Comparison.

Annualized new business premiums increased $134 million primarily driven by
increased sales of universal life insurance products in the third party distribution channel due to a change in the competitive position of our products.

2011 to 2010 Annual Comparison.

Annualized new business premiums increased $18 million primarily driven by
increased sales in the third party distribution channel. This increase was attributable to higher sales of universal life insurance products driven by a change in the competitive position of our products.

Group Insurance

Operating Results

The following table sets forth the Group Insurance
segment’s operating results for the periods indicated.

Adjusted Operating Income

2012 to 2011 Annual
Comparison.

Adjusted operating income decreased $147 million reflecting higher operating expenses in 2012 primarily from an increase in legal reserves, updates to premium tax estimates, and costs for strategic initiatives.
Group life underwriting results were less favorable in 2012, primarily driven by unfavorable claims experience on non-retrospectively experience-rated contracts resulting from an increase in severity partially offset by lower claims incidence. The
unfavorable underwriting results for group life also reflect the absence of a benefit from cumulative premium adjustments in 2011, as discussed below. Group disability underwriting results were less favorable in 2012. New long term disability claims
outpaced an increase in claim terminations as the economy slowly improves. We are investing in our claims management process



which, over time, should drive improvements in this area. Also, reserve refinements in both group life and group disability businesses, including the impact of annual actuarial assumption
updates, contributed a $7 million benefit to adjusted operating income in 2012 compared to a benefit of $22 million in 2011. Partially offsetting these unfavorable items was improved investment income in 2012 primarily from alternative investments.

2011 to 2010 Annual
Comparison.

Adjusted operating income decreased $11 million. Reserve refinements in both group life and group disability businesses, including the impact of annual actuarial assumption updates, contributed a $22 million
benefit to adjusted operating income in 2011 compared to a benefit of $35 million in 2010. Excluding these reserve refinements, adjusted operating income increased $2 million primarily from more favorable underwriting results in 2011 in our group
life business related to favorable claims experience, growth in our non-retrospectively experience-rated business and a benefit of $14 million from cumulative premium adjustments relating to prior periods on two large non-retrospectively
experience-rated cases. These increases were partially offset by less favorable group disability underwriting results in 2011 primarily related to an increase in the number and severity of long-term disability claims reflecting the continued
economic downturn. In addition, results in 2011 reflect higher operating expenses due to business growth and strategic initiatives as well as a decrease in investment results due to less favorable results from alternative investments and lower
reinvestment rates.

Revenues, Benefits and
Expenses

2012 to 2011 Annual
Comparison.

Revenues, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” decreased $5 million. Group life premiums and policy charges and fee income decreased $82 million primarily reflecting lower
premiums from retrospectively experience-rated contracts, largely resulting from a decrease in policyholder benefits. Partially offsetting this decrease are higher premiums from non-retrospectively experience-rated contracts reflecting growth in the
business, partially offset by the benefit from cumulative premium adjustments in 2011. Group disability premiums and policy charges and fee income increased $42 million primarily reflecting growth of business in force and from new sales.
Investment income also increased in 2012 primarily from income on alternative investments, partially offset by a decline in reinvestment rates.

Benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased $142 million reflecting higher
operating expenses primarily from an increase in legal reserves, updates to premium tax estimates and costs of strategic initiatives. This increase also reflects a $54 million increase in policyholders’ benefits, including the change in policy
reserves. Our group disability business reflects an increase in policyholders’ benefits primarily from an increase in the number and severity of long-term disability claims and growth in the business. Our group life business reflects a decrease
in benefits costs on retrospectively experience-rated business that resulted in decreased premiums, as discussed above. This is partially offset by unfavorable claims experience from an increase in severity resulting in an increase in benefits from
growth in the non-retrospectively experience-rated business, as well as the unfavorable variance from reserve refinements, as discussed above.

2011 to 2010 Annual Comparison.

Revenues increased $566 million. Group life premiums and policy charges and
fee income increased $526 million. This increase primarily reflects higher premiums from non-retrospectively experience-rated contracts reflecting growth in the business from new sales and continued strong persistency of 95.8% in 2011 compared to
92.1% in 2010, as well as higher premiums from retrospectively experience-rated contracts resulting from the increase in policyholder benefits on these contracts, as discussed below. 2011 also includes the benefit from cumulative premium
adjustments, as discussed above. In addition, group disability premiums and policy charges and fee income increased $45 million primarily reflecting growth of business in force and from new sales.

Benefits and expenses increased $577 million. This increase
reflects a $536 million increased in policyholders’ benefits, including the change in policy reserves. Our group life business reflected an increase in policyholders’ benefits primarily from growth in the business, including an increase in
benefits on retrospectively experience-rated business that resulted in increased premiums, as discussed above. Our group disability business reflected an increase in policyholders’ benefits primarily from an increase in the number and severity
of disability claims, as well as growth in the business. Also contributing to the increase in benefits and expenses were higher operating expenses primarily related to business growth and strategic initiatives.



Benefits and Expense Ratios

The following table sets forth the Group Insurance segment’s benefits and administrative operating expense
ratios for the periods indicated.

(1)

Ratio of policyholder benefits to earned premiums, policy charges and fee income. Group disability ratios include dental products.

(2)

Ratio of administrative operating expenses (excluding commissions) to gross premiums, policy charges and fee income. Group disability ratios include dental products.

2012 to 2011 Annual
Comparison.

The group life benefits ratio deteriorated 1.4 percentage points primarily due to less favorable claims experience in the non-retrospectively experience-rated business as well as the unfavorable impact of the
reserve refinements and the cumulative premium adjustment in 2011, as discussed above. The group disability benefits ratio deteriorated 3.4 percentage points primarily due to an increase in the number and severity of long-term disability claims
experience. The group life administrative operating expense ratio deteriorated 1.5 percentage points primarily due to an increase in operating costs, legal reserves and the unfavorable comparative impact of updates to premium tax estimates, as
discussed above. The group disability administrative operating expense ratio deteriorated 0.5 due to an increase in operating costs, as discussed above.

2011 to 2010 Annual Comparison.

The group life benefits ratio improved 0.2 percentage points, primarily due
to favorable claims experience, partially offset by an unfavorable variance from the impact of reserve refinements, as discussed above. The group disability benefits ratio deteriorated 3.5 percentage points primarily due to an increase in the number
and severity of long-term disability claims experience. The group life administrative operating expense ratio improved 0.5 percentage points due to business growth without a commensurate increase in expenses and a favorable comparative impact from
the refinement of a premium tax estimate. The group disability administrative operating expense ratio deteriorated 0.6 percentage points reflecting higher expenses in 2011 primarily from business growth and strategic initiatives.

Sales Results

The following table sets forth the Group Insurance
segment’s annualized new business premiums for the periods indicated.

(1)

Amounts exclude new premiums resulting from rate changes on existing policies, from additional coverage under our Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance contract and
from excess premiums on group universal life insurance that build cash value but do not purchase face amounts, and include premiums from the takeover of claim liabilities.

(2)

Includes dental products.

2012 to 2011 Annual Comparison.

Total annualized new business premiums decreased $196 million reflecting the
impact of a large market case sale to a new customer in 2011 in group life, as well as a decrease in sales of long-term disability to existing clients.



2011 to 2010 Annual Comparison.

Total annualized new business
premiums increased $67 million reflecting the impact of the group life large market case sale discussed above as well as increased sales across all disability products.

International Insurance Division

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Movements and Related Hedging
Strategies

As a U.S.-based company with
significant business operations outside the U.S., particularly in Japan, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate movements that could impact our U.S. dollar-equivalent shareholder return on equity. We seek to mitigate this impact through
various hedging strategies, including the use of derivative contracts and through holding U.S. dollar-denominated assets in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.

The operations of our International Insurance Division are subject to currency fluctuations that can materially affect their U.S.
dollar-equivalent earnings from period to period, even if earnings on a local currency basis are relatively constant. We enter into forward currency derivative contracts, and hold “dual currency” and “synthetic dual currency”
investments, as part of our strategy to effectively fix the currency exchange rates for a portion of our prospective non-U.S. dollar-denominated earnings streams, thereby reducing earnings volatility from foreign currency exchange rate movements.
The forward currency hedging program is primarily associated with our insurance operations in Japan and Korea. In addition, our Japanese insurance operations offer a variety of non-yen denominated products which are supported by investments in
corresponding currencies. While these non-yen denominated assets and liabilities are economically hedged, the accounting for changes in the value of these assets and liabilities due to changes in foreign currency exchange rate movements differs,
resulting in volatility in reported U.S. GAAP earnings. For further information on the various hedging strategies used to mitigate the risks of foreign currency exchange rate movements on earnings, see “—Impact of foreign currency exchange
rate movements on earnings.”

We utilize a
yen hedging strategy that calibrates the level of hedges to preserve the relative contribution of our yen-based business to the Company’s overall return on equity. Our hedges include a variety of instruments, including U.S. dollar-denominated
assets held locally by our Japanese insurance subsidiaries financed by the combination of U.S. GAAP equity and yen-denominated liabilities. We may also hedge using instruments held in our U.S. domiciled entities, such as U.S. dollar-denominated debt
that has been swapped to yen.

The table below
presents the aggregate amount of instruments that serve to hedge the impact of foreign currency exchange movements on our U.S. dollar-equivalent shareholder return on equity from our Japanese insurance subsidiaries for the periods indicated.

(1)

Represents the notional amount of forward currency contracts outstanding.

(2)

Represents the present value of future cash flows, on a U.S. dollar-denominated basis.



(3)

Excludes $26.8 billion and $23.7 billion as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, of U.S. dollar assets supporting U.S. dollar liabilities related to U.S.
dollar-denominated products issued by our Japanese insurance operations.

(4)

The yen-denominated liabilities are reported in Corporate and Other operations.

The U.S. dollar-denominated investments that hedge the U.S.
dollar-equivalent shareholder return on equity from our Japanese insurance operations are recorded on the books of yen-based entities and, as a result, foreign currency exchange rate movements will impact their value on the local books of our
yen-based Japanese insurance entities. We seek to mitigate the risk that future unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements will decrease the value of these U.S. dollar-denominated investments on the local books of our yen-based Japanese
insurance entities and therefore negatively impact their equity and regulatory solvency margins by employing internal hedging strategies between a subsidiary of Prudential Financial and these yen-based entities. These internal hedging strategies
have the economic effect of moving the change in value of these U.S. dollar-denominated investments due to foreign currency exchange rate movements from our Japanese yen-based entities to our U.S. dollar-based entities. See “—Liquidity and
Capital Resources—Liquidity—Liquidity associated with other activities—Foreign exchange hedging activities” for a discussion of our internal hedging strategies.

These U.S. dollar-denominated investments also pay a coupon
which is generally higher than what a similar yen-denominated investment would pay. The incremental impact of this higher yield on our U.S. dollar-denominated investments, as well as our dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments
discussed below, will vary over time, and is dependent on the duration of the underlying investments, as well as interest rate environments in the U.S. and Japan at the time of the investments. See “—General Account
Investments—Investment Results” for a discussion of the investment yields generated by our Japanese insurance operations.

Impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on earnings

Forward currency hedging program

The financial results of our International Insurance segment
reflect the impact of an intercompany arrangement with Corporate and Other operations pursuant to which the segment’s non-U.S. dollar-denominated earnings are translated at fixed currency exchange rates. The fixed rates are determined in
connection with a foreign currency income hedging program designed to mitigate the impact of exchange rate changes on the segment’s U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings. Pursuant to this program, Corporate and Other operations execute forward
currency contracts with third parties to sell the net exposure of projected earnings for certain currencies in exchange for U.S. dollars at specified exchange rates. The maturities of these contracts correspond with the future periods (typically on
a three-year rolling basis) in which the identified non-U.S. dollar-denominated earnings are expected to be generated. In establishing the level of non-U.S. dollar-denominated earnings that will be hedged through this program, we exclude the
anticipated level of U.S. dollar-denominated earnings that will be generated by dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments, as well as the anticipated level of non-yen denominated earnings that will be generated by non-yen denominated
products and investments, both of which are discussed in greater detail below.

As a result of this intercompany arrangement, our International Insurance segment’s results for 2012 and 2011 reflect the impact of translating yen-denominated earnings at fixed currency exchange
rates of 85 and 92 yen per U.S. dollar, respectively, and 1180 and 1190 Korean won per U.S. dollar, respectively. Results for 2013 will reflect the impact of translating yen and Korean won-denominated earnings at fixed currency exchange rates of 80
yen per U.S. dollar and 1160 Korean won per U.S. dollar.



Results of Corporate and Other operations include any differences between the translation
adjustments recorded by the segment at the fixed currency exchange rate versus the actual average rate during the period, and the gains or losses recorded from the forward currency contracts that settled during the period, which include the impact
of any over or under hedging of actual earnings that differ from projected earnings. The table below presents, for the periods indicated, the increase (decrease) to revenues and adjusted operating income for the International Insurance segment and
for Corporate and Other operations, reflecting the impact of this intercompany arrangement.

(1)

Represents the difference between non-U.S. dollar-denominated earnings translated on the basis of weighted average monthly currency exchange rates versus fixed currency
exchange rates determined in connection with the forward currency hedging program.

As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the notional amounts of these forward currency contracts were $3.4 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, of which $2.9 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, were
related to our Japanese insurance operations.

Dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments hedging program

In addition, our Japanese insurance operations hold dual currency investments in the form of fixed maturities
and loans. The principal of these dual currency investments is yen-denominated while the related interest income is U.S. dollar-denominated. These investments are the economic equivalent of exchanging what would otherwise be fixed streams of
yen-denominated interest income for fixed streams of U.S. dollar-denominated interest income. Our Japanese insurance operations also hold yen-denominated investments that have been coupled with cross-currency coupon swap agreements, creating
synthetic dual currency investments. The yen/U.S. dollar exchange rate is effectively fixed, as we are obligated in future periods to exchange fixed amounts of yen interest payments generated by the yen-denominated investments for fixed amounts of
U.S. dollar interest payments at the yen/U.S. dollar exchange rates specified by the cross-currency coupon swap agreements. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the notional amount of these investments was ¥235 billion, or $2.2 billion, and
¥280 billion, or $2.5 billion, respectively, based upon the foreign currency exchange rates applicable at the time these investments were acquired. The table below sets forth the fair value of these instruments as reflected on our balance sheet
for the periods indicated.

U.S. GAAP earnings impact
of products denominated in non-local currencies

Our international insurance operations primarily offer products denominated in local currency. However, several of our international insurance operations, most notably our Japanese operations, also offer
products denominated in non-local currencies, primarily comprised of U.S. and Australian dollar-denominated products. The non-yen denominated insurance liabilities related to these products are supported by investments denominated in corresponding
currencies, including a significant portion designated as available-for-sale. While



the impact from foreign currency exchange rate movements on these non-yen denominated assets and liabilities is economically matched, the accounting for changes in the value of these assets and
liabilities due to changes in foreign currency exchange rate movements differs, resulting in volatility in U.S. GAAP earnings. For example, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments, including those arising from foreign currency
exchange rate movements, are recorded in AOCI, whereas the non-yen denominated liabilities are remeasured for foreign currency exchange rate movements, and the related changes in value are recorded in earnings within “Asset management fees and
other income.” Investments designated as held-to-maturity under U.S. GAAP are recorded at amortized cost on the balance sheet, but are remeasured for foreign currency exchange rate movements, with the related change in value recorded in
earnings within “Asset management fees and other income.” Due to this non-economic volatility that is reflected in U.S. GAAP earnings, the gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of these non-yen denominated liabilities, and
certain related non-yen denominated assets, are excluded from adjusted operating income and included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments.” For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010,
“Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments” includes net losses of $1,570 million, net gains of $807 million, and net gains of $121 million, respectively, reflecting the remeasurement of these non-yen denominated
insurance liabilities, which are presented in the table below, and the remeasurement of certain related non-yen denominated assets.

We continue to expect volatility in U.S. GAAP earnings resulting from the remeasurement mismatch described above. For example, based on
the December 31, 2012 non-yen denominated balances subject to remeasurement (including those presented in the table below), if we applied a hypothetical 5% depreciation in value of the yen relative to the U.S. and Australian dollar, we estimate
this would result in net losses of approximately $1.2 billion reflected in U.S. GAAP earnings. These net losses would largely be offset by a corresponding increase in unrealized gains in AOCI. Conversely, a 5% appreciation in value of the yen
relative to these currencies would have an equal but opposite effect.

The table below presents the carrying value of non-yen denominated insurance liabilities within our Japanese insurance operations as of the periods indicated.

1.

Excludes $5.7 billion and $4.5 billion of insurance liabilities for U.S. dollar-denominated products as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, that are associated
with Prudential of Japan. These liabilities are coinsured to our U.S. domiciled insurance entities and supported by U.S. dollar-denominated assets and are not subject to the remeasurement mismatch described above.

International Insurance

Operating Results

The results of our International Insurance operations are
translated on the basis of weighted average monthly exchange rates, inclusive of the effects of the intercompany arrangement discussed above. To provide a better understanding of operating performance within the International Insurance segment,
where indicated below, we have analyzed our results of operations excluding the effect of the year over year change in foreign currency exchange rates. Our results of operations excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations were derived by
translating foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at uniform exchange rates for all periods presented, including for constant dollar information discussed below. The exchange rates used were Japanese yen at a rate of 80 yen per U.S. dollar and
Korean won at a rate of 1160 won per U.S. dollar, both of which were determined in connection with the foreign currency income hedging program discussed above. In addition, for constant dollar information discussed below, activity denominated in
U.S. dollars is generally reported based on the amounts as transacted in U.S. dollars. Annualized new business premiums presented on a constant exchange rate basis in the “Sales Results” section below reflect translation based on these
same uniform exchange rates.



The following table sets forth the International Insurance segment’s operating results
for the periods indicated.

(1)

Includes gains and losses from changes in value of certain assets and liabilities relating to foreign currency exchange movements that are economically matched, as
discussed above.

Acquisition and
Integration of the former Star and Edison Businesses

On February 1, 2011, Prudential Financial completed the acquisition from AIG of the Star and Edison Businesses pursuant to the stock purchase agreement dated September 30, 2010 between
Prudential Financial and AIG. The Star and Edison companies were merged into Gibraltar Life on January 1, 2012. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

We have made significant progress integrating the acquired
former Star and Edison businesses with Gibraltar Life and, as a result, anticipate incurring approximately $450 million of total integration costs, which is lower than our original expectations. In aggregate, we have incurred $312 million of pre-tax
integration costs, of which, $138 million was in 2012 and $174 million was in 2011. After integration is complete, we continue to expect annual cost savings of approximately $250 million and, as of December 31, 2012, have already achieved
approximately 80% of this annual savings. Actual integration costs may exceed, and actual cost savings may fall short of, such expectations.

Adjusted Operating Income

2012 to 2011 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income from Life Planner operations increased $235
million including a net favorable impact of $54 million from currency fluctuations. The current year benefited $20 million from a reduction in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and lower reserves, reflecting the impact of our
annual review and update of assumptions used in estimating the profitability of the business. In addition, the increase in adjusted operating income reflects the comparative impact of a $12 million charge associated with estimated claims and
expenses arising from the 2011 earthquake in Japan, and a $6 million benefit in 2012 resulting from a cash distribution received from the Japan Financial Stability Fund. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted operating income for our Life
Planner operations increased $143 million, primarily reflecting the growth of business in force driven by sales results and continued strong persistency in our Japanese Life Planner operation, partly offset by the impact of lower reinvestment rates.



Adjusted operating income from our Gibraltar Life and Other operations increased $206
million including a favorable impact of $51 million from currency fluctuations and the absence of a $49 million charge associated with claims and expenses arising from the 2011 earthquake in Japan. Additionally, results for 2012 include $138 million
of integration costs relating to the acquisition of the Star and Edison Businesses compared to $213 million of integration and transaction costs in 2011. Partly offsetting these favorable variances is a $15 million net charge in the current year
reflecting the impact of certain charges related to our life insurance joint venture in India offset by a cash distribution received from the Japan Financial Stability Fund. Both periods benefited from the impact of partial sales of our investment,
through a consortium, in China Pacific Group, which contributed a $60 million benefit to 2012 results compared to a $237 million benefit in 2011.

Excluding the effect of the items discussed above, adjusted operating income from our Gibraltar Life and Other operations increased $223
million, primarily reflecting cost savings of $165 million resulting from Star and Edison integration synergies, compared to $21 million of cost savings in 2011, as well as business growth, particularly in the bank distribution channel, and the
impact of including two additional months of earnings from the former Star and Edison Businesses. These favorable items were partly offset by higher benefits and expenses, including costs supporting distribution channel growth, less favorable
mortality in comparison to the prior year and the impact of lower reinvestment rates.

2011 to 2010 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income from our Life Planner operations increased $97 million including a net favorable impact of $11 million from currency
fluctuations. Excluding currency fluctuations, adjusted operating income increased $86 million primarily reflecting the growth of business in force driven by sales and continued strong persistency in our Japanese Life Planner operation and to a
lesser extent, lower administrative expenses due in part to the absence of certain costs incurred in 2010. Partially offsetting these favorable variances were charges of $12 million associated with claims and expenses arising from the March 2011
earthquake in Japan and less favorable mortality experience in Japan and Korea.

Adjusted operating income from our Gibraltar Life and Other operations increased $279 million including a favorable impact of $25 million from currency fluctuations. Excluding currency fluctuations,
adjusted operating income increased $254 million. Results for 2011 benefitted from $224 million of earnings from the acquired Star and Edison Businesses, excluding the impact of estimated claims associated with the earthquake in Japan. Adjusted
operating income for both 2011 and 2010 reflect the impact of partial sales of our investment, through a consortium, in China Pacific Group, which contributed a $237 million benefit to 2011 results compared to a $66 million benefit to 2010 results.
These favorable items were partially offset by transaction and integration costs of $213 million in 2011 relating to the Star and Edison acquisition and $49 million of charges associated with claims and expenses arising from the March 2011
earthquake in Japan.

Excluding the effect of the
items discussed above, adjusted operating income from our Gibraltar Life and Other operations increased $121 million reflecting business growth, including expanding sales of protection products, and improved investment results, including a greater
contribution from our fixed annuity products reflecting growth of that business and lower amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs. Partially offsetting these favorable variances were higher development costs supporting bank and agency
distribution channel growth and unfavorable results from our insurance joint venture in India.

Revenues, Benefits and Expenses

2012 to 2011 Annual Comparison.

Revenues from our Life Planner operations, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased $800 million
including a net unfavorable impact of $2 million from currency fluctuations. Excluding currency fluctuations, revenues increased $802 million primarily reflecting increases in premiums and policy charges and fee income of $616 million driven by
growth of business in force and continued strong persistency in our Japanese Life Planner operation. Net investment income increased $158 million reflecting investment portfolio growth, partially offset by the impact of lower reinvestment rates.

Benefits and expenses from our Life Planner
operations, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased $565 million including a net favorable impact of $56 million from currency fluctuations. Excluding currency fluctuations, benefits and expenses increased
$621 million. Benefits and expenses of our



Japanese Life Planner operation increased $513 million, primarily reflecting an increase in policyholder benefits due to changes in reserves driven by the growth in business in force, partially
offset by the absence of charges recognized in the prior year period associated with claims from the 2011 earthquake in Japan. Additionally, 2012 includes a $20 million benefit from a reduction in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition
costs and lower reserves, reflecting the impact of our annual review and update of assumptions used in estimating the profitability of the business.

Revenues from our Gibraltar Life and Other operations increased $9,219 million, including a net favorable impact of $159 million from
currency fluctuations. Excluding currency fluctuations, revenues increased $9,060 million. This increase is driven by an $8,884 million increase in premiums and policy charges and fee income reflecting growth in the bank distribution channel,
including $7,619 million of higher premiums from sales of yen-denominated single premium reduced death benefit whole life policies, as well as higher premiums of $1,074 million in the Life Consultant distribution channel driven by increased sales of
cancer whole life and U.S. dollar-denominated retirement income products. Also contributing to the increase in revenues is higher net investment income of $353 million primarily reflecting investment portfolio growth, partially offset by the
impact of lower reinvestment rates. Asset management fees and other income declined driven by the comparative impact of partial sales of our indirect investment in China Pacific Group, as discussed above, resulting in a $60 million gain in 2012
compared to a $237 million gain in 2011, partially offset by the distribution received in 2012 from the Japan Financial Stability Fund.

Benefits and expenses of our Gibraltar Life and Other operations increased $9,013 million, including an unfavorable impact of $108 million
from currency fluctuations. Excluding currency fluctuations, benefits and expenses increased $8,905 million. Policyholder benefits, including changes in reserves, increased $8,461 million primarily driven by higher sales of yen-denominated single
premium reduced death benefit whole life, cancer whole life and U.S. dollar-denominated retirement income products in 2012, partially offset by the absence of charges recognized in the prior year associated with claims from the 2011 earthquake in
Japan. General and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, and DAC amortization increased primarily due to increased costs supporting business growth and charges associated with our life insurance joint venture in India, partially offset by
additional synergies and lower integration costs associated with the Star and Edison acquisition.

2011 to 2010 Annual Comparison.

Revenues from our Life Planner operations increased $950 million including a net favorable impact of $398 million from currency fluctuations.
Excluding currency fluctuations, revenues increased $552 million primarily reflecting higher premiums and policy charges and fee income of $392 million driven by a $341 million increase from our Japanese Life Planner operation reflecting growth of
business in force and continued strong persistency. Net investment income increased $118 million primarily due to investment portfolio growth, partially offset by lower yields in our investment portfolio.

Benefits and expenses of our Life Planner operations
increased $853 million including a net unfavorable impact of $387 million from currency fluctuations. Excluding currency fluctuations, benefits and expenses increased $466 million primarily reflecting $396 million of higher benefits and expenses in
our Japanese Life Planner operation which was primarily driven by higher policyholder benefits due to changes in reserves reflecting growth in business in force and to a lesser extent, the impact of the charges associated with claims resulting from
the Japanese earthquake and less favorable mortality experience.

Revenues from our Gibraltar Life and Other operations increased $6,546 million including a favorable impact of $331 million from currency fluctuations. Excluding currency fluctuations, revenues increased
$6,215 million. Premiums and policy charges and fee income increased $4,933 million, of which $2,920 million was associated with the acquired Star and Edison Businesses. Excluding Star and Edison, the increase in premiums and policy charges and fee
income was primarily driven by growth within the bank distribution channel including $1,062 million higher sales of single premium reduced death benefit whole life policies. Net investment income increased $1,028 million primarily reflecting income
on the acquired assets from Star and Edison and to a lesser extent, continued growth of our fixed annuity products. Also contributing to the increase in revenues is higher other income, primarily reflecting the impact of the partial sales of our
indirect investment in China Pacific Group as discussed above.



Benefits and expenses of our Gibraltar Life and Other operations increased $6,267 million,
including an unfavorable impact of $306 million from currency fluctuations. Excluding currency fluctuations, benefits and expenses increased $5,961 million. Policyholder benefits, including changes in reserves, increased $3,866 million and was
primarily driven by the acquisition of the Star and Edison Businesses, higher single premium reduced death benefit whole life sales in 2011 and $37 million of charges associated with claims resulting from the March 2011 earthquake in Japan. General
and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, increased $1,350 million primarily driven by the impact of the Star and Edison acquisition including $213 million of transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition, higher development
costs supporting bank and agency distribution channel growth and $12 million of expenses resulting from the earthquake in Japan. Also contributing to the increase in benefits and expenses is higher amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs
and interest credited to policyholders’ account balances primarily reflecting the impact of the Star and Edison acquisition.

Sales Results

The following table sets forth annualized new business premiums on an actual and constant exchange rate basis for the periods indicated.

Historically, growth in
annualized new business premiums was closely correlated to growth of our Life Planner and Gibraltar Life Consultant distribution force. Recently, growth in annualized new business premiums is being driven by increased average premium per new policy
resulting in part from the growing demand for retirement-oriented products, as well as expanded distribution through third party channels, especially banks. As noted in the table below, bank channel sales contain a disproportionate number of single
pay or limited pay contracts which tend to be larger policies and therefore have higher average premiums per policy.

The amount of annualized new business premiums for any given period can be significantly impacted by several factors, including but not
limited to, changes in credited interest rates for certain products and other product modifications, changes in tax laws, changes in life insurance regulations or changes in the competitive environment. Sales volume may increase or decrease prior to
such changes becoming effective, and then fluctuate in the other direction following such changes.

The tables below present annualized new business premiums on a constant exchange rate basis, by product and distribution channel, for the periods indicated.



(1)

Includes medical insurance, cancer insurance and accident & sickness riders. The years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 include $325 million and $230
million, respectively, of annualized new business premiums from cancer whole life insurance products.

(2)

Includes retirement income, endowment and savings variable universal life.

(3)

Single pay life annualized new business premiums, which include 10% of first year premiums, and 3-year limited pay annualized new business premiums, which include 100%
of new business premiums, represented 74% and 19%, respectively, of total bank distribution channel annualized new business premiums, excluding annuity products, for the year ended December 31, 2012, and 31% and 50%, respectively, of total bank
distribution channel annualized new business premiums, excluding annuity products, for the year ended December 31, 2011. Single pay and limited pay products generally have less death benefit protection per premium paid than more traditional
recurring premium products.

to 2011 Annual Comparison.

Annualized new business premiums, on a constant exchange rate basis, from our Life Planner operations increased $221 million driven by higher sales in Japan of $177 million reflecting increased
demand for U.S. dollar-denominated retirement income products driven by a change in crediting rate that became effective in June 2012 and higher demand for yen-denominated retirement income products in the corporate market. To a lesser extent, sales
in Brazil, Korea, Taiwan and Italy increased due to growth and the introduction of new products into these markets.

Annualized new business premiums, on a constant exchange rate basis, from our Gibraltar Life operations increased $673 million driven by
increased sales of $822 million in the bank channel distribution. Bank channel sales largely reflect higher sales of yen-denominated single premium reduced death benefit whole life policies in anticipation of pricing changes effective January 2013
as well as the benefit from actions taken by certain of our competitors to limit sales and lower crediting rates on similar products. Independent Agency and Life Consultant sales declined $99 million and $50 million, respectively, driven by the
discontinuation of certain products previously offered by the former Star and Edison businesses and the expected attrition of former Star and Edison Life Consultants. These decreases were partly offset by higher sales of cancer whole life products
prior to a tax law change in April 2012 as well as increased demand for U.S. dollar-denominated retirement income products prior to pricing changes in April 2012.

The table below present annualized new business premiums on a
constant exchange rate basis, by product and distribution channel, for the periods indicated.

(1)

Includes medical insurance, cancer insurance and accident & sickness riders.

(2)

Includes retirement income, endowment and savings variable universal life.

(3)

Single pay life annualized new business premiums, which include 10% of first year premiums, and 3-year limited pay annualized new business premiums, which include 100%
of new business premiums, represented 30% and 50%, respectively, of total bank distribution channel annualized new business premiums, excluding annuity products, for the year ended December 31, 2011, and 1% and 64%, respectively, of total bank
distribution channel annualized new business premiums, excluding annuity products, for the year ended December 31, 2010. Single pay and limited pay products generally have less death benefit protection per premium paid than more traditional
recurring premium products.

to 2010 Annual Comparison.

Annualized new business premiums, on a constant exchange rate basis, from our Life Planner operations increased $125 million, including $84 million of higher sales in Japan driven by growth in
average premium per policy reflecting the increasing demand for both yen and U.S. dollar-denominated retirement income products. Sales in Korea increased $21 million driven by growth in



average premium per policy resulting from increased sales of retirement income products and variable annuity products. In Brazil, sales increased $11 million primarily driven by sales of whole
life products due in part to an increase in the number of Life Planners.

Annualized new business premiums, on a constant exchange rate basis, from our Gibraltar Life operations increased $1,103 million, with Star and Edison contributing $763 million to this increase.
Annualized new business premiums for Star include approximately $128 million of sales from an increasing term product that was discontinued upon completion of the merger with Gibraltar. Excluding Star and Edison, the increase in annualized new
business premiums was driven by higher bank channel sales of $233 million primarily due to increased sales of protection products including $137 million from single premium reduced death benefit whole life sales due in part to increased sales in
advance of a premium increase on our yen-denominated product effective early February 2011 and $55 million in whole life products. Excluding Star and Edison, independent agency distribution sales increased $86 million with the vast majority from
sales of cancer insurance products and Life Consultant sales increased $21 million primarily reflecting higher sales of retirement income and annuity products.

Salesforce

The following table sets forth the number of Life Planners and Life Consultants for the periods indicated.

2012 to 2011
Comparison.

The number of Life Planners increased by 266 from December 31, 2011 driven by increases of 96 and 79 in Korea and Japan, respectively, reflecting recruitment and retention initiatives and 69 in Brazil due
to agency growth. Also contributing to the increase in Life Planners over the past year were increases of 61 in Poland and 22 in Italy, partly offset by declines of 37 in Taiwan and 26 in Mexico.

The number of Gibraltar Life Consultants decreased by 1,458
from December 31, 2011, including anticipated resignations and terminations of Life Consultants, due in part to their failure to meet minimum sales production standards.

2011 to 2010 Comparison.

The
number of Life Planners increased by 227 from December 31, 2010 driven by an increase of 84 in Brazil due to stronger recruitment, as well as increases of 62 in Korea, 32 in Poland, 31 in Italy and 15 in Japan. Over this twelve month period,
there were 35 Japanese Life Planners transferred to Gibraltar Life, primarily in support of our efforts to expand our bank channel distribution and to service orphaned policyholders.

The number of Gibraltar Life Consultants increased by 6,510 from December 31, 2010 driven by the Star and
Edison acquisition. As of December 31, 2011, 6,550 Life Consultants were associated with the former acquired businesses of Star and Edison, reflecting a decrease of 719 from the 7,269 Life Consultants as of the February 1, 2011 date of
acquisition, as recruitments were more than offset by terminations and resignations.



Corporate and Other

Corporate and Other includes corporate operations, after
allocations to our business segments, and divested businesses except those that qualify for “discontinued operations” accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP.

(1)

Includes consolidating adjustments.

In December 2012, the Company adopted retrospectively a change in method of applying an accounting principle for the Company’s
pension plans. The change in accounting method relates to the calculation of market related value of pension plan assets, used to determine net periodic pension cost. As a result of this change, Corporate and Other results have been revised for all
historical periods presented. For additional information on the change in accounting method for the Company’s pension plans, see Notes 2 and 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

2012 to 2011 Annual Comparison.

The loss from Corporate and Other operations, on
an adjusted operating income basis, increased $225 million. Capital debt interest expense increased $78 million primarily due to higher levels of capital debt. Net investment income, net of interest expense, excluding capital debt interest expense,
decreased $27 million reflecting less favorable results from equity method investments and higher levels of operating debt. Net charges from other corporate activities for 2012 include a $78 million charge from the impact of an annual review and
update of assumptions on the reserves for certain retained obligations relating to pre-demutualization policyholders to whom we had previously agreed to provide insurance for reduced or no premium in accordance with contractual settlements related
to prior individual life insurance sales practices remediation. In addition, retained corporate expenses increased in 2012 primarily from an increase in corporate advertising, the results of our corporate foreign exchange hedging activities and the
costs related to the prepayment of outstanding debt. These increases are partially offset by a favorable comparative impact for our estimate of payments arising from the use of new Social Security Master Death File matching criteria to identify
deceased policy and contract holders and the absence of a $20 million expense accrued in 2011 related to a voluntary contribution to be made to the insurance industry insolvency fund, related to Executive Life Insurance.

Results from Corporate and Other operations pension income
and employee benefits decreased $48 million primarily due to an increase in recorded liabilities for certain employee benefits and higher postretirement costs. Income from our qualified pension plan partially offset these unfavorable items
reflecting better than expected growth in plan assets partially offset by a decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets from 7.00% in 2011 to 6.75% in 2012.

For purposes of calculating pension income from our own
qualified pension plan for the year ended December 31, 2013, we will decrease the discount rate to 4.05% from 4.85% in 2012. The expected rate of return on plan assets will decrease to 6.25% in 2013 from 6.75% in 2012, and the assumed rate of
increase in compensation will remain unchanged at 4.5%. We determined our expected rate of return on plan assets based upon a building block approach that considers inflation, real return, term premium, credit spreads, equity risk premium and
capital appreciation as well as expenses, expected asset manager performance and the effect of



rebalancing for the equity, debt and real estate asset mix applied on a weighted average basis to our pension asset portfolio. Giving effect to the foregoing assumptions and other factors, we
expect, on a consolidated basis, income from our own qualified pension plan will continue to contribute to adjusted operating income in 2013, but at a level of about $15 million to $25 million lower than in 2012. Other postretirement benefit
expenses will decrease in a range of $5 million to $15 million. The decrease is driven primarily by favorable demographic updates and claims experience, offset by a decrease in the discount rate to 3.85% from 4.60%. In 2013, pension and other
postretirement benefit service costs related to active employees will continue to be allocated to our business segments.

2011 to 2010 Annual Comparison.

The loss from Corporate and Other operations, on an adjusted operating
income basis, increased $174 million. Corporate and Other operations recorded a $93 million increase in reserves for estimated payments arising from use of new Social Security Master Death file criteria to identify deceased policy and contract
holders. Corporate and Other operations also recorded a $20 million charge related to a voluntary contribution to be made to an insurance industry insolvency fund, related to Executive Life Insurance Company of New York. Greater net charges from
other corporate activities, primarily reflecting increased retained corporate expenses, including corporate advertising, contributed to the increased loss. The increase in net charges from other corporate activities was partially offset by more
favorable results from corporate foreign currency hedging activities and reduced charges compared to the prior period for certain retained obligations relating to pre-demutualization policyholders to whom we had previously agreed to provide
insurance for reduced or no premium in accordance with contractual settlements related to prior individual life insurance sales practices remediation. Capital debt interest expense increased $67 million due to a greater level of capital debt, which
includes the issuance in November 2010 of $1 billion of debt for the acquisition of the Star and Edison Businesses. Investment income, net of interest expense, excluding capital debt interest expense, increased $37 million due to higher income in
our corporate investment portfolio including higher income on equity method investments.

Results from Corporate and Other operations pension income and employee benefits decreased $5 million primarily due to a decrease in income from our qualified pension plan resulting from a decrease in the
expected rate of return on plan assets from 7.50% in 2010 to 7.00% in 2011, partially offset by better than expected growth in plan assets.

Capital Protection Framework

Corporate and Other operations includes the results of our Capital Protection Framework, which includes, among other initiatives, the
capital hedge program. The capital hedge program broadly addresses the equity market exposure of the statutory capital of the Company as a whole, under stress scenarios, as described under “—Liquidity and Capital
Resources—Capital—Capital Protection Framework.” This hedge program resulted in charges for amortization of derivative costs of $40 million, $21 million and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively. The impact of the market value changes of these derivatives included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net and related adjustments” was a loss of $15 million, a gain of $9 million and a loss of $7 million for the years
ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

In addition to hedging equity market exposure, we may choose to manage the interest rate risk associated with various operations of the Financial Services Businesses by holding capital against a portion
of the interest rate exposure rather than fully hedging the risk. “Realized investment gains (losses), net and related adjustments” includes net gains of $184 million, net losses of $1,662 million and net gains of $306 million for the
years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 respectively, resulting from our decision to utilize this strategy to manage a portion of our interest rate risk. The $1,662 million net loss in 2011 was driven by significant declines in risk-free
interest rates during the year. The capital consequences associated with our decision to hold capital against a portion of our interest rate exposure have been factored into our Capital Protection Framework.

In addition, we manage certain of the risks associated with
our variable annuity products through our living benefit hedging program, which is described under “—U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division—Individual Annuities.” Through our Capital Protection Framework, we
maintain access to on-balance sheet capital and contingent sources of capital that are available to meet capital needs that may arise related to this hedging program.

For more information on our Capital Protection Framework, see
“—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”



Results of Operations of Closed Block Business

We established the Closed Block Business effective as of the
date of demutualization. The Closed Block Business includes our in force traditional domestic participating life insurance and annuity products and assets that are used for the payment of benefits and policyholder dividends on these policies, as
well as other assets and equity and related liabilities that support these policies. We no longer offer these traditional domestic participating policies. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “—Closed Block
Business” for additional details.

Each year,
the Board of Directors of Prudential Insurance determines the dividends payable on participating policies for the following year based on the experience of the Closed Block, including investment income, net realized and unrealized investment gains,
mortality experience and other factors. Although Closed Block experience for dividend action decisions is based upon statutory results, at the time the Closed Block was established, we developed, as required by U.S. GAAP, an actuarial calculation of
the timing of the maximum future earnings from the policies included in the Closed Block. If actual cumulative earnings in any given period are greater than the cumulative earnings we expected, we will record this excess as a policyholder dividend
obligation. We will subsequently pay this excess to Closed Block policyholders as an additional dividend unless it is otherwise offset by future Closed Block performance that is less favorable than we originally expected. The policyholder dividends
we charge to expense within the Closed Block Business will include any change in our policyholder dividend obligation that we recognize for the excess of actual cumulative earnings in any given period over the cumulative earnings we expected in
addition to the actual policyholder dividends declared by the Board of Directors of Prudential Insurance.

As of December 31, 2012, the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was $885 million, which was
recorded as a policyholder dividend obligation. Actual cumulative earnings, as required by U.S. GAAP, reflect the recognition of realized investment gains and losses in the current period, as well as changes in assets and related liabilities that
support the Closed Block policies. Additionally, the accumulation of net unrealized investment gains that have arisen subsequent to the establishment of the Closed Block have been reflected as a policyholder dividend obligation of $5,478 million at
December 31, 2012, to be paid to Closed Block policyholders unless offset by future experience, with an offsetting amount reported in AOCI.

Operating Results

Management does not consider adjusted operating income to assess the operating performance of the Closed Block Business. Consequently,
results of the Closed Block Business for all periods are presented only in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following table sets forth the Closed Block Business U.S. GAAP results for the periods indicated.

Income from Continuing
Operations Before Income Taxes and Equity in Earnings of Operating Joint Ventures

2012 to 2011 Annual Comparison.

Income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures decreased $150 million. Results for
2012 include $602 million of lower net realized investment gains, primarily due to lower trading gains on fixed maturities and equity investments, as well as unfavorable changes in the value of derivatives. For a discussion of Closed Block Business
realized investment gains (losses), net, see “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses.” Also contributing to the decline in results was a $61 million decrease in net investment income primarily reflecting the impact of lower



reinvestment rates and lower asset balances as the business runs off. As a result of the above and other variances, a $123 million policyholder dividend obligation expense was recorded in 2012,
compared to $636 million in 2011. As noted above, as of December 31, 2012, the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings was $885 million. If actual cumulative earnings fall below expected cumulative earnings in
future periods, earnings volatility in the Closed Block Business, which is primarily due to changes in investment results, may not be offset by changes in the cumulative policyholder dividend obligation.

2011 to 2010 Annual
Comparison.

Income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures decreased $532 million. Results for 2011 include a $40 million increase in reserves for estimated
payments arising from use of new Social Security Master Death File matching criteria to identify deceased policy and contract holders, as well as a decrease in net investment income of $33 million primarily due to lower portfolio yields. These
unfavorable items were partially offset by an increase of $51 million in net realized investment gains primarily resulting from higher trading gains as part of a change in asset allocation of the portfolios and lower impairment losses, partially
offset by lower investment gains from the change in value of derivatives, including interest rate swaps and futures. As a result of the above and other variances, a $636 million policyholder dividend obligation expense was recorded in 2011, compared
to $126 million in 2010.

Revenues, Benefits
and Expenses

2012 to 2011 Annual
Comparison.

Revenues, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” decreased $758 million principally driven by the $602 million decrease in net realized investment gains, as discussed above.
Premiums declined by $101 million, with a related decrease in changes in reserves, primarily due to the expected in force decline as policies terminate. Also contributing to the decline in revenues was a $61 million decrease in net investment
income, as discussed above.

Benefits and
expenses, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” decreased $608 million primarily driven by a $550 million decline in dividends to policyholders including a $513 million decrease in the policyholder dividend
obligation expense reflecting a lower increase in cumulative earnings. In addition, policyholders’ benefits, including changes in reserves, decreased $37 million primarily due to the expected in force decline as policies terminate, partially
offset by an increase in reserves for estimated payments arising from use of new Social Security Master Death File matching criteria to identify deceased policy and contract holders.

2011 to 2010 Annual Comparison.

Revenues decreased $71 million principally driven
by an $89 million decrease in premiums, with a related decrease in changes in reserves, primarily due to the expected in force decline as policies terminate, as well as a $33 million decrease in net investment income primarily due to lower portfolio
yields, as discussed above. Partially offsetting these unfavorable items was an increase of $51 million in net realized investment gains, as discussed above.

Benefits and expenses increased $461 million primarily driven by a $500 million increase in dividends to policyholders including a $510
million increase in the policyholder dividend obligation expense reflecting an increase in cumulative earnings. This unfavorable item was partially offset by a decrease in policyholders’ benefits, including changes in reserves of $30 million
reflecting the expected in force decline, partially offset by an increase in reserves for estimated payments arising from use of new Social Security Master Death File matching criteria to identify deceased policy and contract holders, as discussed
above.



Income Taxes

Shown below is our income tax provision for the years ended
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, separately reflecting the impact of certain significant items. Also presented below is the income tax provision that would have resulted from application of the statutory 35% federal income tax rate in each of
these periods.

Our income tax provision
amounted to an income tax expense of $204 million in 2012 compared to $1,488 million in 2011. Our income tax provision for 2012 and 2011 includes $333 million and $214 million, respectively, of an additional U.S. tax related to the realization of a
portion of the local deferred tax assets existing on the opening day balance sheet for the Star and Edison Businesses. The increase in the additional U.S. tax is a result of the merger of Star and Edison Businesses into the Gibraltar Life
Insurance Company, Ltd. It represents the recomputed U.S. tax liability on Gibraltar’s prior earnings as a result of the repatriation assumption and the merger of the entities. The local utilization of the deferred tax asset coupled with the
repatriation assumption with respect to the applicable earnings of our Japanese entities creates the effect of a “double tax” for U.S. GAAP purposes, whereas only one incidence of tax will ever be paid. In addition, 2011 income tax expense
includes a $42 million tax benefit from the release of a valuation allowance related to a foreign subsidiary. Excluding the impact of the “double tax” and the release of the valuation allowance, the income tax expense decreased primarily
due to the decrease in pre-tax income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures and increase in non-taxable investment income for the year ended December 31, 2012.

Our income tax provision related to foreign operations
amounted to an income tax benefit of $90 million in 2012 compared to income tax expense of $644 million in 2011. Our foreign operations income tax provision for 2012 and 2011 includes $73 million of an additional tax expense and $435 million of an
additional tax benefit, respectively, from the re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities resulting from the Japan corporate income tax rate reduction. However, since we assume repatriation of earnings from our Japanese operations, our domestic tax
provision in 2012 and 2011 includes $73 million of an additional tax benefit and $435 million of an additional tax expense, respectively, resulting from the increase or decrease in the future foreign tax credit benefit and, as a result, the
reduction in the Japan corporate tax rate had no impact on our overall income tax provision. Excluding the impact from the Japan corporate income tax rate reduction, the foreign operations income tax provision decreased primarily due to the decrease
in foreign operations pre-tax income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures.

We employ various tax strategies, including strategies to minimize the amount of taxes resulting from realized capital gains.

For additional information regarding income taxes, see Note
19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Discontinued Operations

Included within net income are the results of businesses which are reflected as discontinued operations under
U.S. GAAP. Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes, was $15 million, $35 million and $33 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

For additional information regarding discontinued operations see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Divested Businesses

Our income from continuing operations includes results from
several businesses that have been or will be sold or exited, including businesses that have been placed in wind down, but that do not qualify for “discontinued operations” accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP. The results of these divested
businesses are reflected in our Corporate and Other operations, but are excluded from adjusted operating income. For a further description of these divested businesses, see “Business—Corporate and Other.” A summary of the results of
these divested businesses that have been excluded from adjusted operating income is as follows for the periods indicated:

Long-Term
Care.

Results for the year ended December 31, 2012, as presented in the table above, include a $639 million net charge, before taxes, from an increase in reserves for our long-term care products and adjustments to
deferred policy acquisition and other costs, reflecting updates to the estimated profitability of the business, driven by changes to our long-term interest rate and morbidity assumptions, partially offset by expected future premium increases. We
have factored into our assumptions our best estimate of the timing and amount of anticipated and yet-to-be-filed premium increases which will require state approval. Our actual experience obtaining pricing increases could be materially different
than what we have assumed, resulting in further policy liability increases which could be material.

Real Estate and Relocation Services

.

Results for the year ended December 31, 2011 include a pre-tax gain of $49 million reflecting the sale of our real estate
brokerage franchise and relocation services business. We retained ownership of a financing subsidiary with debt and equity investments in a limited number of real estate brokerage franchises. The results of these operations are reflected in the
table above. For additional information on the sale of our real estate brokerage franchise and relocation services business, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Experience-Rated Contractholder Liabilities,

Trading Account Assets Supporting Insurance Liabilities and Other Related Investments

Certain products included in the Retirement and International
Insurance segments are experience-rated in that investment results associated with these products are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. The majority of investments supporting these experience-rated products are classified as trading
and are carried at fair value. These trading investments are reflected on the statements of financial position as “Trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities, at fair value” (“TAASIL”). Realized and unrealized gains
and losses for these investments are reported in “Asset management fees and other income.” Interest and dividend income for these



investments is reported in “Net investment income.” To a lesser extent, these experience-rated products are also supported by derivatives and commercial mortgage and other loans. The
derivatives that support these experience-rated products are reflected on the statement of financial position as “Other long-term investments” and are carried at fair value, and the realized and unrealized gains and losses are reported in
“Realized investment gains (losses), net.” The commercial mortgage and other loans that support these experience-rated products are carried at unpaid principal, net of unamortized discounts and an allowance for losses, and are reflected on
the statements of financial position as “Commercial mortgage and other loans.” Gains and losses on sales and changes in the valuation allowance for commercial mortgage and other loans are reported in “Realized investment gains
(losses), net.”

Our Retirement segment has
two types of experience-rated products that are supported by TAASIL and other related investments. Fully participating products are those for which the entire return on underlying investments is passed back to the policyholders through a
corresponding adjustment to the related liability. The adjustment to the liability is based on changes in the fair value of all of the related assets, including commercial mortgage and other loans, which are carried at amortized cost, less any
valuation allowance. Partially participating products are those for which only a portion of the return on underlying investments is passed back to the policyholders over time through changes to the contractual crediting rates. The crediting rates
are typically reset semiannually, often subject to a minimum crediting rate, and returns are required to be passed back within ten years.

In our International Insurance segment, the experience-rated products are fully participating. As a result, the entire return on the
underlying investments is passed back to policyholders through a corresponding adjustment to the related liability.

Adjusted operating income excludes net investment gains and losses on TAASIL, related derivatives and commercial mortgage and other loans.
This is consistent with the exclusion of realized investment gains and losses with respect to other investments supporting insurance liabilities managed on a consistent basis. In addition, to be consistent with the historical treatment of charges
related to realized investment gains and losses on investments, adjusted operating income also excludes the change in contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes in the pool of investments (including changes in the fair value of commercial
mortgage and other loans) supporting these experience-rated contracts, which are reflected in “Interest credited to policyholders’ account balances.” The result of this approach is that adjusted operating income for these products
includes net fee revenue and interest spread we earn on these experience-rated contracts, and excludes changes in fair value of the pool of investments, both realized and unrealized, that we expect will ultimately accrue to the contractholders.



The following tables set forth the impact of these items on results that are excluded from
adjusted operating income for the periods indicated:

(1)

Decreases to contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes are limited by certain floors and therefore do not reflect cumulative declines in recorded asset
values of $3 million, $7 million and $9 million as of December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We have recovered and expect to recover in future periods these declines in recorded asset values through subsequent increases in recorded
asset values or reductions in crediting rates on contractholder liabilities.

(2)

Included in the amounts above related to the change in the liability to contractholders as a result of commercial mortgage and other loans are increases of $18 million,
$55 million and $108 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. As prescribed by U.S. GAAP, changes in the fair value of commercial mortgage and other loans held for investment in our general account, other than
when associated with impairments, are not recognized in income in the current period, while the impact of these changes in fair value are reflected as a change in the liability to fully participating contractholders in the current period.

As shown in the table above, the
net impacts for the Retirement segment of changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities and investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and other related investments were net losses of $11 million,
$51 million and $74 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These impacts primarily reflect timing differences between the recognition of the mark-to-market adjustments and the recognition of the recovery of
these adjustments in future periods through subsequent increases in asset values or reductions in crediting rates on contractholder liabilities for partially participating products. These impacts also reflect the difference between the fair value of
the underlying commercial mortgage and other loans and the amortized cost, less any valuation allowance, of these loans, as described above.

Valuation of Assets and Liabilities

Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities

The authoritative guidance related to fair value measurement establishes a framework that includes a three-level hierarchy used to
classify the inputs used in measuring fair value. The level in the hierarchy within which the fair value falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement. The fair values of assets and liabilities classified
as Level 3 include at least one or more significant unobservable input in the measurement. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for an additional description of the valuation hierarchy levels.



The tables below present the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis, as of the periods indicated, split between the Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business, and the portion of such assets and liabilities that are classified in Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. See Note 20 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by hierarchy level presented on a consolidated basis.

(1)

The amount of Level 3 assets taken as a percentage of total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis totaled 5.1% and 5.5% as of December 31, 2012 and
2011, respectively, for the Financial Services Businesses, and 2.6% and 2.5% as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, for the Closed Block Business. The amount of Level 3 liabilities was immaterial to our balance sheet.

(2)

“All other” and “Other liabilities” included within “Other liabilities and notes of consolidated VIEs” primarily include derivatives. The
amounts classified as Level 3 for the Financial Services Businesses exclude the impact of netting.

The determination of fair value, which for certain assets and liabilities is dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions,
can have a significant impact on our results of operations and may require the application of a greater degree of judgment depending on market conditions, as the ability to value assets and liabilities can be significantly impacted by a decrease in
market activity or a lack of transactions executed in an orderly manner. The following sections provide information regarding certain assets and liabilities of our Financial Services Businesses and our Closed Block Business which are valued using
Level 3 inputs and could have a significant impact on our results of operations.

Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities

Fixed maturity securities included in Level 3 in our fair value hierarchy are generally priced based on internally-developed valuations or indicative broker quotes. For certain private fixed maturity and
equity securities, the internally-developed valuation model uses significant unobservable inputs and, accordingly, such securities are included in Level 3 in our fair value hierarchy. Level 3 fixed maturity securities included approximately $4.5
billion as of December 31, 2012 and $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2011 of public fixed maturities, with values primarily based on indicative broker quotes, and approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2012 and $1.6 billion as
of December 31, 2011 of private fixed maturities, with values primarily based on internally-developed models. Significant unobservable inputs used included: issue specific credit



adjustments, material non-public financial information, management judgment, estimation of future earnings and cash flows, default rate assumptions, liquidity assumptions and indicative quotes
from market makers. These inputs are usually considered unobservable, as not all market participants will have access to this data.

The impact our determination of fair value for fixed maturity and equity securities has on our results of operations is dependent on our
classification of the security as either trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity. For our investments classified as trading, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded within “Asset management fees and other income.” For our
investments classified as available-for-sale, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in AOCI, a separate component of equity. Our investments classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost.

Other Long-Term Investments

Other long-term investments classified in Level 3 primarily
include real estate held in consolidated investment funds and fund investments where the fair value option has been elected. The fair value of real estate held in consolidated investment funds is determined through an independent appraisal process.
The appraisals generally utilize a discounted cash flow model. The appraisals also include replacement cost estimates and recent sales data as alternate methods of fair value. These appraisals and the related assumptions are updated at least
annually. Since many of the assumptions utilized are unobservable and are considered to be significant inputs to the valuation, the real estate investments within other long-term investments are reflected within Level 3. Consolidated real estate
investment funds classified as Level 3 totaled approximately $0.5 billion and $0.4 billion as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The fair value of fund investments, where the fair value option has been elected, is primarily determined
by the fund managers. Since the valuations may be based on unobservable market inputs and cannot be validated by the Company, these investments are included within Level 3. Investments in these funds included in Level 3 totaled approximately $0.5
billion and $0.4 billion as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Derivative Instruments

Derivatives classified as Level 3, excluding embedded derivatives which are discussed in “—Variable Annuity Optional Living Benefit Features” below, include look-back equity options and
other structured products. These derivatives are recorded at fair value either as assets, within “Other trading account assets,” or “Other long-term investments,” or as liabilities, within “Other liabilities,” and are
valued based upon models with some significant unobservable market inputs or inputs from less actively traded markets. We validate these values through periodic comparison of our fair values to broker-dealer values. The fair values of OTC derivative
assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 totaled approximately $19 million and $0 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2012 and $84 million and $3 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2011, without giving consideration to the
impact of netting.

All realized and unrealized
changes in fair value of these derivatives, with the exception of the effective portion of qualifying cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in foreign operations, are recorded in current earnings. Generally, the changes in fair value of
these derivatives, excluding those that qualify for hedge accounting, are recorded in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” For additional information regarding the impact of changes in fair value of derivative instruments on our
results of operations see “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses” below.

Separate Account Assets

Separate account assets included in Level 3 primarily include real estate investments for which values are determined as described above under “Other Long-Term Investments.” Separate account
liabilities are reported at contract value and not fair value.

Variable Annuity Optional Living Benefit Features

Future policy benefits classified in Level 3 primarily include liabilities related to guarantees associated with the optional living
benefit features of certain variable annuity contracts offered by our Individual Annuities



segment, including guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (“GMAB”), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (“GMWB”) and guaranteed minimum income and withdrawal benefits
(“GMIWB”). These benefits are accounted for as embedded derivatives and carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” The fair values of the GMAB, GMWB and GMIWB
liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefit payments to customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature. This methodology could result in either a liability or
contra-liability balance, given changing capital market conditions and various policyholder behavior assumptions. Since there is no observable active market for the transfer of these obligations, the valuations are calculated using
internally-developed models with option pricing techniques. These models utilize significant assumptions that are primarily unobservable, including assumptions as to lapse rates, NPR, utilization rates, withdrawal rates, mortality rates and equity
market volatility. Future policy benefits classified as Level 3 were net liabilities of $3.3 billion and $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. For additional information see “—Results of Operations for Financial
Services Businesses by Segment—U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division—Individual Annuities.”

For additional information about the key estimates and assumptions used in our determination of fair value, see Note 20 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Realized
Investment Gains and Losses

Realized
investment gains and losses are generated from numerous sources, including the following significant items:

•

sale of investments

•

adjustments to the cost basis of investments for other-than-temporary impairments

•

recognition of other-than-temporary impairments in earnings for foreign denominated securities that are approaching maturity and are in an unrealized
loss position due to foreign currency exchange rate movements

•

prepayment premiums received on private fixed maturity securities

•

net changes in the allowance for losses, certain restructurings and foreclosures on commercial mortgage and other loans

•

fair value changes on commercial mortgage loans carried at fair value

•

fair value changes on embedded derivatives and free-standing derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment (except those derivatives
used in our capacity as a broker or dealer).

The level of other-than-temporary impairments generally reflects economic conditions and is expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and to decrease when economic conditions improve.
Historically, the causes of other-than-temporary impairments have been specific to each individual issuer and have not directly resulted in impairments to other securities within the same industry or geographic region. We may also realize additional
credit and interest rate related losses through sales of investments pursuant to our credit risk and portfolio management objectives. For a discussion of our policies regarding other-than-temporary impairments see “—General Account
Investments—Fixed Maturity Securities—Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of Fixed Maturity Securities” and “—General Account Investments—Equity Securities—Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of Equity Securities”
below.

We use interest rate and currency swaps
and other derivatives to manage interest and currency exchange rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities, including duration mismatches. We use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk that unfavorable changes in
currency exchange rates will materially affect U.S. dollar equivalent earnings generated by certain of our non-U.S. businesses. We also use equity-based and interest rate derivatives to hedge a portion of the risks embedded in some of our annuity
products. Derivative contracts also include forward purchases and sales of to-be-announced mortgage-backed securities primarily related to our dollar roll program. Many of these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, and
consequently, we recognize the changes in fair value of such contracts from period to period in current earnings,



although we do not necessarily account for the related assets or liabilities the same way. Accordingly, realized investment gains and losses from our derivative activities can contribute
significantly to fluctuations in net income. For a further discussion of optional living benefit guarantees and related hedge positions in our Individual Annuities segment, see “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses
by Segment—U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division—Individual Annuities.”

Adjusted operating income generally excludes “Realized investment gains (losses), net,” subject to certain exceptions. These
exceptions primarily include realized investment gains or losses within certain of our businesses for which such gains or losses are a principal source of earnings, gains or losses associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and
current period yield adjustments, and related charges and adjustments

.

Other-than-temporary impairments, interest rate related losses and credit related losses on sales (other than those related to certain of our businesses which primarily
originate investments for sale or syndication to unrelated investors) are excluded from adjusted operating income.

The following tables set forth “Realized investment gains (losses), net,” by investment type for the Financial Services
Businesses and Closed Block Business, as well as related charges and adjustments associated with the Financial Services Businesses, for the periods indicated. For additional details regarding adjusted operating income, which is our measure of
performance for the segments of our Financial Services Businesses, see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

2012 to 2011 Annual Comparison

Financial Services Businesses

The Financial Services Businesses’ net
realized investment losses in 2012 were $1,684 million, compared to net realized investment gains of $1,986 million in 2011.



Net realized losses on fixed maturity securities were $140 million in 2012, compared to net
realized losses of $125 million in 2011, as set forth in the following table:

(1)

Amounts exclude prepayment premiums, other-than-temporary impairments, and credit related losses through sales of investments pursuant to our credit risk objectives.

(2)

Excludes the portion of other-than-temporary impairments recorded in “Other comprehensive income (loss),” representing any difference between the fair value
of the impaired debt security and the net present value of its projected future cash flows at the time of impairment.

Net trading gains on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities of $128 million in 2012 were primarily due to sales within our
International Insurance, Retirement and Individual Annuities segments. Net trading gains on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities of $277 million in 2011 were primarily due to sales within our Retirement and Individual Annuities
segments. These gains also included $35 million of gross gains related to the sale of asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages. Sales of fixed maturity securities in our Individual Annuities segment in both years were primarily
due to transfers of investments out of our general account and into separate accounts relating to an automatic rebalancing element embedded in the living benefit features of some of our variable annuity products. See below for information regarding
the other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities in 2012 and 2011.

Net realized losses on equity securities were $54 million in 2012, including other-than-temporary impairments of $104 million, partially offset by net trading gains on sales of equity securities of $50
million, which were primarily due to sales within our Corporate and Other operations. Net realized losses on equity securities were $120 million in 2011, including other-than-temporary impairments of $94 million and net trading losses on sales of
equity securities of $26 million. Net trading losses in 2011 were primarily due to public equity sales within our International Insurance operations. See below for additional information regarding the other-than-temporary impairments of equity
securities in 2012 and 2011.

Net realized gains on
commercial mortgage and other loans in 2012 were $92 million, primarily related to a net decrease in the loan loss reserves primarily driven by payoffs and quality rating upgrades. Net realized gains on commercial mortgage and other loans in 2011
were $89 million, primarily related to $32 million of mark-to-market gains on our interim loan portfolio, a net decrease of $30 million in the loan loss reserves primarily driven by quality rating upgrades, and $27 million of gains within our Asset
Management business. For additional information regarding our commercial mortgage and other loan loss reserves see “—General Account Investments—Commercial Mortgage and Other Loans—Commercial Mortgage and Other Loan
Quality.”

Net realized losses on derivatives
were $1,552 million in 2012, compared to net realized gains of $2,095 million in 2011. The net derivative losses in 2012 primarily reflect net losses of $1,829 million on product related embedded derivatives and related hedge positions primarily
associated with certain variable annuity contracts. Also, contributing to the net derivative losses were net losses of $254 million on foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge portfolio assets in our Japan business primarily due to the
weakening of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar, Australian dollar, euro, and British pound. Partially offsetting these losses were net gains



of $121 million primarily representing risk fees earned on synthetic guaranteed investment contracts in our Retirement businesses which are accounted for as derivatives under U.S. GAAP, and net
gains of $342 million on foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge the future income of non-U.S. businesses, primarily in Japan due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. The net derivative gains in 2011 primarily
reflect net gains of $1,375 million on embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with certain variable annuity contracts. Also, contributing to the net derivative gains were net mark-to-market gains of $498 million on interest rate
derivatives used to manage duration as interest rates declined, and net gains of $214 million on foreign currency forward contracts used in our Japan business to hedge portfolio assets primarily due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen against
the U.S. dollar and Australian dollar. See “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division—Individual Annuities” for additional information
regarding the product related embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with certain variable annuity contracts.

Net realized losses on other investments were $30 million in 2012, which included other-than-temporary impairments of $74 million on real
estate and joint ventures and partnership investments, partially offset by a $41 million gain related to the sale of a real estate investment. Net realized gains on other investments were $47 million in 2011, which primarily included a $64 million
gain on the partial sale of a real estate seed investment, partially offset by $33 million of other other-than-temporary impairments on real estate, joint ventures and partnership investments.

Related adjustments include that portion of “Realized investment gains (losses), net” that are
included in adjusted operating income and that portion of “Asset management fees and other income” and “Net investment income” that are excluded from adjusted operating income. These adjustments are made to arrive at
“Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments” which are excluded from adjusted operating income. Results for 2012 include net negative related adjustments of $1,982 million, compared to net positive related adjustments
of $517 million for 2011. This unfavorable variance is primarily driven by the comparative impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on certain non-yen denominated assets and liabilities within our Japanese insurance operations, for which
the foreign currency exposure is economically matched and offset in AOCI. For additional information, see “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—International Insurance Division—Impact of foreign
currency exchange rate movements on earnings—U.S. GAAP earnings impact of products denominated in non-local currencies.”

Charges that relate to “Realized investment gains (losses), net” are also excluded from adjusted operating income. Results for
2012 include net positive related charges of $857 million, primarily driven by that portion of amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs relating to net losses on embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with
certain variable annuity contracts. Results for 2011 include net negative related charges of $1,656 million, primarily driven by that portion of amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs relating to net gains on embedded
derivatives and related hedge positions associated with certain variable annuity contracts. For additional information, see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

During 2012, we recorded other-than-temporary impairments of
$441 million in earnings, compared to other-than-temporary impairments of $558 million recorded in earnings in 2011. The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the composition of other-than-temporary impairments recorded in earnings
attributable to the Financial Services Businesses by asset type, and for fixed maturity securities, by reason.



(1)

Excludes the portion of other-than-temporary impairments recorded in “Other comprehensive income (loss),” representing any difference between the fair value
of the impaired debt security and the net present value of its projected future cash flows at the time of impairment.

(2)

Includes other-than-temporary impairments relating to investments in joint ventures and partnerships and real estate investments.

(1)

Excludes the portion of other-than-temporary impairment recorded in “Other comprehensive income (loss),” representing any difference between the fair value of
the impaired debt security and the net present value of its projected future cash flows at the time of impairment.

(2)

Represents circumstances where we believe credit events or other adverse conditions of the respective issuers have caused, or will lead to, a deficiency in the
contractual cash flows related to the investment. The amount of the impairment recorded in earnings is the difference between the amortized cost of the debt security and the net present value of its projected future cash flows discounted at the
effective interest rate implicit in the debt security prior to impairment.

(3)

Primarily represents circumstances where securities with losses from foreign currency exchange rate movements approach maturity.

During 2012, we recorded other-than-temporary impairments of
$144 million in earnings related to securities with unrealized losses from foreign currency exchange rate movements that are approaching maturity. Fixed maturity other-than-temporary impairments in 2012 were concentrated in the consumer
non-cyclical, technology, and utility sectors of our corporate securities, and to a lesser extent within asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages. These other-than-temporary impairments were primarily related to securities with
unrealized losses from foreign currency exchange rate movements that are approaching maturity or related to securities with liquidity concerns, downgrades in credit, bankruptcy or other adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers, which
have caused, or we believe will lead to, a deficiency in the contractual cash flows related to the investment. Our Japanese insurance operations hold non-yen denominated investments which in some cases, due primarily to the strengthening of the yen
against the U.S. dollar, as of year end are in an unrealized loss position. As the securities approach maturity and remain in an unrealized loss position, it becomes less likely that the exchange rates will recover and more likely that losses will
be realized upon maturity. Accordingly, additional impairments will be recorded in earnings as they approach maturity. As of December 31, 2012, gross unrealized losses related to those securities maturing between January 1, 2013 and
December 31, 2015 are $206 million. Absent a change in currency rates, impairments of approximately $45 million would be recorded in earnings in 2013 and approximately $45 million in 2014 on these securities. Fixed maturity other-than-temporary
impairments in 2011 were concentrated in the utility, finance, and consumer non-cyclical sectors of our corporate securities, asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, and Japanese commercial mortgage-backed securities. These
other-than-temporary impairments were primarily related to securities with unrealized foreign currency translation losses that are approaching maturity or related to securities with liquidity concerns, downgrades in credit, bankruptcy or other
adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers, which have caused, or we believe will lead to, a deficiency in the contractual cash flows related to the investment.



Equity security other-than-temporary impairments in 2012 and 2011 were primarily in our
Japanese insurance operations where the securities’ decline in value has been maintained for one year or greater or where we intend to sell the security.

Other invested assets other-than-temporary impairments in 2012 and 2011 were mainly driven by a decline in value on certain real estate,
joint ventures and partnership investments.

For a
further discussion of our policies regarding other-than-temporary impairments see “—General Account Investments—Fixed Maturity Securities—Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of Fixed Maturity Securities” and “—General
Account Investments—Equity Securities—Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of Equity Securities” below.

Closed Block Business

For the Closed Block Business, net realized investment gains in 2012 were $243 million, compared to net realized investment gains of $845
million in 2011.

Net realized gains on fixed
maturity securities were $103 million in 2012, compared to net realized gains of $355 million in 2011, as set forth in the following table:

(1)

Amounts exclude prepayment premiums, other-than-temporary impairments, and credit related losses through sales of investments pursuant to our credit risk and portfolio
management objectives.

(2)

Excludes the portion of other-than-temporary impairments recorded in “Other comprehensive income (loss),” representing any difference between the fair value
of the impaired debt security and the net present value of its projected future cash flows at the time of impairment.

Net trading gains on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities were $187 million in 2012 and $441 million in 2011, and both years
included net realized losses on other-than-temporary impairments of $74 million in 2012 and $104 million in 2011 respectively. See below for additional information regarding the other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities in 2012
and 2011.

Net realized gains on equity securities
were $78 million in 2012, which included net trading gains on sales of equity securities of $99 million, partially offset by other-than-temporary impairments of $21 million. Net realized gains on equity securities were $265 million in 2011, which
included net trading gains on sales of equity securities of $283 million, partially offset by other-than-temporary impairments of $18 million. See below for additional information regarding the other-than-temporary impairments of equity securities
in 2012 and 2011.

Net realized gains on commercial
mortgage and other loans in 2012 were $2 million related to a net decrease in the loan loss reserve. Net realized gains on commercial mortgage and other loans in 2011 were $33 million, primarily related to a net decrease in the loan loss reserve of
$42 million, partially offset by net realized



losses on related foreclosures. For additional information regarding our loan loss reserves see “—General Account Investments—Commercial Mortgage and Other Loans—Commercial
Mortgage and Other Loan Quality.”

Net
realized gains on derivatives were $52 million in 2012, compared to net realized gains of $199 million in 2011. Derivative gains in 2012 primarily reflect net gains of $80 million on interest rate derivatives primarily used to manage duration and
net gains of $26 million on “to be announced” (“TBA”) forward contracts as interest rates declined, partially offset by net losses of $16 million on credit default swaps as credit spreads tightened and net losses of $42 million
on currency derivatives used to hedge foreign denominated investments as the U.S. dollar weakened against the Euro and other currencies. The net derivative gains in 2011 primarily reflect net gains of $135 million on interest rate derivatives used
to manage duration, and $53 million on TBA forward contracts as interest rates declined. Also, contributing to these gains are net derivative gains of $23 million on currency derivatives used to hedge foreign denominated investments as the U.S.
dollar strengthened against the Euro. Partially offsetting these gains were net derivative losses of $11 million on embedded derivatives associated with certain externally-managed investments in the European market.

During 2012, we recorded other-than-temporary impairments of
$99 million in earnings, compared to other-than-temporary impairments of $127 million recorded in earnings in 2011. The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the composition of other-than-temporary impairments recorded in earnings
attributable to the Closed Block Business by asset type, and for fixed maturity securities, by reason.

of the impaired debt security and the net present value of its projected future cash flows at the time of impairment.

(2)

Includes other-than-temporary impairments relating to investments in joint ventures and partnerships.

(3)

Primarily represents circumstances where we intend to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized

Fixed maturity
other-than-temporary impairments of $74 million in 2012 were concentrated in asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, and the utility and capital goods sectors of our corporate securities and were primarily driven by liquidity
concerns, downgrades in credit, bankruptcy or other adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers, which have caused, or we believe will lead to, a deficiency in the contractual cash flows related to the investment. Fixed maturity
other-than-temporary impairments of $104 million in 2011 were concentrated in asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, and the utility and consumer cyclical sectors of our corporate securities and were primarily driven by
liquidity concerns, downgrades in credit, bankruptcy or other adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers, which have caused, or we believe will lead to, a deficiency in the contractual cash flows related to the investment.

Equity security other-than-temporary impairments in 2012 and
2011 were primarily due to circumstances where the decline in value was maintained for one year or greater.

For a further discussion of our policies regarding other-than-temporary impairments see “—General Account Investments—Fixed
Maturity Securities—Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of Fixed Maturity Securities” and “—General Account Investments—Equity Securities—Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of Equity Securities” below.

sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities of $207 million in 2010 were primarily due to sales within our Retirement and Individual Annuities segments. Sales of fixed maturity securities in our Individual Annuities segment in both years were
primarily due to transfers of investments out of our general account and into separate accounts relating to an automatic rebalancing element embedded in the living benefit features of some of our variable annuity products. See below for additional
information regarding the other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities in 2011 and 2010.

Net realized losses on equity securities were $120 million in 2011, including other-than-temporary impairments of $94 million and net
trading losses on sales of equity securities of $26 million. Net trading losses in 2011 were primarily due to public equity sales within our International Insurance operations. Net realized gains on equity securities were $11 million in 2010,
including net trading gains on sales of equity securities of $89 million, partially offset by other-than-temporary impairments of $78 million. Net trading gains in 2010 were primarily due to private equity sales within our Corporate and Other

million of mark-to-market gains on our interim loan portfolio, a net decrease of $30 million in the loan loss reserves primarily driven by quality rating upgrades, and $27 million of gains within our Asset Management business. Net realized gains on
commercial mortgage and other loans in 2010 were $35 million and primarily related to a net decrease in the loan loss reserves of $103 million and mark-to-market net gains on our interim loan portfolio of $81 million. These net gains were partially
offset by net realized losses of $149 million on loan modifications, payoffs, and foreclosures within our Asset Management business. For additional information regarding our commercial mortgage and other loan loss reserves see “—General
Account Investments—Commercial Mortgage and Other Loans—Commercial Mortgage and Other Loan Quality.”

Net realized gains on derivatives were $2,095 million in 2011, compared to net realized gains of $601 million in 2010. The net derivative
gains in 2011 include net gains of $1,375 million related to product embedded derivatives and related hedge positions primarily associated with certain variable annuity contracts. Also, contributing to the net derivative gains were net
mark-to-market gains of $498 million on interest rate derivatives used to manage duration as interest rates declined during 2011, and net gains of $214 million on foreign currency forward contracts used in our Star and Edison businesses to hedge

Related adjustments include that portion of “Realized investment gains (losses), net” that are included in adjusted operating income and that portion of “Asset management fees and other
income” and “Net investment income” that are excluded from adjusted operating income. These adjustments are made to arrive at “Realized



investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments” which are excluded from adjusted operating income. Results for 2011 include net positive related adjustments of $517 million, driven
by gains related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on certain assets and liabilities for which we economically hedge the foreign currency exposure. Results for 2010 include net negative related adjustments of $104 million, primarily

During 2011 we recorded
other-than-temporary impairments of $558 million in earnings, compared to total other-than-temporary impairments of $672 million recorded in earnings in 2010. The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the composition of
other-than-temporary impairments recorded in earnings attributable to the Financial Services Businesses by asset type, and for fixed maturity securities, by reason.

Primarily represents circumstances where securities with losses from foreign currency exchange rate movements approach maturity or where we intend to sell the security
or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis.

During 2011, we recorded other-than-temporary impairments of $184 million in earnings related to securities with unrealized losses from
foreign currency exchange rate movements that are approaching maturity. Fixed maturity other-than-temporary impairments in 2011 were concentrated in the utility, finance, and consumer non-cyclical sectors of our corporate securities, asset-backed
securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, and Japanese commercial mortgage-backed securities. These other-than-temporary impairments were primarily related to securities with unrealized losses from foreign currency exchange rate movements
that are approaching maturity or related to securities with liquidity concerns, downgrades in credit, bankruptcy or other adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers, which have caused, or we believe will lead to, a deficiency in the
contractual cash flows related to the investment. Our Japanese insurance operations hold non-yen denominated investments which in some cases, due primarily to the strengthening of the yen against the U.S. dollar, as of year end are in an unrealized
loss position. As the securities approach maturity and remain in an unrealized loss position, it becomes less likely that the exchange rates will recover and more likely that losses will be realized upon maturity. Accordingly, additional impairments
will be recorded in earnings as they approach maturity. As of December 31, 2011, gross unrealized losses related to those securities maturing between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2014 are $625 million. Absent a change in currency
rates, impairments of approximately $191 million would be recorded in 2012. Fixed maturity other-than-temporary impairments in 2010 were concentrated in the finance, consumer cyclical, and communications sectors of our corporate securities,
asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages that reflect adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers, the impact of the rising forward LIBOR curve and the intent to sell securities. Additionally, other-than-temporary
impairments were driven by Japanese commercial mortgage-backed securities that reflect adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers, and foreign currency translation losses related to foreign denominated securities that are approaching
maturity.

Equity security other-than-temporary
impairments in 2011 and 2010 were primarily in our Japanese insurance operations where the securities’ decline in value has been was maintained for one year or greater or where we intend to sell the security.

During 2011 we recorded other-than-temporary impairments of $127 million in earnings,
compared to other-than-temporary impairments of $208 million recorded in earnings in 2010. The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, the composition of other-than-temporary impairments recorded in earnings attributable to the Closed

Fixed maturity
other-than-temporary impairments in 2011 were concentrated in asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, and the utility and consumer cyclical sectors of our corporate securities and were primarily driven by liquidity concerns,
downgrades in credit, bankruptcy or other adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers, which have caused, or we believe will lead to, a deficiency in the contractual cash flows related to the investment. Fixed maturity
other-than-temporary impairments in 2010 were concentrated in asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages that reflect adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers as well as our intent to sell certain asset-backed
securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages.



Equity security other-than-temporary impairments in 2011 and 2010 were primarily due to
circumstances where the decline in value was maintained for one year or greater.

For a further discussion of our policies regarding other-than-temporary impairments see “—General Account Investments—Fixed Maturity Securities—Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of
Fixed Maturity Securities” and “—General Account Investments—Equity Securities—Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of Equity Securities” below.

General Account Investments

We maintain diversified investment portfolios in our general
account to support our liabilities to customers in our Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, as well as our other general liabilities. Our general account does not include: (1) assets of our trading and banking
operations; (2) assets of our asset management operations, including assets managed for third parties; and (3) those assets classified as “Separate account assets” on our balance sheet.

The general account portfolios are managed pursuant to the
distinct objectives and investment policy statements of the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. The primary investment objectives of the Financial Services Businesses include:

•

hedging the market risk characteristics of the major product liabilities and other obligations of the Company;

•

optimizing investment income yield within risk constraints over time; and

•

for certain portfolios, optimizing total return, including both investment income yield and capital appreciation, within risk constraints over time,
while managing the market risk exposures associated with the corresponding product liabilities.

We pursue our objective to optimize investment income yield for the Financial Services Businesses over time through: (1) the
investment of net operating cash flow, including new product premium inflows, and proceeds from investment sales, repayments and prepayments, into investments with attractive risk-adjusted yields, and (2) where appropriate, the sale of lower
yielding investments, either to meet various cash flow needs or to manage the portfolio’s risk exposure profile with respect to duration, credit, currency and other risk factors, while considering the impact on taxes and capital.

The primary investment objectives of the Closed Block
Business include:

•

providing for the reasonable dividend expectations of the participating policyholders within the Closed Block Business and the Class B shareholders;
and

•

optimizing total return, including both investment income yield and capital appreciation, within risk constraints, while managing the market risk
exposures associated with the major products in the Closed Block Business.

Our portfolio management approach, while emphasizing our investment income yield and asset/liability risk management objectives, also takes into account the capital and tax implications of portfolio
activity, our assertions regarding our ability and intent to hold equity securities to recovery, and our lack of any intention or requirement to sell debt securities before anticipated recovery. For a further discussion of our policies regarding
other-than-temporary impairments, including our assertions regarding our ability and intent to hold equity securities to recovery and any intention or requirement to sell debt securities before anticipated recovery, see “—Fixed
Maturity Securities—Other-than-Temporary Impairments of Fixed Maturity Securities” and “—Equity Securities—Other-than-Temporary Impairments of Equity Securities,” below.



Management of Investments

The Investment Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our proprietary investments, including our general
account portfolios. It also regularly reviews performance and risk positions. Our Chief Investment Officer Organization (“CIO Organization”) works with our Risk Management group to develop the investment policies for the general account
portfolios of our domestic and international insurance subsidiaries, and directs and oversees management of the general account portfolios within risk limits and exposure ranges approved annually by the Investment Committee.

The CIO Organization, including related functions within our
insurance subsidiaries, works closely with product actuaries and Risk Management to understand the characteristics of our products and their associated market risk exposures. This information is incorporated into the development of target asset
portfolios that hedge market risk exposures associated with the liability characteristics and establish investment risk exposures, within tolerances proscribed by Prudential’s investment risk limits, on which we expect to earn an attractive
risk-adjusted return. We develop asset strategies for specific classes of product liabilities and attributed or accumulated surplus, each with distinct risk characteristics. Market risk exposures associated with the liabilities include interest rate
risk which is addressed through the duration characteristics of the target asset mix, and currency risk which is addressed by the currency profile of the target asset mix. In certain of our smaller markets, outside of the U.S. and Japan, capital
markets limitations hinder our ability to hedge interest rate exposure to the same extent we do for our U.S. and Japan businesses and lead us to accept a higher degree of interest rate risk in these smaller portfolios. General account portfolios
typically include allocations to credit and other investment risks as a means to enhance investment yields and returns over time.

Most of our products can be categorized into the following three classes:

•

interest-crediting products for which the rates credited to customers are periodically adjusted to reflect market and competitive forces and actual
investment experience, such as fixed annuities and universal life insurance;

•

participating individual and experience-rated group products in which customers participate in actual investment and business results through annual
dividends, interest or return of premium; and

•

guaranteed products for which there are price or rate guarantees for the life of the contract, such as traditional whole life and endowment products,
guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements.

Our total investment portfolio is composed of a number of operating portfolios. Each operating portfolio backs a specific set of liabilities and the portfolios have a target asset mix that supports the
liability characteristics, including duration, cash flow, liquidity needs and other criteria. As of December 31, 2012, the average duration of our general account investment portfolios attributable to the domestic Financial Services Businesses,
including the impact of derivatives, is between 5 and 6 years. As of December 31, 2012, the average duration of our general account portfolios attributable to our Japanese insurance operations, including the impact of derivatives, is approximately
10 years, which represents a blend of yen-denominated and U.S. and Australian dollar-denominated investments, which have distinct average durations. Our asset/liability management process has enabled us to successfully manage our portfolios through
several market cycles.

We implement our portfolio
strategies primarily through investment in a broad range of fixed income assets, including government and agency securities, public and private corporate bonds and structured securities, and commercial mortgage loans. In addition, we hold small
allocations to alternative assets and other equities.

We manage our public fixed maturity portfolio to a risk profile directed or overseen by the CIO Organization and Risk Management groups and to a profile that also reflects the local market environments
impacting both our domestic and international insurance portfolios. The return that we earn on the portfolio will be reflected both as investment income and also as realized gains or losses on investments.

We use privately-placed corporate debt securities and
commercial mortgage loans, which consist of well-underwritten mortgages on diversified properties in terms of geography, property type and borrowers, to enhance the yield on our portfolio and to improve the overall diversification of the portfolios.
Private placements typically offer enhanced yields due to an illiquidity premium and generally offer enhanced credit protection in the form of covenants. Our origination capability offers the opportunity to lead transactions and gives us the
opportunity for better terms, including covenants and call protection, and to take advantage of innovative deal structures.



Derivative strategies are employed in the context of our risk management framework to
enhance our ability to manage interest rate and currency risk exposures of the asset portfolio relative to the liabilities and to manage credit and equity positions in the investment portfolios. For a discussion of our risk management process see
“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” below.

Our portfolio asset allocation reflects our emphasis on diversification across asset classes, sectors, and issuers. The CIO Organization, directly and through related functions within the insurance
subsidiaries, implements portfolio strategies primarily through various asset management units within Prudential’s Asset Management segment. Activities of the Asset Management segment on behalf of the general account portfolios are directed and
overseen by the CIO Organization and monitored by Risk Management for compliance with investment risk limits.

Portfolio Composition

Our investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans, equity securities and other invested assets. The composition of our general account
reflects, within the discipline provided by our risk management approach, our need for competitive results and the selection of diverse investment alternatives available primarily through our Asset Management segment. The size of our portfolio
enables us to invest in asset classes that may be unavailable to the typical investor.

In the fourth quarter of 2012, our Retirement segment completed two significant pension risk transfer transactions, in which we issued non-participating group annuity contracts to two unaffiliated pension
plan sponsors, and assumed responsibility for certain pension benefit obligations for participants covered by the agreements. In return for assuming these obligations, we received approximately $33 billion of in-kind assets, consisting of
approximately $31 billion of fixed maturity securities and approximately $2 billion of private equity partnership assets. The addition of these assets to our portfolio increased our investments in fixed maturity securities and other long-term
investments by approximately 11%, and 30%, respectively. For additional information on these transactions, see “—Executive Summary—Current Developments” above.

The following tables set forth the composition of the
investments of our general account apportioned between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business as of the dates indicated.



(1)

Other long-term investments consist of real estate and non-real estate-related investments in joint ventures and partnerships, investment real estate held through
direct ownership and other miscellaneous investments. For additional information regarding these investments, see “—Other Long-Term Investments” below.

(2)

Includes invested assets of our trading, banking, and asset management operations. Excludes assets of our asset management operations managed for third parties and
those assets classified as “Separate account assets” on our balance sheet. For additional information regarding these investments, see “—Invested Assets of Other Entities and Operations” below.

The increase in general account investments attributable to
the Financial Services Businesses in 2012 was primarily due to the pension risk transfer transactions as discussed above, portfolio growth as a result of reinvestment of net investment income and net operating inflows, and a net increase in fair
value driven by a decrease in interest rates. The general account investments attributable to the Closed Block Business also increased in 2012, primarily due to portfolio growth as a result of reinvestment of net investment income and a net increase
in fair value driven by a decrease in interest rates, partially offset by net operating outflows. For information regarding the methodology used in determining the fair value of our fixed maturities, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

We have substantial insurance
operations in Japan, with 46% and 50% of our Financial Services Businesses’ general account investments relating to our Japanese insurance operations as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.

The following table sets forth the composition of the
investments of our Japanese insurance operations’ general account as of the dates indicated.



(1)

Other long-term investments consist of real estate and non-real estate-related investments in joint ventures and partnerships, investment real estate held through
direct ownership, derivatives, and other miscellaneous investments.

(2)

Excludes assets classified as “Separate accounts assets” on our balance sheet.

The increase in general account investments related to our Japanese insurance operations in 2012 was primarily
attributable to portfolio growth as a result of business inflows and the reinvestment of net investment income, as well as a net increase in fair value primarily driven by declining interest rates, partially offset by the weakening of the yen
against the U.S. dollar.

The functional currency
of our Japanese insurance subsidiaries is the yen and, although the majority of the Japanese general account is invested in yen-denominated investments, our Japanese insurance operations also hold significant investments denominated in U.S. and
Australian dollars.

As of December 31, 2012,
our Japanese insurance operations had $44.9 billion, at fair value, of investments denominated in U.S. dollars, including $4.4 billion that were hedged to yen through third party derivative contracts and $31.6 billion that support liabilities
denominated in U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2011, our Japanese insurance operations had $38.9 billion, at fair value, of investments denominated in U.S. dollars, including $4.4 billion that were hedged to yen through third party derivative
contracts and $25.9 billion that support liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars. The $6.0 billion increase of U.S. dollar investments from December 31, 2011 is primarily driven by portfolio growth as a result of business inflows and an
increase in fair value driven by a decrease in interest rates.

Our Japanese insurance operations had $8.6 billion and $6.4 billion, at fair value, of investments denominated in Australian dollars that support liabilities denominated in Australian dollars as of
December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. The $2.2 billion increase of Australian dollar investments from December 31, 2011 is primarily driven by portfolio growth as a result of business inflows and an increase in fair
value driven by a decrease in interest rates.

For
additional information regarding U.S. and Australian dollar investments held in our Japanese insurance operations, see “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—International Insurance Division,” above.

Eurozone Exposure

Our investment portfolio includes direct investment exposure
to the Eurozone region. We define this region as consisting of those countries within the European Union that have adopted the euro as their sole legal currency. The Eurozone region currently consists of seventeen countries, including Austria,
Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain. Included in this region are peripheral countries, which we currently define as consisting of
Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain. Specific country exposure is determined based on the issuer’s country of incorporation.



The following table sets forth the composition of our gross direct exposure to the Eurozone
region, by country of incorporation, attributable to the Financial Services Businesses, as of December 31, 2012.

Eurozone Gross Direct Exposure—Financial Services Businesses

Other non-peripheral countries include Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, Malta, Slovakia, and Slovenia.

(2)

Principally represents Italian government securities owned by our Italian insurance operations.

(3)

Other peripheral countries include Greece and Portugal.

(4)

International agencies include agencies such as Eurofima, European Investment Bank, Council of Europe Development, and Nordic Investment Bank, where a single country of
incorporation could not be determined.

(5)

Of the $14,406 million of amortized cost represented above, 87% is related to fixed maturities, 8% is related to trading account assets supporting insurance
liabilities, and the remaining 5% is related to all other asset types.

(6)

Sovereigns include local governments.

(7)

Our gross direct exposure to the Eurozone region attributable to the Closed Block Business was $4,241 million of amortized cost (fair value, $4,688 million), as of December 31, 2012, of which
$3,659 million (fair value, $4,068 million) represented non-peripheral exposure and $582 million (fair value, $620 million) represented peripheral exposure. Approximately 12% and 13% of the non-peripheral and peripheral exposure, respectively, was
related to financial institutions, and less than 1% of each of the non-peripheral and peripheral exposures was related to sovereigns. Of the $4,241 million of amortized cost represented above, 94% was related to fixed maturities, and the remaining
6% was related to all other asset types.



Investment Results

The following tables set forth the income yield and
investment income for each major investment category of our general account for the periods indicated. The yields are based on net investment income as reported under U.S. GAAP and do not include adjustments, such as settlements of duration
management swaps that are included in adjusted operating income.



(1)

Yields are based on quarterly average carrying values except for fixed maturities, equity securities and securities lending activity. Yields for fixed maturities are
based on amortized cost. Yields for equity securities are based on cost. Yields for fixed maturities and short-term investments and cash equivalents are calculated net of liabilities and rebate expenses corresponding to securities lending activity.
Yields exclude investment income on assets other than those included in invested assets. Prior period’s yields are presented on a basis consistent with the current period presentation.

(2)

Includes investment income of our trading, banking, and asset management operations.

(3)

Yields for the year ended December 31, 2011 are weighted for ten months of income and assets related to the Star and Edison Businesses.

See below for a discussion of the change in the Financial
Services Businesses’ yields. The decrease in net investment income yield attributable to the Closed Block Business’s portfolio for 2012, compared to 2011, was primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates on floating rate investments
due to rate resets and lower fixed income reinvestment rates.

The decrease in net investment income yield attributable to the Closed Block Business for 2011, compared to 2010, was primarily due to lower interest rates on floating rate investments due to rate resets
and lower fixed income reinvestment rates.



The following table sets forth the income yield and investment income for each major
investment category of the Financial Services Businesses’ general account, excluding the Japanese insurance operations’ portion of the general account which is presented separately below, for the periods indicated. The yields are based on
net investment income as reported under U.S. GAAP and do not include adjustments, such as settlements of duration management swaps that are included in adjusted operating income.

Yields exclude investment income on assets other than those included in invested assets. Prior period’s yields are presented on a basis consistent with the current period presentation.

(2)

Includes investment income of our trading, banking, and asset management operations.

The decrease in net investment income yield attributable to
the Financial Services Businesses’ general account, excluding the Japanese operations’ portfolio, for 2012, compared to 2011, was primarily the result of lower interest rates on floating rate investments due to rate resets, lower fixed
maturity reinvestment rates, and the addition of assets from the pension risk transfer transactions at current market yields.

The decrease in net investment income yield attributable to the Financial Services Businesses’ general account, excluding the
Japanese operations’ portfolio, for 2011, compared to 2010, was primarily the result of lower interest rates on floating rate investments due to rate resets and lower fixed maturity reinvestment rates, partially offset by higher income from our
joint ventures and limited partnerships, driven by appreciation and gains on the underlying assets.



The following tables set forth the income yield and investment income for each major
investment category of our Japanese operations’ general account for the periods indicated. The yields are based on net investment income as reported under U.S. GAAP and do not include adjustments, such as settlements of duration management
swaps that are included in adjusted operating income.

(2)

Yields for the year ended December 31, 2011 are weighted for ten months of income and assets related to the Star and Edison Businesses.

The increase in net investment income yield on the Japanese
insurance portfolio for 2012, compared to 2011, is primarily attributable to more favorable results from alternative investments and asset growth supporting both U.S. and Australian dollar-denominated products, partially offset by lower fixed
maturity reinvestment rates in both the U.S. and Japan.

The decrease in net investment income yield on the Japanese insurance portfolio for 2011, compared to 2010, is primarily attributable to lower fixed maturity reinvestment rates in both the U.S. and Japan,
and the impact of the Star and Edison portfolios.

Both the U.S. dollar-denominated and Australian dollar-denominated fixed maturities that are not hedged to yen through third party
derivative contracts provide a yield that is substantially higher than the yield on comparable yen-denominated fixed maturities. The average amortized cost of U.S. dollar-denominated fixed maturities that are not hedged to yen through third party
derivative contracts for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, was approximately $29.4 billion and $24.2 billion, respectively. The majority of U.S. dollar-denominated fixed maturities support liabilities that are denominated in U.S.
dollars. The average amortized cost of Australian dollar-denominated fixed maturities that are not hedged to yen through third party derivative contracts for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, was approximately $7.0 billion and $4.8
billion, respectively. The Australian dollar-denominated fixed maturities support liabilities that are denominated in Australian dollars.

For additional information regarding U.S. and Australian dollar investments held in our Japanese insurance operations see,
“—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—International Insurance Division” above.

(7)

Prior period’s amounts are presented on a basis consistent with the current period presentation.

The increase in net unrealized gains from December 31,
2011 to December 31, 2012, was primarily due to a net decrease in interest rates in both the U.S. and Japan.



The following table sets forth the composition of the portion of our fixed maturity
securities portfolio by industry category attributable to the Closed Block Business as of the dates indicated and the associated gross unrealized gains and losses.

Fixed Maturity Securities—Closed Block Business

(5)

Prior period’s amounts are presented on a basis consistent with the current period presentation.

The increase in net unrealized gains from December 31,
2011 to December 31, 2012, was primarily due to a net decrease in interest rates.

Asset-Backed Securities

Included within asset-backed securities attributable to both the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business are securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages. While there is no market
standard definition, we define sub-prime mortgages as residential mortgages that are originated to weaker quality obligors as indicated by weaker credit scores, as well as mortgages with higher loan-to-value ratios or limited documentation. The
deterioration of the U.S. housing market and higher unemployment levels over the past several years, coupled with relaxed underwriting standards for some originators of sub-prime mortgages through 2007, have led to higher delinquency rates,
particularly for those mortgages issued in 2006 and 2007. This has resulted in increased attention given to potential deficiencies in lenders’ foreclosure documentation, causing delays in the foreclosure process. From the perspective of an
investor in securities backed by sub-prime collateral, significant delays in foreclosure proceedings have resulted in increased servicing costs which negatively affect the value of the impacted securities. Separately, as an investor in sub-prime
securities, we are pursuing legal and other actions with respect to potential remedies arising from any potential deficiencies related to the original lending and securitization practices.



The following tables set forth the amortized cost and fair value of our asset-backed
securities attributable to the Financial Services Businesses as of the dates indicated, by credit quality, and for asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, by year of issuance (vintage).

Asset-Backed Securities at Amortized Cost—Financial Services
Businesses

(1)

Included within the $2.2 billion of asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages as of December 31, 2012, are $30 million of securities
collateralized by second-lien exposures.

(2)

As of December 31, 2012, includes collateralized loan obligations with amortized cost of $1,858 million, with none secured by sub-prime mortgages. Also includes
asset-backed securities collateralized by education loans, aircraft, equipment leases, franchises, and timeshares.

(3)

Excluded from the table above are asset-backed securities held outside the general account in other entities and operations. Also excluded from the table above are
asset-backed securities classified as trading.

Asset-Backed Securities at Fair Value—Financial Services Businesses



(1)

As of December 31, 2012, includes collateralized loan obligations with fair value of $1,871 million, with none secured by sub-prime mortgages. Also includes
asset-backed securities collateralized by education loans, aircraft, franchises, equipment leases, and timeshares.

(2)

Excluded from the table above are asset-backed securities held outside the general account in other entities and operations. Also excluded from the table above are
asset-backed securities classified as trading.

The tables above provide ratings as assigned by nationally recognized rating agencies as of December 31, 2012, including Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch. In making our
investment decisions, rather than relying solely on the rating agencies’ evaluations, we assign internal ratings to our asset-backed securities based upon our dedicated asset-backed securities unit’s independent evaluation of the
underlying collateral and securitization structure, including any guarantees from monoline bond insurers.

On an amortized cost basis, asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages attributable to the Financial Services
Businesses decreased from $2.634 billion as of December 31, 2011, to $2.242 billion as of December 31, 2012, primarily reflecting sales, principal paydowns and other-than-temporary impairments recognized. Gross unrealized losses related to
our asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages attributable to the Financial Services Businesses were $390 million as of December 31, 2012, and $906 million as of December 31, 2011. For additional information regarding
other-than-temporary impairments of asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages see “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses” above. For information regarding the methodology used in determining the fair value of our
asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The weighted average estimated subordination percentage of our asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages attributable
to the Financial Services Businesses, excluding those supported by guarantees from monoline bond insurers, was 28% as of December 31, 2012. The subordination percentage represents the current weighted average estimated percentage of the capital
structure subordinated to our investment holding that is available to absorb losses before the security incurs the first dollar loss of principal. As of December 31, 2012, based on amortized cost, approximately 57% of the asset-backed
securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages attributable to the Financial Services Businesses have estimated credit subordination percentages of 20% or more, and 39% have estimated credit subordination percentages of 30% or more.

In addition to subordination, certain securities, referred to
as front pay or second pay securities, benefit from the prioritization of principal cash flows within the senior tranches of the structure. In most instances, these shorter duration senior securities have priority to principal cash flows over other
securities in the structure, including longer duration senior securities. Included within the $2.242 billion of asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages attributable to the Financial Services Businesses as of December 31,
2012 were $405 million of securities, on an amortized cost basis, that represent front pay or second pay securities, depending on the overall structure of the securities.



The following tables set forth the amortized cost and fair value of our asset-backed
securities attributable to the Closed Block Business as of the dates indicated, by credit quality, and for asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, by year of issuance (vintage).

Asset-Backed Securities at Amortized Cost—Closed Block Business

(1)

Included within the $1.8 billion of asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages as of December 31, 2012, are $2 million of securities
collateralized by second-lien exposures.

(2)

As of December 31, 2012, includes collateralized loan obligations with amortized cost of $599 million, with none secured by sub-prime mortgages. Also includes
asset-backed securities collateralized by franchises, equipment leases, aircraft, manufacturing and timeshares.

(3)

Excluded from the table above are asset-backed securities classified as trading.

Asset-Backed Securities at Fair Value—Closed Block Business

(1)

As of December 31, 2012, includes collateralized loan obligations with fair value of $605 million, with none secured by sub-prime mortgages. Also includes
asset-backed securities collateralized by franchises, equipment leases, aircraft, manufacturing, and timeshares.

(2)

Excluded from the table above are asset-backed securities classified as trading.



On an amortized cost basis, asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages
attributable to the Closed Block Business decreased from $2.290 billion as of December 31, 2011, to $1.771 billion as of December 31, 2012, primarily reflecting sales, principal paydowns and other-than-temporary impairments recognized.
Gross unrealized losses related to our asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages attributable to the Closed Block Business were $315 million as of December 31, 2012, and $789 million as of December 31, 2011. For
additional information regarding other-than-temporary impairments of asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages see “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses” above. For information regarding the methodology used in
determining the fair value of our asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The weighted average estimated subordination percentage of asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages attributable to
the Closed Block Business, excluding those supported by guarantees from monoline bond insurers, was 32% as of December 31, 2012. The subordination percentage represents the current weighted average estimated percentage of the capital structure
subordinated to our investment holding that is available to absorb losses before the security incurs the first dollar loss of principal. As of December 31, 2012, based on amortized cost, approximately 67% of the asset-backed securities
collateralized by sub-prime mortgages attributable to the Closed Block Business have estimated credit subordination percentages of 20% or more, and 46% have estimated credit subordination percentages of 30% or more.

In addition to subordination, certain securities, referred to
as front pay or second pay securities, benefit from the prioritization of principal cash flows within the senior tranches of the structure. In most instances, these shorter duration senior securities have priority to principal cash flows over other
securities in the structure, including longer duration senior securities. Included within the $1.771 billion of asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages attributable to the Closed Block Business as of December 31, 2012,
were $348 million of securities, on an amortized cost basis, that represent front pay or second pay securities, depending on the overall structure of the securities.

Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities

The commercial real estate market was severely impacted by the financial crisis and the subsequent recession; however, market fundamentals
appear to have bottomed and have shown signs of improvement since late 2010. Commercial real estate vacancy rates have declined from their peak, rent growth has turned positive, and prices of commercial real estate have stabilized. Additionally, the
elevated delinquency rate on mortgages in the commercial mortgage-backed securities market has slowed and refinancing activity has increased, reflecting the improvement in these fundamentals. The loans included in new issues seem to reflect better
underwriting and lower levels of leverage compared to 2007.

Although there are positive signs in commercial real estate, there are still some significant challenges for this market, including numerous future loan workouts, a large wave of refinancings for
over-leveraged properties and numerous legislative changes. To ensure our investment objectives and asset strategies are maintained, we consider these market factors in making our investment decisions on commercial mortgage-backed securities.

The following tables set forth the amortized cost
and fair value of our commercial mortgage-backed securities attributable to the Financial Services Businesses as of the dates indicated, by credit quality and by year of issuance (vintage).

Fixed Maturity Securities
Credit Quality

The Securities Valuation
Office, or SVO, of the NAIC, evaluates the investments of insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called “NAIC Designations.” In general, NAIC Designations of “1”
highest quality, or “2” high quality, include fixed maturities considered investment grade, which include securities rated Baa3 or higher by Moody’s or BBB- or higher by Standard & Poor’s. NAIC Designations of
“3” through “6” generally include fixed maturities referred to as below investment grade, which include securities rated Ba1 or lower by Moody’s and BB+ or lower by Standard & Poor’s. The NAIC Designations for
commercial mortgage-backed securities and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, including our asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, are based on security level expected losses as modeled by an independent third
party (engaged by the NAIC) and the statutory carrying value of the security, including any purchase discounts or impairment charges previously recognized.

As a result of time lags between the funding of investments, the finalization of legal documents, and the completion of the SVO filing
process, the fixed maturity portfolio generally includes securities that have not yet been rated by the SVO as of each balance sheet date. Pending receipt of SVO ratings, the categorization of these securities by NAIC Designation is based on the
expected ratings indicated by internal analysis.

Investments of our international insurance companies are not subject to NAIC guidelines. Investments of our Japanese insurance operations
are regulated locally by the Financial Services Agency, an agency of the Japanese government. The Financial Services Agency has its own investment quality criteria and risk control standards. Our Japanese insurance companies comply with the
Financial Services Agency’s credit quality review and risk monitoring guidelines. The credit quality ratings of the investments of our Japanese insurance companies are based on ratings assigned by nationally recognized credit rating agencies,
including Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, or rating equivalents based on ratings assigned by Japanese credit ratings agencies.

Credit Derivative Exposure to Public Fixed Maturities

In addition to the credit exposure from
public fixed maturities noted above, we sell credit derivatives to enhance the return on our investment portfolio by creating credit exposure similar to an investment in public fixed maturity cash instruments.

In a credit derivative, we sell credit protection on an
identified name or a broad-based index, and in return receive a quarterly premium. This premium or credit spread generally corresponds to the difference between the yield on the referenced name’s (or an index’s underlying reference names)
public fixed maturity cash instruments and swap rates at the time the agreement is executed.

The majority of the underlying reference names in single name and index credit derivatives where we have sold credit protection, as well as all the counterparties to these agreements, are investment grade
credit quality and our credit derivatives have a remaining term to maturity of five years or less. Credit derivative contracts are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value, including the premium received, recorded in “Realized
investment gains (losses), net.” The premium received for the credit derivatives we sell attributable to the Financial Services Businesses was $3 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and is
included in adjusted operating income as an adjustment to “Realized investment gains (losses), net.”



As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Financial Services Businesses had $1,065 million
and $770 million of outstanding notional amounts, respectively, each reported at fair value as an asset of $2 million, where we have sold credit protection through credit derivatives. These amounts exclude a credit derivative related to surplus
notes issued by a subsidiary of Prudential Insurance and embedded derivatives contained in certain externally-managed investments in the European market. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these
derivatives.

As of December 31, 2012 and
2011, the Closed Block Business had $5 million and $50 million of outstanding notional amounts, respectively, each reported at fair value as an asset of less than $1 million of exposure where we have sold credit protection through credit
derivatives.

In addition to selling credit
protection, we have purchased credit protection using credit derivatives in order to hedge specific credit exposures in our investment portfolio, including exposures relating to certain guarantees from monoline bond insurers. As of December 31,
2012 and 2011, the Financial Services Businesses had $1,370 million and $1,598 million of outstanding notional amounts, reported at fair value as a liability of $27 million and an asset of $2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2012 and
2011, the Closed Block Business had $309 million and $381 million of outstanding notional amounts, reported at fair value as a liability of $8 million and an asset of less than $1 million, respectively. The premium paid for the credit derivatives we
purchase attributable to the Financial Services Businesses was $38 million and $43 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and is included in adjusted operating income as an adjustment to “Realized investment
gains (losses), net.” See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding credit derivatives and an overall description of our derivative activities.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of Fixed Maturity Securities

We maintain separate monitoring processes for public and
private fixed maturities and create watch lists to highlight securities that require special scrutiny and management. Our public fixed maturity asset managers formally review all public fixed maturity holdings on a quarterly basis and more
frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings downgrades, unexpected price variances, and/or company or industry specific concerns.

For private placements, our credit and portfolio management
processes help ensure prudent controls over valuation and management. We have separate pricing and authorization processes to establish “checks and balances” for new investments. We apply consistent standards of credit analysis and due
diligence for all transactions, whether they originate through our own in-house origination staff or through agents. Our regional offices closely monitor the portfolios in their regions. We set all valuation standards centrally, and we assess the
fair value of all investments quarterly. Our private fixed maturity asset managers formally review all private fixed maturity holdings on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration whether due to
ratings downgrades, unexpected price variances, and/or company or industry specific concerns.

Fixed maturity securities classified as held-to-maturity are those securities where we have the intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity. These securities are reflected at amortized cost
in our consolidated statements of financial position. Other fixed maturity securities are considered available-for-sale and, as a result, we record unrealized gains and losses to the extent that amortized cost is different from estimated fair value.
All held-to-maturity securities and all available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses are subject to our review to identify other-than-temporary impairments in value.

In evaluating whether a decline in value is
other-than-temporary, we consistently consider several factors including, but not limited to, the following:

•

the reasons for the decline in value (credit event, currency or interest rate related, including general credit spread widening);

•

the financial condition of and near-term prospects of the issuer; and

•

the extent and duration of the decline.



In determining whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, we place greater emphasis
on our analysis of the underlying credit versus the extent and duration of a decline in value. Our credit analysis of an investment includes determining whether the issuer is current on its contractual payments, evaluating whether it is probable
that we will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security, and analyzing our overall ability to recover the amortized cost of the investment. We continue to utilize valuation declines as a potential indicator
of credit deterioration, and apply additional levels of scrutiny in our analysis as the severity and duration of the decline increases.

In addition, we recognize an other-than-temporary impairment in earnings for a debt security in an unrealized loss position when
(a) we have the intent to sell the debt security, or (b) it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery or (c) a foreign currency denominated security with a foreign currency
translation loss approaches maturity. For all debt securities in unrealized loss positions that do not meet any of these criteria, we analyze our ability to recover the amortized cost by comparing the net present value of our best estimate of
projected future cash flows with the amortized cost of the security. If the net present value is less than the amortized cost of the investment, an other-than-temporary impairment is recorded. The determination of the assumptions used in these
projections requires the use of significant management judgment. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these assumptions and our policies for recognizing other-than-temporary impairments for debt
securities.

Other-than-temporary impairments of
general account fixed maturity securities attributable to the Financial Services Businesses that were recognized in earnings were $253 million and $431 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Included in the
other-than-temporary impairments of general account fixed maturities attributable to the Financial Services Businesses for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, were $56 million and $118 million, respectively, of other-than-temporary
impairments on asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages.

Other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities attributable to the Closed Block Business that were recognized in earnings were $74 million and $104 million for the years ended
December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Included in the other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturities attributable to the Closed Block Business for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, were $40 million and $67 million,
respectively, of other-than-temporary impairments on asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages. For a further discussion of other-than-temporary impairments, see “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses” above.



Trading Account Assets Supporting Insurance Liabilities

Certain products included in the Retirement and
International Insurance segments are experience-rated, meaning that we expect the investment results associated with these products will ultimately accrue to contractholders. The investments supporting these experience-rated products, excluding
commercial mortgage and other loans, are primarily classified as trading and are reflected on the balance sheet as “Trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities, at fair value.” Realized and unrealized gains and losses for these
investments are reported in “Asset management fees and other income,” and excluded from adjusted operating income. Investment income for these investments is reported in “Net investment income,” and is included in adjusted
operating income. The following table sets forth the composition of this portfolio as of the dates indicated.

(1)

Prior period’s amounts are presented on a basis consistent with the current period presentation.

As a percentage of amortized cost, 75% of the portfolio was
publicly-traded as of both December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, 93% and 92%, respectively, of the fixed maturity portfolio was considered high or highest quality based on NAIC or equivalent rating. As
of December 31, 2012, $1.867 billion of the residential mortgage-backed securities were publicly-traded agency pass-through securities, which are supported by implicit or explicit government guarantees, of which 99% have credit ratings of A or
higher. Collateralized mortgage obligations, including approximately $73 million secured by “ALT-A” mortgages, represented the remaining $98 million of residential mortgage-backed securities, of which 29% have credit ratings of A or better
and 71% are BBB and below. For a discussion of changes in the fair value of our trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities see “—Experience-Rated Contractholder Liabilities, Trading Account Assets Supporting Insurance
Liabilities and Other Related Investments,” above.

Other Trading Account Assets

Other trading account assets consist primarily of certain financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative where we elected to
classify the entire instrument as a trading account asset rather than bifurcate. These instruments are carried at fair value, with realized and unrealized gains and losses reported in “Asset management fees and other income,” and excluded
from adjusted operating income. Interest and dividend income from these investments is reported in “Net investment income,” and is included in adjusted operating income.



The following table sets forth the composition of our other trading account assets as of the
dates indicated.

(1)

Included in equity securities are perpetual preferred stock securities that have characteristics of both debt and equity securities.

As of December 31, 2012, on an amortized cost basis, 67%
of asset-backed securities classified as “Other trading account assets” attributable to the Financial Services Businesses have credit ratings of A or above, 18% have BBB credit ratings, and the remaining 15% have BB or below credit
ratings. As of December 31, 2012, on an amortized cost basis, 100% of asset-backed securities classified as “Other trading account assets” attributable to the Closed Block Business have credit ratings of A or above.

Commercial Mortgage and Other Loans

Investment Mix

As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we held approximately
9% and 10%, respectively, of our general account investments in commercial mortgage and other loans. This percentage is net of a $244 million and $310 million allowance for losses as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

The following table sets forth the composition of our
commercial mortgage and other loans portfolio, before the allowance for losses, as of the dates indicated.

(1)

Excluded from the table above are commercial mortgage loans held outside the general account in other entities and operations. For additional information regarding
commercial mortgage loans held outside the general account, see “—Invested Assets of Other Entities and Operations” below.

We originate commercial and agricultural mortgage loans using a dedicated investment staff and a network of independent companies through
our various regional offices. All loans are underwritten consistently to our standards using a proprietary quality rating system that has been developed from our experience in real estate and mortgage lending.

Uncollateralized loans primarily represent reverse dual
currency loans and corporate loans which do not meet the definition of a security under authoritative accounting guidance.



Residential property loans primarily include Japanese recourse loans. Upon default of these
recourse loans we can make a claim against the personal assets of the property owner, in addition to the mortgaged property. These loans are also backed by third party guarantors.

Other collateralized loans attributable to the Financial
Services Businesses include $45 million and $63 million of collateralized consumer loans as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Composition of Commercial and Agricultural Mortgage Loans

The commercial real estate market was severely impacted by
the financial crisis and the subsequent recession, though the flow of capital to commercial real estate has been strong since 2010. Portfolio lenders have been actively originating loans, focusing primarily on the highest quality properties in major
markets, resulting in an increase in the liquidity and availability of capital in the commercial mortgage loan market. For most property types, the market fundamentals have stabilized or are improving. In addition, the commercial banks are active
and there has been increased loan origination activity by securitization lenders as market spreads have tightened. These conditions have led to greater competition for portfolio lenders such as our general account, though underwriting remains
conservative. While there is still some weakness in commercial real estate fundamentals that are dependent on employment recovery, delinquency rates on our commercial mortgage loans remain stable. For additional information see “—Realized
Investment Gains and Losses,” above.

Our
commercial and agricultural mortgage loan portfolio strategy emphasizes diversification by property type and geographic location. The following tables set forth the breakdown of the gross carrying values of our general account investments in
commercial and agricultural mortgage loans by geographic region and property type as of the dates indicated.



Loan-to-value and debt
service coverage ratios are measures commonly used to assess the quality of commercial and agricultural mortgage loans. The loan-to-value ratio compares the amount of the loan to the fair value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan,
and is commonly expressed as a percentage. Loan-to-value ratios greater than 100% indicate that the loan amount is greater than the collateral value. A smaller loan-to-value ratio indicates a greater excess of collateral value over the loan amount.
The debt service coverage ratio compares a property’s net operating income to its debt service payments. Debt service coverage ratios less than 1.0 times indicate that property operations do not generate enough income to cover the loan’s
current debt payments. A larger debt service coverage ratio indicates a greater excess of net operating income over the debt service payments.

As of December 31, 2012, our general account investments in commercial and agricultural mortgage loans attributable to the Financial
Services Businesses had a weighted average debt service coverage ratio of 2.07 times, and a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 57%. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 97% of commercial and agricultural mortgage loans attributable to
the Financial Services Businesses were fixed rate loans. As of December 31, 2012, our general account investments in commercial and agricultural mortgage loans attributable to the Closed Block Business had a weighted average debt service
coverage ratio of 2.0 times, and a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 54%. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 99% of commercial and agricultural mortgage loans attributable to the Closed Block Business were fixed rate loans. For those
general account commercial and agricultural mortgage loans attributable to the Financial Services Businesses that were originated in 2012, the weighted average debt service coverage ratio was 2.51 times and the weighted average loan-to-value ratio
was 64%.

The values utilized in calculating these
loan-to-value ratios are developed as part of our periodic review of the commercial and agricultural mortgage loan portfolio, which includes an internal evaluation of the underlying collateral value. Our periodic review also includes a quality
re-rating process, whereby we update the internal quality rating originally assigned at underwriting based on the proprietary quality rating system mentioned above. As discussed below, the internal quality rating is a key input in determining our
allowance for loan losses.

For loans with
collateral under construction, renovation or lease-up, a stabilized value and projected net operating income are used in the calculation of the loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios. Our commercial and agricultural mortgage loan portfolio
attributable to the Financial Services Businesses included approximately $0.5 billion of such loans as of both December 31, 2012 and 2011, and our commercial and agricultural mortgage loan portfolio attributable to the Closed Block Business
included approximately $0.1 billion and $0.2 billion of such loans as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. All else being equal, these loans are inherently more risky than those collateralized by properties that have already stabilized.
As of December 31, 2012, there are no loan-specific reserves related to these loans attributable to either the Financial Services Businesses or the Closed Block Business. In addition, these unstabilized loans are included in the calculation of
our portfolio reserve as discussed below. For information regarding similar loans we hold as part of our commercial and agricultural mortgage operations, see “—Invested Assets of Other Entities and Operations,” below.



The following tables set forth the gross carrying value of our general account investments
in commercial and agricultural mortgage loans attributable to the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business as of the dates indicated by loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios.

Commercial Mortgage and Other Loans by Contractual Maturity Date

The following table sets forth the breakdown of our
commercial mortgage and other loan portfolio by contractual maturity as of December 31, 2012.

Commercial Mortgage and
Other Loan Quality

Ongoing review of the
portfolio is performed and loans are placed on watch list status based on a predefined set of criteria, where they are assigned to one of the following categories. We place loans on early warning status in cases where, based on our analysis of the
loan’s collateral, the financial situation of the borrower or tenants or other market factors, we believe a loss of principal or interest could occur. We classify loans as closely monitored when we determine there is a collateral deficiency or
other credit events that may lead to a potential loss of principal or interest. Loans not in good standing are those loans where we have concluded that there is a high probability of loss of principal, such as when the loan is in the process of
foreclosure or the borrower is in bankruptcy. In our domestic operations, our workout and special servicing professionals manage the loans on the watch list. As described below, in determining our allowance for losses we evaluate each loan on the
watch list to determine if it is probable that amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected. In our international portfolios, we monitor delinquency in consumer loans on a pool basis and evaluate any
servicing relationship and guarantees the same way we do for commercial mortgage loans.

We establish an allowance for losses to provide for the risk of credit losses inherent in the lending process. The allowance includes loan specific reserves for loans that are determined to be impaired as
a result of our loan review process, and a portfolio reserve for probable incurred but not specifically identified losses for loans which are not on the watch list. We define an impaired loan as a loan for which we estimate it is probable that
amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected. The loan specific portion of the loss allowance is based on our assessment as to ultimate collectability of loan principal and interest. Valuation allowances
for an impaired loan are recorded based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or based on the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The portfolio reserve
for incurred but not specifically identified losses considers the current credit composition of the portfolio based on the internal quality ratings mentioned above. The portfolio reserves are determined using past loan experience, including
historical credit migration, loss probability, and loss severity factors by property type. These factors are reviewed and updated as appropriate. The valuation allowance for commercial mortgage and other loans can increase or decrease from period to
period based on these factors.

Our general
account investments in commercial mortgage and other loans attributable to the Financial Services Businesses, based upon the recorded investment gross of allowance for credit losses, was $26,809 million and $25,323 million as of December 31, 2012
and 2011, respectively. As a percentage of recorded investment gross of allowance, 99% of the assets were current for both periods.



Our general account investments in commercial mortgage and other loans attributable to the
Closed Block Business, based upon the recorded investment gross of allowance for credit losses, was $9,666 million and $9,100 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. As a percentage of recorded investment gross of allowance,
more than 99% of the assets were current for both periods.

The equity securities attributable to the Financial Services
Businesses consist principally of investments in common and preferred stock of publicly-traded companies, as well as mutual fund shares. The following table sets forth the composition of our equity securities portfolio attributable to the Financial
Services Businesses and the associated gross unrealized gains and losses as of the dates indicated.

Equity Securities—Financial Services Businesses

(1)

Includes mutual fund shares representing our interest in the underlying assets of certain of our separate account investments supporting corporate-owned life insurance.
These mutual funds invest primarily in high yield bonds.

(2)

Amounts presented exclude hedge funds and other alternative investments which are reported in “Other long-term investments.”



The following table sets forth the composition of our equity securities portfolio
attributable to the Closed Block Business and the associated gross unrealized gains and losses as of the dates indicated.

Equity Securities—Closed Block Business

Other-Than-Temporary
Impairments of Equity Securities

For those
equity securities classified as available-for-sale, we record unrealized gains and losses to the extent cost is different from estimated fair value. All securities with unrealized losses are subject to our review to identify other-than-temporary
impairments in value. In evaluating whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, we consistently consider several factors including, but not limited to, the following:

•

the extent and the duration of the decline; including, but not limited to, the following general guidelines:

•

declines in value greater than 20%, maintained for six months or greater;

•

declines in value maintained for one year or greater; and

•

declines in value greater than 50%;

•

the reasons for the decline in value (issuer specific event, currency or market fluctuation);

•

our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value, including certain equity securities managed by
independent third parties where we do not exercise management discretion concerning individual buy or sell decisions; and

•

the financial condition of and near-term prospects of the issuer.

We generally recognize other-than-temporary impairments for securities with declines in value greater than 50%
maintained for six months or greater or with any decline in value maintained for one year or greater. In addition, in making our determinations we continue to analyze the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including an
assessment of the issuer’s capital position, and consider our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value.

For those securities that have declines in value that are
deemed to be only temporary, we make an assertion as to our ability and intent to retain the security until recovery. Once identified, these securities are restricted from trading unless authorized based upon events that could not have been foreseen
at the time we asserted our ability and intent to retain the security until recovery. Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, the deterioration of the issuer’s creditworthiness, a major business combination or disposition, a
change in regulatory requirements, certain other portfolio actions or other similar events. For those securities that have declines in value for which we cannot assert our ability and intent to retain until recovery, including certain equity
securities managed by independent third parties where we do not exercise management discretion concerning individual buy or sell decisions, impairments are recognized as other-than-temporary regardless of the reason for, or the extent of, the
decline. For perpetual preferred securities, which have characteristics of both debt and equity securities, we apply an impairment model similar to our fixed maturity securities, factoring in the position of the security in the capital structure and
the lack of a formal maturity date. For additional discussion of our policies regarding other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities, see “—Fixed Maturity Securities—Other-than-Temporary Impairments of Fixed Maturity
Securities” above.



When we determine that there is an other-than-temporary impairment, we record a writedown to
estimated fair value, which reduces the cost basis and is included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our policies around
other-than-temporary impairments for equity securities. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the fair value methodology used for equity securities.

Impairments of equity securities attributable to the Financial Services Businesses were $104 million and $94
million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Impairments of equity securities attributable to the Closed Block Business were $21 million and $18 million for years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. For
a further discussion of impairments, see “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses” above.

Other Long-Term Investments

“Other long-term investments” are comprised as follows:

(1)

Primarily includes investments in office buildings within our Japanese insurance operations.

(2)

Primarily includes derivatives and member and activity stock held in the Federal Home Loan Banks of New York and Boston. For additional information regarding our
holdings in the Federal Home Loan Banks of New York and Boston, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The increase in non-real estate-related joint venture and limited partnership assets is due to private equity partnership assets acquired
from the two pension risk transfer transactions completed in the fourth quarter of 2012.

Invested Assets of Other Entities and Operations

The following table sets forth the composition of investments held outside the general account in other entities and operations, including
the invested assets of our trading, banking and asset management operations, as of the dates indicated. Assets of our asset management operations managed for third parties and those assets classified as “Separate account assets” on our
balance sheet are not included.

(1)

Includes trading positions held by our derivatives trading operations used in a non-dealer capacity to manage interest rate, currency, credit and equity exposures.

(2)

Book value is generally based on unpaid principal balance net of any allowance for losses, the lower of cost or fair value, or fair value, depending on the loan.



Commercial Mortgage and Other Loans

Our asset management operations include our commercial
mortgage operations, which provide mortgage origination, asset management and servicing for our general account, institutional clients, and government sponsored entities such as Fannie Mae, the Federal Housing Administration, and Freddie Mac. We
also originate shorter-term interim loans for spread lending that are collateralized by assets generally under renovation or lease up. All else being equal, these interim loans are inherently more risky than those collateralized by properties that
have already stabilized. Our interim loans are generally paid off through refinancing or the sale of the underlying collateral by the borrower.

The following table sets forth information regarding the interim loan portfolio held outside the general account in other entities and
operations as of the dates indicated.

(1)

A stabilized value and projected net operating income are used in the calculation of the loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios.

As of December 31, 2012, we hold no commercial real
estate held-for-sale related to foreclosed interim loans. The mortgage loans of our commercial mortgage operations are included in “Commercial mortgage and other loans,” with related derivatives and other hedging instruments primarily
included in “Other trading account assets” and “Other long-term investments.”

Other Long-Term Investments

Other long-term investments primarily include strategic investments made as part of our asset management operations. We make these strategic investments in real estate, as well as fixed income, public
equity and real estate securities, including controlling interests. Certain of these investments are made primarily for purposes of co-investment in our managed funds and structured products. Other strategic investments are made with the intention
to sell or syndicate to investors, including our general account, or for placement in funds and structured products that we offer and manage (seed investments). As part of our asset management operations, we also make loans to our managed funds that
are secured by equity commitments from investors or assets of the funds.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Overview

Liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet the payment obligations of the Company. Capital refers to the long term financial resources available to support the
operations of our businesses, fund business growth, and provide a cushion to withstand adverse circumstances. Our ability to generate and maintain sufficient liquidity and capital depends on the profitability of our businesses, general economic
conditions and our access to the capital markets and the alternate sources of liquidity and capital described herein.

Effective and prudent liquidity and capital management is a priority across the organization. Management monitors the liquidity of
Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries on a daily basis and projects borrowing and capital needs over a multi-year time horizon through our quarterly planning process. We believe that cash flows from the sources of funds available to us are
sufficient to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries, including under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios. We have a capital management framework in place that facilitates the allocation of
capital and approval of capital uses, and we forecast capital sources and uses on a quarterly basis. Furthermore, we employ a “Capital Protection Framework”



to ensure the availability of sufficient capital resources to maintain adequate capitalization on a consolidated basis and competitive risk-based capital ratios and solvency margins for our
insurance subsidiaries under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios.

The Dodd-Frank Act may result in the imposition on us of new capital and liquidity standards, including requirements regarding risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity, stress-testing and other matters. We
are currently under consideration by the Financial Stability Oversight Council for a proposed determination that we should be subject to these and other regulatory standards and to supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
under the Dodd Frank Act. See “Business—Regulation” and “Risk Factors” for information regarding the potential impact of the Dodd-Frank Act.

During 2012, we took the following significant actions that
impacted our liquidity and capital position:

•

We repositioned our capital structure by issuing an aggregate of $3.1 billion of junior subordinated debt in public offerings;

•

In addition to maturing debt, we repaid $1.6 billion of senior debt through optional redemptions of retail notes;

•

We repurchased $650 million of shares of our Common Stock and paid shareholder dividends of $749 million; and

•

We made substantial investments in our businesses, including the expansion of our Retirement business through two significant pension risk transfer
transactions and an agreement to acquire The Hartford’s Individual Life Insurance Business, which closed in January 2013.

Capital

Our capital management framework is primarily based on statutory risk-based capital and solvency margin measures. Due to our diverse mix
of businesses and applicable regulatory requirements, we apply certain refinements to the framework that are designed to more appropriately reflect risks associated with our businesses on a consistent basis across the Company. In addition, we use an
economic capital framework to inform capital decisions.

We seek to capitalize all of our subsidiaries and businesses in accordance with their ratings targets, and we believe Prudential Financial’s capitalization and use of financial leverage are
consistent with those ratings targets. Our long-term senior debt rating targets for Prudential Financial are “A” for Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, or S&P, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., or Moody’s, and
Fitch Ratings Ltd., or Fitch, and “a” for A.M. Best Company, or A.M. Best. Our financial strength rating targets for our life insurance companies are “AA/Aa/AA” for S&P, Moody’s and Fitch, respectively, and
“A+” for A.M. Best. Currently, some of our ratings are below these targets. For a description of the potential impacts of ratings downgrades, see “—Ratings.”

Capital Governance

Our capital management framework is ultimately reviewed and approved by the Company’s Board of Directors. Prior to Board review, our
Capital and Financial Controls Committee (“CFCC”) reviews the use and allocation of capital above certain threshold amounts to ensure that capital is efficiently deployed and earns returns consistent with our strategic objectives, ratings
aspirations and other goals and targets. This management committee provides a multi-disciplinary due diligence review of specific initiatives or transactions requiring the use of capital, including all mergers and acquisitions, as well as new
products, initiatives and transactions that present substantial reputational, legal, regulatory, operating, accounting or tax risk. The CFCC also evaluates the Company’s Annual Capital and Financing Plan (and quarterly updates to this plan) and
the Company’s capital, liquidity and financial position, borrowing plans, and related matters prior to the discussion of these items with the Company’s Board of Directors.

Under our capital management policy approved by the Board of Directors, our Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer and Vice Chairman are authorized to approve capital actions on behalf of the Company and to further delegate authority with respect to capital actions to appropriate officers. Any capital commitment that exceeds the authority granted to
senior management is separately authorized by the Board.



Capitalization

The primary components of capitalization for the Financial
Services Businesses consist of the equity we attribute to the Financial Services Businesses and outstanding capital debt, including junior subordinated debt, of the Financial Services Businesses. As shown in the table below, as of December 31,
2012, the Financial Services Businesses had $37.9 billion in capital, all of which was available to support the aggregate capital requirements of its three divisions and its Corporate and Other operations. Based on our assessment of these businesses
and operations, we believe this level of capital is consistent with our ratings targets.

(1)

Excludes AOCI. This amount may be subject to volatility due to, among other things, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on certain non-yen
denominated assets and liabilities within our Japanese insurance operations, for which the foreign currency exposure is economically matched and offset in AOCI (see “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by
Segment—International Insurance Division—Impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on earnings—U.S. GAAP earnings impact of products denominated in non-local currencies” for additional information).

Regulatory Capital

We manage Prudential Insurance, Gibraltar, Prudential of
Japan, and our other domestic and international insurance subsidiaries to regulatory capital levels consistent with our “AA” ratings targets.

The Risk-Based Capital, or RBC, ratio is a primary measure of the capital adequacy of Prudential Insurance, which includes businesses in
both the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, and our other domestic insurance subsidiaries. RBC is calculated based on statutory financial statements and risk formulas consistent with National Association of Insurance
Commissioners, or NAIC, practices. RBC considers, among other things, risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets, insurance-related risks associated with an insurer’s products and liabilities, interest rate risks and general
business risks. The RBC ratio calculations are intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring the insurer’s solvency and ability to pay future claims. The reporting of RBC measures is not intended for the purpose of ranking any insurance
company or for use in connection with any marketing, advertising or promotional activities but is available to the public. All of our domestic insurance companies have RBC ratios that exceed the minimum level required by applicable insurance
regulations. The table below presents the RBC ratios of certain of our domestic insurance subsidiaries as of the periods indicated:

Similar to the RBC ratios
that are employed by U.S. insurance regulators, regulatory authorities in the international jurisdictions in which we operate generally establish some form of minimum solvency margin requirements for insurance companies based on local statutory
accounting practices. These solvency margins are a primary measure of the capital adequacy of our international insurance operations. Maintenance of our solvency margins at certain levels is also important to our competitive positioning, as in
certain jurisdictions, such as Japan, these solvency margins are required to be disclosed to the public and therefore impact the public perception of an insurer’s financial strength. The table below presents the solvency margins of our most
significant international insurance subsidiaries as of the periods indicated:

(1)

Reflects the merger of the acquired Star and Edison entities with Gibraltar, which became effective January 1, 2012, and includes Prudential Gibraltar Financial
Life Insurance Company, Ltd., or Prudential Gibraltar, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gibraltar.



The regulatory capital levels of our domestic and international insurance subsidiaries can
be materially impacted by interest rates, equity market and real estate market fluctuations, changes in the values of derivatives, the level of impairments recorded, credit quality migration of the investment portfolio, foreign exchange rate
movements and business growth, among other items. In addition, particularly for our domestic insurance subsidiaries, the recapture of business subject to reinsurance arrangements due to defaults by, or credit quality migration affecting, the
reinsurers could result in higher required statutory capital levels. Our regulatory capital levels are also affected by statutory accounting rules, which are subject to change by each applicable insurance regulator.

We evaluate the regulatory capital levels of our domestic and
international insurance operations under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios and believe we have adequate resources to maintain our capital levels comfortably above regulatory requirements under these scenarios. For further information on the
calculation of RBC and solvency margin ratios, as well as regulatory minimums, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Capital Protection Framework

We employ a “Capital Protection Framework” to ensure sufficient capital resources are available to maintain adequate
capitalization on a consolidated basis and competitive RBC ratios and solvency margins for our insurance subsidiaries under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios. The Capital Protection Framework incorporates the potential impact from market
related stresses, including equity markets, interest rates, credit losses, and foreign currency exchange rates. Potential sources of capital include on-balance sheet capital, derivatives, reinsurance and contingent sources of capital. Although we
continue to enhance our approach, we believe we currently have sufficient resources to maintain adequate capitalization and competitive RBC ratios and solvency margins under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios. See “Business—Corporate
and Other” for further information on our Capital Protection Framework.

Shareholder Distributions

Share Repurchase Program

In June 2012, our Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase at management’s discretion up to $1.0 billion of its outstanding Common Stock during the period from July 1, 2012
through June 30, 2013. As of December 31, 2012, 2.7 million shares of our Common Stock were repurchased under this authorization for a total cost of $150 million. The Company exhausted the Board’s previous $1.5 billion repurchase
authority which covered the prior twelve-month period. During 2012, 11.5 million shares of our Common Stock were repurchased, for a total cost of $650 million. The timing and amount of any future share repurchases will be determined by
management based on market conditions and other considerations. Repurchases may be effected in the open market, through derivative, accelerated repurchase and other negotiated transactions and through plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1(c)
under the Exchange Act. Numerous factors could affect the timing and amount of any future repurchases under the share repurchase program, including increased capital needs of our businesses due to opportunities for growth and acquisitions, as well
as adverse market conditions.



Shareholder Dividends

On November 7, 2012, Prudential Financial declared an annual dividend for 2012 of $1.60 per share of
Common Stock, representing an increase of approximately 10% from the 2011 Common Stock dividend. On February 12, 2013, Prudential Financial declared a dividend for the first quarter of 2013 of $0.40 per share of Common Stock reflecting our plan
to move to a quarterly Common Stock dividend schedule in 2013. The table below presents declaration, record, and payment dates, as well as per share and aggregate dividend amounts, for the Common Stock dividend for the last five years.

Captive Reinsurance Companies

We use captive reinsurance companies in
our domestic insurance operations to more effectively manage our capital on an economic basis and to enable the aggregation and transfer of risks. To support the risks they assume, our captives are capitalized to a level consistent with the
“AA” financial strength rating targets of our issuing insurance entities. All of our captive reinsurance companies are wholly-owned subsidiaries and are located domestically, typically in the state of domicile of our direct writing entity
that cedes business to the captive. In addition to governance by U.S. regulators, our captives are subject to internal policies governing their activities. In the normal course of business, Prudential Financial provides support to these captives
through net worth maintenance agreements and/or guarantees of certain of the captives’ obligations.

Our domestic life insurance subsidiaries are subject to a regulation entitled “Valuation of Life Insurance Policies,” commonly
known as “Regulation XXX,” and a supporting guideline entitled “The Application of the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies,” commonly known as “Guideline AXXX.” The regulation and supporting guideline require insurers
to establish statutory reserves for term and universal life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees that are consistent with the statutory reserves required for other individual life insurance policies with similar guarantees. Many
market participants believe that these levels of reserves are non-economic. We use captive reinsurance companies to implement reinsurance and capital management actions to satisfy these reserves requirements, including financing the non-economic
reserves through internal and external solutions. See “—Financing Activities—Subsidiary borrowings—Financing of regulatory reserves associated with domestic life insurance products” below for additional information on our
financing activities related to Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX.

We reinsure living benefit guarantees on certain variable annuity and retirement products from our domestic life insurance companies to a domestic captive reinsurance company, Pruco Reinsurance, Ltd., or
Pruco Re. This enables us to execute our living benefit hedging program primarily within one legal entity, Pruco Re. As part of the living benefit hedging program, we enter into a range of exchange-traded and over the counter equity and interest
rate derivatives to hedge certain optional living benefit features accounted for as embedded derivatives against changes in certain capital market conditions such as interest rate and equity market exposures. For a full discussion of our living
benefits hedging program, see “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division—Individual Annuities.” We believe Pruco Re maintains an adequate
level of capital and liquidity to support this hedging program. However, as discussed below under “Liquidity associated with other activities—Hedging activities associated with living benefit guarantees,” Pruco Re’s capital and
liquidity needs can vary significantly due to, among other things, changes in equity markets, interest rates, mortality and policyholder behavior. Through our Capital Protection Framework, we maintain access to on-balance sheet and contingent
sources of capital and liquidity that are available to meet any needs as they arise.



We reinsure 90% of the short-term risks of Prudential Insurance’s Closed Block Business
to a captive reinsurance company domiciled in New Jersey. These short-term risks represent the impact of variations in experience of the Closed Block that are expected to be recovered over time as a result of corresponding adjustments to
policyholder dividends. The reinsurance arrangement is intended to alleviate the short-term surplus volatility within Prudential Insurance resulting from the Closed Block Business, including volatility caused by the impact of any unrealized
mark-to-market losses and realized credit losses within the investment portfolio. In October 2011, in connection with the Closed Block reinsurance arrangement, we entered into a $2 billion letter of credit facility with certain financial
institutions, pursuant to which the New Jersey captive can obtain a letter of credit during a 3-year availability period to support its funding obligations under the reinsurance arrangement. Prudential Financial guarantees all obligations of the New
Jersey captive under the facility, including its obligation to reimburse any draws made under a letter of credit. Because experience of the Closed Block is ultimately passed along to policyholders over time through the annual policyholder dividend,
we believe that any draw under a letter of credit is unlikely. Our ability to obtain a letter of credit under the facility is subject to the continued satisfaction of customary conditions similar to those described under “Credit
Facilities” below.

Insurance regulators are
reviewing life insurers’ use of captive reinsurance companies. We cannot predict what, if any, changes may result from this review. If applicable insurance laws are changed in a way that impairs the use of captive reinsurance companies, our
financial results, liquidity and capital position may be adversely affected.

Liquidity

Liquidity management and stress testing are performed on a legal entity basis as the ability to transfer funds between subsidiaries is limited due in part to regulatory restrictions. Liquidity needs are
determined through daily and quarterly cash flow forecasting at the holding company and within our operating subsidiaries. A target cash balance of $1.2 billion is maintained to ensure adequate liquidity is available at Prudential Financial to cover
fixed expenses in the event that we experience reduced cash flows from our operating subsidiaries. This target balance is reviewed and approved annually by the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.

To mitigate the risk of having limited or no access to
financing due to stressed market conditions, we aim to prefund capital debt in advance of maturity. We mitigate the refinancing risk associated with our debt that is used to fund operating needs by matching the term of debt with the assets financed.
Short term financing, such as commercial paper, is used to fund short term needs only. To ensure adequate liquidity in stress scenarios, stress testing is performed on a quarterly basis for our major operating subsidiaries. Risks to liquidity are
further mitigated by our access to alternative sources of liquidity discussed below.

Liquidity of Prudential Financial

The principal sources of funds available to Prudential Financial, the parent holding company, are dividends and returns of capital from its subsidiaries, repayments of operating loans from subsidiaries
and cash and short-term investments. These sources of funds may be supplemented by Prudential Financial’s access to the capital markets as well as the “—Alternative Sources of Liquidity” described below.

The primary uses of funds at Prudential Financial include
servicing debt, operating expenses, capital contributions and loans to subsidiaries, the payment of declared shareholder dividends, and repurchases of outstanding shares of Common Stock executed under Board authority.

As of December 31, 2012, Prudential Financial had cash
and short-term investments of $8,563 million, an increase of $3,619 million from 2011. Included in the cash and short-term investments of Prudential Financial is $3,136 million held in an intercompany liquidity account that is designed to optimize
the use of cash by facilitating the lending and borrowing of funds between Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries on a daily basis.



The following table sets forth Prudential Financial’s principal sources and uses of
cash and short-term investments for the periods indicated.

(1)

2012 includes dividends and/or returns of capital of $865 million from international subsidiaries, $646 million from asset management subsidiaries, $600 million from
Prudential Insurance, $408 million from Prudential Annuities Life Assurance Corporation, $230 million from Prudential Bank & Trust and $113 million from other subsidiaries. 2011 includes dividends and/or returns of capital of $1,592 million
from Prudential Insurance, $478 million from international subsidiaries, $588 million from Prudential Annuities Life Assurance Corporation, $468 million from asset management subsidiaries and $116 million from other subsidiaries.

(2)

2012 includes an increase in net borrowings by Prudential Financial of $1,727 million in our intercompany liquidity account and $395 million from Prudential of Japan,
partially offset by a repayment of $20 million to Prudential Holdings, LLC. 2012 also includes net repayments by subsidiaries of $558 million by asset management subsidiaries, $200 million by Prudential Annuities Life Assurance Corporation, $188
million by Pruco Re and $42 million by other subsidiaries, partially offset by net borrowings of $164 million by Pruco Life Insurance Company. 2011 includes an increase of $395 million in net borrowings by Prudential Financial in our intercompany
liquidity account and net repayments of $322 million by Prudential Securities Group (previously supporting the global commodities business), $282 million by Prudential Real Estate and Relocation, $175 million by Prudential Annuities Life Assurance
Corporation, $169 million by our asset management subsidiaries and $100 million by Prudential Arizona Reinsurance Term Company (previously funding statutory reserves required under Regulation XXX), partially offset by net borrowings of $1,030
million by Pruco Re, $336 million by Pruco Life Insurance and $43 million from other subsidiaries.

(3)

Represents payments in 2011 and subsequent repayments in 2012 associated with transitional financing agreements provided in connection with the sale of the real estate
brokerage franchise and relocation business in 2011.

(4)

Primarily includes tax settlements pursuant to the tax allocation agreement between Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries, net of estimated tax payments to the
Internal Revenue Service.

(5)

2012 includes capital contributions of $1,431 million to Pruco Re, $406 million to international insurance subsidiaries, $31 million to asset management subsidiaries
and $44 million to other subsidiaries. Subsequent to 2012, Prudential Financial made a $712 million capital contribution to Prudential Insurance, of which $615 million was paid to The Hartford in connection with our acquisition of its Individual
Life Insurance Business. 2011 includes capital contributions of $1,005 million to international insurance subsidiaries, $64 million to Pruco Re, and $62 million to asset management subsidiaries and $45 million to an investment subsidiary.



Restrictions on Dividends and Returns of Capital from Subsidiaries

Our insurance companies are subject to regulatory
limitations on the payment of dividends and other transfers of funds to Prudential Financial and other affiliates. The payment of dividends by any of our subsidiaries is subject to declaration by their Board of Directors and can be affected by
market conditions and other factors. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on specific dividend restrictions.

Domestic insurance subsidiaries.

Prudential Insurance is permitted to pay ordinary dividends based on
calculations specified under New Jersey insurance law, subject to prior notification to NJDOBI. Any distributions above this amount in any 12-month period are considered to be “extraordinary” dividends, and the approval of NJDOBI is
required prior to payment. In 2012, Prudential Insurance paid an ordinary dividend of $316 million and an extraordinary dividend of $284 million to its parent, Prudential Holdings, LLC, all of which was in turn distributed to Prudential Financial.
In 2013, Prudential Insurance is permitted to pay an ordinary dividend of $893 million under New Jersey insurance law.

The laws regulating dividends of the states where our other domestic insurance companies are domiciled are similar, but not identical, to
New Jersey’s. In 2012, Prudential Annuities Life Assurance Corporation, or PALAC, did not have ordinary dividend capacity but paid an extraordinary dividend of $408 million to Prudential Financial. In 2013, PALAC is permitted to pay an ordinary
dividend of $41 million based on Connecticut insurance law. On September 6, 2012, Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity Corporation, or PRIAC, paid an ordinary dividend of $200 million to its parent, Prudential Insurance.

International insurance
subsidiaries.

Our international insurance subsidiaries are subject to dividend restrictions from the regulatory authorities in the international jurisdictions in which they operate. Our most significant international
insurance subsidiaries, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life, are permitted to pay common stock dividends based on calculations specified by Japanese insurance law, subject to prior notification to the FSA. Dividends in excess of these amounts and
other forms of capital distribution require the prior approval of the FSA. In 2012, Prudential of Japan paid a dividend of ¥18.4 billion, or $224 million, which was ultimately sent to Prudential Financial. The current regulatory fiscal year end
for both Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life is March 31, 2013, at which time the common stock dividend amount permitted to be paid without prior approval from the FSA will be determinable. Although Gibraltar Life may be able to pay common
stock dividends under these legal and regulatory restrictions, we do not anticipate receiving common stock dividends for several years as Gibraltar Life may return capital to Prudential Financial through other means, such as the repayment of
subordinated debt or preferred stock obligations held by Prudential Financial or other affiliates. In 2012, Gibraltar repaid ¥31.5 billion, or $401 million, in subordinated debt to its parent, Prudential Holdings of Japan, of which $259 million
was ultimately sent to Prudential Financial. As of December 31, 2012, Gibraltar Life had subordinated debt and preferred stock obligations to affiliates of approximately $3.7 billion. Additionally, during 2012, Prudential of Korea paid a
dividend of $58 million, which was ultimately sent to Prudential Financial.

Other subsidiaries.

The ability of our asset management subsidiaries and the majority of our other operating subsidiaries to pay dividends is largely unrestricted from a
regulatory standpoint.

Liquidity of Insurance Subsidiaries

We manage the liquidity of our insurance
operations to ensure stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of cash flows to meet all of our obligations. Liquidity within each of our insurance subsidiaries is provided by a variety of sources, as described more fully below, including
portfolios of liquid assets. The investment portfolios of our subsidiaries are integral to the overall liquidity of our insurance operations. We segment our investment portfolios and employ an asset/liability management approach specific to the
requirements of each of our product lines. This enhances the discipline applied in managing the liquidity, as well as the interest rate and credit risk profiles, of each portfolio in a manner consistent with the unique characteristics of the product
liabilities. We use a projection process for cash flows from operations to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet projected cash outflows, including claims.

Liquidity is measured against internally-developed benchmarks
that take into account the characteristics of both the asset portfolio and the liabilities that they support. We consider attributes of the various categories of



liquid assets (for example, type of asset and credit quality) in calculating internal liquidity measures to evaluate our insurance operations’ liquidity under various stress scenarios,
including company-specific and market-wide events. We believe we have adequate liquidity in each of our insurance subsidiaries, including under these stress scenarios.

Cash Flow

The principal sources of liquidity for our insurance
subsidiaries are premiums and certain annuity considerations, investment and fee income, and investment maturities and sales associated with our insurance and annuity operations, as well as internal and external borrowings. The principal uses of
that liquidity include benefits, claims, dividends paid to policyholders, and payments to policyholders and contractholders in connection with surrenders, withdrawals and net policy loan activity. Other uses of liquidity include commissions, general
and administrative expenses, purchases of investments, hedging activity and payments in connection with financing activities.

In each of our major insurance subsidiaries, we believe that the cash flows from operations are adequate to satisfy current liquidity
requirements. The continued adequacy of this liquidity will depend upon factors such as future securities market conditions, changes in interest rate levels, policyholder perceptions of our financial strength, policyholder behavior, catastrophic
events and the relative safety and attractiveness of competing products, each of which could lead to reduced cash inflows or increased cash outflows. Our insurance operations’ cash flows from investment activities result from repayments of
principal, proceeds from maturities and sales of invested assets and investment income, net of amounts reinvested. The primary liquidity risks with respect to these cash flows are the risk of default by debtors or bond insurers, our
counterparties’ willingness to extend repurchase and/or securities lending arrangements, commitments to invest and market volatility. We closely manage these risks through our credit risk management process and regular monitoring of our
liquidity position.

Domestic insurance
operations.

In managing the liquidity of our domestic insurance operations, we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions when selecting assets to support these
contractual obligations. We use surrender charges and other contract provisions to mitigate the extent, timing and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers. The following table sets forth withdrawal characteristics of our general
account annuity reserves and deposit liabilities (based on statutory liability values) as of the dates indicated.

Individual life insurance
policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than our annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may incur surrender charges and be subject to a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy. Our annuity
reserves with guarantee features may be less susceptible to withdrawal than historical experience indicates, due to the perceived value of these guarantee features to policyholders as a result of market declines in recent years as well as the
unavailability of comparable products in the marketplace. Annuity benefits and guaranteed investment withdrawals under group annuity contracts are generally not subject to early withdrawal. Gross account withdrawals for our domestic insurance
operations’ products were consistent with our assumptions in asset/liability management, and the associated cash outflows did not have a material adverse impact on our overall liquidity.



International insurance operations.

As with our domestic
operations, in managing the liquidity of our international insurance operations, we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions in selecting assets to support these contractual obligations.
The following table sets forth the total general account insurance-related liabilities (other than dividends payable to policyholders) of our international insurance subsidiaries, as of the dates indicated.

(1)

As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, $5.7 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, of the insurance-related liabilities for Prudential of Japan are associated with
U.S. dollar-denominated products that are coinsured to our domestic insurance operations and supported by U.S. dollar-denominated assets.

(2)

Includes Prudential Gibraltar.

(3)

Represents our international insurance operations, excluding Japan.

We believe most of the longer-term recurring pay individual
life insurance policies sold by our Japanese operations do not have significant withdrawal risk because policyholders may incur surrender charges and must undergo a new underwriting process to obtain a new insurance policy. In addition, we utilize
market value adjustment features to mitigate the profitability impact and timing of withdrawals of funds by customers. As of December 31, 2012, products with a market value adjustment feature represented $19.9 billion of our Japan operations’
insurance-related liabilities.

Recently,
Gibraltar Life has had substantial sales of its yen-denominated single premium reduced death benefit whole life product that has a greater savings component. This product is more susceptible to increased levels of surrenders if interest rates
increase in Japan, which may result in losses. As of December 31, 2012, single premium reduced death benefit whole life products represented $10.0 billion of our Japan operations’ insurance-related liabilities. Gibraltar Life also sells fixed
annuities denominated in U.S. and Australian dollars that may be subject to increased surrenders should these currencies appreciate in relation to the yen and interest rates in Australia and the U.S. decline relative to Japan. As of December 31,
2012, fixed annuities denominated in U.S. and Australian dollars represented $17.1 billion of our Japan operations’ insurance-related liabilities, of which $14.5 billion include a market value adjustment feature which mitigates the
profitability impact from surrenders.

Liquid
Assets

Liquid assets include cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments, fixed maturities that are not designated as held-to-maturity and public equity securities. In addition to access to substantial investment portfolios, our insurance companies’ liquidity is managed through
access to a variety of instruments available for funding and/or managing cash flow mismatches, including from time to time those arising from claim levels in excess of projections. Our ability to utilize assets and liquidity between our subsidiaries
is limited by regulatory and other constraints. We believe that ongoing operations and the liquidity profile of our assets provide sufficient liquidity under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios for each of our insurance subsidiaries.



The following table sets forth the fair value of our domestic insurance operations’
portfolio of liquid assets, including cash and short-term investments, fixed maturity investments other than those designated as held-to-maturity, by NAIC or equivalent rating, and public equity securities, as of the dates indicated.

(1)

Includes PALAC and PRUCO life insurance companies

The following table sets forth the fair value of our international insurance operations’ portfolio of liquid assets, including cash
and short-term investments, fixed maturity investments other than those designated as held-to-maturity, by NAIC or equivalent rating, and public equity securities, as of the dates indicated.

(1)

Includes Prudential Gibraltar.

(2)

Represents our international insurance operations, excluding Japan.

(3)

Of the $134.9 billion of fixed maturity investments that are not designated as held–to-maturity and considered high or highest quality as of December 31,
2012, $95.9 billion, or 71%, were invested in government or government agency bonds.

Given the size and liquidity profile of our investment portfolios, we believe that claim experience, including policyholder withdrawals and surrenders, varying from our projections does not constitute a
significant liquidity risk. Our asset/liability management process takes into account the expected maturity of investments and expected claim payments as well as the specific nature and risk profile of the liabilities. To the extent we need to pay
claims in excess of projections, we may borrow temporarily or sell investments sooner than anticipated to pay these claims, which may result in increased borrowing costs or realized investment gains or losses affecting results of operations. The
payment of claims and sale of investments earlier than anticipated would have an impact on the reported level of cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities, respectively, in our financial statements. Historically, there has been
no significant variation between the expected maturities of our investments and the payment of claims.

Liquidity associated with other activities

Hedging activities associated with living benefit guarantees

As discussed under “—Captive reinsurance
companies” above, we reinsure living benefit guarantees on certain variable annuity and retirement products from our domestic insurance companies to a captive reinsurance company, Pruco Re. Pruco Re requires access to sufficient liquidity to
support the hedging activities such as periodic settlements, purchases, maturities, terminations and breakage. The liquidity needs can vary materially



due to, among other items, changes in interest rates, equity markets, mortality and policyholder behavior. Currently, we fund these liquidity needs with a combination of capital contributions and
loans from Prudential Financial and affiliates.

Additionally, for certain of our domestic insurance companies to claim statutory reinsurance reserve credit for business ceded to Pruco
Re, Pruco Re must collateralize its obligations under the reinsurance arrangement. We satisfy this requirement today by depositing assets into statutory reserve credit trusts. Funding needs for the statutory reserve credit trusts are separate and
distinct from capital needs of Pruco Re. However, assets pledged to the statutory reserve credit trusts may include assets supporting the capital of Pruco Re provided that they meet eligibility requirements prescribed by the relevant insurance
regulators. Reinsurance reserve credit requirements can move materially in either direction due to changes in equity markets, interest rates, actuarial assumptions and other factors. Higher reinsurance reserve credit requirements would necessitate
depositing additional assets in the statutory reserve credit trusts, while lower reserve credit requirements would allow assets to be removed from the statutory reserve credit trusts. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, for the applicable
domestic insurance entities, the statutory reserve credit trusts required collateral of $2.2 billion and $1.2 billion respectively. The increase in comparison to 2011 was primarily driven by actuarial assumption updates, reflecting lower long-term
interest rates, partially offset by the impact of higher equity markets.

The living benefits hedging activity in Pruco Re may also result in collateral postings on derivatives to or from counterparties. The Company’s collateral position depends on changes in interest
rates and equity markets related to the notional amount of the exposures hedged. Depending on market conditions, the collateral posting requirements can result in material liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2012, these derivatives were in a
net receive position, for which $4.7 billion of collateral was posted to the Company by the external counterparties.

Foreign exchange hedging activities

We employ various hedging strategies to manage potential exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements, including the strategies
discussed in “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—International Insurance Division.” These hedging strategies include both internal and external hedging programs and may impact the liquidity of
both Prudential Financial and our international insurance subsidiaries.

The internal-only hedges are between a subsidiary of Prudential Financial and certain of our yen-based entities and serve to hedge a portion of the value of U.S. dollar-denominated investments held on the
books of these yen-based entities. These U.S. dollar-denominated investments are part of our hedging strategy to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the value of our U.S. dollar-equivalent investment in our Japanese
subsidiaries. Absent an internal hedge, however, the changes in market value of these U.S. dollar-denominated investments attributable to changes in the yen-dollar exchange rate would create volatility in the solvency margins of these subsidiaries.
To minimize this volatility, we enter into inter-company hedges. Cash settlements from these hedging activities result in cash flows between Prudential Financial and these yen-based subsidiaries. The cash flows are dependent on changes in foreign
currency exchange rates and the notional amount of the exposures hedged. During 2012, Prudential Financial received $21 million of net cash settlements related to the internal hedge program, which were paid by the yen-based subsidiaries. As of
December 31, 2012, the market value of the internal hedges was an asset of $50 million due from the yen-based subsidiaries. Absent any changes in forward exchange rates from those expected as of December 31, 2012, the $50 million internal
hedge asset represents the present value of the net cash flows to Prudential Financial from these entities over the life of the hedging instruments, up to 30 years. A significant yen depreciation over an extended period of time could result in net
cash flows to Prudential Financial. Conversely, a significant yen appreciation could result in net cash outflows from Prudential Financial.

Our external hedges primarily serve to hedge foreign currency-denominated future income of our foreign subsidiaries and equity investments
in certain of these subsidiaries. The external hedges are between a subsidiary of Prudential Financial and external parties. Cash settlements on these activities result in cash flows between Prudential Financial and the external parties and are
dependent on changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the notional amount of the exposures hedged. During 2012, Prudential Financial paid $121 million for these international insurance-related external hedge settlements. As of
December 31, 2012, the net asset related to these external foreign currency hedges was $103 million. A significant appreciation in the yen and other foreign currencies could result in net cash outflows.



Asset Management operations

The principal sources of liquidity for our fee-based asset management businesses include asset management fees
and commercial mortgage origination and servicing fees. The principal uses of liquidity include general and administrative expenses and distribution of dividends and returns of capital to Prudential Financial. The primary liquidity risks for our
fee-based asset management businesses relate to their profitability, which is impacted by market conditions and our investment management performance. We believe the cash flows from our fee-based asset management businesses are adequate to satisfy
the current liquidity requirements of these operations, as well as requirements that could arise under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios, which are monitored through the use of internal measures.

The principal sources of liquidity for our strategic
investments and interim loans held in our asset management businesses are cash flows from investments, the ability to liquidate investments, and available borrowing lines from internal sources, including Prudential Funding and Prudential Financial.
The primary liquidity risks include the inability to sell assets in a timely manner, declines in the value of assets and credit defaults.

In support of our real estate business, certain real estate funds under management are held for the benefit of clients in insurance
company separate accounts sponsored by Prudential Insurance. In the normal course of business, Prudential Insurance, on behalf of these separate accounts, may contractually agree to various funding commitments which may include, among other things,
commitments to purchase real estate, to invest in real estate partnerships (both existing and to-be-formed) to acquire or develop real estate, and/or to fund additional construction or other expenditures on previously-acquired real estate
investments. These contractual commitments are typically entered into by Prudential Insurance on behalf of the particular separate account. As of December 31, 2012, total outstanding funding commitments related to such separate account activity
was $1.9 billion, of which $1.2 billion was on-balance sheet and $0.7 billion was off-balance sheet. In the majority of cases (all but $0.2 billion), the commitments specify that Prudential Insurance’s recourse liability for the obligation is
limited to the assets of the applicable separate account, with no recourse to Prudential Insurance. We believe that the separate accounts have sufficient resources to meet future obligations, including $1.1 billion of maturities in 2013. However,
there is a risk that the separate accounts may not be able to timely fund all maturing obligations from regular sources such as asset sales, operating cash flow, deposits from clients, debt refinancing or, as mentioned in Note 14 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements, from portfolio level credit facilities. In cases where the separate account is not able to fund maturing obligations, Prudential Insurance may be called upon or required to provide interim funding solutions. To date, Prudential
Insurance has not been required to provide any such funding.

Alternative Sources of Liquidity

In addition to the sources of liquidity discussed throughout this section, Prudential Financial and certain subsidiaries have access to
the alternative sources of liquidity described below.

Asset-based Financing

We conduct asset-based or secured financing within our insurance and other subsidiaries, including transactions such as securities lending, repurchase agreements and mortgage dollar rolls to earn spread
income, to borrow funds, or to facilitate trading activity. These programs are primarily driven by portfolio holdings of securities that are lendable based on counterparty demand for these securities in the marketplace. The collateral received in
connection with these programs is primarily used to purchase securities in the short-term spread portfolios of our insurance entities. Investments held in the short-term spread portfolios include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments,
mortgage loans and fixed maturities, including mortgage- and asset-backed securities, with a weighted average life at time of purchase by the short-term portfolios of four years or less. Floating rate assets comprise the majority of our short-term
spread portfolio. These short-term portfolios are subject to specific investment policy statements, which among other things, do not allow for significant asset/liability interest rate duration mismatch.



The following table sets forth our liabilities under asset-based or secured financing
programs attributable to the Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business as of the dates indicated.

(1)

The daily weighted average outstanding for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $6,695 million and $4,651 million, respectively, for the
Financial Services Businesses and $4,303 million and $4,301 million, respectively, for the Closed Block Business.

(2)

Excludes securities that may be returned to the Company overnight.

The $565 million increase in the outstanding liabilities
under these programs during 2012 was driven by attractive financing and investment opportunities.

As of December 31, 2012, our domestic insurance entities had assets eligible for the asset-based or secured financing programs of $81.6 billion, of which $9.4 billion were on loan. Taking into
account market conditions and outstanding loan balances as of December 31, 2012, we believe approximately $30.3 billion of the remaining eligible assets are readily lendable, of which approximately $21.6 billion relates to the Financial
Services Businesses; however, these amounts are subject to potential regulatory constraints and to changes in market conditions.

In addition, as of December 31, 2012, our Closed Block Business had outstanding mortgage dollar rolls, under which we are committed
to repurchase $505 million of mortgage-backed securities, or TBA forward contracts. These repurchase agreements do not qualify as secured borrowings and are accounted for as derivatives. These mortgage-backed securities are considered high or
highest quality based on NAIC or equivalent rating.

Membership in the Federal Home Loan Banks

Prudential Insurance is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, or FHLBNY. Membership allows Prudential Insurance access to
the FHLBNY’s financial services, including the ability to obtain loans and to issue funding agreements as an alternative source of liquidity that are collateralized by qualifying mortgage-related assets or U.S. Treasury securities. Prudential
Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company, or PRIAC, is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, or FHLBB, which provides PRIAC access to collateralized advances. Based on regulatory limitations, as of December 31, 2012, Prudential
Insurance had an estimated maximum borrowing capacity of $6.4 billion under the FHLBNY facility, of which $2.3 billion was outstanding, and PRIAC had an estimated maximum borrowing capacity of $1.7 billion with no advances outstanding. Nevertheless,
borrowings under these facilities are subject to the FHLBNY’s and the FHLBB’s discretion and require the availability of qualifying assets at Prudential Insurance and PRIAC. For further information, see Note 14 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Commercial Paper
Programs

Prudential Financial and Prudential
Funding, LLC, or Prudential Funding, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Insurance, have commercial paper programs with an authorized issuance capacity of $3.0 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively. Prudential Financial commercial paper
borrowings generally have been used to fund



the working capital needs of our subsidiaries. Prudential Funding commercial paper borrowings have generally served as an additional source of financing to meet the working capital needs of
Prudential Insurance and its subsidiaries. Prudential Funding also lends to other subsidiaries of Prudential Financial up to limits agreed with NJDOBI. Prudential Funding maintains a support agreement with Prudential Insurance whereby Prudential
Insurance has agreed to maintain Prudential Funding’s positive tangible net worth at all times. Prudential Financial has also issued a subordinated guarantee covering Prudential Funding’s commercial paper program. As of December 31,
2012, Prudential Financial and Prudential Funding had outstanding borrowings of $113 million and $359 million, respectively, under these commercial paper programs. For further information, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Credit Facilities

We have access to an aggregate of $3.75 billion of
syndicated, unsecured committed credit facilities, which includes a $2 billion five-year facility expiring in December 2016 that has Prudential Financial as borrower and a $1.75 billion three-year facility expiring in December 2014 that has both
Prudential Financial and Prudential Funding as borrowers. The facilities may be used for general corporate purposes, including as backup liquidity for our commercial paper programs. The maximum amount of outstanding borrowings from the five-year
credit facility in 2012 was $250 million. There were no outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities as of December 31, 2012 or as of the date of this filing.

Prudential Financial expects that it may continue to borrow
under the five-year credit facility from time to time to fund its working capital needs and those of its subsidiaries. In addition, up to $300 million of the five-year facility may be drawn in the form of standby letters of credit that can be used
to meet the Company’s operating needs. The credit facilities contain representations and warranties, covenants and events of default that are customary for facilities of this type; however, borrowings under the facilities are not contingent on
the Company’s credit ratings nor subject to material adverse change clauses. Borrowings under the credit facilities require that the Company maintain at all times consolidated net worth, relating to the Financial Services Businesses only, of at
least $18.985 billion (excluding AOCI and excluding equity of non-controlling interests). For further information, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.



Financing Activities

As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, total short- and
long-term debt of the Company on a consolidated basis was $27.2 billion and $27.0 billion, respectively. The following table sets forth total consolidated borrowings of the Company as of the dates indicated. We may, from time to time, seek to redeem
or repurchase our outstanding debt securities through open market purchases, individually negotiated transactions or otherwise. Any such repurchases will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity position and other factors.

(1)

See “—Alternative Sources of Liquidity” above for a discussion on our use of commercial paper

(2)

Includes collateralized borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York of $100 million and $199 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. For
additional information on these borrowings, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(3)

Does not include $1,780 million and $3,197 million of medium-term notes of consolidated trust entities secured by funding agreements purchased with the proceeds of such
notes as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, or $1.9 billion or $1.5 billion of collateralized funding agreements issued to the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. These notes and
funding agreements are included in “Policyholders’ account balances.” For additional information on these obligations, see Notes 10 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements

(4)

Includes collateralized borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York of $280 million and $725 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. For
additional information on these borrowings, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(5)

Amounts are net of assets under set-off arrangements of $1,000 million and $500 million, as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively

(6)

Limited and non-recourse borrowing represents outstanding debt of Prudential Holdings, LLC that is attributable to the Closed Block Business. See “Prudential
Holdings, LLC Notes” within Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to the borrowings in the table above. For
further information on the terms of our short- and long-term debt obligations, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Based on the use of proceeds, we classify our borrowings as capital debt, investment-related debt, and debt related to specified
businesses. Capital debt, which is debt utilized to meet the capital requirements of our businesses, was $10.6 billion and $11.2 billion as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Investment-related debt of $10.5 billion and $8.9 billion
as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, consists of debt issued to finance specific investment assets or portfolios of investment assets, the proceeds from which will service the debt. Specifically, this includes institutional spread
lending investment portfolios, assets supporting reserve requirements under Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX as described below, as well as institutional and insurance company portfolio cash flow timing differences. Our remaining borrowings are
utilized for business funding to meet specific purposes, including funding new business acquisition costs associated with our individual annuities business, operating needs associated with hedging our individual annuities products as discussed above
and activities associated with our asset management business.



Prudential Financial Borrowings

Long-term borrowings are conducted primarily by the holding company, Prudential Financial. It borrows these
funds to meet its capital and other funding needs, as well as the capital and funding needs of its subsidiaries. Prudential Financial maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that permits the issuance of public debt, equity and hybrid
securities. As a “Well-Known Seasoned Issuer” under SEC rules, Prudential Financial’s shelf registration statement provides for automatic effectiveness upon filing and has no stated issuance capacity.

Prudential Financial primarily issues
senior debt under its Medium-Term Note, Series D program that currently has an authorized issuance capacity of $20 billion, of which approximately $8.7 billion remained available as of December 31, 2012. Prudential Financial also maintains a
retail medium-term notes program, including InterNotes

®

that has an authorized issuance capacity of $5.0
billion, of which approximately $4.3 billion remained available as of December 31, 2012. The weighted average interest rate on Prudential Financial’s senior notes, including the effect of interest rate hedging activity, was 5.27% and 5.24%
for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, excluding the effect of debt issued to consolidated subsidiaries.

Prudential Financial has $4.6 billion of junior subordinated notes outstanding as of December 31, 2012 that are considered hybrid
securities and receive enhanced equity treatment from the rating agencies. See Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the key terms of our junior subordinated notes.

During 2012, $850 million of medium-term notes matured, and
we redeemed $1,631 million of outstanding retail notes financed in part by our issuance of $3,075 million of junior subordinated notes. As part of our overall liquidity and capital management, we may continue to redeem some or all of the remaining
retail notes outstanding. As of December 31, 2012, $0.9 billion of outstanding retail notes were redeemable by the Company at par.

Subsidiary Borrowings

Subsidiary borrowings principally consist of surplus note issuances done within our insurance and captive reinsurance subsidiaries,
commercial paper borrowings by Prudential Funding and asset-based financing.

During 2012, Prudential Insurance issued $1.0 billion of asset-backed notes. These notes are secured by a trust holding approximately $2.8 billion of residential mortgage-backed securities deposited by
Prudential Insurance. The deposit of these securities into the trust did not result in the recognition of gains or losses on the securities, or de-recognition of the securities from the balance sheet under statutory accounting principles or U.S.
GAAP, but is consistent with our tax planning strategies to monetize statutory deferred tax assets. For additional detail on these notes, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Financing of regulatory reserves associated with domestic life insurance products

As discussed above under “Capital—Insurance
Subsidiaries—Captive Reinsurance Companies,” we use captive reinsurance companies to implement reinsurance and capital management actions, including financing regulatory non-economic reserves through internal and external solutions. These
activities are described below.

During 2012 and
2011, a captive reinsurance subsidiary entered into agreements with external counterparties providing for the issuance and sale of up to $1.5 billion of ten-year fixed-rate surplus notes in order to finance non-economic reserves required under
Regulation XXX. Under the agreements, the subsidiary received debt securities, with a principal amount equal to the surplus notes issued, which are redeemable under certain circumstances, including upon the occurrence of specified stress events
affecting the subsidiary. Because valid rights of set-off exist, interest and principal payments on the surplus notes and on the debt securities are settled on a net basis, and the surplus notes are reflected in the Company’s total consolidated
borrowings on a net basis. Prudential Financial has agreed to make capital contributions to the subsidiary in order to reimburse it for investment losses in excess of specified amounts and has agreed to make payments of principal and interest on the
surplus notes in certain cases if payments are not made by the subsidiary. As of December 31, 2012, no capital contributions have been made by Prudential Financial under this agreement. In addition, during 2011 and 2012, another captive
reinsurance subsidiary issued $2.5 billion of surplus notes to an affiliate to finance non-economic reserves required under Guideline AXXX.



Other captive reinsurance subsidiaries have outstanding an additional $3.2 billion of
surplus notes that were issued in 2006 through 2008 with unaffiliated institutions to finance non-economic reserves required under Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX. Prudential Financial has agreed to maintain the capital of these subsidiaries at or
above a prescribed minimum level and has entered into arrangements (which are accounted for as derivative instruments) that require it to make certain payments in the event of deterioration in the value of these surplus notes. As of
December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, there were no collateral postings made under these derivative instruments.

The surplus notes described above are subordinated to policyholder obligations, and the payment of principal on the surplus notes may only
be made with prior insurance regulatory approval. The payment of interest on the surplus notes has been approved by the regulator, subject to its ability to withdraw that approval.

As we continue to underwrite term and universal life
business, including as part of The Hartford’s individual life business acquired by us in early 2013, we expect to have additional borrowing needs to finance non-economic statutory reserves required under Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX.
However, we believe we have sufficient financing resources available, including those internal and external resources described above, to meet our financing needs under Regulation XXX and under Guideline AXXX through 2013, assuming that the volume
of new business remains consistent with current sales projections.

Ratings

Financial strength ratings (which are sometimes referred to as “claims-paying” ratings) and credit ratings are important factors affecting public confidence in an insurer and its competitive
position in marketing products. Nationally Recognized Statistical Ratings Organizations continually review the financial performance and financial condition of the entities they rate, including Prudential Financial and its rated subsidiaries. Our
credit ratings are also important for our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt and for the cost of such financing.

A downgrade in the credit or financial strength ratings of Prudential Financial or its rated subsidiaries could potentially, among other
things, limit our ability to market products, reduce our competitiveness, increase the number or value of policy surrenders and withdrawals, increase our borrowing costs and potentially make it more difficult to borrow funds, adversely affect the
availability of financial guarantees, such as letters of credit, cause additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements, allow counterparties to terminate derivative agreements and/or hurt our relationships with
creditors, distributors, or trading counterparties thereby potentially negatively affecting our profitability, liquidity, and/or capital. In addition, we consider our own risk of non-performance in determining the fair value of our liabilities.
Therefore, changes in our credit or financial strength ratings may affect the fair value of our liabilities.



Financial strength ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding the financial
ability of an insurance company to meet its obligations under an insurance policy. Credit ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding an entity’s ability to repay its indebtedness. The following table summarizes the ratings for
Prudential Financial and certain of its subsidiaries as of the date of this filing.

*

“NR” indicates not rated.

(1)

A.M. Best Company , which we refer to as A.M. Best, financial strength ratings for insurance companies currently range from “A++ (superior)” to “F (in
liquidation).” A.M. Best’s ratings reflect its opinion of an insurance company’s financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders. An A.M. Best long-term credit rating is an opinion of the
ability of an obligor to pay interest and principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation. A.M. Best long-term credit ratings range from “aaa (exceptional)” to “d (in default),” with ratings from “aaa” to
“bbb” considered as investment grade. An A.M. Best short-term credit rating reflects an opinion of the issuer’s fundamental credit quality. Ratings range from “AMB-1+,” which represents an exceptional ability to repay
short-term debt obligations, to “AMB-4,” which correlates with a speculative (“bb”) long-term rating.

(2)

Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, which we refer to as S&P, financial strength ratings currently range from “AAA (extremely strong)” to
“R (regulatory supervision).” These ratings reflect S&P’s opinion of an operating insurance company’s financial capacity to meet the obligations of its insurance policies in accordance with their terms. A “+” or
“-” indicates relative strength within a category. An S&P credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation, a specific class of financial obligations or a specific
financial program. S&P’s long-term issue credit ratings range from “AAA (extremely strong)” to “D (default).” S&P short-term ratings range from “A-1 (highest category)” to “D (default).”

(3)

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., which we refer to as Moody’s, insurance financial strength ratings currently range from “Aaa (exceptional)” to
“C (lowest).” Moody’s insurance ratings reflect the ability of insurance companies to repay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations. Numeric modifiers are used to refer to the ranking within the group—with 1 being
the highest and 3 being the lowest. These modifiers are used to indicate relative strength within a category. Moody’s credit ratings currently range from “Aaa (highest)” to “C (default).” Moody’s credit ratings grade
debt according to its investment quality. Moody’s considers “A1,” “A2” and “A3” rated debt to be upper medium grade obligations, subject to low credit risk. Moody’s short-term ratings are opinions of the
ability of issuers to honor senior financial obligations and contracts. Prime ratings range from “Prime-1 (P-1),” which represents a superior ability for repayment of senior short-term debt obligations, to “Prime-3 (P-3),” which
represents an acceptable ability for repayment of such obligations. Issuers rated “Not Prime” do not fall within any of the Prime rating categories.

(4)

Fitch Ratings Ltd., which we refer to as Fitch, financial strength ratings currently range from “AAA (exceptionally strong)” to “D
(distressed).” Fitch’s ratings reflect its assessment of the likelihood of timely payment of policyholder and contractholder obligations.



Fitch long-term credit ratings currently range from “AAA (highest credit quality),” which denotes exceptionally strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments, to “D
(default).” Investment grade ratings range between “AAA” and “BBB.” Short-term ratings range from “F1 (highest credit quality)” to “C (high default risk).” Within long-term and short-term ratings, a
“+” or a “–” may be appended to a rating to denote relative status within major rating categories.

(5)

S&P has the ratings of our U.S.-domiciled entities on stable outlook and the ratings of The Prudential Life Insurance Company Ltd. and Gibraltar Life Insurance
Company Ltd. on negative outlook as part of S&P’s decision to put the sovereign debt ratings of Japan on negative outlook.

(6)

Includes the retail medium-term notes program.

The ratings set forth above reflect current opinions of each rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other
rating. These ratings are not directed toward shareholders and do not in any way reflect evaluations of the safety and security of the Common Stock. These ratings are reviewed periodically and may be changed at any time by the rating agencies. As a
result, we cannot assure you that we will maintain our current ratings in the future.

Rating agencies use an “outlook” statement for both industry sectors and individual companies. For an industry sector, a stable outlook generally implies that over the next 12-18 months the
rating agency expects ratings to remain unchanged among companies in the sector. Currently, A.M. Best, S&P and Fitch all have the U.S. life insurance industry on stable outlook. Moody’s has the U.S. life insurance industry on negative
outlook. For a particular company, an outlook generally indicates a medium- or long-term trend (generally six months to two years) in credit fundamentals, which if continued, may lead to a rating change. These indicators are not necessarily a
precursor of a rating change nor do they preclude a rating agency from changing a rating at any time without notice. Currently, Moody’s has all of the Company’s ratings on positive outlook; A.M. Best and Fitch have all of the
Company’s ratings on stable outlook; and S&P has the ratings of our U.S.-domiciled entities on stable outlook and the ratings of The Prudential Life Insurance Company Ltd. and Gibraltar Life Insurance Company Ltd. on negative outlook as
part of S&P’s decision to put the sovereign debt ratings of Japan on negative outlook.

Requirements to post collateral or make other payments as a result of ratings downgrades under certain agreements, including derivative agreements, can be satisfied in cash or by posting permissible
securities held by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements. A ratings downgrade of three ratings levels from the ratings levels as of December 31, 2012 (relating to financial strength ratings in certain cases and credit ratings in other
cases) would result in estimated additional collateral posting requirements or payments under such agreements of approximately $77 million. The amount of collateral required to be posted for derivative agreements is also dependent on the fair value
of the derivative positions as of the balance sheet date. For additional information regarding the potential impacts of a ratings downgrade on our derivative agreements see Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, a ratings
downgrade by A.M. Best to “A-” for our domestic life insurance companies would require Prudential Insurance to post a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $1.7 billion, based on the level of statutory reserves related to the
variable annuity business acquired from Allstate, that we estimate would result in annual cash outflows of approximately $14 million, or collateral posting in the form of cash or securities to be held in a trust. We believe that the posting of such
collateral would not be a material liquidity event for Prudential Insurance.

In view of the difficulties experienced recently by many financial institutions, the rating agencies have heightened the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions, have increased the
frequency and scope of their credit reviews, have requested additional information from the companies that they rate, and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings
levels, such as the financial strength ratings currently held by our life insurance subsidiaries. In addition, actions we might take to access third party financing or to realign our capital structure may in turn cause rating agencies to reevaluate
our ratings.

Contractual Obligations

The table below summarizes the future
estimated cash payments related to certain contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012. The estimated payments reflected in this table are based on management’s estimates and assumptions about these obligations. Because these estimates
and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the



actual cash outflows in future periods will vary, possibly materially, from those reflected in the table. In addition, we do not believe that our cash flow requirements can be adequately assessed
based solely upon an analysis of these obligations, as the table below does not contemplate all aspects of our cash inflows, such as the level of cash flow generated by certain of our investments, nor all aspects of our cash outflows.

(1)

The estimated payments due by period for long-term debt reflects the contractual maturities of principal, as disclosed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, as well as estimated future interest payments. The payment of principal and estimated future interest for short-term debt are reflected in estimated payments due in less than one year. The estimate for future interest payments includes
the effect of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning our short-term and long-term debt.

(2)

The estimated payments due by period for operating leases reflect the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases, as disclosed in Note 23 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements. We have no significant capital lease obligations.

(3)

As discussed in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have commitments to purchase or fund investments, some of which are contingent upon events or
circumstances not under our control, including those at the discretion of our counterparties. The timing of the fulfillment of certain of these commitments cannot be estimated, therefore the settlement of these obligations are reflected in estimated
payments due in less than one year. Commitments to purchase or fund investments include $0.757 billion that we anticipate will ultimately be funded from our separate accounts. Of these separate account commitments, $0.007 billion have recourse to
Prudential Insurance if the separate accounts are unable to fund the amounts when due. For further discussion of these separate account commitments, see “—Liquidity—Liquidity associated with other activities—Asset Management
operations.”

(4)

As discussed in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, loan commitments of our commercial mortgage operations, which are legally binding commitments to
extend credit to a counterparty, have been reflected in the contractual obligations table above principally based on the expiration date of the commitment; however, it is possible these loan commitments could be funded prior to their expiration. In
certain circumstances the counterparty may also extend the date of the expiration in exchange for a fee.

(5)

The estimated payments due by period for insurance liabilities reflect future estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and others for future policy benefits,
policyholders’ account balances, policyholder’s dividends, reinsurance payables and separate account liabilities. These future estimated cash outflows are based on mortality, morbidity, lapse and other assumptions comparable with our
experience, consider future premium receipts on current policies in force, and assume market growth and interest crediting consistent with assumptions used in amortizing deferred acquisition costs and value of business acquired. These cash outflows
are undiscounted with respect to interest and, as a result, the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of $1,162 billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of $612 billion included in the Consolidated Financial Statements
as of December 31, 2012. Separate account liabilities are legally insulated from general account obligations, and it is generally expected these liabilities will be fully funded by separate account assets and their related cash flows. We have
made significant assumptions to determine the future estimated cash outflows related to the underlying policies and contracts. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, actual cash outflows will differ, possibly materially, from these
estimates.

(6)

The estimated payments due by period for other liabilities includes securities sold under agreements to repurchase, cash collateral for loaned securities, liabilities
for unrecognized tax benefits, bank customer liabilities, and other miscellaneous liabilities. Amounts presented in the table also exclude $1.577 billion of notes of consolidated VIE’s which recourse for these obligations is limited to the
assets of the respective VIE and do not have recourse to the general credit of the company.

We also enter into agreements to purchase goods and services in the normal course of business; however, these purchase obligations are not
material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position as of December 31, 2012.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Guarantees and Other Contingencies

In the course of our business, we provide certain guarantees
and indemnities to third parties pursuant to which we may be contingently required to make payments in the future. See “Commitments and Guarantees” within Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Other Contingent Commitments

We also have other commitments, some of which are contingent
upon events or circumstances not under our control, including those at the discretion of our counterparties. See “Commitments and Guarantees” within Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding
these commitments. For further discussion of certain of these commitments that relate to our separate accounts, also see “—Liquidity associated with other activities—Asset Management operations.”

Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have retained or contingent interests in assets
transferred to unconsolidated entities, or variable interests in unconsolidated entities or other similar transactions, arrangements or relationships that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support, that we believe are reasonably likely to
have a material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or our access to or requirements for capital resources. In addition, we do not have
relationships with any unconsolidated entities that are contractually limited to narrow activities that facilitate our transfer of or access to associated assets. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.



ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market Risk and Risk Management

Market risk is the risk of change in the value of financial
instruments as a result of absolute or relative changes in, among other things, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices. To varying degrees, the investment activities supporting all of our products and services generate
exposure to market risk. The primary source of our exposure to market risk is “other than trading” activities conducted primarily in our insurance and annuity operations. The market risk incurred and our strategies for managing this risk
vary by product. The market risk associated with “trading” activities is immaterial.

Risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds
while optimizing returns on the underlying assets or liabilities. Risk range limits are established for each type of risk, and are approved by the Investment Committee of the Board of Directors and subject to ongoing review. Our risk management
process is an integral part of managing our core businesses, and utilizes a variety of risk management tools and techniques, including:

•

Measures of price sensitivity to market changes (e.g., interest rates, foreign exchange, equity index prices)

•

Value-at-Risk, or “VaR” measures

•

Asset/liability management analytics

•

Stress scenario testing

•

Disciplined hedging programs

•

Risk management governance, including risk oversight committees, policies and limits

For additional information regarding the potential impacts of
interest rate and other market fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions on our businesses and profitability, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors.” For additional information regarding the overall management of our
general account investments and our asset mix strategies, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—General Account Investments—Management of Investments.” For additional
information regarding our liquidity and capital resources, which may be impacted by changing market risks, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital
Resources.”

Market Risk Related to
Interest Rates

Assets that subject us to
interest rate risk primarily include fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage and other loans and policy loans. Liabilities that subject us to interest rate risk primarily include policyholder account balances relating to interest-sensitive
life insurance, annuity and other investment-type contracts, as well as through outstanding short-term and long-term debt. Changes in interest rates create risk that the resulting changes in asset values will differ from the changes in the value of
the liabilities relating to the underlying or hedged products. Derivatives that subject us to interest rate risk primarily include interest rate swaps, forwards, futures and options. Additionally, changes in interest rates may impact other items
including, but not limited to, the following:

•

Net investment spread between the amounts that we are required to pay and the rate of return we are able to earn on investments for certain products
supported by general account investments

•

Asset-based fees earned on assets under management or contractholder account value

•

Estimated total gross profits and the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs

•

Net exposure to the guarantees provided under certain products

•

Equity of our regulated entities

We use duration and convexity analyses to measure price sensitivity to interest rate changes. Duration measures the relative sensitivity
of the fair value of a financial instrument to changes in interest rates. Convexity



measures the rate of change of duration with respect to changes in interest rates. We use asset/liability management and derivative strategies to manage our interest rate exposure by legal entity
by matching the relative sensitivity of asset and liability values to interest rate changes, or controlling “duration mismatch” of assets and liabilities. We have duration mismatch constraints tailored to the rate sensitivity of products
in each entity. In certain markets, primarily outside the U.S. and Japan, capital market limitations that hinder our ability to acquire assets that closely approximate the duration of some of our liabilities are considered in setting the limits. As
of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the difference between the duration of assets and the target duration of liabilities in our duration-managed portfolios was within our limits. We consider risk-based capital and tax implications as well as current
market conditions in our asset/liability management strategies.

We assess the impact of interest rate movements on the value of our financial assets, financial liabilities and derivatives using hypothetical test scenarios that assume either upward or downward 100
basis point parallel shifts in the yield curve from prevailing interest rates, reflecting changes in either credit spreads or the risk-free rate. The following table sets forth the net estimated potential loss in fair value on these financial
instruments from a hypothetical 100 basis point upward shift as of December 31, 2012 and 2011. This table is presented on a gross basis and excludes offsetting impacts to insurance liabilities that are not considered financial liabilities under
U.S GAAP. This scenario results in the greatest net exposure to interest rate risk of the hypothetical scenarios tested at those dates. While the test scenario is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future
interest rates or the performance of fixed-income markets, it is a near-term, reasonably possible hypothetical change that illustrates the potential impact of such events. These test scenarios do not measure the changes in value that could result
from non-parallel shifts in the yield curve, which we would expect to produce different changes in discount rates for different maturities. As a result, the actual loss in fair value from a 100 basis point change in interest rates could be different
from that indicated by these calculations. The estimated changes in fair values do not include separate account assets associated with products for which investment risk is borne primarily by the separate account contractholders.

(1)

Includes fixed maturities classified as “trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities” and other fixed maturities classified as trading securities
under U.S. GAAP, but are held for “other than trading” activities in our segments that offer insurance, retirement and annuities products.

(2)

Reflects only the gross change on the embedded derivatives, and excludes any offsetting impact of derivative instruments purchased to hedge such changes.

(3)

Excludes approximately $249 billion and $203 billion as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively, of insurance reserve and deposit liabilities
which are not considered financial liabilities. We believe that the interest rate sensitivities of these insurance liabilities would serve as an offset to the net interest rate risk of the financial assets and liabilities, including investment
contracts.

(4)

See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs).

(5)

Prior periods have been restated to conform to current period presentation.



Our net estimated potential loss in fair value as of December 31, 2012 increased $4,980
million from December 31, 2011, primarily reflecting an increase in our fixed maturity securities portfolio in 2012, driven by inflows related to two significant pension risk transfer transactions in our Retirement segment, in which we received
approximately $31 billion of fixed maturity securities. The increase was also driven by reinvestment of net investment income and a net increase in fair value driven by a decrease in interest rates. For a discussion of changes in derivatives, see
“Derivatives” below.

Under U.S. GAAP,
the fair value of the embedded derivatives for certain variable annuity and other living benefit features, reflected in the table above, includes the impact of the market’s perception of our own non-performance risk (“NPR”). The
additional credit spread over LIBOR rates incorporated into the discount rate as of December 31, 2012 to reflect NPR in the valuation of these embedded derivatives ranged from 20 to 160 basis points. The following table provides a demonstration
of the sensitivity of these embedded derivatives to our NPR credit spread by quantifying the adjustments that would be required assuming both a 50 basis point parallel increase and decrease in our NPR credit spreads. While the information below is
for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding our credit spreads, it is a near-term, reasonably possible change that illustrates the potential impact of such a change. This information considers only the direct
effect of changes in our credit spread on operating results due to the change in these embedded derivatives and not changes in any other assumptions such as persistency, utilization and mortality, and also excludes the effect of these changes on DAC
or other balances.

For an additional discussion
of our variable annuity optional living benefit guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives and related derivatives used to hedge the changes in fair value of these embedded derivatives, see “Market Risk Related to Certain Variable Annuity
Products” below. For additional information about the key estimates and assumptions used in our determination of fair value, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For information on the impacts of a sustained low interest rate
environment, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Summary—Industry Trends—Impact of a Low Interest Rate Environment.”

Market Risk Related to Equity Prices

We have exposure to equity price risk through our
investments in equity securities, equity-based derivatives and certain variable annuity and other living benefit feature embedded derivatives. Our equity based derivatives primarily hedge the equity price risk embedded in the living benefit feature
embedded derivatives, and are also part of our capital hedging program. Changes in equity prices create risk that the resulting changes in asset values will differ from the changes in the value of the liabilities relating to the underlying or hedged
products. Additionally, changes in equity prices may impact other items including, but not limited to, the following:

•

Asset-based fees earned on assets under management or contractholder account value

•

Estimated total gross profits and the amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs

•

Net exposure to the guarantees provided under certain products

We actively manage investment equity price risk against
benchmarks in respective markets. We benchmark our return on equity holdings against a blend of market indices, mainly the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 for U.S. equities. For foreign equities we benchmark against the Tokyo Price Index, or TOPIX, and
the MSCI EAFE, a market index of European, Australian, and Far Eastern equities. We target price sensitivities that approximate those of the benchmark indices.

We estimate our investment equity price risk from a hypothetical 10% decline in equity benchmark market levels and measure this risk in
terms of the decline in fair market value of equity securities we hold. The



following table sets forth the net estimated potential loss in fair value from such a decline as of December 31, 2012 and 2011. While these scenarios are for illustrative purposes only and
do not reflect our expectations regarding future performance of equity markets or of our equity portfolio, they represent near term reasonably possible hypothetical changes that illustrate the potential impact of such events. These scenarios
consider only the direct impact on fair value of declines in equity benchmark market levels and not changes in asset-based fees recognized as revenue, changes in our estimates of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy
acquisition and other costs, or changes in any other assumptions such as market volatility or mortality, utilization or persistency rates in our variable annuity contracts that could also impact the fair value of our living benefit features. In
addition, these scenarios do not reflect the impact of basis risk, such as potential differences in the performance of the investment funds underlying the variable annuity products relative to the market indices we use as a basis for developing our
hedging strategy. The impact of basis risk could result in larger differences between the change in fair value of the equity-based derivatives and the related living benefit features, in comparison to the scenarios above. In calculating these
amounts, we exclude separate account equity securities related to products for which the investment risk is borne primarily by the separate account contractholder.

(1)

Includes equity securities classified as “trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities” and other equity securities classified as trading
securities under U.S. GAAP, but are held for “other than trading” activities in our segments that offer insurance, retirement and annuities products.

(2)

The notional and fair value of equity-based derivatives and the fair value of variable annuity and other living benefit feature embedded derivatives are also reflected
in amounts under “Market Risk Related to Interest Rates” above, and are not additive.

(3)

Reflects only the gross change on the embedded derivatives, and excludes any offsetting impact of derivative instruments purchased to hedge such changes.

(4)

Prior periods have been restated to conform to current period presentation.

The sensitivity level as of December 31, 2012 was
essentially flat compared with December 31, 2011, as the change in the estimated equity price risk associated with the living benefit features accounted for as an embedded derivative was offset by a corresponding change in equity-based
derivatives used to hedge these features. For a discussion of derivatives, see “Derivatives” below. For an additional discussion of our variable annuity optional living benefit guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives and related
derivatives used to hedge the changes in fair value of these embedded derivatives, see “Market Risk Related to Certain Variable Annuity Products” below. For additional information regarding our capital hedging program, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Market Risk Related to Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

As a U.S.-based company with significant business operations
outside the U.S., we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to these operations, as well as related to our general account investment portfolio and other proprietary-investment portfolios.

For our international insurance operations, changes in
foreign currency exchange rates create risk that we may experience volatility in the U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings and value of our equity investments in these operations. We actively manage this risk through various hedging strategies, including
the use of foreign currency hedges and through holding U.S. dollar-denominated securities in the investment portfolios of certain of these operations. Additionally, certain of our international insurance operations issue product liabilities that are
denominated in currencies other than their own functional currencies, and hold underlying investments denominated in the corresponding currencies. This results in reporting of economically-matched foreign currency



exchange gains or losses on the assets and liabilities. However, we experience volatility in U.S. GAAP earnings due to the fact that the changes in the value of the liabilities are recorded in
earnings within “Asset management fees and other income,” while changes in the value of the majority of the investments are recorded in equity in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” and, thereafter, are ultimately
recorded in earnings in “Realized investment gains (losses), net” in the period of maturity, sale or other-than-temporary impairment.

For our domestic general account investment portfolios supporting our U.S. insurance operations and other proprietary-investment
portfolios, our foreign currency exchange rate risk arises primarily from investments that are denominated in foreign currencies. We manage this risk by hedging substantially all domestic foreign currency-denominated fixed-income investments into
U.S. dollars. We generally do not hedge all of the foreign currency risk of our investments in equity securities of unaffiliated foreign entities.

We manage our foreign currency exchange rate risks within specified limits, and using VaR-based analysis. This statistical technique
estimates, at a specified confidence level, the potential pre-tax loss in portfolio market value that could occur over an assumed time horizon due to adverse market movements. For the unhedged portions of our equity investment in international
subsidiaries and the foreign currency-denominated investments held in our domestic general account portfolio, we estimate the hypothetical decline in VaR, as well as the average VaR, each measured at a 95% confidence level and using a one-month time
horizon. These calculations use historical price volatilities and correlation data at a 95% confidence level. The following table sets forth these measures as of the periods indicated.

(1)

Excludes assets and liabilities subject to the impact of foreign exchange rate movements that are hedged with externally-purchased derivatives or are economically
matched, as discussed above.

The
decrease in VaR as of December 31, 2012 was driven by a lower level of foreign exchange rate volatility. For derivatives used to hedge the anticipated level of U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings of our international operations, the estimated
hypothetical decline in VaR, measured at a 95% confidence level and using a one-month time horizon was $81 million and $135 million as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. For additional information, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—General Account Investments—Portfolio Composition,” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—International Insurance Division.”

Although VaR models are a recognized tool for risk management, they have inherent limitations, including reliance on historical data that
may not be indicative of future market conditions or trading patterns. Accordingly, VaR models should not be viewed as a predictor of future results. We may incur losses that could be materially in excess of the amounts indicated by the models on a
particular trading day or over a period of time, and there have been instances when results have fallen outside the values generated by our VaR models. A VaR model does not estimate the greatest possible loss. The results of these models and
analysis thereof are subject to the judgment of our risk management personnel.

Derivatives

We use derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce market risk from changes in interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates, including to alter interest rate or foreign
currency exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities. Our derivatives primarily include swaps, futures, options and forward contracts that are exchange-traded or contracted in the over-the-counter market.

Our derivatives also include interest rate guarantees we
provide on our synthetic GIC products. Synthetic GICs simulate the performance of traditional insurance-related GICs but, under U.S. GAAP, are accounted for as



derivatives due to the fact that the policyholders own the underlying assets, and we only provide a book value “wrap” on the customers’ funds, which are held in a client-owned
trust. Since these wraps provide payment of guaranteed principal and interest to the customer, changes in interest rates create risk that declines in the market value of customers’ funds would increase our net exposure to these guarantees.
However, this risk is minimal due to several mitigating factors. Our obligation is limited to payments that are in excess of the existing customers’ fund value. Additionally, we have the ability to periodically reset crediting rates, subject to
a 0% minimum floor, as well as the ability to increase prices. Further, our contract provisions provide that, although participants may withdraw funds at book value, contractholder withdrawals may only occur at market value immediately or at book
value over time. These factors, among others, result in these contracts experiencing minimal changes in fair value, despite a more significant notional value.

Our derivatives also include those that are embedded in certain financial instruments, and primarily relate to certain optional living
benefit features associated with our variable annuity products, as discussed in more detail in “Market Risk Related to Certain Variable Annuity Products” below.

The notional amount of derivative instruments increased $72
billion in 2012, from $223 billion as of December 31, 2011 to $295 billion as of December 31, 2012. The increase was related to sales of investment-only stable value synthetic GIC products, our variable annuity hedging activities, and our
capital hedge program. For additional information on our derivative activities, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Market Risk Related to Certain Variable Annuity Products

The primary risk exposures of our variable annuity contracts
relate to actual deviations from, or changes to, the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products, including capital markets assumptions, such as equity market returns, interest rates and market volatility, and actuarial assumptions.
For our capital markets assumptions, we hedge or limit our exposure to the risk created by capital markets fluctuations through a combination of product design elements, such as an automatic rebalancing element and inclusion of certain optional
living benefits in our living benefits hedging program. Certain variable annuity products with optional living benefit features are accounted for as an embedded derivative and recorded at fair value. The market risk sensitivities associated with
U.S. GAAP values of both the embedded derivatives and the related derivatives used to hedge the changes in fair value of these embedded derivatives is provided under “Market Risk Related to Interest Rates” and “Market Risk Related to
Equity Prices” above.

For additional
information regarding our risk management strategies, including our living benefit hedging program and other product design elements, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results
of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—Individual Annuities.”



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INDEX



Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

Management of Prudential
Financial, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness, as of
December 31, 2012, of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, based on the framework established

in Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). Based on our assessment under that framework, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2012.

Our internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed by or under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
transactions and dispositions of assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing herein.

February 22, 2013



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of

Prudential Financial, Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Prudential Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under
Item 15.2 present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(“COSO”). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, listed in the accompanying index. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the
financial statement schedules, and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. The accompanying supplemental combining financial information is presented for
the purposes of additional analysis of the consolidated financial statements rather than to present the financial position and results of operations of the individual components. Such supplemental information has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audits of the consolidated financial statements and, in our opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

As described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial
statements, on January 1, 2012 and in December 2012, the Company adopted, retrospectively, i) a change to the method of accounting for the deferral of acquisition costs for new or renewed insurance contracts and ii) a change in the method of
applying an accounting principle for pension plans, respectively.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

1.    BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Prudential Financial, Inc.
(“Prudential Financial”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Prudential” or the “Company”) provide a wide range of insurance, investment management, and other financial products and services to both individual and
institutional customers throughout the United States and in many other countries. Principal products and services provided include life insurance, annuities, retirement-related services, mutual funds, and investment management. The Company has
organized its principal operations into the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. The Financial Services Businesses operate through three operating divisions: U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management, U.S.
Individual Life and Group Insurance, and International Insurance. The Company’s businesses that are not sufficiently material to warrant separate disclosure and divested businesses, are included in Corporate and Other operations within the
Financial Services Businesses. The Closed Block Business, which includes the Closed Block (see Note 12), is managed separately from the Financial Services Businesses. The Closed Block Business was established on the date of demutualization and
includes the Company’s in force participating insurance and annuity products and assets that are used for the payment of benefits and policyholders’ dividends on these products, as well as other assets and equity that support these
products and related liabilities. In connection with the demutualization, the Company ceased offering these participating products.

Demutualization

On December 18, 2001 (the “date of demutualization”), The Prudential Insurance Company of America (“Prudential
Insurance”) converted from a mutual life insurance company to a stock life insurance company and became an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial. At the time of demutualization Prudential Financial issued two classes of
common stock, both of which remain outstanding. The Common Stock, which is publicly traded, reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses, and the Class B Stock, which was issued through a private placement, reflects the performance
of the Closed Block Business.

Basis of Presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements
include the accounts of Prudential Financial, entities over which the Company exercises control, including majority-owned subsidiaries and minority-owned entities such as limited partnerships in which the Company is the general partner, and variable
interest entities in which the Company is considered the primary beneficiary. See Note 5 for more information on the Company’s consolidated variable interest entities. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

The Company’s Gibraltar Life Insurance Company, Ltd. (“Gibraltar Life”) consolidated operations, including the
previously-acquired AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd., AIG Edison Life Insurance Company, AIG Financial Assurance Japan K.K., and AIG Edison Service Co., Ltd. (collectively the “Star and Edison Businesses”) use a November 30 fiscal
year end for purposes of inclusion in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 include the assets and liabilities of Gibraltar Life as of
November 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, include Gibraltar Life’s results of operations for the twelve months ended November 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The most significant estimates include those used in determining deferred policy
acquisition costs and related amortization; value of business acquired and its amortization; amortization of sales inducements; measurement of goodwill and any related impairment; valuation of investments including derivatives and the recognition of
other-than-temporary impairments; future policy benefits including guarantees; pension and other postretirement benefits; provision for income taxes and valuation of deferred tax assets; and reserves for contingent liabilities, including reserves
for losses in connection with unresolved legal matters.

Out
of Period Adjustments

During 2012, the
Company recorded out of period adjustments resulting in an aggregate net decrease of $170 million to “Income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures” for the year ended
December 31, 2012. Such adjustments primarily resulted from two items previously disclosed in the second quarter and one item identified in the fourth quarter. These adjustments were 1) a decline in the value of a real estate-related
investment, where, based on a review of the underlying collateral and a related guarantee, the Company determined that impairments of $75 million should be recognized, of which $61 million should have been recorded in prior years; 2) an increase of
$61 million in reserves for estimated payments arising from use of new Social Security Master Death File matching criteria to identify deceased policy and contract holders which should have been reflected in the third quarter of 2011; and 3) an
increase of $54 million in recorded liabilities for certain employee benefits based on a review of the consistency of recognition of such liabilities across the Company which should have been recorded in prior years. Management has evaluated the
adjustments and concluded they were not material to any previously reported quarterly or annual financial statements or to the current year. For additional information on the impact of these adjustments to our operating segments, see Note 22.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in prior years have been reclassified to
conform to the current year presentation.

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRONOUNCEMENTS

Share-Based Payments

The Company recognizes the cost resulting from all
share-based payments in accordance with the authoritative guidance on accounting for stock based compensation and applies the fair value-based measurement method in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees except for equity
instruments held by employee share ownership plans. The Company accounts for excess tax benefits in additional paid-in capital as a single “pool” available to all share-based compensation awards. The Company does not recognize excess tax
benefits in additional paid-in capital until the benefits result in a reduction in taxes payable. The Company has elected the “tax-law ordering methodology” and has adopted a convention that considers excess tax benefits to be the last
portion of a net operating loss carryforward to be utilized.

The Company accounts for non-employee stock options using the fair value method in accordance with authoritative guidance and related interpretations on accounting for equity instruments that are issued
to other than employees for acquiring, or in conjunction with selling, goods or services.

Earnings Per Share

As discussed in Note 1, the Company has outstanding two separate classes of common stock. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing available income attributable to each of the two groups of common



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

shareholders by the respective weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share includes the effect of all dilutive potential common shares that
were outstanding during the period.

As discussed
under “Share-Based Payments” above, the Company accounts for excess tax benefits in additional paid-in capital as a single “pool” available to all share-based compensation awards. The Company reflects in assumed proceeds, based
on application of the treasury stock method, the excess tax benefits that would be recognized in additional paid-in capital upon exercise or release of the award.

Investments and Investment-Related Liabilities

The Company’s principal investments are fixed
maturities; equity securities; commercial mortgage and other loans; policy loans; other long-term investments, including joint ventures (other than operating joint ventures), limited partnerships, and real estate; and short-term investments.
Investments and investment-related liabilities also include securities repurchase and resale agreements and securities lending transactions. The accounting policies related to each are as follows:

Fixed maturities are comprised of bonds, notes and redeemable
preferred stock. Fixed maturities classified as “available-for-sale” are carried at fair value. See Note 20 for additional information regarding the determination of fair value. Fixed maturities that the Company has both the positive
intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as “held-to-maturity.” The amortized cost of fixed maturities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Interest
income, as well as the related amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is included in “Net investment income” under the effective yield method. For mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, the effective yield is based on
estimated cash flows, including interest rate and prepayment assumptions based on data from widely accepted third-party data sources or internal estimates. In addition to interest rate and prepayment assumptions, cash flow estimates also vary based
on other assumptions regarding the underlying collateral, including default rates and changes in value. These assumptions can significantly impact income recognition and the amount of other-than-temporary impairments recognized in earnings and other
comprehensive income. For high credit quality mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities (those rated AA or above), cash flows are provided quarterly, and the amortized cost and effective yield of the security are adjusted as necessary to reflect
historical prepayment experience and changes in estimated future prepayments. The adjustments to amortized cost are recorded as a charge or credit to net investment income in accordance with the retrospective method. For mortgage-backed and
asset-backed securities rated below AA, or those for which an other than temporary impairment has been recorded, the effective yield is adjusted prospectively for any changes in estimated cash flows. See the discussion below on realized investment
gains and losses for a description of the accounting for impairments. Unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities classified as “available-for-sale,” net of tax, and the effect on deferred policy acquisition costs, value of business
acquired, deferred sales inducements, future policy benefits and policyholders’ dividends that would result from the realization of unrealized gains and losses, are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)”
(“AOCI”).

“Trading account assets
supporting insurance liabilities, at fair value” includes invested assets that support certain products included in the Retirement segment, as well as certain products included in the International Insurance segment, which are experience rated,
meaning that the investment results associated with these products are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. Realized and unrealized gains and losses for these investments are reported in “Asset management fees and other
income.” Interest and dividend income from these investments is reported in “Net investment income.”

“Other trading account assets, at fair value” consist primarily of fixed maturities, equity securities, including certain
perpetual preferred stock, and certain derivatives, including those used by the Company in its capacity as a broker-dealer and derivative hedging positions used in a non-broker-dealer capacity primarily to hedge the risks related to certain
products. These instruments are carried at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these investments and on derivatives used by the Company in its capacity as a broker-dealer are reported in



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

“Asset management fees and other income” and, for those related to the Company’s global commodities group, in “Income from discontinued operations, net of
taxes.” Interest and dividend income from these investments is reported in “Net investment income” and, for those related to the Company’s global commodities group, in “Income from discontinued operations, net of
taxes.”

Equity securities available-for-sale
are comprised of common stock, mutual fund shares, non-redeemable preferred stock, and certain perpetual preferred stock, and are carried at fair value. The associated unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, and the effect on deferred policy
acquisition costs, value of business acquired, deferred sales inducements, future policy benefits and policyholders’ dividends that would result from the realization of unrealized gains and losses, are included in AOCI. The cost of equity
securities is written down to fair value when a decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary. See the discussion below on realized investment gains and losses for a description of the accounting for impairments. Dividends from these
investments are recognized in “Net investment income” when earned.

Commercial mortgage and other loans consist of commercial mortgage loans, agricultural loans, loans backed by residential properties, as well as certain other collateralized and uncollateralized loans.
Loans backed by residential properties primarily include recourse loans held by the Company’s international insurance businesses. Other collateralized loans primarily include senior loans made by the Company’s international insurance
businesses and loans made to the Company’s former real estate franchisees. Uncollateralized loans primarily represent reverse dual currency loans and corporate loans held by the Company’s international insurance businesses.

Commercial mortgage and other loans originated and held for
investment are generally carried at unpaid principal balance, net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and expenses, and net of an allowance for losses. Commercial mortgage loans originated within the Company’s commercial mortgage
operations include loans held for sale which are reported at the lower of cost or fair value; loans held for investment which are reported at amortized cost net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and expenses, and net of an allowance for
losses; and loans reported at fair value under the fair value option. Commercial mortgage and other loans acquired, including those related to the acquisition of a business, are recorded at fair value when purchased, reflecting any premiums or
discounts to unpaid principal balances.

Interest
income, as well as prepayment fees and the amortization of the related premiums or discounts, related to commercial mortgage and other loans, are included in “Net investment income.”

Impaired loans include those loans for which it is probable that amounts due will not all be collected
according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The Company defines “past due” as principal or interest not collected at least 30 days past the scheduled contractual due date. Interest received on loans that are past due,
including impaired and non-impaired loans as well as loans that were previously modified in a troubled debt restructuring, is either applied against the principal or reported as net investment income based on the Company’s assessment as to the
collectability of the principal. See Note 4 for additional information about the Company’s past due loans.

The Company discontinues accruing interest on loans after the loans become 90 days delinquent as to principal or interest payments, or
earlier when the Company has doubts about collectability. When the Company discontinues accruing interest on a loan, any accrued but uncollectible interest on the loan and other loans backed by the same collateral, if any, is charged to interest
income in the same period. Generally, a loan is restored to accrual status only after all delinquent interest and principal are brought current and, in the case of loans where the payment of interest has been interrupted for a substantial period, or
the loan has been modified, a regular payment performance has been established.

The Company reviews the performance and credit quality of the commercial mortgage and other loan portfolio on an on-going basis. Loans are placed on watch list status based on a predefined set of criteria
and are assigned one of three categories. Loans are placed on “early warning” status in cases where, based on the



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Company’s analysis of the loan’s collateral, the financial situation of the borrower or tenants or other market factors, it is believed a loss of principal or interest could occur.
Loans are classified as “closely monitored” when it is determined that there is a collateral deficiency or other credit events that may lead to a potential loss of principal or interest. Loans “not in good standing” are those
loans where the Company has concluded that there is a high probability of loss of principal, such as when the loan is delinquent or in the process of foreclosure. As described below, in determining the allowance for losses, the Company evaluates
each loan on the watch list to determine if it is probable that amounts due will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.

Loan-to-value and debt service coverage ratios are measures commonly used to assess the quality of commercial mortgage loans. The
loan-to-value ratio compares the amount of the loan to the fair value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan, and is commonly expressed as a percentage. Loan-to-value ratios greater than 100% indicate that the loan amount exceeds the
collateral value. A smaller loan-to-value ratio indicates a greater excess of collateral value over the loan amount. The debt service coverage ratio compares a property’s net operating income to its debt service payments. Debt service coverage
ratios less than 1.0 times indicate that property operations do not generate enough income to cover the loan’s current debt payments. A larger debt service coverage ratio indicates a greater excess of net operating income over the debt
service payments. The values utilized in calculating these ratios are developed as part of the Company’s periodic review of the commercial mortgage loan and agricultural loan portfolio, which includes an internal appraisal of the underlying
collateral value. The Company’s periodic review also includes a quality re-rating process, whereby the internal quality rating originally assigned at underwriting is updated based on current loan, property and market information using a
proprietary quality rating system. The loan-to-value ratio is the most significant of several inputs used to establish the internal credit rating of a loan which in turn drives the allowance for losses. Other key factors considered in determining
the internal credit rating include debt service coverage ratios, amortization, loan term, estimated market value growth rate and volatility for the property type and region. See Note 4 for additional information related to the loan-to-value ratios
and debt service coverage ratios related to the Company’s commercial mortgage and agricultural loan portfolios.

Loans backed by residential properties, other collateralized loans, and uncollateralized loans are also reviewed periodically. Each loan
is assigned an internal or external credit rating. Internal credit ratings take into consideration various factors including financial ratios and qualitative assessments based on non-financial information. In cases where there are personal or third
party guarantors, the credit quality of the guarantor is also reviewed. These factors are used in developing the allowance for losses. Based on the diversity of the loans in these categories and their immateriality, the Company has not disclosed the
credit quality indicators related to these loans in Note 4.

For those loans not reported at fair value, the allowance for losses includes a loan specific reserve for each impaired loan that has a specifically identified loss and a portfolio reserve for probable
incurred but not specifically identified losses. For impaired commercial mortgage and other loans the allowances for losses are determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest
rate, or based upon the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The portfolio reserves for probable incurred but not specifically identified losses in the commercial mortgage and agricultural loan portfolio segments
considers the current credit composition of the portfolio based on an internal quality rating, (as described above). The portfolio reserves are determined using past loan experience, including historical credit migration, loss probability and loss
severity factors by property type. These factors are reviewed each quarter and updated as appropriate.

The allowance for losses on commercial mortgage and other loans can increase or decrease from period to period based on the factors noted
above. “Realized investment gains (losses), net” includes changes in the allowance for losses and changes in value for loans accounted for under the fair value option. “Realized investment gains (losses), net” also includes gains
and losses on sales, certain restructurings, and foreclosures.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

When a commercial mortgage or other loan is deemed to be uncollectible, any specific
valuation allowance associated with the loan is reversed and a direct write down to the carrying amount of the loan is made. The carrying amount of the loan is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in value.

Commercial mortgage and other loans are occasionally
restructured in a troubled debt restructuring. These restructurings generally include one or more of the following: full or partial payoffs outside of the original contract terms; changes to interest rates; extensions of maturity; or additions or
modifications to covenants. Additionally, the Company may accept assets in full or partial satisfaction of the debt as part of a troubled debt restructuring. When restructurings occur, they are evaluated individually to determine whether the
restructuring or modification constitutes a “troubled debt restructuring” as defined by authoritative accounting guidance. If the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the Company has granted a concession, the restructuring,
including those that involve a partial payoff or the receipt of assets in full satisfaction of the debt is deemed to be a troubled debt restructuring. Based on the Company’s credit review process described above, these loans generally would
have been deemed impaired prior to the troubled debt restructuring, and specific allowances for losses would have been established prior to the determination that a troubled debt restructuring has occurred.

In a troubled debt restructuring where the Company receives
assets in full satisfaction of the debt, any specific valuation allowance is reversed and a direct write down of the loan is recorded for the amount of the allowance, and any additional loss, net of recoveries, or any gain is recorded for the
difference between the fair value of the assets received and the recorded investment in the loan. When assets are received in partial settlement, the same process is followed, and the remaining loan is evaluated prospectively for impairment based on
the credit review process noted above. When a loan is restructured in a troubled debt restructuring, the impairment of the loan is remeasured using the modified terms and the loan’s original effective yield, and the allowance for loss is
adjusted accordingly. Subsequent to the modification, income is recognized prospectively based on the modified terms of the loans in accordance with the income recognition policy noted above. Additionally, the loan continues to be subject to the
credit review process noted above.

In situations
where a loan has been restructured in a troubled debt restructuring and the loan has subsequently defaulted, this factor is considered when evaluating the loan for a specific allowance for losses in accordance with the credit review process noted
above.

See Note 4 for additional information
about commercial mortgage and other loans that have been restructured in a troubled debt restructuring.

“Policy loans” are carried at unpaid principal balances. Interest income on policy loans is recognized in net investment income
at the contract interest rate when earned. Policy loans are fully collateralized by the cash surrender value of the associated insurance policies.

Securities repurchase and resale agreements and securities loaned transactions are used to earn spread income, to borrow funds, or to
facilitate trading activity. As part of securities repurchase agreements or securities loaned transactions, the Company transfers U.S. and foreign debt and equity securities, as well as U.S. government and government agency securities, and receives
cash as collateral. As part of securities resale agreements, the Company invests cash and receives as collateral U.S. government securities or other debt securities. For securities repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions used to
earn spread income, the cash received is typically invested in cash equivalents, short-term investments or fixed maturities.

Securities repurchase and resale agreements that satisfy certain criteria are treated as secured borrowing or secured lending
arrangements. These agreements are carried at the amounts at which the securities will be subsequently resold or reacquired, as specified in the respective transactions. For securities purchased under agreements to resell, the Company’s policy
is to take possession or control of the securities either directly or through a third party custodian. These securities are valued daily and additional securities or cash collateral is received, or returned, when appropriate to protect against
credit exposure. Securities to be resold are the same, or substantially the same, as the securities received. For securities sold under agreements to repurchase, the market



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

value of the securities to be repurchased is monitored, and additional collateral is obtained where appropriate, to protect against credit exposure. Securities to be repurchased are the same, or
substantially the same, as those sold. Income and expenses related to these transactions executed within the insurance companies used to earn spread income are reported as “Net investment income;” however, for transactions used for funding
purposes, the associated borrowing cost is reported as interest expense (included in “General and administrative expenses”). Income and expenses related to these transactions executed within the Company’s derivative operations are
reported in “Asset management fees and other income.” Income and expenses related to these transactions executed within the Company’s global commodities group are reported in “Income from discontinued operations, net of
taxes.”

Securities loaned transactions are
treated as financing arrangements and are recorded at the amount of cash received. The Company obtains collateral in an amount equal to 102% and 105% of the fair value of the domestic and foreign securities, respectively. The Company monitors the
market value of the securities loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained as necessary. Substantially all of the Company’s securities loaned transactions are with large brokerage firms. Income and expenses associated with
securities loaned transactions used to earn spread income are reported as “Net investment income;” however, for securities loaned transactions used for funding purposes the associated rebate is reported as interest expense (included in
“General and administrative expenses”).

“Other long-term investments” consist of the Company’s investments in joint ventures and limited partnerships, other than
operating joint ventures, as well as wholly-owned investment real estate and other investments. Joint venture and partnership interests are either accounted for using the equity method of accounting or under the cost method when the Company’s
partnership interest is so minor (generally less than 3%) that it exercises virtually no influence over operating and financial policies. The Company’s income from investments in joint ventures and partnerships accounted for using the equity
method or the cost method, other than the Company’s investment in operating joint ventures, is included in “Net investment income.” The carrying value of these investments is written down, or impaired, to fair value when a decline in
value is considered to be other-than-temporary. In applying the equity method or the cost method (including assessment for other-than-temporary impairment), the Company uses financial information provided by the investee, generally on a one to three
month lag. The Company consolidates joint ventures and limited partnerships in certain other instances where it is deemed to exercise control, or is considered the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. See Note 5 for additional
information about variable interest entities.

The
Company’s wholly-owned investment real estate consists of real estate which the Company has the intent to hold for the production of income as well as real estate held for sale. Real estate which the Company has the intent to hold for the
production of income is carried at depreciated cost less any writedowns to fair value for impairment losses and is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Real estate held for
sale is carried at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value less estimated selling costs and is not further depreciated once classified as such. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value of the investment real estate exceeds the
estimated undiscounted future cash flows (excluding interest charges) from the investment. At that time, the carrying value of the investment real estate is written down to fair value. Decreases in the carrying value of investment real estate held
for the production of income due to other-than-temporary impairments are recorded in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” Depreciation on real estate held for the production of income is computed using the straight-line method over
the estimated lives of the properties, and is included in “Net investment income.” In the period a real estate investment is deemed held for sale and meets all of the discontinued operation criteria, the Company reports all related net
investment income and any resulting investment gains and losses as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

“Short-term investments” primarily consist of highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity of twelve months or less and
greater than three months when purchased, other than those debt instruments meeting this definition that are included in “Trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities, at fair value.” These investments are generally carried at
fair value and include certain money market investments, short-term debt



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

securities issued by government sponsored entities and other highly liquid debt instruments. Short-term investments held in the Company’s former broker-dealer operations were
marked-to-market through “Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes.”

Realized investment gains (losses) are computed using the specific identification method with the exception of some of the Company’s International Insurance businesses’ portfolios, where the
average cost method is used. Realized investment gains and losses are generated from numerous sources, including the sale of fixed maturity securities, equity securities, investments in joint ventures and limited partnerships and other types of
investments, as well as adjustments to the cost basis of investments for net other-than-temporary impairments recognized in earnings. Realized investment gains and losses are also generated from prepayment premiums received on private fixed maturity
securities, allowance for losses on commercial mortgage and other loans, fair value changes on commercial mortgage loans carried at fair value, and fair value changes on embedded derivatives and free-standing derivatives that do not qualify for
hedge accounting treatment, except those derivatives used in the Company’s capacity as a broker or dealer.

The Company’s available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities with unrealized losses are reviewed quarterly to identify
other-than-temporary impairments in value. In evaluating whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, the Company considers several factors including, but not limited to the following: (1) the extent and the duration of the decline;
(2) the reasons for the decline in value (credit event, currency or interest-rate related, including general credit spread widening); and (3) the financial condition of and near-term prospects of the issuer. With regard to
available-for-sale equity securities, the Company also considers the ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value. When it is determined that a decline in value of an equity security is
other-than-temporary, the carrying value of the equity security is reduced to its fair value, with a corresponding charge to earnings.

An other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in earnings for a debt security in an unrealized loss position when the Company either
(a) has the intent to sell the debt security or (b) more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery. For all debt securities in unrealized loss positions that do not meet either of these two
criteria, the Company analyzes its ability to recover the amortized cost by comparing the net present value of projected future cash flows with the amortized cost of the security. The net present value is calculated by discounting the Company’s
best estimate of projected future cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the debt security prior to impairment. The Company may use the estimated fair value of collateral as a proxy for the net present value if it believes that the
security is dependent on the liquidation of collateral for recovery of its investment. If the net present value is less than the amortized cost of the investment, an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. In addition to the above mentioned
circumstances, the Company also recognizes an other-than-temporary impairment in earnings when a non-functional currency denominated security in an unrealized loss position due to currency exchange rates approaches maturity.

When an other-than-temporary impairment of a debt security
has occurred, the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings depends on whether the Company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost
basis. If the debt security meets either of these two criteria or the foreign currency translation loss is not expected to be recovered before maturity, the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings is equal to the entire difference
between the security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the impairment measurement date. For other-than-temporary impairments of debt securities that do not meet these criteria, the net amount recognized in earnings is equal to the
difference between the amortized cost of the debt security and its net present value calculated as described above. Any difference between the fair value and the net present value of the debt security at the impairment measurement date is recorded
in “Other comprehensive income (loss).” Unrealized gains or losses on securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment has been recognized in earnings is tracked as a separate component of AOCI.

For debt securities, the split between the amount of an
other-than-temporary impairment recognized in other comprehensive income and the net amount recognized in earnings is driven principally by assumptions regarding



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

the amount and timing of projected cash flows. For mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, cash flow estimates consider the payment terms of the underlying assets backing a particular
security, including interest rate and prepayment assumptions based on data from widely accepted third-party data sources or internal estimates. In addition to interest rate and prepayment assumptions, cash flow estimates also include other
assumptions regarding the underlying collateral including default rates and recoveries, which vary based on the asset type and geographic location, as well as the vintage year of the security. For structured securities, the payment priority within
the tranche structure is also considered. For all other debt securities, cash flow estimates are driven by assumptions regarding probability of default and estimates regarding timing and amount of recoveries associated with a default. The Company
has developed these estimates using information based on its historical experience as well as using market observable data, such as industry analyst reports and forecasts, sector credit ratings and other data relevant to the collectability of a
security, such as the general payment terms of the security and the security’s position within the capital structure of the issuer.

The new cost basis of an impaired security is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value. In periods subsequent to the
recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment, the impaired security is accounted for as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of the impairment. For debt securities, the discount (or reduced premium) based on the new cost basis may
be accreted into net investment income in future periods, including increases in cash flow on a prospective basis. In certain cases where there are decreased cash flow expectations, the security is reviewed for further cash flow impairments.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due
from banks, certain money market investments and other debt instruments with maturities of three months or less when purchased, other than cash equivalents that are included in “Trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities, at fair
value.”

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs

Costs that vary with and that are
directly related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance and annuity business are deferred to the extent such costs are deemed recoverable from future profits. Such deferred policy acquisition costs (“DAC”) primarily include
commissions, costs of policy issuance and underwriting, and certain other expenses that are directly related to successfully negotiated contracts. See below under “Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements” for a discussion of the new
authoritative guidance adopted effective January 1, 2012, regarding which costs relating to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts qualify for deferral. In each reporting period, capitalized DAC is amortized to “Amortization
of deferred policy acquisition costs,” net of the accrual of imputed interest on DAC balances. DAC is subject to recoverability testing at the end of each reporting period to ensure that the balance does not exceed the present value of
estimated gross profits, estimated gross margins, or premiums less benefits and maintenance expenses, as applicable. DAC, for applicable products, is adjusted for the impact of unrealized gains or losses on investments as if these gains or losses
had been realized, with corresponding credits or charges included in AOCI.

For traditional participating life insurance included in the Closed Block, DAC is amortized over the expected life of the contracts (up to 45 years) in proportion to gross margins based on historical and
anticipated future experience, which is evaluated regularly. The effect of changes in estimated gross margins on unamortized DAC is reflected in “Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs” in the period such estimated gross margins
are revised. Policy acquisition costs related to interest-sensitive and variable life products and fixed and variable deferred annuity products are deferred and amortized over the expected life of the contracts (periods ranging from 25 to 99 years)
in proportion to gross profits arising principally from investment results, mortality and expense margins, and surrender charges, based on historical and anticipated future experience, which is updated periodically. The Company uses a reversion to
the mean approach for equities to derive the blended future rate of return assumptions. However, if the projected future rate of return calculated using this approach is greater than the maximum future rate of return assumption, the maximum future
rate of return is utilized in deriving the blended future rate of return assumption. In addition to the gross profit components previously

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

mentioned, the impact of the embedded derivatives associated with certain optional living benefit features of the Company’s variable annuity contracts and related hedging activities are also
included in actual gross profits used as the basis for calculating current period amortization and, in certain instances, in management’s estimate of total gross profits used for setting the amortization rate. The effect of changes to estimated
gross profits on unamortized DAC is reflected in “Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs” in the period such estimated gross profits are revised. DAC related to non-participating traditional individual life insurance is
amortized in proportion to gross premiums.

For
group annuity contracts (other than single premium group annuities with life contingencies), acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the expected life of the contracts in proportion to gross profits. For group corporate-, bank- and
trust-owned life insurance contracts, acquisition costs are deferred and amortized in proportion to lives insured. For single premium immediate annuities with life contingencies, and single premium group annuities and single premium structured
settlements with life contingencies, all acquisition costs are charged to expense immediately because generally all premiums are received at the inception of the contract. For funding agreement notes contracts, single premium structured settlement
contracts without life contingencies, and single premium immediate annuities without life contingencies, acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the expected life of the contracts using the interest method. For other group life and
disability insurance contracts and guaranteed investment contracts, acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.

For some products, policyholders can elect to modify product benefits, features, rights or coverages by exchanging a contract for a new
contract or by amendment, endorsement, or rider to a contract, or by the election of a feature or coverage within a contract. These transactions are known as internal replacements. If policyholders surrender traditional life insurance policies in
exchange for life insurance policies that do not have fixed and guaranteed terms, the Company immediately charges to expense the remaining unamortized DAC on the surrendered policies. For other internal replacement transactions, except those that
involve the addition of a nonintegrated contract feature that does not change the existing base contract, the unamortized DAC is immediately charged to expense if the terms of the new policies are not substantially similar to those of the former
policies. If the new terms are substantially similar to those of the earlier policies, the DAC is retained with respect to the new policies and amortized over the expected life of the new policies.

Value of Business Acquired

As a result of certain acquisitions and the application of
purchase accounting, the Company reports a financial asset representing the value of business acquired (“VOBA”). VOBA includes an explicit adjustment to reflect the cost of capital attributable to the acquired insurance contracts. VOBA
represents an adjustment to the stated value of inforce insurance contract liabilities to present them at fair value, determined as of the acquisition date. VOBA balances are subject to recoverability testing, in the manner in which it was acquired,
at the end of each reporting period to ensure that the balance does not exceed the present value of anticipated gross profits. The Company has established a VOBA asset primarily for its acquired traditional life insurance products, accident and
health products with fixed benefits, deferred annuity contracts, and defined contribution and defined benefit businesses. The majority of the VOBA balance relates to the business acquired as part of the acquisition of the Star and Edison Businesses
in 2011. The Company amortizes VOBA over the effective life of the acquired contracts in “General and administrative expenses.” For acquired traditional life insurance products and accident and health products with fixed benefits, VOBA is
amortized in proportion to estimated gross premiums or in proportion to the face amount of insurance in force, as applicable. For acquired annuity contracts, VOBA is amortized in proportion to estimated gross profits arising from the contracts and
anticipated future experience, which is evaluated regularly. For acquired defined contribution and defined benefit businesses, the majority of VOBA is amortized in proportion to estimated gross profits arising principally from investment spreads and
fees in excess of actual expense based upon historical and estimated future experience, which is updated periodically. The remainder of VOBA is amortized based on estimated gross revenues, fees, or the change in policyholders’ account balances,
as applicable. The effect of changes in estimated gross profits on unamortized VOBA is reflected in the period such estimates of expected future profits are revised. VOBA, for applicable products, is adjusted for the impact of unrealized gains or
losses on investments as if these gains or losses had been realized,

with corresponding credits or charges included in AOCI. See Note 8 for additional information regarding VOBA and Note 3 for additional information regarding the VOBA asset related to the
acquisition of the Star and Edison Businesses.

Separate
Account Assets and Liabilities

Separate
account assets are reported at fair value and represent segregated funds that are invested for certain policyholders, pension funds and other customers. The assets consist primarily of equity securities, fixed maturities, real estate-related
investments, real estate mortgage loans, short-term investments and derivative instruments. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of any other business of the Company. Investment risks
associated with market value changes are borne by the customers, except to the extent of minimum guarantees made by the Company with respect to certain accounts. See Note 11 for additional information regarding separate account arrangements with
contractual guarantees. Separate account liabilities primarily represent the contractholder’s account balance in separate account assets and to a lesser extent borrowings of the separate account, and will be equal and offsetting to total
separate account assets. The investment income and realized investment gains or losses from separate account assets generally accrue to the policyholders and are not included in the Company’s results of operations. Mortality, policy
administration and surrender charges assessed against the accounts are included in “Policy charges and fee income.” Asset management fees charged to the accounts are included in “Asset management fees and other income.” Seed
money that the Company invests in separate accounts is reported in the appropriate general account asset line. Investment income and realized investment gains or losses from seed money invested in separate accounts accrues to the Company and is
included in the Company’s results of operations.

Other
Assets and Other Liabilities

Other
assets consist primarily of prepaid pension benefit costs, certain restricted assets, trade receivables, value of business acquired, goodwill and other intangible assets, deferred sales inducements, the Company’s investments in operating joint
ventures, which include the Company’s indirect investment in China Pacific Insurance (Group) Co., Ltd. (“China Pacific Group”), property and equipment, reinsurance recoverables, and receivables resulting from sales of securities that
had not yet settled at the balance sheet date. Other liabilities consist primarily of trade payables, pension and other employee benefit liabilities, derivative liabilities, reinsurance payables, and payables resulting from purchases of securities
that had not yet settled at the balance sheet date.

Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is determined using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which generally range from 3 to 40 years.

As a result of certain acquisitions, the Company recognizes an asset for goodwill representing the excess of cost over the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is
assigned to reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially recorded. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a unit one level below the operating segment, if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management
at that level. Once goodwill has been assigned to reporting units, it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition, and all of the activities within a reporting unit, whether acquired or organically grown, are available to support
the value of the goodwill.

The Company tests
goodwill for impairment annually as of December 31 and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The fundamental goodwill
impairment analysis is a two-step test that is performed at the reporting unit level. The first step, used to identify potential impairment, involves comparing each reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value including goodwill. If the
fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the applicable goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, there is an indication of a potential impairment and the second step of the test is
performed to measure the amount of impairment.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each
reporting unit for which the first step indicated impairment. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination, which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting
unit, as determined in the first step, over the aggregate fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill in
the “pro forma” business combination accounting as described above exceeds the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an
impairment charge is recorded in “General and administrative expenses” for the excess. An impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit, and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill.
Subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted. Management is required to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of a reporting unit including, but not limited to: projected earnings, comparative market
multiples, and the risk rate at which future net cash flows are discounted.

In accordance with accounting guidance, the Company may first perform a qualitative goodwill assessment to determine whether events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not
that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Factors such as macroeconomic conditions; industry and market considerations; cost factors and other are used to assess the validity of goodwill. If, after assessing the
totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step goodwill impairment test, as described above, is not
necessary. If, however, the Company concludes otherwise, then the Company must perform the first step of the two-step impairment test by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value with its carrying value including goodwill. If the carrying value
exceeds fair value, then the Company must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the impairment loss, if any.

See Note 9 for additional information regarding goodwill.

The Company offers various types of sales inducements to
policyholders related to fixed and variable deferred annuity contracts. The Company defers sales inducements and amortizes them over the anticipated life of the policy using the same methodology and assumptions used to amortize DAC. Sales
inducements balances are subject to recoverability testing at the end of each reporting period to ensure that the balance does not exceed the present value of anticipated gross profits. The Company records amortization of deferred sales inducements
in “Interest credited to policyholders’ account balances.” See Note 11 for additional information regarding sales inducements.

The majority of the Company’s reinsurance recoverables and payables are receivables and corresponding payables associated with the
reinsurance arrangements used to effect the Company’s acquisition of the retirement businesses of CIGNA. The remaining amounts relate to other reinsurance arrangements entered into by the Company. For each of its reinsurance contracts, the
Company determines if the contract provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The Company reviews all contractual features, particularly those that may limit the
amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims. See Note 13 for additional information about the Company’s reinsurance arrangements.

Identifiable intangible assets are recorded net of
accumulated amortization. The Company tests identifiable intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of December 31 of each year or whenever events or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an identifiable intangible asset
may exceed the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. If this condition exists and the carrying value of an identifiable intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the excess is recognized as an
impairment and is recorded as a charge against net income. Measuring intangibles requires the use of estimates. Significant estimates include the projected net cash flow attributable to the intangible asset and the risk rate at which future net cash
flows are discounted for purposes of estimating fair value, as applicable. Identifiable intangible assets primarily include customer relationships and mortgage servicing rights. See Note 9 for additional information regarding identifiable intangible
assets.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Investments in operating joint ventures are generally accounted for under the equity
method. The carrying value of these investments is written down, or impaired, to fair value when a decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary. See Note 7 for additional information on investments in operating joint ventures.

Future Policy Benefits

The Company’s liability for future policy benefits is
primarily comprised of the present value of estimated future payments to or on behalf of policyholders, where the timing and amount of payment depends on policyholder mortality or morbidity, less the present value of future net premiums. For
individual traditional participating life insurance products, the mortality and interest rate assumptions applied are those used to calculate the policies’ guaranteed cash surrender values. For life insurance, other than individual traditional
participating life insurance, and annuity and disability products, expected mortality and morbidity is generally based on the Company’s historical experience or standard industry tables including a provision for the risk of adverse deviation.
Interest rate assumptions are based on factors such as market conditions and expected investment returns. Although mortality and morbidity and interest rate assumptions are “locked-in” upon the issuance of new insurance or annuity business
with fixed and guaranteed terms, significant changes in experience or assumptions may require the Company to provide for expected future losses on a product by establishing premium deficiency reserves. Premium deficiency reserves, if required, are
determined based on assumptions at the time the premium deficiency reserve is established and do not include a provision for the risk of adverse deviation. See Note 10 for additional information regarding future policy benefits.

The Company’s liability for future policy benefits also
includes a liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. The Company does not establish claim liabilities until a loss has occurred. However, unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses includes estimates of claims that the Company
believes have been incurred but have not yet been reported as of the balance sheet date. The Company’s liability for future policy benefits also includes net liabilities for guarantee benefits related to certain nontraditional long-duration
life and annuity contracts, which are discussed more fully in Note 11, and certain unearned revenues.

Policyholders’ Account Balances

The Company’s liability for policyholders’ account balances represents the contract value that has accrued to the benefit of the policyholder as of the balance sheet date. This liability is
generally equal to the accumulated account deposits, plus interest credited, less policyholder withdrawals and other charges assessed against the account balance. These policyholders’ account balances also include provision for benefits under
non-life contingent payout annuities and certain unearned revenues. See Note 10 for additional information regarding policyholders’ account balances.

Policyholders’ Dividends

The Company’s liability for policyholders’ dividends includes its dividends payable to policyholders and its policyholder
dividend obligation associated with the participating policies included in the Closed Block. The dividends payable for participating policies included in the Closed Block are determined at the end of each year for the following year by the Board of
Directors of Prudential Insurance based on its statutory results, capital position, ratings, and the emerging experience of the Closed Block. The policyholder dividend obligation represents amounts to be paid to Closed Block policyholders as an
additional policyholder dividend unless otherwise offset by future Closed Block performance that is less favorable than originally expected, the components of which are discussed more fully in Note 12. The dividends payable for policies other than
the participating policies included in the Closed Block include dividends payable in accordance with certain group and individual insurance policies.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Contingent Liabilities

Amounts related to contingent liabilities are accrued if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and
an amount is reasonably estimable. Management evaluates whether there are incremental legal or other costs directly associated with the ultimate resolution of the matter that are reasonably estimable and, if so, they are included in the accrual.

Insurance Revenue and Expense Recognition

Premiums from individual life products,
other than interest-sensitive life contracts, and health insurance and long-term care products are recognized when due. When premiums are due over a significantly shorter period than the period over which benefits are provided, any gross premium in
excess of the net premium (i.e., the portion of the gross premium required to provide for all expected future benefits and expenses) is deferred and recognized into revenue in a constant relationship to insurance in force. Benefits are recorded as
an expense when they are incurred. A liability for future policy benefits is recorded when premiums are recognized using the net level premium method.

Premiums from non-participating group annuities with life contingencies, single premium structured settlements with life contingencies and
single premium immediate annuities with life contingencies are recognized when due. When premiums are due over a significantly shorter period than the period over which benefits are provided, any gross premium in excess of the net premium is
deferred and recognized into revenue in a constant relationship to the amount of expected future benefit payments. Benefits are recorded as an expense when they are incurred. A liability for future policy benefits is recorded when premiums are
recognized using the net premium method.

Certain
individual annuity contracts provide the holder a guarantee that the benefit received upon death or annuitization will be no less than a minimum prescribed amount. These benefits are accounted for as insurance contracts and are discussed in further
detail in Note 11. The Company also provides contracts with certain living benefits which are considered embedded derivatives. These contracts are discussed in further detail in Note 11.

Amounts received as payment for interest-sensitive group and individual life contracts, deferred fixed
annuities, structured settlements and other contracts without life contingencies, and participating group annuities are reported as deposits to “Policyholders’ account balances.” Revenues from these contracts are reflected in
“Policy charges and fee income” consisting primarily of fees assessed during the period against the policyholders’ account balances for mortality charges, policy administration charges and surrender charges. In addition to fees, the
Company earns investment income from the investment of policyholders’ deposits in the Company’s general account portfolio. Fees assessed that represent compensation to the Company for services to be provided in future periods and certain
other fees are deferred and amortized into revenue over the life of the related contracts in proportion to estimated gross profits. Benefits and expenses for these products include claims in excess of related account balances, expenses of contract
administration, interest credited to policyholders’ account balances and amortization of DAC.

For group life, other than interest-sensitive group life contracts, and disability insurance, premiums are recognized over the period to which the premiums relate in proportion to the amount of insurance
protection provided. Claim and claim adjustment expenses are recognized when incurred.

Premiums, benefits and expenses are stated net of reinsurance ceded to other companies, except for amounts associated with certain modified coinsurance contracts which are reflected in the Company’s
financial statements based on the application of the deposit method of accounting. Estimated reinsurance recoverables and the cost of reinsurance are recognized over the life of the reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to
account for the underlying policies.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Asset Management Fees and Other Income

“Asset management fees and other income”
principally include asset management fees and securities and commodities commission revenues, which are recognized in the period in which the services are performed. Realized and unrealized gains or losses from investments classified as
“trading” such as “Trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities” and “Other trading account assets,” short-term investments that are marked-to-market through other income, and from consolidated entities that
follow specialized investment company fair value accounting are also included in “Asset management fees and other income.” In certain asset management fee arrangements, the Company is entitled to receive performance based incentive fees
when the return on assets under management exceeds certain benchmark returns or other performance targets. Performance based incentive fee revenue is accrued quarterly based on measuring fund performance to date versus the performance benchmark
stated in the investment management agreement. Certain performance based incentive fees are also subject to future adjustment based on cumulative fund performance in relation to these specified benchmarks.

Foreign Currency

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations and
subsidiaries reported in currencies other than U.S. dollars are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period. Revenues, benefits and other expenses are translated at the average rate prevailing during the period. The effects of
translating the statements of operations and financial position of non-U.S. entities with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included, net of related qualifying hedge gains and losses and income taxes, in AOCI. Gains and losses
resulting from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are reported in either AOCI or current earnings in “Asset management fees and other income” depending on the nature of the related foreign currency denominated asset or
liability.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivatives are financial instruments
whose values are derived from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices, values of securities or commodities, credit spreads, market volatility, expected returns, and liquidity. Values can also be affected by changes in estimates and
assumptions, including those related to counterparty behavior and non-performance risk used in valuation models. Derivative financial instruments generally used by the Company include swaps, futures, forwards and options and may be exchange-traded
or contracted in the over-the-counter market. Derivative positions are carried at fair value, generally by obtaining quoted market prices or through the use of valuation models.

Derivatives are used in a non-broker-dealer capacity to
manage the interest rate and currency characteristics of assets or liabilities and to mitigate volatility of expected non-U.S. earnings and net investments in foreign operations resulting from changes in currency exchange rates. Additionally,
derivatives may be used to seek to reduce exposure to interest rate, credit, foreign currency and equity risks associated with assets held or expected to be purchased or sold, and liabilities incurred or expected to be incurred. As discussed in
detail below and in Note 21, all realized and unrealized changes in fair value of non-broker-dealer related derivatives are recorded in current earnings, with the exception of the effective portion of cash flow hedges and effective hedges of net
investments in foreign operations. Cash flows from derivatives are reported in the operating, investing, or financing activities sections in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows based on the nature and purpose of the derivative.

Derivatives were also used in a derivative broker-dealer
capacity in the Company’s global commodities group to meet the needs of clients by structuring transactions that allow clients to manage their exposure to interest rates, foreign exchange rates, indices and prices of securities and commodities.
The Company’s global commodities group was sold on July 1, 2011. See Note 3 for further details. Realized and unrealized changes in fair value of derivatives used in these dealer related operations are included in “Income from
discontinued operations, net of taxes” in the periods in which the changes occur. Cash flows from such derivatives are reported in the operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Derivatives are recorded either as assets, within “Other trading account assets, at
fair value” or “Other long-term investments,” or as liabilities, within “Other liabilities,” except for embedded derivatives which are recorded with the associated host contract. The Company nets the fair value of all
derivative financial instruments with counterparties for which a master netting arrangement has been executed.

The Company designates derivatives as either (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or unrecognized firm
commitment (“fair value” hedge); (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash flow” hedge); (3) a foreign-currency
fair value or cash flow hedge (“foreign currency” hedge); (4) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation; or (5) a derivative that does not qualify for hedge accounting.

To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative must
be highly effective in mitigating the designated risk of the hedged item. Effectiveness of the hedge is formally assessed at inception and throughout the life of the hedging relationship. Even if a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting
treatment, there may be an element of ineffectiveness of the hedge. Under such circumstances, the ineffective portion is recorded in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.”

The Company formally documents at inception all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as
well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as fair value, cash flow, or foreign currency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the
balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation are linked to the specific foreign operation.

When a derivative is designated as a fair value hedge and is
determined to be highly effective, changes in its fair value, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability (including losses or gains on firm commitments), are reported on a net basis in the income statement, generally in
“Realized investment gains (losses), net.” When swaps are used in hedge accounting relationships, periodic settlements are recorded in the same income statement line as the related settlements of the hedged items.

When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge and is
determined to be highly effective, changes in its fair value are recorded in AOCI until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows being hedged (e.g., when periodic settlements on a variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in
earnings). At that time, the related portion of deferred gains or losses on the derivative instrument is reclassified and reported in the income statement line item associated with the hedged item.

When a derivative is designated as a foreign currency hedge
and is determined to be highly effective, changes in its fair value are recorded either in current period earnings if the hedge transaction is a fair value hedge (e.g., a hedge of a recognized foreign currency asset or liability) or in AOCI if the
hedge transaction is a cash flow hedge (e.g., a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction). When a derivative is used as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, its change in fair value, to the extent effective as a hedge, is
recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment account within AOCI.

If it is determined that a derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair value or cash flow hedge or management removes the hedge designation, the derivative will continue to be carried on the
balance sheet at its fair value, with changes in fair value recognized currently in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” In this scenario, the hedged asset or liability under a fair value hedge will no longer be adjusted for changes
in fair value and the existing basis adjustment is amortized to the income statement line associated with the asset or liability. The component of AOCI related to discontinued cash flow hedges is reclassified to the income statement line associated
with the hedged cash flows consistent with the earnings impact of the original hedged cash flows.

When hedge accounting is discontinued because the hedged item no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment, or because it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of
the specified



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

time period, the derivative will continue to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value, with changes in fair value recognized currently in “Realized investment gains (losses),
net.” Any asset or liability that was recorded pursuant to recognition of the firm commitment is removed from the balance sheet and recognized currently in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” Gains and losses that were in AOCI
pursuant to the hedge of a forecasted transaction are recognized immediately in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.”

If a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting, all changes in its fair value, including net receipts and payments, are included in
“Realized investment gains (losses), net” without considering changes in the fair value of the economically associated assets or liabilities.

The Company is a party to financial instruments that contain derivative instruments that are “embedded” in the financial
instruments. At inception, the Company assesses whether the economic characteristics of the embedded instrument are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the remaining component of the financial instrument (i.e., the host
contract) and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative instrument. When it is determined that (1) the embedded instrument possesses economic characteristics that are
not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract, and (2) a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded instrument qualifies as an embedded derivative that
is separated from the host contract, carried at fair value, and changes in its fair value are included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” For certain financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative that otherwise would
need to be bifurcated and reported at fair value, the Company may elect to classify the entire instrument as a trading account asset and report it within “Other trading account assets, at fair value.”

Short-Term and Long-Term Debt

Liabilities for short-term and long-term debt are primarily
carried at an amount equal to unpaid principal balance, net of unamortized discount or premium. Original-issue discount or premium and debt-issue costs are recognized as a component of interest expense over the period the debt is expected to be
outstanding, using the interest method of amortization. Short-term debt is debt coming due in the next twelve months, including that portion of debt otherwise classified as long-term. The short-term debt caption may exclude short-term debt items the
Company intends to refinance on a long-term basis in the near term. See Note 14 for additional information regarding short-term and long-term debt.

Income Taxes

The Company and its eligible domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return that includes both life insurance
companies and non-life insurance companies. Subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. are taxed, and income tax expense is recorded, based on applicable foreign statutes. See Note 19 for a discussion of certain non-U.S. jurisdictions for which the
Company assumes repatriation of earnings to the U.S.

Deferred income taxes are recognized, based on enacted rates, when assets and liabilities have different values for financial statement and tax reporting purposes. A valuation allowance is recorded to
reduce a deferred tax asset to the amount expected to be realized.

The Company’s liability for income taxes includes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties which relate to tax years still subject to review by the Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS”) or other taxing jurisdictions. Audit periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed. Generally, for tax years which produce net operating losses, capital losses or tax credit carryforwards (“tax
attributes”), the statute of limitations does not close, to the extent of these tax attributes, until the expiration of the statute of limitations for the tax year in which they are fully utilized. The completion of review or the expiration of
the statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the liability for income taxes. The Company classifies all interest and penalties related to tax uncertainties as income tax expense. See Note 19 for additional
information regarding income taxes.

Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2012, the Company adopted retrospectively a
change in method of applying an accounting principle for the Company’s pension plans. The change in accounting method relates to the calculation of market related value of pension plan assets, used to determine net periodic pension cost. The
impact of this change in accounting method on net income for the year ended December 31, 2012 was an increase of $96 million ($0.21 diluted earnings per share of Common stock). In addition, this change resulted in a cumulative increase of $144
million in retained earnings previously reported for December 31, 2009, with a corresponding decrease in AOCI. For additional information on the change in accounting method for the Company’s pension plans, see Note 18.

Effective January 1, 2012, the Company adopted,
retrospectively, new authoritative guidance to address diversity in practice regarding the interpretation of which costs relating to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts qualify for deferral. Under the amended guidance, acquisition
costs are to include only those costs that are directly related to the acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts by applying a model similar to the accounting for loan origination costs. An entity may defer incremental direct costs of contract
acquisition with independent third parties or employees that are essential to the contract transaction, as well as the portion of employee compensation, including payroll fringe benefits and other costs directly related to underwriting, policy
issuance and processing, medical inspection, and contract selling for successfully negotiated contracts. Prior period financial information presented in these financial statements has been adjusted to reflect the retrospective adoption of the
amended guidance. Retained earnings and AOCI previously reported for December 31, 2009 were reduced $2,358 million and $90 million, respectively, as a result of this retrospective adoption. The lower level of costs now qualifying for deferral
will be only partially offset by a lower level of amortization of “Deferred policy acquisition costs”, and, as such, will initially result in lower earnings in future periods, primarily within the International Insurance and Individual
Annuities segments. The impact to the International Insurance segment largely reflects lower deferrals of allocated costs of its proprietary distribution system, while the impact to the Individual Annuities segment mainly reflects lower deferrals of
its wholesaler costs. This amended guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011 and permits, but does not require, retrospective application. The Company adopted this guidance
effective January 1, 2012 and applied the retrospective method of adoption. While the adoption of this amended guidance changes the timing of when certain costs are reflected in the Company’s results of operations, it has no effect on the
total acquisition costs to be recognized over time and has no impact on the Company’s cash flows.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

In September 2011, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued updated guidance regarding the application of the goodwill impairment test. The updated guidance allows an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the
existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines
it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is not necessary. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it must perform the first step of
the two-step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the entity is
required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the impairment loss, if any. An entity has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and to proceed directly to performing the
first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test. An entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. The updated guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company’s early adoption of this guidance, as permitted, effective December 31, 2011, had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, and financial
statement disclosures.

In June 2011, the FASB
issued updated guidance regarding the presentation of comprehensive income. The updated guidance eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity. Under the
updated guidance, an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two
separate but consecutive statements. The updated guidance does not change the items that are reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. The Company opted to present the
total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income in two separate but consecutive statements. The Consolidated Financial Statements included herein reflect the adoption of this updated
guidance.

In May 2011, the FASB issued updated
guidance regarding the fair value measurements and disclosure requirements. The updated guidance clarifies existing guidance related to the application of fair value measurement methods and requires expanded disclosures. This new guidance is
effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2011 and should be applied prospectively. The expanded disclosures required by this guidance are included in Note 20. Adoption of this guidance did not have
a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In April 2011, the FASB issued updated guidance regarding the assessment of effective control for repurchase agreements. This new guidance is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period
beginning on or after December 15, 2011 and should be applied prospectively to transactions or modifications of existing



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

transactions that occur on or after the effective date. The Company’s adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results
of operations, and financial statement disclosures.

In April 2011, the FASB issued updated guidance clarifying which restructurings constitute troubled debt restructurings. It is intended to
assist creditors in their evaluation of whether conditions exist that constitute a troubled debt restructuring. This new guidance is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning on or after June 15, 2011 and should be
applied retrospectively to the beginning of the annual reporting period of adoption. The Company’s adoption of this guidance in the third quarter of 2011 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position,
results of operations, or financial statement disclosures.

In December 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for business combinations that modifies the first step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts.
For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. In determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment
exists, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist. The qualitative factors are consistent with existing authoritative guidance, which requires that goodwill of a reporting
unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. This new guidance is effective for public entities for
fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2010. The Company’s adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2011 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
position, results of operations, and financial statement disclosures.

In December 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined
entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. This guidance expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures required for
business combinations to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination(s) included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings. This new guidance
is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010. The Company adopted this guidance prospectively for
business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2011. The disclosures included in Note 3 reflect this guidance.

In July 2010, the FASB issued updated guidance that requires enhanced disclosures related to the allowance for credit losses and the
credit quality of a company’s financing receivable portfolio. The disclosures as of the end of a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after December 15, 2010. The Company adopted this
guidance effective December 31, 2010. The disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010. The required disclosures are included
above and in Note 4. In January 2011, the FASB deferred the disclosures required by this guidance related to troubled debt restructurings. These disclosures are effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning on or after
June 15, 2011, concurrent with the effective date of guidance for determining what constitutes a troubled debt restructuring. The disclosures required by this guidance related to troubled debt restructurings were adopted in the third quarter of
2011 and are included above and in Note 4.

In
April 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance clarifying that an insurance entity should not consider any separate account interests in an investment held for the benefit of policyholders to be the insurer’s interests, and should not
combine those interests with its general account interest in the same investment when assessing the investment for consolidation, unless the separate account interests are held for a related party policyholder, whereby consolidation of such
interests must be considered under applicable variable interest



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

guidance. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010 and retrospectively to all prior periods upon the date of adoption, with early
adoption permitted. The Company’s adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2011 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, and financial statement disclosures.

Future Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2011 and January 2013, the
FASB issued updated guidance regarding the disclosure of recognized derivative instruments (including bifurcated embedded derivatives), repurchase agreements and securities borrowing/lending transactions that are offset in the statement of financial
position or are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement (irrespective of whether they are offset in the statement of financial position). This new guidance requires an entity to disclose information on both a gross
basis and net basis about instruments and transactions within the scope of this guidance. This new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim reporting periods within those years, and
should be applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the guidance on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, and financial statement disclosures.

In February 2013, the FASB issued updated
guidance regarding the presentation of comprehensive income. Under the guidance, an entity would separately present information about significant items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component as well as changes in
accumulated other comprehensive income balances by component in either the financial statements or the notes to the financial statements. The guidance does not change the items that are reported in other comprehensive income, does not change when an
item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income, and does not amend any existing requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income. The guidance is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period
beginning after December 15, 2012 and should be applied prospectively. This guidance is not expected to impact the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position or cash flows. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this
guidance on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and equity and the notes to consolidated financial statements.

3.    ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

Acquisition of The Hartford’s Individual Life
Insurance Business

On January 2,
2013, the Company acquired The Hartford’s individual life insurance business through a reinsurance transaction. Under the agreement, the Company paid The Hartford cash consideration of $615 million, primarily in the form of a ceding commission
to provide reinsurance for approximately 700,000 life insurance policies with a net retained face amount in force of approximately $135 billion. This acquisition increases the Company’s scale in the U.S. individual life insurance market,
particularly universal life products, and provides complementary distribution opportunities through expanded wirehouse and bank distribution channels.

Acquisition of AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd., AIG Edison Life Insurance Company and Related Entities from AIG

On February 1, 2011, Prudential Financial completed the
acquisition from American International Group, Inc. (“AIG”) of AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (“Star”), AIG Edison Life Insurance Company (“Edison”), AIG Financial Assurance Japan K.K., and AIG Edison Service Co.,
Ltd. (collectively, the “Star and Edison Businesses”) pursuant to the stock purchase agreement dated September 30, 2010 between Prudential Financial and AIG. The total purchase price was $4,709 million, comprised of $4,213 million in
cash and $496 million in assumed third party debt, substantially all of which is expected to be repaid, over time, with excess capital of the acquired entities. The acquisition of these businesses included the purchase by the Company of all of the
shares



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

of these entities, which became indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company. All acquired entities were Japanese corporations and their businesses were in Japan, increasing the
Company’s scale in the Japanese insurance market. On January 1, 2012, Star and Edison were merged into the Gibraltar Life Insurance Company, Ltd.

Prudential Financial made a Section 338(g) election under the Internal Revenue Code with respect to the acquisition resulting in the
acquired entities being treated for U.S. tax purposes as newly-incorporated companies. Under such election, the U.S. tax basis of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the Star and Edison Businesses were adjusted as of February 1, 2011
to reflect the consequences of the Section 338(g) election.

Although the acquisition of the Star and Edison Businesses included the acquisition of multiple entities, the Company views this as a single acquisition and reports it as such in the following
disclosures.

Net Assets Acquired

The following table presents an allocation
of the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed at February 1, 2011 (the “Acquisition Date”):

(1)

Total invested assets, at fair value, include $55 million of related party assets. Other assets include $86 million of related party assets.

(2)

Includes investment contracts reported at fair value, which exceeded the account value by $646 million.

Value of Business Acquired

Value of business acquired (“VOBA”), which is
established in accordance with purchase accounting guidance, is an intangible asset associated with the acquired in force insurance contracts representing the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the liabilities, determined as of
the acquisition date. The fair value of the liabilities, and hence VOBA, reflects the cost of the capital attributable to the acquired insurance contracts. VOBA is amortized over the expected life of the contracts in proportion to either gross
premiums or gross profits, depending on the type of contract. Total gross profits include both actual experience as it arises and estimates of gross profits for future periods. The Company regularly evaluates and adjusts the VOBA balance with a
corresponding charge or credit to earnings for the effects of actual gross profits and changes in assumptions regarding estimated future gross profits. VOBA is reported as a component of “Other assets” and the amortization of VOBA is
reported in “General and administrative expenses.” The proportion of the VOBA balance attributable to each of the product groups, as of the acquisition date, was as follows: 48% related to accident and health insurance products, 45%
related to individual life insurance, and 7% related to fixed annuities.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The following table provides estimated future amortization of VOBA, net of interest,
assuming December 31, 2012 end of period foreign currency exchange rates remain constant, relating to the Star and Edison Businesses for the periods indicated.

Information regarding the
change in VOBA is as follows:

Goodwill

As a result of the acquisition of the Star and Edison
Businesses, the Company recognized an asset for goodwill representing the excess of the acquisition cost over the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill resulting from the acquisition of the Star and Edison
Businesses amounted to $173 million. Based on the Company’s final calculation of the 338(g) election the Company determined that none of the goodwill is tax deductible. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, goodwill is not amortized but rather is
tested at least annually for impairment. The test is performed at the reporting unit level which for this acquisition is the International Insurance segment’s Gibraltar Life and Other operations.

Results of the Star and Edison Businesses since the
Acquisition Date

The following table
presents selected financial information reflecting results for the Star and Edison Businesses, prior to merging into the Gibraltar Life Insurance Company, Ltd. on January 1, 2012, that are included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements
of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2011:

Includes 10 months of results for the Star and Edison Businesses (February 1, 2011 through November 30, 2011) as discussed in Note 1.

The results of the Star and Edison Businesses in the table
above include a pre-tax charge of $27 million for estimated claims and expenses arising from the 2011 earthquake in Japan. The results of the Star and Edison Businesses in the table above do not reflect the impact of transaction and integration
costs on the Company’s results. Transaction costs represent costs directly related to effecting the acquisition. Integration costs are costs associated with the integration of the core operations of the Star and Edison Businesses with the
Gibraltar Life operations. Both transaction and integration costs are expensed as incurred and are included in “General and

administrative expenses.” For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company incurred $138 million and $213 million, respectively, of transaction and integration costs
reflected in the International Insurance segment.

Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Information

The following supplemental information presents selected
unaudited pro forma information for the Company assuming the acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 2010. This pro forma information does not purport to represent what the Company’s actual results of operations would have been if the
acquisition had occurred as of the date indicated or what such results would be for any future periods. The pro forma information does not reflect the impact of future events that may occur, including but not limited to, expense efficiencies arising
from the acquisition and also does not give effect to certain one-time charges that the Company expects to incur, such as restructuring and integration costs.

Sale of Real Estate Brokerage Franchise
and Relocation Services Business

On
December 6, 2011, the Company sold its real estate brokerage franchise and relocation services business (“PRERS”) to Brookfield Asset Management, Inc. The Prudential Real Estate Financial Services Company of America Inc.
(“PREFSA”), a finance subsidiary of the Company with investments in a limited number of real estate brokerage franchises, was excluded from the transaction. The proceeds from the sale, before transaction related expenses, were $108 million
and resulted in a pre-tax gain of $49 million and an after tax gain of $62 million.

Under the sale agreement, the real estate brokerage franchisees may continue to use the Company’s trademark, based on the terms of their respective franchise agreements. In addition, the Company had
agreed to provide certain Brookfield affiliates with transitional financing for the transferred relocation services business. This transitional financing was terminated on October 26, 2012.

PRERS did not qualify as a Discontinued Operation due to the
continuing involvement through the financing provided to Brookfield and the retained equity in PREFSA

.

Results related to PRERS and PREFSA are included in Corporate and Other operations as a divested business.

(1)

Excludes notes with amortized cost of $1,500 million (fair value, $1,660 million) which have been offset with the associated payables under a netting agreement.

Actual maturities may differ from
contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations. Asset-backed, commercial mortgage-backed, and residential mortgage-backed securities are shown separately in the table above, as they are not due at a single
maturity date.

Other Long-Term Investments

“Other long-term investments” are comprised as follows at December 31:

In certain investment
structures, the Company’s asset management business invests with other co-investors in an investment fund referred to as a feeder fund. In these structures, the invested capital of several feeder funds is pooled together and used to purchase
ownership interests in another fund, referred to as a master fund. The master fund utilizes this invested capital and, in certain cases, other debt financing, to purchase various classes of assets on behalf of its investors. Specialized industry
accounting for investment companies calls for the feeder fund to reflect its investment in the master fund as a single net asset equal to its proportionate share of the net assets of the master fund, regardless of its level of interest in the master
fund. In cases where the Company consolidates the feeder fund, it retains the feeder fund’s net asset presentation and reports the consolidated feeder fund’s proportionate share of the net assets of the master fund in “Other long-term
investments,” with any unaffiliated investors’ noncontrolling interest in the feeder fund reported in “Other liabilities” or “Noncontrolling interests.” The consolidated feeder funds’ investments in these master
funds, reflected on this net asset basis, totaled $97 million and $172 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The unaffiliated interest in the consolidated feeder funds was $2 million as of both December 31, 2012 and 2011,
and the master funds had gross assets of $1,049 million and $819 million, respectively, and gross liabilities of $791 million and $565 million, respectively, which are not included on the Company’s balance sheet.

Duration of Gross Unrealized Loss Positions for Fixed Maturities and Equity Securities

The following table shows the fair value
and gross unrealized losses aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual fixed maturity securities and equity securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at December 31:

(1)

Includes $526 million of fair value and $67 million of gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2012 on securities classified as held-to-maturity, a portion of
which are not reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income.

(1)

Includes $706 million of fair value and $98 million of gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2011 on securities classified as held-to-maturity, a portion of
which are not reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2012 and 2011 are composed of $1,866
million and $3,535 million related to high or highest quality securities based on NAIC or equivalent rating and $677 million and $1,819 million related to other than high or highest quality securities based on NAIC or equivalent rating. At
December 31, 2012, the $1,833 million of gross unrealized losses of twelve months or more were concentrated in asset-backed securities, and in the finance and consumer cyclical sectors of the Company’s corporate securities. At
December 31, 2011, the $3,900 million of gross unrealized losses of twelve months or more were concentrated in asset-backed securities, and in the finance and utility sectors of the Company’s corporate securities. In accordance with its
policy described in Note 2, the Company concluded that an adjustment to earnings for other-than-temporary impairments for these securities was not warranted at December 31, 2012 and 2011. These conclusions are based on a detailed analysis of
the underlying credit and cash flows on each security. The gross unrealized losses are primarily attributable to foreign currency movements, credit spread widening and increased liquidity discounts. At December 31, 2012, the Company does not
intend to sell the securities and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis.

At December 31, 2012, $6 million of the gross unrealized losses represented declines of greater than 20%,
$4 million of which had been in that position for less than six months. At December 31, 2011, $236 million of the gross unrealized losses represented declines of greater than 20%, $225 million of which had been in that position for less than
six months. In accordance with its policy described in Note 2, the Company concluded that an adjustment for other-than-temporary impairments for these equity securities was not warranted at December 31, 2012 and 2011.

Securities Pledged, Restricted Assets and Special Deposits

The Company pledges as collateral
investment securities it owns to unaffiliated parties through certain transactions, including securities lending, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, collateralized borrowings and postings of collateral with derivative counterparties. At
December 31, the carrying value of investments pledged to third parties as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position included the following:

(1)

Includes $4 million of fixed maturity securities classified as short-term investments at December 31, 2011.

As of December 31, 2012, the carrying amount of the
associated liabilities supported by the pledged collateral was $15,621 million. Of this amount, $5,818 million was “Securities sold under agreements to repurchase,” $3,535 million was “Separate account liabilities,” $3,941
million was “Cash collateral for loaned securities,” $280 million was “Long-term debt,” $100 million was “Short-term debt,” and $1,947 million was “Policyholders’ account balances.” As of
December 31, 2011, the carrying amount of the associated liabilities supported by the pledged collateral was $17,408 million. Of this amount, $6,218 million was “Securities sold under agreements to repurchase,” $4,160 million was
“Separate account liabilities,” $2,973 million was “Cash collateral for loaned securities,” $725 million was “Long-term debt,” $199 million was “Short-term debt,” $1,500 million was “Policyholders’
account balances,” and $1,388 million was “Other liabilities.”

In the normal course of its business activities, the Company accepts collateral that can be sold or repledged. The primary sources of this collateral are securities in customer accounts and securities
purchased under agreements to resell. The fair value of this collateral was approximately $2,996 million and $2,258 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, all of which, for both periods, had either been sold or repledged.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Assets of $80 million and $50 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively,
were on deposit with governmental authorities or trustees. Additionally, assets carried at $594 million and $596 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, were held in voluntary trusts established primarily to fund guaranteed dividends to certain
policyholders and to fund certain employee benefits. Securities restricted as to sale amounted to $183 million and $191 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. These amounts include member and activity-based stock associated
with memberships in the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and Boston. Restricted cash and securities of $67 million and $56 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, were included in “Other assets.”

5.    VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

In the normal course of its activities,
the Company enters into relationships with various special purpose entities and other entities that are deemed to be variable interest entities (“VIEs”). A VIE is an entity that either (1) has equity investors that lack certain
essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest (including the ability to control activities of the entity, the obligation to absorb the entity’s expected losses and the right to receive the entity’s expected residual
returns) or (2) lacks sufficient equity to finance its own activities without financial support provided by other entities, which in turn would be expected to absorb at least some of the expected losses of the VIE.

If the Company determines that it is the VIE’s
“primary beneficiary” it consolidates the VIE. There are currently two models for determining whether or not the Company is the “primary beneficiary” of a VIE. The first relates to those VIEs that have the characteristics of an
investment company and for which certain other conditions are true. These conditions are that (1) the Company does not have the implicit or explicit obligation to fund losses of the VIE and (2) the VIE is not a securitization entity,
asset-backed financing entity or an entity that was formerly considered a qualified special-purpose entity. In this model the Company is the primary beneficiary if it stands to absorb a majority of the VIE’s expected losses or to receive a
majority of the VIE’s expected residual returns and would be required to consolidate the VIE.

For all other VIEs, the Company is the primary beneficiary if the Company has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity
and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could be potentially significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could be potentially significant. If both conditions are present the Company would be
required to consolidate the VIE.

Consolidated Variable
Interest Entities for which the Company is the Investment Manager

The Company is the investment manager of certain asset-backed investment vehicles (commonly referred to as collateralized debt obligations, or “CDOs”) and certain other vehicles for which the
Company earns fee income for investment management services, including certain investment structures which the Company’s asset management business invests with other co-investors in investment funds referred to as feeder funds. The Company
sells or syndicates investments through these vehicles, principally as part of the strategic investing activity of the Company’s asset management businesses. Additionally, the Company may invest in debt or equity securities issued by these
vehicles. CDOs raise capital by issuing debt securities, and use the proceeds to purchase investments, typically interest-bearing financial instruments. The Company analyzes these relationships to determine whether it has (1) the power to
direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could be potentially significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from
the entity that could be potentially significant and thus is the primary beneficiary. This analysis includes a review of (1) the Company’s rights and responsibilities as investment manager, (2) fees received by the Company and
(3) other interests (if any) held by the Company. The Company is not required to provide, and has not provided, material financial or other support to any VIE for which it is the investment manager.

The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary
of certain VIEs for which it is the asset manager, including certain CDOs and other investment structures, as it meets both conditions listed above. The



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

table below reflects the carrying amount and balance sheet caption in which the assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs for which the Company is the investment manager are reported. The
assets of these VIEs are restricted and must be used first to settle liabilities of the VIE. The creditors of these VIEs do not have recourse to the Company in excess of the assets contained within the VIE.

As included in the table
above, notes issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position titled, “Notes issued by consolidated VIEs.” Recourse is limited to the assets of the respective Variable
Interest Entity and does not extend to the general credit of Prudential Financial. As of December 31, 2012, the maturities of these obligations were over five years.

The Company also consolidates a VIE whose beneficial
interests are wholly-owned by consolidated subsidiaries. This VIE is not included in the table above and the Company does not currently intend to sell these beneficial interests to third parties.

Other Consolidated Variable Interest Entities

The Company is the primary beneficiary of certain VIEs in
which the Company has invested, as part of its investment activities. Included among these structured investments are structured investments issued by a VIE that manages yen-denominated investments coupled with cross-currency coupon swap agreements
thereby creating synthetic dual currency investments. The Company’s involvement in the structuring of these investments combined with its economic interest indicates that the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company has not provided
material financial or other support that was not contractually required to these VIEs. The table below reflects the carrying amount and balance sheet caption in which the assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs for which the Company is not the
investment manager are reported. These liabilities primarily comprise obligations under debt instruments issued by the VIEs that are non-recourse to the Company. The creditors of each consolidated VIE have recourse only to the assets of that VIE.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

In addition, not reflected in the table above, the Company has created a trust that is a
VIE, to facilitate Prudential Insurance’s Funding Agreement Notes Issuance Program (“FANIP”). The trust issues medium-term notes secured by funding agreements issued to the trust by Prudential Insurance with the proceeds of such
notes. The trust is the beneficiary of an indemnity agreement with the Company that provides that the Company is responsible for costs related to the notes issued with limited exception. As a result, the Company has determined that it is the primary
beneficiary of the trust, which is therefore consolidated.

The funding agreements represent an intercompany transaction that is eliminated upon consolidation. However, in recognition of the security interest in such funding agreements, the trust’s
medium-term note liability of $1,780 million and $3,197 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, is classified within “Policyholders’ account balances.” Creditors of the trust have recourse to Prudential Insurance if
the trust fails to make contractual payments on the medium-term notes. The Company has not provided material financial or other support that was not contractually required to the trust.

Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities

The Company has determined that it is not the primary
beneficiary of certain VIEs for which it is the investment manager, including certain CDOs and other investment structures, as it does not have both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the economic
performance of the entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could be potentially significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could be potentially significant. The Company’s maximum
exposure to loss resulting from its relationship with unconsolidated VIEs for which it is the investment manager is limited to its investment in the VIEs, which was $602 million and $622 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
These investments are reflected in “Fixed maturities, available-for-sale,” “Other trading account assets, at fair value” and “Other long-term investments.” The fair value of assets held within these unconsolidated VIEs
was $9,240 million and $9,819 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Company has provided a guarantee to an unconsolidated VIE under which the Company is exposed to potential losses in the amount of $64 million and $97
million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. There are no liabilities associated with these unconsolidated VIEs on the Company’s balance sheet.

In the normal course of its activities, the Company will
invest in joint ventures and limited partnerships. These ventures include hedge funds, private equity funds and real estate-related funds and may or may not be VIEs. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss on these investments, both VIEs and
non-VIEs, is limited to the amount of its investment. The Company has determined that it is not required to consolidate these entities because either (1) it does not control them or (2) it does not have the obligation to absorb losses of
the entities that could be potentially significant to the entities or the right to receive benefits from the entities that could be potentially significant. The Company classifies these investments as “Other long-term investments” and its
maximum exposure to loss associated with these entities was $6,873 million and $4,486 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

In addition, in the normal course of its activities, the Company will invest in structured investments including VIEs for which it is not
the investment manager. These structured investments typically invest in fixed income investments and are managed by third parties and include asset-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage-backed securities.
The Company’s maximum exposure to loss on these structured investments, both VIEs and non-VIEs, is limited to the amount of its investment. See Note 4 for details regarding the carrying amounts and classification of these assets. The Company
has not provided material financial or other support that was not contractually required to these structures. The Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these structures due to the fact that it does not control these
entities.

Included among these structured
investments are asset-backed securities issued by VIEs that manage investments in the European market. In addition to a stated coupon, each investment provides a return based on the VIE’s portfolio of assets and related investment activity. The
market value of these VIEs was approximately $2.1 billion and $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and these VIEs were financed primarily through the issuance of notes similar to those purchased by the Company. The
Company generally



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

accounts for these investments as available-for-sale fixed maturities containing embedded derivatives that are bifurcated and marked-to-market through “Realized investment gains (losses),
net,” based upon the change in value of the underlying portfolio. The Company’s variable interest in each of these VIEs represents less than 50% of the only class of variable interests issued by the VIE. The Company’s maximum exposure
to loss from these interests was $314 million and $664 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which includes the fair value of the embedded derivatives.

7.    INVESTMENTS IN OPERATING JOINT VENTURES

The Company has made investments in
certain joint ventures that are strategic in nature and made other than for the sole purpose of generating investment income. These investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are included in “Other assets” in
the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The earnings from these investments are included on an after-tax basis in “Equity in earnings of operating joint ventures, net of taxes” in the Company’s Consolidated
Statements of Operations. The summarized financial information for the Company’s operating joint ventures has been included in the summarized combined financial information for all significant equity method investments shown in Note 4.

The following table sets forth information

operating joint ventures as part of its Asset Management and International Insurance segments and its Corporate and Other operations. The Company’s combined investment in these operating joint ventures includes an indirect investment, through a
consortium of investors, in China Pacific Group. The indirect investment in China Pacific Group includes unrealized changes in market value, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income and relate to the market price of China Pacific
Group’s publicly traded shares. The consortium of investors including the Company sold portions of its holdings

recorded for mortgage servicing rights or other intangibles. See the non-recurring fair value measurements section of Note 20 for more information regarding these impairments.

10.    POLICYHOLDERS’ LIABILITIES

Future Policy Benefits

Future policy benefits at December 31, are as follows:

Life insurance liabilities
include reserves for death and endowment policy benefits, terminal dividends and certain health benefits. Individual and group annuities and supplementary contracts liabilities include reserves for life contingent immediate annuities and life
contingent group annuities. Other contract liabilities include unearned revenue and certain other reserves for group, annuities and individual life and health products.

Future policy benefits for individual participating
traditional life insurance are based on the net level premium method, calculated using the guaranteed mortality and nonforfeiture interest rates which range from 2.5% to 7.5%. Participating insurance represented 5% and 5% of direct individual life
insurance in force at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and 11%, 17% and 24% of direct individual life insurance premiums for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Future policy benefits for individual non-participating
traditional life insurance policies, group and individual long-term care policies and individual health insurance policies are generally equal to the aggregate of (1) the present value of future benefit payments and related expenses, less the
present value of future net premiums, and (2) any premium deficiency reserves. Assumptions as to mortality, morbidity and persistency are based on the Company’s experience, and in certain instances, industry experience, when the basis of
the reserve is established. Interest rates used in the determination of the present values range from 1.0% to 14.0%; less than 1% of the reserves are based on an interest rate in excess of 8%.

Future policy benefits for individual and group annuities and supplementary contracts are generally equal to
the aggregate of (1) the present value of expected future payments, and (2) any premium deficiency reserves. Assumptions as to mortality are based on the Company’s experience, and in certain instances, industry experience, when the
basis of the reserve is established. The interest rates used in the determination of the present values range from 0.8% to 11.7%; less than 1% of the reserves are based on an interest rate in excess of 8%.

Future policy benefits for other contract liabilities are
generally equal to the present value of expected future payments based on the Company’s experience, except for example, certain group insurance coverages for which future policy benefits are equal to gross unearned premium reserves. The
interest rates used in the determination of the present values range from 0.1% to 6.7%.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Premium deficiency reserves are established, if necessary, when the liability for future
policy benefits plus the present value of expected future gross premiums are determined to be insufficient to provide for expected future policy benefits and expenses and to recover any unamortized policy acquisition costs. Premium deficiency
reserves have been recorded for the group single premium annuity business, which consists of limited-payment, long duration traditional, non-participating annuities; structured settlements; single premium immediate annuities with life contingencies;
long term care, and for certain individual health policies. These reserves are included in “Future policy benefits”, and include amounts relating to net unrealized gains on securities classified as available-for-sale, that is also reported
within AOCI on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.

The Company’s liability for future policy benefits is also inclusive of liabilities for guarantee benefits related to certain nontraditional long-duration life and annuity contracts, which are
discussed more fully in Note 11 and are primarily reflected in other contract liabilities in the table above.

Unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses primarily reflect the Company’s estimate of future disability claim payments and expenses
as well as estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet dates related to group disability products. Unpaid claim liabilities that are discounted use interest rates ranging from 3.5% to 6.4%.

Policyholders’ Account Balances

Policyholders’ account balances at December 31,
are as follows:

Policyholders’ account
balances represent an accumulation of account deposits plus credited interest less withdrawals, expenses and mortality charges, if applicable. These policyholders’ account balances also include provisions for benefits under non-life contingent
payout annuities. Included in “Funding agreements” at December 31, 2012 and 2011 are $1,788 million and $3,244 million, respectively, related to the Company’s Funding Agreement Notes Issuance Program (“FANIP”). Under
this program, which has a maximum authorized amount of $15 billion, a Delaware statutory trust issues medium-term notes to investors that are secured by funding agreements issued to the trust by Prudential Insurance. The outstanding notes have fixed
or floating interest rates that range from 0.5% to 5.5% and original maturities ranging from five to ten years. Included in the amounts at December 31, 2012 and 2011 is the medium-term note liability, which is carried at amortized cost, of
$1,780 million and $3,197 million, respectively, as well as the fair value of qualifying derivative financial instruments associated with these notes of $8 million and $27 million, respectively. For additional details on the FANIP program, see Note
5.

Also included in “Funding
agreements” are collateralized funding agreements issued to the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLBNY”) of $1,947 million and $1,503 million, as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. These obligations, which are
carried at amortized cost, have fixed or floating interest rates that range from 0.7% to 3.5% and original maturities ranging from three to eight years. For additional details on the FHLBNY program, see Note 14. Interest crediting rates range from
0% to 12.0% for interest-sensitive life contracts and from 0% to 13.4% for contracts other than interest-sensitive life. Less than 1% of policyholders’ account balances have interest crediting rates in excess of 8%.

11.    CERTAIN NONTRADITIONAL LONG-DURATION CONTRACTS

The Company issues traditional variable
annuity contracts through its separate accounts for which investment income and investment gains and losses accrue directly to, and investment risk is borne by, the contractholder. The Company also issues variable annuity contracts with general and
separate account options where the Company contractually guarantees to the contractholder a return of no less than (1) total deposits made to the contract less any partial withdrawals (“return of net deposits”), (2) total
deposits made to the contract less any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return (“minimum return”), or (3) the highest contract value on a specified date minus any withdrawals (“contract value”). These guarantees include
benefits that are payable in the event of death, annuitization or at specified dates during the accumulation period and withdrawal and income benefits payable during specified periods. The Company also issues annuity contracts with market value
adjusted investment options (“MVAs”), which provide for a return of principal plus a fixed rate of return if held-to-maturity, or, alternatively, a “market adjusted value” if surrendered prior to maturity or if funds are
reallocated to other investment options. The market value adjustment may result in a gain or loss to the Company, depending on crediting rates or an indexed rate at surrender, as applicable. The company also issues fixed deferred annuity contracts
without MVA that have a guaranteed credited rate and annuity benefit.

In addition, the Company issues variable life, variable universal life and universal life contracts where the Company contractually guarantees to the contractholder a death benefit even when there is
insufficient value to cover monthly mortality and expense charges, whereas otherwise the contract would typically lapse (“no lapse guarantee”). Variable life and variable universal life contracts are offered with general and separate
account options.

The assets supporting the
variable portion of both traditional variable annuities and certain variable contracts with guarantees are carried at fair value and reported as “Separate account assets” with an equivalent amount reported as “Separate account
liabilities.” Amounts assessed against the contractholders for mortality, administration, and other services are included within revenue in “Policy charges and fee income” and changes in liabilities for minimum guarantees are
generally included in “Policyholders’ benefits.”

For those guarantees of benefits that are payable in the event of death, the net amount at risk is generally defined as the current guaranteed minimum death benefit in excess of the current account
balance at the balance sheet date. The Company’s primary risk exposures for these contracts relates to actual deviations from, or changes to, the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products, including equity market returns,
contract lapses and contractholder mortality.

For
guarantees of benefits that are payable at annuitization, the net amount at risk is generally defined as the present value of the minimum guaranteed annuity payments available to the contractholder determined in accordance with the terms of the
contract in excess of the current account balance. The Company’s primary risk exposures for these contracts relates to actual deviations from, or changes to, the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products, including fixed income
and equity market returns, timing of annuitization, contract lapses and contractholder mortality.

For guarantees of benefits that are payable at withdrawal, the net amount at risk is generally defined as the present value of the minimum guaranteed withdrawal payments available to the contractholder
determined in accordance with the terms of the contract in excess of the current account balance. For guarantees of accumulation balances, the net amount at risk is generally defined as the guaranteed minimum accumulation balance minus the current
account balance. The Company’s primary risk exposures for these contracts relates to actual deviations from, or changes to, the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products, including equity market returns, interest rates, market
volatility or contractholder behavior used in the original pricing of these products.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The Company’s contracts with guarantees may offer more than one type of guarantee
in each contract; therefore, the amounts listed may not be mutually exclusive. The liabilities related to the net amount at risk are reflected within “Future policy benefits.” As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had the
following guarantees associated with these contracts, by product and guarantee type:

(1)

Includes income and withdrawal benefits as described herein.

Account balances of variable annuity contracts with guarantees were invested in separate account investment options as follows:

In addition to the amounts
invested in separate account investment options above, $9,590 million at December 31, 2012 and $10,848 million at December 31, 2011 of account balances of variable annuity contracts with guarantees, inclusive of contracts with MVA
features, were invested in general account investment options. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, there were no transfers of assets, other than cash, from the general account to any separate account, and accordingly no gains
or losses recorded.

Liabilities For Guarantee Benefits

The table below summarizes the changes in general account
liabilities for guarantees. The liabilities for guaranteed minimum death benefits (“GMDB”) and guaranteed minimum income benefits (“GMIB”) are included in “Future policy benefits” and the related changes in the
liabilities are included in “Policyholders’ benefits.” Guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (“GMAB”), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (“GMWB”), and guaranteed minimum income and withdrawal benefits
(“GMIWB”) features are considered to be bifurcated embedded derivatives and are recorded at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives, including changes in the Company’s own risk of non-performance, along with any
fees attributed or payments made relating to the derivative, are recorded in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” See Note 20 for additional information regarding the methodology used in determining the fair value of these embedded
derivatives. The liabilities for GMAB, GMWB and GMIWB are included in “Future policy benefits.” As discussed below, the Company maintains a portfolio of derivative investments that serve as a partial hedge of the risks associated with
these products, for which the changes in fair value are also recorded in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” This portfolio of derivative investments does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP.

(1)

Incurred guarantee benefits include the portion of assessments established as additions to reserves as well as changes in estimates affecting the reserves. Also
includes changes in the fair value of features considered to be derivatives.

(2)

Primarily represents amounts acquired from Star and Edison.

The GMDB liability is determined each period end by estimating the accumulated value of a portion of the total assessments to date less
the accumulated value of the death benefits in excess of the account balance. The GMIB liability associated with variable annuities is determined each period by estimating the accumulated value of a portion of the total assessments to date less the
accumulated value of the projected income benefits in excess of the account balance. The portion of assessments used is chosen such that, at issue the present value of expected death benefits or expected income benefits in excess of the projected
account balance and the portion of



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

the present value of total expected assessments over the lifetime of the contracts are equal. The GMIB liability associated with fixed annuities is determined each period by estimating the
present value of projected income benefits in excess of the account balance. The Company regularly evaluates the estimates used and adjusts the GMDB and GMIB liability balances, with an associated charge or credit to earnings, if actual experience
or other evidence suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised.

The GMAB features provide the contractholder with a guaranteed return of initial account value or an enhanced value if applicable. The most significant of the Company’s GMAB features are the
guaranteed return option (“GRO”) features, which includes an automatic rebalancing element that reduces the Company’s exposure to these guarantees. The GMAB liability is calculated as the present value of future expected payments to
customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature.

The GMWB features provide the contractholder with access to a guaranteed remaining balance if the account value is reduced to zero through
a combination of market declines and withdrawals. The guaranteed remaining balance is generally equal to the protected value under the contract, which is initially established as the greater of the account value or cumulative deposits when
withdrawals commence, less cumulative withdrawals. The contractholder accesses the guaranteed remaining balance through defined annual payments. The contractholder also has the option, after a specified time period, to reset the guaranteed remaining
balance to the then-current account value, if greater. The GMWB liability is calculated as the present value of future expected payments to customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature.

The GMIWB features, taken collectively, provide a
contractholder two optional methods to receive guaranteed minimum payments over time, a “withdrawal” option or an “income” option. The withdrawal option (which was available under only one of the GMIWBs the Company no longer
offers) guarantees that a contractholder can withdraw an amount each year until the cumulative withdrawals reach a total guaranteed balance. The income option (which varies among the Company’s GMIWBs) in general guarantees the contractholder
the ability to withdraw an amount each year for life (or for joint lives, in the case of any spousal version of the benefit) where such amount is equal to a percentage of a protected value under the benefit. The contractholder also has the potential
to increase this annual amount, based on certain subsequent increases in account value that may occur. The GMIWB can be elected by the contractholder upon issuance of an appropriate deferred variable annuity contract or at any time following
contract issue prior to annuitization. Certain GMIWB features include an automatic rebalancing element that reduces the Company’s exposure to these guarantees. The GMIWB liability is calculated as the present value of future expected payments
to customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature.

As part of its risk management strategy, the Company hedges or limits its exposure to these risks, excluding those risks that have been
deemed suitable to retain and risks that are not able to be hedged, through a combination of product design elements, such as an automatic rebalancing element, and externally purchased hedging instruments, such as equity options and interest rate
derivatives. The automatic rebalancing element included in the design of certain optional living benefits transfers assets between certain variable investments selected by the annuity contractholder and, depending on the benefit feature, a
fixed-rate account in the general account or a bond portfolio within the separate accounts. The transfers are based on the static mathematical formula used with the particular optional benefit which considers a number of factors, including, but not
limited to, the impact of investment performance of the contractholder’s total account value. In general, negative investment performance may result in transfers to a fixed-rate account in the general account or a bond portfolio within the
separate accounts, and positive investment performance may result in transfers back to contractholder-selected variable investments. Other product design elements utilized for certain products to manage these risks include asset allocation
restrictions and minimum issuance age requirements. For risk management purposes the Company segregates the variable annuity living benefit features into those that include the automatic rebalancing element, including certain GMIWB riders and
certain GMAB riders that feature the GRO policyholder benefits; and those that do not include the automatic rebalancing element, including certain legacy GMIWB, GMWB, GMAB and GMIB riders. Living benefit riders that include the automatic rebalancing
element also include GMDB riders, and as such the GMDB risk in these riders also benefits from the automatic rebalancing element.

Sales Inducements

The Company defers sales inducements and amortizes them over
the anticipated life of the policy using the same methodology and assumptions used to amortize deferred policy acquisition costs. These deferred sales inducements are included in “Other assets.” The Company offers various types of sales
inducements. These inducements include: (1) a bonus whereby the policyholder’s initial account balance is increased by an amount equal to a specified percentage of the customer’s initial deposit, (2) additional credits after a
certain number of years a contract is held and (3) enhanced interest crediting rates that are higher than the normal general account interest rate credited in certain product lines. Changes in deferred sales inducements, reported as
“Interest credited to policyholders’ account balances,” are as follows:

12.    CLOSED BLOCK

On the date of demutualization,
Prudential Insurance established a Closed Block for certain individual life insurance policies and annuities issued by Prudential Insurance in the U.S. The recorded assets and liabilities were allocated to the Closed Block at their historical
carrying amounts. The Closed Block forms the principal component of the Closed Block Business.

The policies included in the Closed Block are specified individual life insurance policies and individual annuity contracts that were in force on the effective date of the Plan of Reorganization and for
which Prudential Insurance is currently paying or expects to pay experience-based policy dividends. Assets have been allocated to the Closed Block in an amount that has been determined to produce cash flows which, together with revenues from
policies included in the Closed Block, are expected to be sufficient to support obligations and liabilities relating to these policies, including provision for payment of benefits, certain expenses, and taxes and to provide for continuation of the
policyholder dividend scales in effect in 2000, assuming experience underlying such scales continues. To the extent that, over time, cash flows from the assets allocated to the Closed Block and claims and other experience related to the Closed Block
are, in the aggregate, more or less favorable than what was assumed when the Closed Block was established, total dividends paid to Closed Block policyholders may be greater than or less than the total dividends that would have been paid to these
policyholders if the policyholder dividend scales in effect in 2000 had been continued. Any cash flows in excess of amounts assumed will be available for distribution over time to Closed Block policyholders and will not be available to stockholders.
If the Closed Block has insufficient funds to make guaranteed policy benefit payments, such payments will be made from assets outside of the Closed Block. The Closed Block will continue in effect as long as any policy in the Closed Block remains in
force unless, with the consent of the New Jersey insurance regulator, it is terminated earlier.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The excess of Closed Block Liabilities over Closed Block Assets at the date of the
demutualization (adjusted to eliminate the impact of related amounts in AOCI) represented the estimated maximum future earnings at that date from the Closed Block expected to result from operations attributed to the Closed Block after income taxes.
In establishing the Closed Block, the Company developed an actuarial calculation of the timing of such maximum future earnings. If actual cumulative earnings of the Closed Block from inception through the end of any given period are greater than the
expected cumulative earnings, only the expected earnings will be recognized in income. Any excess of actual cumulative earnings over expected cumulative earnings will represent undistributed accumulated earnings attributable to policyholders, which
are recorded as a policyholder dividend obligation. The policyholder dividend obligation represents amounts to be paid to Closed Block policyholders as an additional policyholder dividend unless otherwise offset by future Closed Block performance
that is less favorable than originally expected. If the actual cumulative earnings of the Closed Block from its inception through the end of any given period are less than the expected cumulative earnings of the Closed Block, the Company will
recognize only the actual earnings in income. However, the Company may reduce policyholder dividend scales, which would be intended to increase future actual earnings until the actual cumulative earnings equaled the expected cumulative earnings.

As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the
Company recognized a policyholder dividend obligation of $885 million and $762 million, respectively, to Closed Block policyholders for the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings. Additionally, accumulated net
unrealized investment gains that have arisen subsequent to the establishment of the Closed Block have been reflected as a policyholder dividend obligation of $5,478 million and $3,847 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, to be
paid to Closed Block policyholders unless offset by future experience, with an offsetting amount reported in AOCI. See the table below for changes in the components of the policyholder dividend obligation for the years ended December 31, 2012
and 2011.

On December 11,
2012, December 13, 2011 and December 14, 2010, Prudential Insurance’s Board of Directors approved a continuation of the Closed Block dividend scales in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

13.    REINSURANCE

The Company participates in reinsurance
with third parties primarily to provide additional capacity for future growth, to limit the maximum net loss potential arising from large risks and in acquiring or disposing of businesses.

In 2011 and 2012, the Company entered into several reinsurance agreements to assume pension liabilities in the
United Kingdom. Under these arrangements, the Company assumes the longevity risk associated with the pension benefits of certain named beneficiaries.

In 2006, the Company acquired the variable annuity business of The Allstate Corporation (“Allstate”) through a reinsurance
transaction. The reinsurance arrangements with Allstate include a coinsurance arrangement associated with the general account liabilities assumed and a modified coinsurance arrangement associated with the separate account liabilities assumed. The
reinsurance payable, which represents the Company’s obligation under the modified coinsurance arrangement, is netted with the reinsurance receivable in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

In 2004, the Company acquired the retirement business of
CIGNA and as a result, entered into various reinsurance arrangements. The Company still has indemnity coinsurance and modified coinsurance without assumption arrangements in effect related to this acquisition.

For the domestic business, life and disability reinsurance is
accomplished through various plans of reinsurance, primarily yearly renewable term, per person excess, excess of loss, and coinsurance. The Company currently reinsures 90% of the mortality risk for most products. Placement of reinsurance is
accomplished primarily on an automatic basis with some specific risks reinsured on a facultative basis. The Company has historically retained up to $30 million per life, but will reduce its retention limit to $20 million in 2013 on individual
contracts. In addition, the Company has reinsured with unaffiliated third parties, 83% of the Closed Block through various modified coinsurance arrangements. The Company accounts for these modified coinsurance arrangements using the deposit method
of accounting.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

For the international business, some reinsurance is used to manage risk and volatility,
as necessary. A more significant use of reinsurance is to obtain experience with respect to new product offerings.

Reinsurance ceded arrangements do not discharge the Company as the primary insurer. Ceded balances would represent a liability of the
Company in the event the reinsurers were unable to meet their obligations to the Company under the terms of the reinsurance agreements. Reinsurance premiums, commissions, expense reimbursements, benefits and reserves related to reinsured
long-duration contracts are accounted for over the life of the underlying reinsured contracts using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the underlying contracts. The cost of reinsurance related to short-duration contracts is
accounted for over the reinsurance contract period. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers, for both short-and long-duration reinsurance arrangements, are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liabilities and policy benefits associated with
the reinsured policies.

The tables presented
below exclude amounts pertaining to the Company’s discontinued operations.

Reinsurance amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for premiums, policy charges and fees and policyholders’ benefits for the years ended December 31, were as follows:

Reinsurance recoverables at
December 31, are as follows:

(1)

Primarily represents reinsurance recoverables established under the reinsurance arrangements associated with the acquisition of the retirement business of CIGNA. The
Company has recorded related reinsurance payables of $628 million and $713 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Excluding the reinsurance recoverable associated with the acquisition of the retirement business of CIGNA, four major reinsurance
companies account for approximately 57% of the reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2012. The Company periodically reviews the financial condition of its reinsurers, amounts recoverable therefrom, and unearned reinsurance premium, in order
to minimize its exposure to loss from reinsurer insolvencies. If deemed necessary, the Company would secure collateral in the form of a trust, letter of credit, or funds withheld arrangement to ensure collectability, otherwise, an allowance for
uncollectible reinsurance would be recorded.

14.    SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT

Short-term Debt

Short-term debt at December 31 is as follows:

(1)

Includes collateralized borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York of $100 million and $199 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively,
discussed in more detail below.

(2)

Includes limited and non-recourse borrowings of Prudential Holdings, LLC attributable to the Closed Block Business of $75 million and $0 million at December 31,
2012 and 2011, respectively

(3)

Includes Prudential Financial debt of $1,847 million and $1,252 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

(4)

Excludes the current portion of long-term debt.

At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company was in compliance with all covenants related to the above debt.

Commercial Paper

Prudential Financial has a commercial paper program with an
authorized capacity of $3.0 billion. Prudential Financial commercial paper borrowings have been generally used to fund the working capital needs of Prudential Financial’s subsidiaries and provide short-term liquidity at Prudential Financial.

Prudential Funding, LLC (“Prudential
Funding”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Insurance, has a commercial paper program, with an authorized capacity of $7.0 billion. Prudential Funding commercial paper borrowings have generally served as an additional source of financing
to meet the working capital needs of Prudential Insurance and its subsidiaries. Prudential Funding also lends to other subsidiaries of Prudential Financial up to limits agreed with the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance
(“NJDOBI”). Prudential Funding maintains a support agreement with Prudential Insurance whereby Prudential Insurance has agreed to maintain Prudential Funding’s tangible net worth at a positive level. Additionally, Prudential Financial
has issued a subordinated guarantee covering Prudential Funding’s commercial paper program.

Federal Home Loan Bank of New York

Prudential Insurance is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLBNY”). Membership allows Prudential Insurance access to the FHLBNY’s financial services, including the
ability to obtain collateralized loans and to issue collateralized funding agreements. Under applicable law, the funding agreements issued to the FHLBNY have priority claim status above debt holders of Prudential Insurance. FHLBNY borrowings and
funding agreements are collateralized by qualifying mortgage-related assets or U.S. Treasury securities, the fair value of which must be maintained at certain specified levels relative to outstanding,



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

borrowings. FHLBNY membership requires Prudential Insurance to own member stock and borrowings require the purchase of activity-based stock in an amount equal to 4.5% of outstanding borrowings.
Under FHLBNY guidelines, if Prudential Insurance’s financial strength ratings decline below A/A2/A Stable by S&P/Moody’s/Fitch, respectively, and the FHLBNY does not receive written assurances from the NJDOBI regarding Prudential
Insurance’s solvency, new borrowings from the FHLBNY would be limited to a term of 90 days or less. Currently there are no restrictions on the term of borrowings from the FHLBNY. All FHLBNY stock purchased by Prudential Insurance is classified
as restricted general account investments within “Other long-term investments,” and the carrying value of these investments was $170 million and $173 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

NJDOBI permits Prudential Insurance to pledge collateral to
the FHLBNY in an amount of up to 5% of its prior year-end statutory net admitted assets, excluding separate account assets. Based on Prudential Insurance’s statutory net admitted assets as of December 31, 2011, the 5% limitation equates to
a maximum amount of pledged assets of $7.7 billion and an estimated maximum borrowing capacity (after taking into account required collateralization levels and purchases of activity-based stock) of approximately $6.4 billion, of which $2.3 billion
was outstanding. Nevertheless, FHLBNY borrowings are subject to the FHLBNY’s discretion and to the availability of qualifying assets at Prudential Insurance.

As of December 31, 2012, Prudential Insurance had
pledged qualifying assets with a fair value of $2.9 billion that supported outstanding collateralized advances and collateralized funding agreements. During 2012, a $725 million collateralized advance was re-issued in the form of a funding
agreement. Of this amount, $445 million now supports proprietary spread lending and is classified as Policyholders’ account balances, and the remaining $280 million continues to be classified as long term debt. The fair value of qualifying
assets that were available to Prudential Insurance but not pledged amounted to $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2012.

Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston

Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company (“PRIAC”) is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston
(“FHLBB”). Membership allows PRIAC access to collateralized advances which will be classified in “Short-term debt” or “Long-term debt,” depending on the maturity date of the obligation. PRIAC’s membership in FHLBB
requires the ownership of member stock and borrowings from FHLBB require the purchase of activity-based stock in an amount between 3.0% and 4.5% of outstanding borrowings depending on the maturity date of the obligation. As of December 31,
2012, PRIAC had no advances outstanding under the FHLBB facility.

The Connecticut Department of Insurance (“CTDOI”) permits PRIAC to pledge up to $2.6 billion in qualifying assets to secure FHLBB borrowings through December 31, 2013. PRIAC must seek
re-approval from CTDOI prior to borrowing additional funds after that date. Based on available eligible assets as of December 31, 2012, PRIAC had an estimated maximum borrowing capacity, after taking into consideration required
collateralization levels and required purchases of activity-based FHLBB stock, of approximately $1.7 billion.

Credit Facilities

As of December 31, 2012, Prudential Financial and Prudential Funding maintained an aggregate of $3,750 million of unsecured committed
credit facilities consisting of a $2,000 million five-year facility expiring in December 2016 that has Prudential Financial as a borrower and a $1,750 million three-year facility expiring in December 2014 that has both Prudential Financial and
Prudential Funding as borrowers. Each of the facilities may be used for general corporate purposes, including as backup liquidity for the Company’s commercial paper programs discussed above. In November 2012, Prudential Financial obtained a
$250 million loan under the five-year facility to fund short-term operating needs within Asset Management and repaid the loan in December 2012. As of December 31, 2012, there were no outstanding borrowings under either credit facility.
Prudential Financial expects that it may continue to borrow under the five-year credit facility from time to time to fund its working capital needs and those of its subsidiaries. In addition, up to $300 million of the five-year facility may be drawn
in the form of standby letters of credit that can be used to meet the Company’s operating needs.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The credit facilities contain representations and warranties, covenants and events of
default that are customary for facilities of this type; however, borrowings under the facilities are not contingent on the Company’s credit ratings nor subject to material adverse change clauses. Borrowings under the credit facilities are
conditioned on the continued satisfaction of other customary conditions, including the maintenance at all times of consolidated net worth, relating to the Company’s Financial Services Businesses only, of at least $18.985 billion, which for this
purpose is calculated as U.S. GAAP equity, excluding AOCI and excluding equity of noncontrolling interests. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the consolidated net worth of the Company’s Financial Services Businesses exceeded the minimum
amount required to borrow under the credit facilities.

In addition to the above credit facilities, the Company had access to $870 million of certain other lines of credit at December 31, 2012, of which $815 million was for the sole use of certain real
estate separate accounts. The separate account facilities include loan-to-value ratio requirements and other financial covenants and recourse on obligations under these facilities is limited to the assets of the applicable separate account. At
December 31, 2012, $10 million of these credit facilities were used. The Company also has access to uncommitted lines of credit from financial institutions.

Long-term Debt

Long-term debt at December 31 is as follows:

(1)

Includes collateralized borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York of $280 million and $725 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

(2)

The interest rates on the floating Surplus notes ranged from 0.6% to 3.8% in 2012 and 0.5% to 3.6% in 2011.

(3)

The interest rates of the USD-denominated senior notes are based on LIBOR and the U.S. Consumer Price Index. Interest rates ranged from 1.7% to 6.6% in 2012 and 1.8% to
6.6% in 2011.

(4)

In conjunction with the Company’s acquisition of the Star and Edison Businesses from AIG in 2011, the Company assumed ¥47.8 billion of long-term debt, of which
¥42.5 billion is outstanding with a carrying value of $452 million at December 31, 2012.

(5)

Includes $76 million of perpetual debt that has no stated maturity. Maturities on the remaining debt ranges from 2014 to 2026.

(6)

The interest rates of the foreign currency-denominated senior notes ranged from 0.9% to 3.1% in 2012 and 0.8% to 1.7% in 2011.

(7)

Annual scheduled repayments of principal for the Series A and Series C notes begin in 2013. Annual scheduled repayments of principal for the Series B notes begin in
2018.

(8)

The interest rate on the Series A notes is a floating rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.875% per year. The interest ranged from 1.2% to 1.4% in 2012 and 1.1% to 1.4% in
2011.

Assets under set-off arrangements represent a reduction in the amount of fixed-rate surplus notes included in long-term debt, relating to an arrangement where valid
rights of set-off exist and it is the intent of both parties to settle on a net basis under legally enforceable arrangements.

Includes Prudential Financial debt of $16,998 million and $17,300 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company was in
compliance with all debt covenants related to the borrowings in the table above.

The following table presents the Company’s contractual maturities of its long-term debt as of December 31, 2012:

Surplus Notes

As of December 31, 2012, Prudential
Insurance had $940 million of fixed-rate surplus notes outstanding. These notes are subordinated to other Prudential Insurance borrowings and policyholder obligations, and the payment of interest and principal may only be made with the prior
approval of NJDOBI. NJDOBI could prohibit the payment of the interest and principal on the surplus notes if certain statutory capital requirements are not met. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company met these statutory capital requirements.

Prudential Insurance’s fixed-rate surplus
notes include $500 million of exchangeable surplus notes issued in a private placement in 2009 with an interest rate of 5.36% per annum and due September 2019. The surplus notes are exchangeable at the option of the holder, in whole but not in
part, for shares of Prudential Financial Common Stock beginning in September 2014, or earlier upon a fundamental business combination involving Prudential Financial or a continuing payment default. The initial exchange rate for the surplus notes is
10.1235 shares of Common Stock per each $1,000 principal amount of surplus notes, which represents an initial exchange price per share of Common Stock of $98.78; however, the exchange rate is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The
exchange rate is also subject to a make-whole decrease in the event of an exchange prior to maturity (except upon a fundamental business combination or a continuing payment default), that will result in a reduction in the number of shares issued
upon exchange (per $1,000 principal amount of surplus notes) determined by dividing a prescribed cash reduction value (which will decline over the life of the surplus notes, from $102.62 for an exercise on September 18, 2014 to zero for an
exercise at maturity) by the price of the Common Stock at the time of exchange. In addition, the exchange rate is subject to a customary make-whole increase in connection with an exchange of the surplus notes upon a fundamental business combination
where 10% or more of the consideration in that business combination consists of cash, other property or securities that are not listed on a U.S. national securities exchange. These exchangeable surplus notes are not redeemable by Prudential
Insurance prior to maturity, except in connection with a fundamental business combination involving Prudential Financial, in which case the surplus notes will be redeemable by Prudential Insurance, subject to the noteholders’ right to exchange
the surplus notes instead, at par or, if greater, a make-whole redemption price.

During 2011 and 2012, a captive reinsurance subsidiary of Prudential Insurance entered into agreements providing for the issuance and sale of up to $1.5 billion of ten-year fixed-rate surplus notes. At
December 31, 2012, $1,000 million of surplus notes were outstanding under these agreements. Under the agreements, the subsidiary received debt securities, with a principal amount equal to the surplus notes issued, which are redeemable under
certain circumstances, including upon the occurrence of specified stress events affecting the subsidiary. Because valid rights of set-off exist, interest and principal payments on the surplus notes and on the debt securities are settled on a net
basis, and the surplus notes are reflected in the Company’s total consolidated borrowings on a net basis. Prudential Financial has agreed to make capital contributions to the captive

reinsurance subsidiary in order to reimburse it for investment losses in excess of specified amounts and has agreed to make payments of principal and interest on the surplus notes in certain
cases if payments are not made by the subsidiary. Surplus notes issued under this facility are subordinated to policyholder obligations, and the payment of principal on the surplus notes may only be made with prior approval of the Arizona Department
of Insurance. The payment of interest on the surplus notes has been approved by the Arizona Department, subject to its ability of the regulator to withdraw that approval.

Other captive reinsurance subsidiaries have outstanding $3.2
billion of surplus notes that were issued in 2006 through 2008 with unaffiliated institutions to finance reserves required under Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX. Prudential Financial has agreed to maintain the capital of these subsidiaries at or
above a prescribed minimum level and has entered into arrangements (which are accounted for as derivative instruments) that require it to make certain payments in the event of deterioration in the value of these surplus notes. As of
December 31, 2012 and 2011, there were no collateral postings made under these derivative instruments. These surplus notes are subordinated to policyholder obligations, and the payment of principal on the surplus notes may only be made with
prior approval of the Arizona Department of Insurance. The payment of interest on the surplus notes has been approved by the Arizona Department, subject to its ability to withdraw that approval.

Senior Notes

Medium-term notes.

Prudential
Financial maintains a Medium-term Notes, Series D program under its shelf registration statement with an authorized issuance capacity of $20 billion. As of December 31, 2012, the outstanding balance of medium-term notes under this program was
$13.2 billion, a decrease of $0.9 billion from December 31, 2011, due to $850 million of maturities.

Retail medium-term notes.

Prudential Financial also maintains a retail medium-term
notes program, including the InterNotes

®

program, under its shelf registration statement with an authorized
issuance capacity of $5.0 billion. As of December 31, 2012, the outstanding balance of retail notes was $0.9 billion. Retail notes outstanding decreased by $1.7 billion from December 31, 2011 due to $1.6 billion of redemptions by the
Company during 2012, with an average interest rate of approximately 6.1%.

Asset-backed notes.

On March 30, 2012, Prudential Insurance sold, in a Rule 144A private placement, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.997% notes with a final
maturity of September 30, 2015. The notes are secured by the assets of a trust, consisting of approximately $2.8 billion aggregate principal balance of residential mortgage-backed securities deposited into the trust by Prudential Insurance.
Payments of interest and principal on the notes will be made only to the extent of funds available to the trust in accordance with a priority of payments set forth in the indenture governing the notes. Prudential Financial guaranteed to the holders
of the notes the timely payment of all principal and interest due on the notes and any “make-whole payments” that may become due as a result of the payment of principal on the notes prior to the scheduled payment date.

Funding Agreement Notes Issuance
Program.

The Company maintains a Funding Agreement Notes Issuance Program in which a statutory trust issues medium-term notes secured by funding agreements issued to the Trust by Prudential Insurance. These obligations are
included in “Policyholders’ account balances” and not included in the foregoing table. See Notes 5 and 10 for further discussion of these obligations.

Junior Subordinated Notes

Prudential Financial’s junior subordinated notes
outstanding are considered hybrid securities that receive enhanced equity treatment from the rating agencies. Junior subordinated notes outstanding, along with their key terms, are as follows:

(1)

Represents the initial date on which the notes can be redeemed at par solely at the option of the Company, subject in the case of the 8.875% notes to compliance with
the replacement capital covenant described below.

Prudential Financial has the right to defer interest payments on these notes for specified periods, typically 5-10 years without resulting in a default, during which time interest will be compounded. On
or after the optional redemption dates, Prudential Financial may redeem the notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest. Prior to those optional redemption dates, redemptions generally are subject to a make-whole price; however, the Company may
redeem the notes prior to these dates at par upon the occurrence of certain events, such as, for the notes issued in 2012, a future change in the regulatory capital treatment of the notes with respect to the Company.

In April 2012, the Company terminated the replacement capital
covenants that were entered into in connection with the junior subordinated notes issued in 2008. In April, the Company also entered into a new replacement capital covenant with respect to the 8.875% junior subordinated notes only. This new
replacement capital covenant was entered into for the benefit of the holders of the Company’s 5.90% medium-term notes due March 2036 and requires that the Company not repay, redeem or purchase the 8.875% junior subordinated notes prior to
June 15, 2038 unless the Company has received proceeds from the sale or issuance of common stock or other qualifying securities that have certain characteristics that are at least as equity-like as the 8.875% junior subordinated notes. However,
unlike the prior covenants that the Company terminated, the terms of this new replacement capital covenant do not apply in certain instances, including (i) if Standard & Poor’s upgrades the Company’s corporate credit rating
by at least one notch above “A+” or (ii) if the Company repurchases or redeems up to 10% of the outstanding principal amount of the 8.875% junior subordinated notes in any one-year period, provided that no more than 25% of the
outstanding principal amount of the 8.875% junior subordinated notes are repurchased or redeemed in any ten-year period.

Prudential Holdings, LLC Notes

On December 18, 2001, the date of demutualization, Prudential Holdings, LLC (“PHLLC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Prudential Financial, issued $1,750 million in senior secured notes (the “IHC debt”). PHLLC owns the capital stock of Prudential Insurance and does not have any operating businesses of its own. The IHC debt represents senior secured
obligations of PHLLC with limited recourse; neither Prudential Financial, Prudential Insurance nor any other affiliate is an obligor or guarantor on the IHC debt. The IHC debt is collateralized by 13.8% of the outstanding common stock of Prudential
Insurance and other items specified in the indenture, primarily the “Debt Service Coverage Account” (the “DSCA”) discussed below.

PHLLC’s ability to meet its obligations under the IHC debt is dependent principally upon sufficient available funds being generated
by the Closed Block Business and the ability of Prudential Insurance, the sole direct subsidiary of PHLLC, to dividend such funds to PHLLC. The payment of scheduled principal and interest on the Series A notes and the Series B notes is insured by a
financial guarantee insurance policy. The payment of principal and interest on the Series C notes is not insured. The IHC debt is redeemable prior to its stated maturity at the option of PHLLC and, in the event of certain circumstances, the bond
insurer can require PHLLC to redeem the IHC debt.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Net proceeds from the IHC debt amounted to $1,727 million, of which, $1,218 million
was distributed to Prudential Financial through a dividend on the date of demutualization for use in the Financial Services Businesses. In addition, $72 million was used to purchase a guaranteed investment contract to fund a portion of the financial
guarantee insurance premium related to the IHC debt. The remainder of the net proceeds was deposited to a restricted account within PHLLC, referred to as the DSCA, and constitutes collateral for the IHC debt. The balance in the DSCA was $658 million
as of December 31, 2012.

Summarized
consolidated financial data for Prudential Holdings, LLC is presented below.

Prudential Financial is a
holding company and is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. The rights of Prudential Financial to participate in any distribution of assets of any subsidiary, including upon its liquidation or reorganization, are subject to
the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary, except to the extent that Prudential Financial may itself be a creditor of that subsidiary and its claims are recognized. PHLLC and its subsidiaries have entered into covenants and arrangements with
third parties in connection with the issuance of the IHC debt which are intended to confirm their separate, “bankruptcy-remote” status, by assuring that the assets of PHLLC and its subsidiaries are not available to creditors of Prudential
Financial or its other subsidiaries, except and to the extent that Prudential Financial and its other subsidiaries are, as shareholders or creditors of PHLLC and its subsidiaries, or would be, entitled to those assets.

At December 31, 2012, the Company was in compliance with
all IHC debt covenants.

Interest Expense

In order to modify exposure to interest rate and currency exchange rate movements, the Company utilizes
derivative instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt issues. The impact of these derivative instruments are not reflected in the rates presented in the tables above. For those derivative instruments that
qualify for hedge accounting treatment, interest expense was increased by $16 million, by $12 million, and by $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. See Note 21 for additional information on the
Company’s use of derivative instruments.

Interest expense for short-term and long-term debt was $1,389 million, $1,315 million and $1,224 million for the years ended
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. This includes interest expense of $8 million, $17 million and $39 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, reported in “Net investment income.”

15.    EQUITY

The Company has outstanding two classes
of common stock: the Common Stock and the Class B Stock. The changes in the number of shares issued, held in treasury and outstanding are as follows for the periods indicated:

(1)

Represents net shares issued from treasury pursuant to the Company’s stock-based compensation program as discussed in Note 17.

(2)

In November 2010, the Company issued 18,348,624 shares of Common Stock in a public offering at a price of $54.50 per share for net proceeds of $970 million.

Common Stock and Class B Stock

On the date of demutualization,
Prudential Financial completed an initial public offering of its Common Stock at an initial public offering price of $27.50 per share. The shares of Common Stock issued were in addition to shares of Common Stock the Company distributed to
policyholders as part of the demutualization. The Common Stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “PRU.” Also on the date of demutualization, Prudential Financial completed the sale, through a private placement, of
2.0 million shares of Class B Stock at a price of $87.50 per share. The Class B Stock is a separate class of common stock which is not publicly traded. The Common Stock reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Class
B Stock reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business.

Holders of Common Stock have no interest in a separate legal entity representing the Financial Services Businesses and holders of the Class B Stock have no interest in a separate legal entity representing
the Closed Block Business and holders of each class of common stock are subject to all of the risks associated with an investment in the Company.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, holders of
Common Stock and holders of Class B Stock would be entitled to receive a proportionate share of the net assets of the Company that remain after paying all liabilities and the liquidation preferences of any preferred stock.

Common Stock Held in Treasury

Common Stock held in treasury is accounted for at average
cost. Gains resulting from the reissuance of “Common Stock held in treasury” are credited to “Additional paid-in capital.” Losses resulting from the reissuance of “Common Stock held in treasury” are charged first to
“Additional paid-in capital” to the extent the Company has previously recorded gains on treasury share transactions, then to “Retained earnings.”

In June 2011, Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors
authorized the Company to repurchase at management’s discretion up to $1.5 billion of its outstanding Common Stock through June 2012. Under this authorization, 28.6 million shares of the Company’s Common Stock were repurchased at a
total cost of $1.5 billion, of which 8.8 million shares were repurchased in the first six months of 2012 at a total cost of $500 million.

In June 2012, Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase at management’s discretion up to
$1.0 billion of its outstanding Common Stock through June 2013. As of December 31, 2012, 2.7 million shares of the Company’s Common Stock were repurchased under this authorization at a total cost of $150 million.

The timing and amount of share repurchases are determined by
management based upon market conditions and other considerations, and repurchases may be effected in the open market, through derivative, accelerated repurchase and other negotiated transactions and through prearranged trading plans complying with
Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Exchange Act. Numerous factors could affect the timing and amount of any future repurchases under the share repurchase authorization, including increased capital needs of the Company due to opportunities for growth and
acquisitions, as well as the effect of adverse market conditions on the segments.

Stock Conversion Rights of the Class B Stock

Prudential Financial may, at its option, at any time, exchange all outstanding shares of Class B Stock into such number of shares of
Common Stock as have an aggregate average market value equal to 120% of the appraised fair market value of the outstanding shares of Class B Stock.

Holders of Class B Stock will be permitted to convert their shares of Class B Stock into such number of shares of Common Stock as have an
aggregate average market value equal to 100% of the appraised fair market value of the outstanding shares of Class B Stock (1) in the holder’s sole discretion, in the year 2016 or at any time thereafter, and (2) at any time in the
event that (a) the Class B Stock is no longer treated as equity of Prudential Financial for federal income tax purposes or (b) the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance changes the regulation of the Closed Block, the Closed Block
Business, the Class B Stock or the IHC debt in a manner that materially adversely affects the “CB Distributable Cash Flow” (described below); provided, however, that a holder of Class B Stock may not convert its shares if such holder would
become, upon such conversion, the beneficial owner (as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of over 9.9% of the total outstanding voting power of Prudential Financial’s voting securities. In the event a holder of shares of Class B
Stock requests to convert shares pursuant to clause (2)(a) in the preceding sentence, Prudential Financial may elect, instead of effecting such conversion, to increase the Target Dividend Amount from $9.625 to $12.6875 per share per annum,
retroactively from the time of issuance of the Class B Stock.

Preferred Stock

As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had no preferred stock outstanding. The Company previously maintained a shareholder
rights plan; however, the rights plan expired on December 18, 2011.

Dividends

The declaration and payment of dividends on the Common Stock
is limited by New Jersey corporate law, pursuant to which Prudential Financial cannot pay a Common Stock dividend if, after giving effect to that dividend, either (a) the Company would be unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual
course of its business or (b) the Company’s total assets would be less than its liabilities. This limitation is applied both as if the Financial Services Businesses were a separate corporation and on a consolidated basis after taking into
account dividends on the Class B Stock. In addition, the terms of the Company’s outstanding junior subordinated debt include a “dividend stopper” provision that restricts the payment of dividends on the Common Stock and Class B Stock
if interest payments are not made on the junior subordinated debt. The terms of the Class B Stock also restrict dividends on the Common Stock in certain circumstances as described below.

Notwithstanding the above limitations, dividends on the Common Stock will primarily depend upon the financial
condition, results of operations, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors relating to the Financial Services Businesses, including cash available to Prudential Financial, the parent holding company. The principal sources of funds
available to Prudential Financial are dividends and returns of capital from its subsidiaries, repayments of operating loans from its subsidiaries and cash and short-term investments. The primary uses of funds at Prudential Financial include
servicing its debt, operating expenses, capital contributions and loans to subsidiaries, the payment of declared shareholder dividends and repurchases of outstanding shares of Common Stock if executed under Board authority. As of December 31,
2012, Prudential Financial had cash and short term investments, excluding amounts held in an intercompany liquidity account, of $5,427 million.

The majority of the Company’s subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive regulation, including limitations on their payment of
dividends and other transfers of funds to Prudential Financial.

With respect to Prudential Insurance, the Company’s primary domestic insurance subsidiary, New Jersey insurance law provides that, except in the case of extraordinary dividends (as described below),
all dividends or other distributions paid by Prudential Insurance may be paid only from unassigned surplus, as determined pursuant to statutory accounting principles, less cumulative unrealized investment gains and losses and revaluation of assets
as of the prior calendar year-end. As of December 31, 2012, Prudential Insurance’s unassigned surplus was $5,668 million, and it recorded applicable adjustments for cumulative unrealized investment gains of $2,669 million. Prudential
Insurance must give prior notification to the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (the “Department”) of its intent to pay any such dividend or distribution. Also, if any dividend, together with other dividends or distributions
made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (i) 10% of Prudential Insurance’s statutory surplus as of the preceding December 31 ($870 million as of December 31, 2012) or (ii) its statutory net gain from
operations excluding realized investment gains and losses for the twelve-month period ending on the preceding December 31 ($893 million for the year ended December 31, 2012), the dividend is considered to be an “extraordinary
dividend” and requires the prior approval of the Department. Under New Jersey insurance law, Prudential Insurance is permitted to pay a dividend of $893 million in 2013 without prior approval of the Department.

The laws regulating dividends of the states where the
Company’s other domestic insurance subsidiaries are domiciled are similar, but not identical, to New Jersey’s. Prudential Annuities Life Assurance Corporation (“PALAC”), another domestic insurance subsidiary of Prudential
Financial that is domiciled in Connecticut, is permitted to pay a dividend of $41 million in 2013 with prior notification to the Connecticut Department of Insurance.

The Company’s international insurance operations are
subject to dividend restrictions from the regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. With respect to The Prudential Life Insurance Company Ltd. (“Prudential of Japan”) and Gibraltar Life, the Company’s most
significant international insurance subsidiaries, both of which are domiciled in Japan, Japan insurance law provides that common stock dividends may be paid in an amount of up to 83% of prior fiscal year statutory after-tax earnings, after certain
reserving thresholds are met, including providing for policyholder dividends. If statutory retained earnings exceed 100% of



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

statutory paid-in-capital, 100% of prior year statutory after-tax earnings may be paid, after reserving thresholds are met. Dividends in excess of these amounts and other forms of capital
distribution require the prior approval of the Japan Financial Services Agency (“FSA”). Additionally, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar Life must give prior notification to the FSA of their intent to pay any dividend or distribution. In
2012, Prudential of Japan paid a dividend of ¥18.4 billion, or $224 million, which was ultimately paid to Prudential Financial. Prudential of Japan has met the statutory retained earnings level necessary to dividend up to 100% of prior year
statutory after-tax earnings. Prudential of Japan’s and Gibraltar Life’s current regulatory fiscal year will end March 31, 2013, at which time the common stock dividend amount permitted to be paid without prior approval from the FSA
will be determinable. Although Gibraltar Life may be able to pay common stock dividends under applicable legal and regulatory restrictions, Gibraltar Life does not anticipate paying common stock dividends for several years as it anticipates
returning capital through other means, such as the repayment of subordinated debt or preferred stock obligations held by Prudential Financial or affiliates. The prior approval of the FSA is required for such capital distributions.

Additionally, although prior regulatory approval may not be
required by law for the payment of dividends up to the limitations described above, in practice, the Company would typically discuss any dividend payments with the applicable regulatory authority prior to payment. Additionally, the payment of
dividends by the Company’s subsidiaries is subject to declaration by their Board of Directors and may be affected by market conditions and other factors.

The declaration and payment of dividends on the Class B Stock depends upon the financial performance of the Closed Block Business and, as
the Closed Block matures, the holders of the Class B Stock will receive the surplus of the Closed Block Business no longer required to support the Closed Block for regulatory purposes. In addition, dividends on the Class B Stock are payable in an
aggregate amount per year at least equal to the lesser of (1) a Target Dividend Amount of $19.25 million or (2) the “CB Distributable Cash Flow” for such year, which is a measure of the net cash flows of the Closed Block
Business. Notwithstanding this formula, as with any common stock, Prudential Financial retains the flexibility to suspend dividends on the Class B Stock; however, if CB Distributable Cash Flow exists and Prudential Financial chooses not to pay
dividends on the Class B Stock in an aggregate amount at least equal to the lesser of the CB Distributable Cash Flow or the Target Dividend Amount for any period, then cash dividends cannot be paid on the Common Stock with respect to such period.

Statutory Net Income, Capital and Surplus

The Company’s domestic insurance
subsidiaries are required to prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the state of domicile. These subsidiaries do not utilize prescribed or
permitted practices that vary materially from the statutory accounting practices prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”). Statutory accounting practices primarily differ from U.S. GAAP by charging policy
acquisition costs to expense as incurred, establishing future policy benefit liabilities using different actuarial assumptions as well as valuing investments and certain assets and accounting for deferred taxes on a different basis. Statutory net
income (loss) of Prudential Insurance amounted to $1,382 million, $826 million and $1,623 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Statutory capital and surplus of Prudential Insurance amounted to $8,699
million and $8,160 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Statutory net income (loss) of PALAC amounted to $217 million, $177 million and $348 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Statutory capital and surplus of PALAC amounted to $448 million and $672 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

The Risk Based Capital (“RBC”) ratio is a primary measure by which the Company and its insurance regulators evaluate the capital
adequacy of Prudential Insurance and the Company’s other domestic insurance subsidiaries. The RBC ratio for Prudential Insurance includes both the Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business. RBC is determined by
NAIC—prescribed formulas that consider, among other things, risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets, insurance-related risks associated with an insurer’s products and liabilities, interest rate risks and general
business risks. If a subsidiary’s Total Adjusted Capital (“TAC”), as



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

calculated in a manner prescribed by the NAIC, falls below the “Company Action Level” RBC of 100%, corrective action is required.

The Company’s international insurance subsidiaries
prepare financial statements in accordance with local regulatory requirements, and they do not utilize regulatory accounting practices that vary materially from the applicable prescribed regulatory accounting practices. These statutory accounting
practices differ from U.S. GAAP primarily by charging policy acquisition costs to expense as incurred and establishing future policy benefit liabilities using different actuarial assumptions, as well as valuing investments and certain assets and
accounting for deferred taxes on a different basis.

The FSA utilizes a solvency margin ratio to evaluate the capital adequacy of Japanese insurance companies. The solvency margin ratio
considers the level of solvency margin capital to a solvency margin risk amount, which is calculated in a similar manner to RBC. If a subsidiary’s solvency margin ratio falls below 200%, the FSA is authorized to take control of that entity.

All of the Company’s domestic and
international insurance subsidiaries have capital and surplus levels that exceed their respective regulatory minimum requirements.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

The balance of and changes in each component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) attributable to Prudential Financial,
Inc.” for the years ended December 31, are as follows (net of taxes):

(1)

Includes cash flow hedges. See Note 21 for information on cash flow hedges. See Note 4 for additional information regarding unrealized investment gains (losses),
including the split between amounts related to fixed maturity securities on which an other-than-temporary impairment loss has been recognized, and all other unrealized investment gains (losses).

(2)

See Note 2 for additional information on changes in accounting for deferred acquisition costs and pension plans.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

16.    EARNINGS PER SHARE

The Company has outstanding two separate
classes of common stock. The Common Stock reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Class B Stock reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business. Accordingly, earnings per share is calculated separately for each of
these two classes of common stock.

Net income for
the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business is determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes general and administrative expenses charged to each of the respective businesses based on the Company’s methodology for the
allocation of such expenses. Cash flows between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business related to administrative expenses are determined by a policy servicing fee arrangement that is based upon insurance and policies in
force and statutory cash premiums. To the extent reported administrative expenses vary from these cash flow amounts, the differences are recorded, on an after tax basis, as direct equity adjustments to the equity balances of the businesses.

The direct equity adjustments modify the earnings
available to each of the classes of common stock for earnings per share purposes.

Common Stock

A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted per share computations for the years ended December 31, is as follows:



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are
participating securities and included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Under this method, earnings of the Financial Services Businesses attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. are allocated between Common
Stock and the participating awards, as if the awards were a second class of stock. Undistributed earnings allocated to participating unvested share-based payment awards for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was based on
4.6 million, 6.5 million and 6.1 million of such awards, respectively, weighted for the period they were outstanding. The computation of earnings per share of Common Stock excludes the dilutive impact of participating unvested
share-based awards based on the application of the two-class method.

For the years ended December 31, the number of options, weighted for the portion of the period they were outstanding, that were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the
options, based on application of the treasury stock method, were antidilutive, are as follows:

In September 2009, the
Company issued $500 million of surplus notes with an interest rate of 5.36% per annum which are exchangeable at the option of the note holders for shares of Common Stock. The exchange rate used in the diluted earnings per share calculation for
the surplus notes is 10.1235 shares of Common Stock per each $1,000 principal amount of surplus notes. In calculating diluted earnings per share under the if-converted method, the potential shares that would be issued assuming a hypothetical
exchange, weighted for the period the notes are outstanding, is added to the denominator, and interest expense, net of tax, is added to the numerator, if the overall effect is dilutive. See Note 14 for additional information regarding the
exchangeable surplus notes.

Class B Stock

Income from continuing operations per
share of Class B Stock for the years ended December 31, are presented below. There are no potentially dilutive shares associated with the Class B Stock.

17.    SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS

Omnibus Incentive Plan

In March 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted
the Prudential Financial, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (as subsequently amended and restated, the “Omnibus Plan”). Upon adoption of the Omnibus Plan, the Prudential Financial, Inc. Stock Option Plan previously adopted by the Company on
January 9, 2001 (the “Option Plan”) was merged into the Omnibus Plan. The nature of stock based awards provided under the Omnibus Plan are stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock shares, restricted stock units,
stock settled performance shares, and cash settled performance units. Dividend equivalents are generally provided on restricted stock shares and restricted stock units outstanding as of the record date. Dividend equivalents are generally accrued on
target performance shares and units outstanding as of the record date. These dividend equivalents are paid only on the shares and units released up to a maximum of the target number of shares and units awarded. Generally, the requisite service
period is the vesting period.

As of
December 31, 2012, 18,785,951 authorized shares remain available for grant under the Omnibus Plan including previously authorized but unissued shares under the Option Plan.

Compensation Costs

Compensation cost for employee stock options is based on the
fair values estimated on the grant date, using the approach and assumptions described below. Compensation cost for restricted stock units, performance shares and performance units granted to employees is measured by the share price of the underlying
Common Stock at the date of grant.

The fair value
of each stock option award is estimated using a binomial option-pricing model on the date of grant for stock options issued to employees. The weighted average grant date assumptions used in the binomial option valuation model are as follows:

Expected volatilities are
based on historical volatility of the Company’s Common Stock and implied volatilities from traded options on the Company’s Common Stock. The Company uses historical data and expectations of future exercise patterns to estimate option
exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods associated with the expected term
of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

The following chart summarizes the compensation cost recognized and the related income tax benefit for stock options, restricted stock units, performance shares and performance units for the years ended
December 31:



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Compensation costs for all stock based compensation plans capitalized in deferred
acquisition costs for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were de minimis.

Stock Options

Each stock option granted has an exercise price no less than the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant and has a maximum term of 10 years. Generally, one third of the
option grant vests in each of the first three years.

A summary of the status of the Company’s stock option grants is as follows:

The weighted average grant
date fair value of employee stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $16.36, $20.21, and $18.00, respectively.

The total intrinsic value (i.e., market price of the stock less the option exercise price) of employee stock options exercised during the
years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $66 million, $49 million, and $35 million, respectively.

The weighted average remaining contractual term and the aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding, vested and expected to
vest and exercisable as of December 31, 2012 is as follows:

Restricted Stock Units,
Performance Share Awards and Performance Unit Awards

A restricted stock unit is an unfunded, unsecured right to receive a share of Common Stock at the end of a specified period of time, which is subject to forfeiture and transfer restrictions. Generally,
the restrictions will lapse on the third anniversary of the date of grant. Performance shares and performance units are awards



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

denominated in Common Stock. The number of units is determined over the performance period, and may be adjusted based on the satisfaction of certain performance goals. Performance share awards
are payable in Common Stock. Performance unit awards are payable in cash.

A summary of the Company’s restricted stock units and performance shares and performance unit awards is as follows:

(1)

Performance share and performance unit awards reflect the target awarded, reduced for cancellations and releases to date. The actual number of units to be awarded at
the end of each performance period will range between 0% and 150% of the target number of awards granted, based upon a measure of the reported performance for the Company’s Financial Services Businesses relative to stated goals.

(2)

Represents the change in shares issued based upon the attainment of performance goals for the Company’s Financial Services Businesses. No performance shares or
performance unit awards were released in 2012 as no performance shares or performance units were granted in 2009.

(3)

For performance share and performance unit awards issued after January 1, 2010, the grant date is the same as the date the grant vests. The features of the grant
are such that a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of the award between the employee and employer have not been reached until the grant is vested. Consequently, the weighted average grant date fair value as of December 31,
2012 and December 31, 2011 is the year end closing stock price of Prudential Financial’s common stock.

The fair market value of restricted stock units and performance shares released for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010
was $196 million, $75 million and $56 million, respectively.

The weighted average grant date fair value for restricted stock units granted during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $58.89, $63.39 and $48.56, respectively. The weighted average
grant date fair value for performance shares and performance units granted during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $53.33, $50.12 and $58.71, respectively.

The number of restricted stock units, performance shares and
performance units expected to vest at December 31, 2012 is 4,993,644.

Unrecognized Compensation Cost

Unrecognized compensation cost for stock options as of December 31, 2012 was $18 million with a weighted average recognition period of 1.66 years. Unrecognized compensation cost for restricted stock
units, performance shares and performance units as of December 31, 2012 was $77 million with a weighted average recognition period of 1.74 years.

Tax Benefits Realized

The tax benefit realized for exercises of stock options during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $21 million, $18
million and $14 million, respectively.

The tax
benefit realized upon vesting of restricted stock units and performance shares for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $69 million, $26 million and $18 million, respectively.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Stock Purchase Plan

At the Annual Meeting of the Shareholders of the Company
held on June 7, 2005, the shareholders approved the Prudential Financial, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The plan is a qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan under Section 423 of the Code. Under the plan, eligible participants may
purchase shares based upon quarterly offering periods at an amount equal to the lesser of (1) 85% of the closing market price of the Common Stock on the first day of the quarterly offering period, or (2) 85% of the closing market price of
the Common Stock on the last day of the quarterly offering period. Participant contributions will be limited to the lower of 10% of eligible earnings or $25,000.

Compensation cost is recognized for each three-month offering
period and is based on grant date fair value. The fair value is estimated using the 15% discount off of the grant date share price, plus the value of three month call and put options on shares at the grant date share price, less the value of forgone
interest. Compensation costs recognized for employees under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $13 million, $12 million and $12 million, respectively. The weighted average
grant date fair value for employee shares recognized in compensation cost for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $11.10, $12.87, and $13.06, respectively.

Tax benefits are only recorded in the event of a
disqualifying disposition. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, tax benefits realized upon disqualifying dispositions were de minimis.

During the year ended December 31, 2012, 1,362,896 shares were purchased under the plan, including those shares purchased in January
2012 related to the October 1 to December 31, 2011 offering period. During the year ended December 31, 2011, 1,117,395 shares were purchased under the plan, including those shares purchased in January 2011 related to the
October 1 to December 31, 2010 offering period. During the year ended December 31, 2010, 1,092,676 shares were purchased under the plan, including those shares purchased in January 2010 related to October 1 to December 31
2009 offering period. As of December 31, 2012, 19,148,813 authorized shares remain available for future issuance under the plan.

Settlement of Awards

The Company’s policy is to issue shares from Common Stock held in treasury upon exercise of stock options, the release of restricted
stock units and performance shares, as well as for purchases under the stock purchase plan. The Company has not settled any equity instruments granted under share-based payment arrangements in cash. Performance units will be settled in cash
beginning in 2013.

18.    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

The Company has funded and non-funded
non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, which cover substantially all of its employees. For some employees, benefits are based on final average earnings and length of service, while benefits for other employees are based on an account
balance that takes into consideration age, service and earnings during their career.

The Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for its retired employees, their beneficiaries and covered dependents (“other postretirement benefits”). The health care plan
is contributory; the life insurance plan is non-contributory. Substantially all of the Company’s U.S. employees may become eligible to receive other postretirement benefits if they retire after age 55 with at least 10 years of service or
under certain circumstances after age 50 with at least 20 years of continuous service. The Company has elected to amortize its transition obligation for other postretirement benefits over 20 years.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Effective December 2012, the Company adopted retrospectively a change in method of
applying an accounting principle for the Company’s pension plans. The new accounting method changes the calculation of market related value of pension plan assets used to determine net periodic benefit cost but has no impact on the funded
status of the plans. The Company previously calculated market related value for pensions by recognizing changes in fair value of plan assets over a period of five years on all classes of assets (U.S Equities, International Equities, Fixed Maturities
(including short term investments) Real Estate and Other). As a result of the change in accounting method the Company will no longer recognize changes in fair value of fixed maturity assets over a period of five years. Instead, changes in fair value
for fixed maturity assets, including short term investments, will be recognized immediately for purposes of the market-related value. However, the Company will continue to recognize changes in fair value of all other classes of its plan assets
including U.S. Equities, International Equities, Real Estate and Other Assets over a five year period.

The Company’s investment philosophy for pension plan assets uses a cash flow matching approach relative to the pension plan’s
Projected Benefit Obligation (“PBO”). Under the matching approach cash flows from fixed maturity investments (including short term investments) are expected to match cash flows used to pay the plans’ benefits, in both amount and
timing. Immediately recognizing changes in fair value for fixed maturity investments better aligns the value of these assets for purpose of calculating net periodic benefit cost under the new accounting method with this investment philosophy as well
as with the recognition of changes in the PBO in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost.

The Company views the periodic benefit cost determined under the new method of accounting as providing improved transparency and better reflecting the ongoing economics of the plans, which is why the
Company considers it a preferable method of calculating net periodic benefit cost. All of the other asset classes of plan assets including US Equities, International Equities, Real Estate and Other Assets will continue to be recognized over five
years to reduce the volatility in the unrecognized gains and losses of these investments. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies and Pronouncements, for the impact of the change on amounts previously reported for 2011 and 2010.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

with respect to certain non-qualified retirement plans ($998 million and $834 million benefit obligation at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively). Assets held in the rabbi trust are
available to the general creditors of the Company in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy. The Company may from time to time in its discretion make contributions to the trust to fund accrued benefits payable to participants in one or more of the
plans, and, in the case of a change in control of the Company, as defined in the trust agreement, the Company will be required to make contributions to the trust to fund the accrued benefits, vested and unvested, payable on a pretax basis to
participants in the plans. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the assets in the trust had a carrying value of $445 million and $404 million, respectively.

The Company also maintains a separate rabbi trust for the purpose of holding assets of the Company to be used to satisfy its obligations
with respect to certain other non-qualified retirement plans ($80 million and $78 million benefit obligation at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively), as well as certain cash-based deferred compensation arrangements. As of December 31,
2012 and 2011, the assets in the trust had a carrying value of $135 million and $134 million, respectively.

Pension benefits for foreign plans comprised 16% and 19% of the ending benefit obligation for 2012 and 2011, respectively. Foreign pension
plans comprised 5% and 3% of the ending fair value of plan assets for 2012 and 2011. There are no material foreign postretirement plans.

Information for pension plans with a projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets

Information for pension
plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets

In 2012 the pension plans
purchased annuity contracts from Prudential Insurance for $1 million. There were no purchases of annuity contracts in 2011 from Prudential Insurance. The approximate future annual benefit payment payable by Prudential Insurance for all annuity
contracts was $18 million and $18 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

There were pension plan amendments in 2012 and 2011. In 2012 the benefit obligation for pension benefits decreased $62 million to reduce future pension benefits associated with the cash balance feature of
certain domestic plans and changes in benefit structures for Japanese plans. In 2011 the benefit obligation for pension benefits decreased by $72 million for changes in benefit structures for certain Japanese plans. There were no postretirement plan
amendments in 2012 and 2011.

Components of Net Periodic Benefit Cost

Net periodic (benefit) cost included in “General and
administrative expenses” in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, includes the following components:

(1)

Includes net periodic (benefit) cost for pensions of $0 million, ($18) million and ($4) million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, that have been classified as
discontinued operations.

(3)

Certain employees were provided special termination benefits under non-qualified plans in the form of unreduced early retirement benefits as a result of their
involuntary termination.

Changes in
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

The amounts recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” as of the end of the period, which have not yet been
recognized as a component of net periodic (benefit) cost, and the related changes in these items during the period that are recognized in “Other Comprehensive Income” are as follows:



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The amounts included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)”
expected to be recognized as components of net periodic (benefit) cost in 2013 are as follows:

The Company’s
assumptions related to the calculation of the domestic benefit obligation (end of period) and the determination of net periodic (benefit) cost (beginning of period) are presented in the table below:

The domestic discount rate
used to value the pension and postretirement obligations at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 is based upon the value of a portfolio of Aa investments whose cash flows would be available to pay the benefit obligation’s cash
flows when due. The portfolio is selected from a compilation of approximately 670 Aa-rated bonds across the full range of maturities. Since yields can vary widely at each maturity point, the Company generally avoids using the highest and lowest
yielding bonds at the maturity points, so as to avoid relying on bonds that might be mispriced or misrated. This refinement process generally results in having a distribution from the 10th to 90th percentile. The Aa portfolio is then selected and,
accordingly, its value is a measure of the benefit obligation at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. A single equivalent discount rate is calculated to equate the value of the Aa portfolio to the cash flows for the benefit obligation.
The result is rounded to the nearest 5 basis points and the benefit obligation is recalculated using the rounded discount rate.

The pension and postretirement expected long-term rates of return on plan assets for 2012 were determined based upon an approach that
considered an expectation of the allocation of plan assets during the measurement period of 2012. Expected returns are estimated by asset class as noted in the discussion of investment policies and strategies below. Expected returns on asset classes
are developed using a building-block approach that is forward looking and are not strictly based upon historical returns. The building blocks for equity returns include inflation, real return, a term premium, an equity risk premium, capital
appreciation, effect of active management, expenses and the effect of rebalancing. The building blocks for fixed maturity returns include inflation, real return, a term premium, credit spread, capital appreciation, effect of active management,
expenses and the effect of rebalancing.

The
Company applied the same approach to the determination of the expected rate of return on plan assets in 2013. The expected rate of return for 2013 is 6.25% and 7.00% for pension and postretirement, respectively.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The assumptions for foreign pension plans are based on local markets. There are no
material foreign postretirement plans.

Assumed
health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plan. A one-percentage point increase and decrease in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

Plan Assets

The investment goal of the domestic pension plan assets is
to generate an above benchmark return on a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds and other investments. The cash requirements of the pension obligation, which include a traditional formula principally representing payments to annuitants and a cash
balance formula that allows lump sum payments and annuity payments, are designed to be met by the bonds and short term investments in the portfolio. The pension plan risk management practices include guidelines for asset concentration, credit rating
and liquidity. The pension plan does not invest in leveraged derivatives. Derivatives such as futures contracts are used to reduce transaction costs and change asset concentration, while interest rate swaps and futures are used to adjust duration.

The investment goal of the domestic
postretirement plan assets is to generate an above benchmark return on a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other investments, while meeting the cash requirements for the postretirement obligation that includes a medical benefit including
prescription drugs, a dental benefit, and a life benefit. The postretirement plans risk management practices include guidelines for asset concentration, credit rating, liquidity, and tax efficiency. The postretirement plan does not invest in
leveraged derivatives. Derivatives such as futures contracts are used to reduce transaction costs and change asset concentration, while interest rate swaps and futures are used to adjust duration.

The plan fiduciaries for the Company’s pension and
postretirement plans have developed guidelines for asset allocations reflecting a percentage of total assets by asset class, which are reviewed on an annual basis. Asset allocation targets as of December 31, 2012 are as follows:

To implement the investment
strategy, plan assets are invested in funds that primarily invest in securities that correspond to one of the asset categories under the investment guidelines. However, at any point in time, some of the assets in a fund may be of a different nature
than the specified asset category.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Assets held with Prudential Insurance are in either pooled separate accounts or single
client separate accounts. Pooled separate accounts hold assets for multiple investors. Each investor owns a “unit of account.” Single client separate accounts hold assets for only one investor, the domestic qualified pension plan and each
security in the fund is treated as individually owned. Assets held with a bank are either in common/collective trusts or single client trusts. Common or collective trusts hold assets for more than one investor. Each investor owns a “unit of
account.” Single client trusts hold assets for only one investor, the domestic qualified pension plan and each security in the fund is treated as individually owned.

There were no investments in Prudential Financial Common
Stock as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 for either the pension or postretirement plans. Pension plan assets of $9,239 million and $8,262 million are included in the Company’s separate account assets and liabilities as of
December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.

The authoritative guidance around fair value established a framework for measuring fair value. Fair value is disclosed using a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used
to measure fair value, as described in Note 20.

The following describes the valuation methodologies used for pension and postretirement plans assets measured at fair value.

Insurance Company Pooled Separate Accounts, Common or
Collective Trusts, and United Kingdom Insurance Pooled Funds

—Insurance company pooled separate accounts are invested via group annuity contracts issued by Prudential Insurance. Assets are represented by a “unit of account.” The
redemption value of those units is based on a per unit value whose value is the result of the accumulated values of underlying investments. The underlying investments are valued in accordance with the corresponding valuation method for the
investments held.

Equities—

See Note
20 for a discussion of the valuation methodologies for equity securities.

U.S. Government Securities (both Federal and State & Other), Non–U.S. Government Securities

, and Corporate Debt—See Note 20 for a discussion of the valuation methodologies for
fixed maturity securities.

Interest Rate
Swaps

—See Note 20 for a discussion of the valuation methodologies for derivative instruments.

Guaranteed Investment Contract—

The value is based on contract cash flows and available market rates for similar investments.

Registered Investment Companies (Mutual
Funds)

—Securities are priced at the net asset value (“NAV”) of shares.

Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investment of Securities Lending Collateral—

This value is the contractual position relative to the investment of securities lending collateral.

Real Estate—

The values are determined through an
independent appraisal process. The estimate of fair value is based on three approaches; (1) current cost of reproducing the property less deterioration and functional/economic obsolescence; (2) discounting a series of income streams and
reversion at a specific yield or by directly capitalizing a single year income estimate by an appropriate factor; and (3) value indicated by recent sales of comparable properties in the market. Each approach requires the exercise of subjective
judgment.

Short-term
Investments—

Securities are valued initially at cost and thereafter adjusted for amortization of any discount or premium (i.e., amortized cost). Amortized cost approximates fair value.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Partnerships—

The value of interests owned in partnerships is based on
valuations of the underlying investments that include private placements, structured debt, real estate, equities, fixed maturities, commodities and other investments.

Structured Debt (Gateway Recovery Trust)—

The
value is based primarily on unobservable inputs including probability weighted cash flows and reinvestment yield assumptions.

Hedge Funds—

The value of interests in hedge funds is based on the underlying investments that include equities, debt and other
investments.

Variable Life Insurance
Policies—

These assets are held in group and individual variable life insurance policies issued by Prudential Insurance. Group policies are invested in Insurance Company Pooled Separate Accounts. Individual policies are invested in
Registered Investment Companies (Mutual Funds). The value of interest in these policies is the cash surrender value of the policies based on the underlying investments.

19.    INCOME TAXES

The components of income tax expense
(benefit) for the years ended December 31, were as follows:

As of December 31, 2012,
Congress failed to extend a number of tax provisions that expired at the end of 2011. One such provision provides tax deferral for investment income earned by a foreign insurance operation until the income is repatriated to the U.S. On
January 2, 2013, the expired tax provision for such investment income was retroactively reinstated. For 2012, as a result of the expiration of this provision, the total income tax expense on continuing operations before equity in earnings of
operating joint ventures and the total income tax expense related to other comprehensive income include income tax expense equal to $2 million and $58 million, respectively. In the quarter ended March 31, 2013, total income tax expense on
continuing operations before equity in earnings of operating joint ventures will include a tax benefit equal to $60 million to reflect the retroactive reinstatement of the tax provision.

The Company’s income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of
operating joint ventures includes income (loss) from domestic and foreign operations, for the years ended December 31, as follows:



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The Company’s actual income tax expense on continuing operations before equity in
earnings of operating joint ventures for the years ended December 31, differs from the expected amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% to income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in
earnings of operating joint ventures for the following reasons:

Total income tax expense
includes additional tax expense related to the realization of deferred tax assets recorded in the Statement of Financial Position as of the acquisition date for Prudential Gibraltar Financial Life Insurance Company, Ltd. (“PGFL”) and the
Star and Edison Businesses. The balance of additional U.S. GAAP tax expense to be recognized in the future related to the utilization of opening balance sheet deferred tax assets is as follows:

On January 1, 2012, the
Star and Edison Businesses merged into Gibraltar Life Insurance Company, Ltd. The majority of additional U.S. tax expense recognized in 2012 is a result of the merger. The annual amount of additional tax expense related to the realization of opening
balance sheet deferred tax assets will be significantly lower in the future.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, resulted from the items listed
in the following table:

The application of U.S. GAAP
requires the Company to evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if necessary to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not expected to be realized. Considerable judgment is
required in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, and if so, the amount of such valuation allowance. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance the Company considers many factors, including: (1) the nature of the
deferred tax assets and liabilities; (2) whether they are ordinary or capital; (3) in which tax jurisdictions they were generated and the timing of their reversal; (4) taxable income in prior carryback years as well as projected
taxable earnings exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards; (5) the length of time that carryovers can be utilized in the various taxing jurisdictions; (6) any unique tax rules that would impact the utilization of the
deferred tax assets; and (7) any tax planning strategies that the Company would employ to avoid a tax benefit from expiring unused. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax
assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.

A valuation allowance has been recorded related to tax benefits associated with state and local and foreign deferred tax assets. Adjustments to the valuation allowance are made to reflect changes in
management’s assessment of the amount of the deferred tax asset that is realizable. The valuation allowance includes amounts recorded in connection with deferred tax assets at December 31, as follows:

The following table sets
forth the federal, state and foreign operating and capital loss carryforwards for tax purposes, at December 31:

The Company provides for U.S. income taxes on unremitted foreign earnings of its operations in Japan, and
certain operations in India, Germany, and Taiwan. In addition, beginning in 2012, the Company provides for U.S. income taxes on a portion of current year foreign earnings for its insurance operations in Korea. Unremitted foreign earnings from
operations in other foreign jurisdictions are considered to be permanently reinvested. During 2010, the Company made no material changes with respect to its repatriation assumptions. In 2011 the Company sold various foreign entities that were a part
of the global commodities group and the relocation business. Consequently, their earnings were no longer considered permanently reinvested and the Company recognized an income tax expense of $6 million related to the sale of global commodities group
in “Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes” and income tax benefit of $11 million related to the sale of the relocation business. Except for the change in repatriation assumption with respect to a portion of current year foreign
earnings for insurance operations in Korea, the Company made no material changes with respect to its repatriation assumptions during 2012.

The following table sets forth the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, where the Company assumes permanent reinvestment, for
which U.S. deferred taxes have not been provided, as of the periods indicated. Determining the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were remitted is not practicable.

extended. The Federal statute of limitations for the 2007 through 2008 tax years will expire in December 2013, unless extended. Tax years 2009 through 2011 are still open for IRS examination.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

During 2004 through 2006, the Company entered into two transactions that involved, among
other things, the payment of foreign income taxes that were credited against the Company’s U.S. tax liability. On May 23, 2011, the IRS issued notices of proposed adjustments disallowing the foreign tax credits claimed and related
transaction expenses. The total amount of the proposed adjustments for the transactions was approximately $200 million of tax and penalties. During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company reached agreement with the IRS on the resolution of the
proposed foreign tax credits disallowance. The impact to the 2011 results attributable to the settlement was an increase to tax expense of approximately $93 million. The settlement of the foreign tax credit transactions for 2004 through 2006 marked
the conclusion of the IRS audits for those years. As a result, all unrecognized tax positions plus interest relating to tax years prior to 2007 were recognized in 2011. As such, 2011 benefited from a reduction to the liability for unrecognized tax
benefits of $70 million, including the impact from the foreign tax credit disallowance.

The Company does not anticipate any significant changes within the next 12 months to its total unrecognized tax benefits related to tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired.

The dividends received deduction
(“DRD”) reduces the amount of dividend income subject to U.S. tax and is the primary component of the non-taxable investment income shown in the table above, and, as such, is a significant component of the difference between the
Company’s effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate of 35%. The DRD for the current period was estimated using information from 2011, current year results, and was adjusted to take into account the current year’s equity market
performance. The actual current year DRD can vary from the estimate based on factors such as, but not limited to, changes in the amount of dividends received that are eligible for the DRD, changes in the amount of distributions received from mutual
fund investments, changes in the account balances of variable life and annuity contracts, and the Company’s taxable income before the DRD.

In August 2007, the IRS released Revenue Ruling 2007-54, which included, among other items, guidance on the methodology to be followed in
calculating the DRD related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts. In September 2007, the IRS released Revenue Ruling 2007-61. Revenue Ruling 2007-61 suspended Revenue Ruling 2007-54 and informed taxpayers that the U.S. Treasury
Department and the IRS intend to address through new guidance the issues considered in Revenue Ruling 2007-54, including the methodology to be followed in determining the DRD related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts. In May 2010, the
IRS issued an Industry Director Directive (“IDD”) confirming that the methodology for calculating the DRD set forth in Revenue Ruling 2007-54 should not be followed. The IDD also confirmed that the IRS guidance issued before Revenue Ruling
2007-54, which guidance the Company relied upon in calculating its DRD, should be used to determine the DRD. For the last several years, the revenue proposals included in the Obama Administration’s budgets included a proposal that would change
the method used to determine the amount of the DRD. A change in the DRD, including the possible retroactive or prospective elimination of this deduction through guidance or legislation, could increase actual tax expense and reduce the Company’s
consolidated net income. These activities had no impact on the Company’s 2010, 2011 or 2012 results.

For tax years 2007 through 2012, the Company is participating in the IRS’s Compliance Assurance Program (“CAP”). Under CAP,
the IRS assigns an examination team to review completed transactions contemporaneously during these tax years in order to reach agreement with the Company on how they should be reported in the tax returns. If disagreements arise, accelerated
resolutions programs are available to resolve the disagreements in a timely manner before the tax returns are filed. It is management’s expectation this program will shorten the time period between the filing of the Company’s federal
income tax returns and the IRS’s completion of its examination of the returns.

The Company’s affiliates in Japan file separate tax returns and are subject to audits by the local taxing authority. The general statute of limitations is five years from when the return is filed.
During 2011, the Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau concluded a routine tax audit of the tax returns of Edison Life Insurance Company Ltd. for its tax years ended March 31, 2009 to March 31, 2010. These activities had no material impact on the
Company’s 2010, 2011 or 2012 results.

The Company’s affiliates in South Korea file separate tax returns and are subject
to audits by the local taxing authority. The general statute of limitations is five years from when the return is filed. During 2010, South Korea’s National Tax Service concluded a general tax audit of POK’s tax years ended March 31,
2006 to March 31, 2010. These activities had no material impact on the Company’s 2010, 2011 or 2012 results.

On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was modified by the Health
Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 signed into law on March 30, 2010, (together, the “Healthcare Act”). The federal government provides a subsidy to companies that provide certain retiree prescription drug benefits (the
“Medicare Part D subsidy”), including the Company. The Medicare Part D subsidy was previously provided tax-free. However, as currently adopted, the Healthcare Act includes a provision that would reduce the tax deductibility of retiree
health care costs to the extent of any Medicare Part D subsidy received. In effect, this provision of the Healthcare Act makes the Medicare Part D subsidy taxable beginning in 2013. Therefore, the Company incurred a charge in 2010 for the reduction
of deferred tax assets of $94 million, which reduces net income and is reflected in “Income tax expense (benefit).”

20.    FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

Fair Value Measurement

—Fair
value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The authoritative fair value guidance establishes a framework for
measuring fair value that includes a hierarchy used to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

Level 1—Fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible to the Company for identical assets or liabilities. The Company’s Level 1 assets and liabilities
primarily include certain cash equivalents and short term investments, equity securities and derivative contracts that trade on an active exchange market.

Level 2—Fair value is based on significant inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability through corroboration with observable market data. Level 2 inputs include quoted market prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities,
quoted market prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar assets or liabilities, and other market observable inputs. The Company’s Level 2 assets and liabilities include: fixed maturities (corporate public and private bonds,
most government securities, certain asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, etc.), certain equity securities (mutual funds, which do not actively trade and are priced based on a net asset value), certain commercial mortgage loans, short-term
investments and certain cash equivalents (primarily commercial paper), and certain over-the-counter derivatives.

Level 3—Fair value is based on at least one or more significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The assets and
liabilities in this category may require significant judgment or estimation in determining the fair value. The Company’s Level 3 assets and liabilities primarily include: certain private fixed maturities and equity securities, certain manually
priced public equity securities and fixed maturities, certain highly structured over-the-counter derivative contracts, certain commercial mortgage loans, certain consolidated real estate funds for which the Company is the general partner, and
embedded derivatives resulting from certain products with guaranteed benefits.

Separate account assets represent segregated funds that are invested for certain customers. Investment risks associated with market value changes are borne by the
customers, except to the extent of minimum guarantees made by the Company with respect to certain accounts. Separate account assets classified as Level 3 consist primarily of real estate and real estate investment funds. Separate account liabilities
are not included in the above table as they are reported at contract value and not fair value in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

(5)

Includes reclassifications to conform to current period presentation.

The methods and assumptions the Company uses to estimate the
fair value of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below.

Fixed Maturity Securities

—The fair values of the Company’s public fixed maturity securities are generally based on prices
obtained from independent pricing services. Prices for each security are generally



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

sourced from multiple pricing vendors, and a vendor hierarchy is maintained by asset type based on historical pricing experience and vendor expertise. The Company ultimately uses the price from
the pricing service highest in the vendor hierarchy based on the respective asset type. Consistent with the fair value hierarchy described above, securities with validated quotes from pricing services are generally reflected within Level 2, as they
are primarily based on observable pricing for similar assets and/or other market observable inputs. If the pricing information received from third party pricing services is not reflective of market activity or other inputs observable in the market,
the Company may challenge the price through a formal process with the pricing service. If the pricing service updates the price to be more consistent with the presented market observations, the security remains within Level 2.

Internally-developed valuations or indicative broker quotes
are also used to determine fair value in circumstances where vendor pricing is not available, or where the Company ultimately concludes that pricing information received from the independent pricing service is not reflective of market activity. If
the Company concludes the values from both pricing services and brokers are not reflective of market activity, it may over-ride the information with an internally-developed valuation. As of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011,
over-rides on a net basis were not material. Pricing service over-rides, internally-developed valuations and indicative broker quotes are generally included in Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

The fair value of private fixed maturities, which are
comprised of investments in private placement securities, originated by internal private asset managers, are primarily determined using a discounted cash flow model. If the fair value is determined using pricing inputs that are observable in the
market, the securities have been reflected within Level 2; otherwise a Level 3 classification is used.

Private fixed maturities also include debt investments in funds that pay a stated coupon and a return based upon the results of the
underlying portfolios. The fair values of these securities are determined by reference to the funds’ net asset value (“NAV”). Since the NAV at which the funds trade can be observed by redemption and subscription transactions between
third parties, the fair values of these investments have been reflected within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Trading Account Assets

—Trading account assets consist primarily of public corporate bonds, treasuries, equity securities and
derivatives whose fair values are determined consistent with similar instruments described above under “Fixed Maturity Securities” and below under “Equity Securities” and “Derivative Instruments.”

Equity Securities—

Equity securities consist
principally of investments in common and preferred stock of publicly traded companies, perpetual preferred stock, privately traded securities, as well as mutual fund shares. The fair values of most publicly traded equity securities are based on
quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and are classified within Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Estimated fair values for most privately traded equity securities are determined using discounted cash flow, earnings multiple
and other valuation models that require a substantial level of judgment around inputs and therefore are classified within Level 3. The fair values of mutual fund shares that transact regularly (but do not trade in active markets because they are not
publicly available) are based on transaction prices of identical fund shares and are classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of perpetual preferred stock are based on inputs obtained from independent pricing services
that are primarily based on indicative broker quotes. As a result, the fair values of perpetual preferred stock are classified as Level 3.

Commercial Mortgage and Other Loans

—The fair value of commercial mortgage loans held for investment (i.e. interim portfolio)
and accounted for using the fair value option are determined based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the appropriate U.S. Treasury rate, adjusted for the current market spread for similar quality loans. The quality
ratings for these loans, a primary determinant of the appropriate credit spread and a significant component of the pricing input, are based on internally-developed estimates. As a result, these loans are included in Level 3 in the fair value
hierarchy.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The fair value of other loans held and accounted for using the fair value option is
determined utilizing pricing indicators from the whole loan market, where investors are committed to purchase these loans at a pre-determined price, which is considered the principal exit market for these loans. The Company has evaluated the
valuation inputs used for these assets, including the existence of pre-determined exit prices, the terms of the loans, prevailing interest rates and credit risk, and deemed that the primary pricing inputs are Level 2 inputs in the fair value
hierarchy.

Other Long-Term
Investments

—Other long-term investments include limited partnerships which are consolidated because the Company is either deemed to exercise control or considered the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. These entities are
considered investment companies and follow specialized industry accounting whereby their assets are carried at fair value. The investments held by these entities include various feeder fund investments in underlying master funds (whose underlying
holdings generally include public fixed maturities, equity securities and mutual funds), as well as wholly-owned real estate held within other investment funds. The fair value is determined by reference to the underlying direct investments, with
publicly traded equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets reflected in Level 1, and public fixed maturities and mutual funds priced via quotes from pricing services or observable data reflected in Level 2. The fair value of
investments in funds that are subject to significant liquidity restrictions are reflected in Level 3.

The fair value of real estate held in consolidated investment funds is determined through an independent appraisal process. The appraisals
generally utilize a discounted cash flow model, supplemented with replacement cost estimates and comparable recent sales data when available. These appraisals and the related assumptions are updated at least annually. Since many of the assumptions
utilized are unobservable and are considered to be significant inputs to the valuation, the real estate investments within other long-term investments have been reflected within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

The fair value of fund investments, where the fair value
option has been elected, is primarily determined by the fund managers. Since the valuations may be based on unobservable market inputs and cannot be validated by the Company, these investments have been included within Level 3 in the fair value
hierarchy.

Derivative
Instruments

—Derivatives are recorded at fair value either as assets, within “Other trading account assets,” or “Other long-term investments,” or as liabilities, within “Other liabilities,” except for embedded
derivatives which are recorded with the associated host contract. The fair values of derivative contracts can be affected by changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, credit spreads, market volatility, expected returns,
non-performance risk, liquidity and other factors. Liquidity valuation adjustments are made to reflect the cost of exiting significant risk positions, and consider the bid-ask spread, maturity, complexity, and other specific attributes of the
underlying derivative position.

The
Company’s exchange-traded futures and options include Treasury futures, Eurodollar futures, commodity futures, Eurodollar options and commodity options. Exchange-traded futures and options are valued using quoted prices in active markets and
are classified within Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.

The majority of the Company’s derivative positions are traded in the over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivative market and are classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. OTC
derivatives classified within Level 2 are valued using models that utilize actively quoted or observable market input values from external market data providers, third-party pricing vendors and/or recent trading activity. The Company’s policy
is to use mid-market pricing in determining its best estimate of fair value. The fair values of most OTC derivatives, including interest rate and cross currency swaps, currency forward contracts, commodity swaps, commodity forward contracts, single
name credit default swaps, loan commitments held for sale and to-be-announced (or TBA) forward contracts on highly rated mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government sponsored entities are determined using discounted cash flow models. The
fair values of European style option contracts are determined using Black-Scholes option pricing models. These models’ key inputs include the contractual terms of the respective contract, along with significant observable inputs, including
interest rates, currency rates, credit spreads, equity prices, index dividend yields, non-performance risk, volatility and other factors.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The vast majority of the Company’s derivative agreements are with highly rated
major international financial institutions. To reflect the market’s perception of its own and the counterparty’s non-performance risk, the Company incorporates additional spreads over London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) into
the discount rate used in determining the fair value of OTC derivative assets and liabilities that are not otherwise collateralized.

Derivatives classified as Level 3 include look-back equity options and other structured products. These derivatives are valued based upon
models (such as Monte Carlo simulation models and other techniques) with some significant unobservable market inputs or inputs (e.g., interest rates, equity indices, dividend yields, etc.) from less actively traded markets (e.g., model-specific
input values, including volatility parameters, etc.). Level 3 methodologies are validated through periodic comparison of the Company’s fair values to broker-dealer values.

Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

—Cash
equivalents and short-term investments

i

nclude money market instruments, commercial paper and other highly liquid debt instruments. Certain money market instruments are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are
accessible for identical assets and are primarily classified as Level 1. The remaining instruments in this category are generally fair valued based on market observable inputs and these investments have primarily been classified within Level 2.

Separate Account Assets

—Separate
Account Assets include fixed maturity securities, treasuries, equity securities and real estate investments for which values are determined consistent with similar instruments described above under “Fixed Maturity Securities,” “Equity
Securities” and “Other Long-Term Investments.”

Notes of Consolidated VIEs

—The fair values of these notes are based on broker quotes and classified within Level 3. See Note 5 and the fair value option section below for additional
information.

Other Liabilities

—Other
liabilities include certain derivative instruments, the fair values of which are determined consistent with similar derivative instruments described above under “Derivative Instruments.”

Future Policy Benefits

—The liability for future
policy benefits primarily includes general account liabilities for the optional living benefit features of the Company’s variable annuity contracts, including guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (“GMAB”), guaranteed minimum
withdrawal benefits (“GMWB”) and guaranteed minimum income and withdrawal benefits (“GMIWB”), accounted for as embedded derivatives. The fair values of the GMAB, GMWB and GMIWB liabilities are calculated as the present value of
future expected benefit payments to customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature. This methodology could result in either a liability or contra-liability balance, given changing capital
market conditions and various policyholder behavior assumptions. Since there is no observable active market for the transfer of these obligations, the valuations are calculated using internally-developed models with option pricing techniques. The
models are based on a risk neutral valuation framework and incorporate premiums for risks inherent in valuation techniques, inputs, and the general uncertainty around the timing and amount of future cash flows. The determination of these risk
premiums requires the use of management judgment.

The significant inputs to the valuation models for these embedded derivatives include capital market assumptions, such as interest
rate and implied volatility assumptions, the Company’s market-perceived risk of its own non-performance (“NPR”), as well as actuarially determined assumptions, including contractholder behavior, such as lapse rates, benefit
utilization rates, withdrawal rates, and mortality rates. Since many of these assumptions are unobservable and are considered to be significant inputs to the liability valuation, the liability included in future policy benefits has been reflected
within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy

.

Capital market inputs and actual policyholders’ account values are updated each quarter based on capital market conditions as of the
end of the quarter, including interest rates, equity markets and implied volatility. In the risk neutral valuation, interest rates are used to both grow the policyholders’ account values and discount all projected future cash flows. The
Company’s discount rate assumption is based on the LIBOR swap curve adjusted for an additional spread over LIBOR to reflect NPR.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Actuarial assumptions, including contractholder behavior and mortality, are reviewed at
least annually, and updated based upon historical experience giving consideration to any observable market data, including available industry studies or market transactions such as acquisitions and reinsurance transactions. These assumptions are
generally updated in the third quarter of each year unless a material change that the Company feels is indicative of a long term trend is observed in an interim period.

Transfers between Levels 1 and 2

—Periodically
there are transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 for foreign common stocks held in the Company’s Separate Account. In certain periods, an adjustment may be made for the fair value of these assets beyond the quoted market price to reflect events
that occurred between the close of foreign trading markets and the close of U.S. trading markets for the respective day. As a result of this type of adjustment, net transfers of $2.9 billion were moved from Level 1 to Level 2 for the year ended
December 31, 2012 and net transfers of $3.4 billion were moved from Level 2 to Level 1 for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Quantitative Information Regarding Internally-Priced Level 3 Assets and
Liabilities

—The table below presents quantitative information on significant internally-priced Level 3 assets and liabilities for which the investment risks associated with market value changes are borne by the Company.

(1)

Conversely, the impact of a decrease in input would have the opposite impact for the fair value as that presented in the table.

(2)

EBITDA multiples represent multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and are amounts used when the reporting entity has determined
that market participants would use such multiples when pricing the investments.

(3)

In isolation, an increase in prepayment rate or a decrease in default rate or loss severity would generally result in an increase in fair value, although the
interrelationships between these inputs depend on specific market conditions.

(4)

Base lapse rates are adjusted at the contract level based on a comparison of the actuarially calculated guaranteed amount and the current policyholder account value as
well as other factors, such as the applicability of any surrender charges. A dynamic lapse adjustment reduces the base lapse rate when the guaranteed amount is greater than the account value, as in-the-money contracts are less likely to lapse. Lapse
rates are also generally assumed to be lower for the period where surrender charges apply.

(5)

To reflect NPR, the Company incorporates an additional spread over LIBOR into the discount rate used in the valuation of individual living benefit contracts in a
liability position and generally not to those in a contra-liability position. In determining the NPR spread, the Company believes it appropriate to reflect the financial strength ratings of the Company’s insurance subsidiaries as these are
insurance liabilities and senior to debt. The additional spread over LIBOR is determined by the credit spreads associated with funding agreements issued by these subsidiaries, adjusted for any illiquidity risk premium.

(6)

The utilization rate assumption estimates the percentage of contracts that will utilize the benefit during the contract duration, and begin lifetime withdrawals at
various time intervals from contract inception. The remaining contractholders are assumed to either begin lifetime withdrawals immediately or never utilizing the benefit. These assumptions vary based on the product type, the age of the
contractholder and the age of the contract. The impact of changes in these assumptions is highly dependent on the contract type and age of the contractholder at the time of the sale and the timing of the first lifetime income withdrawal.

(7)

The withdrawal rate assumption estimates the magnitude of annual contractholder withdrawals relative to the maximum allowable amount under the contract. The fair value
of the liability will generally increase the closer the withdrawal rate is to 100%.

(8)

Range reflects the mortality rate for the vast majority of business with living benefits, with policyholders ranging from 35 to 90 years old. While the majority of
living benefits have a minimum age requirement, certain benefits do not have an age restriction. This results in contractholders for certain benefits with mortality rates approaching 0%. Based on historical experience, the Company applies a set of
age and duration specific mortality rate adjustments compared to standard industry tables. A mortality improvement assumption is also incorporated into the overall mortality table.

Separate Account Assets

—In addition to the significant internally-priced
Level 3 assets and liabilities presented and described above, the Company also has internally-priced separate account assets reported within Level 3. Changes in the fair value of separate account assets are borne by customers and thus are offset by
changes in separate account liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. As a result, changes in value associated with these investments do not impact the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations. In
addition, fees earned by the Company related to the management of most separate account assets classified as Level 3 do not change due to changes in the fair value of these investments. Quantitative information about significant internally-priced
Level 3 separate account assets is as follows:

Real Estate and Other Invested Assets

—Separate account assets include $19,518 million of investments in real estate as of
December 31, 2012 that are classified as Level 3 and reported at fair value. In general, these fair value estimates are based on property appraisal reports prepared by independent real estate appraisers. Key inputs and assumptions to the
appraisal process include rental income and expense amounts, related growth rates, discount rates and capitalization rates. In cases where real estate investments are made through indirect investments, fair value is generally determined by the
Company’s equity in net assets of the entities. The debt associated with real estate, other invested assets and the Company’s equity position in entities are externally valued. Because of the subjective nature of inputs and the judgment
involved in the appraisal process, real estate investments and their corresponding debt are typically included in the Level 3 classification. Key unobservable inputs to real estate valuation include capitalization rates, which range from 4.75% to
10.5% (6.49% weighted average) and discount rates, which range from 6.25% to 15.0% (7.92% weighted average). Key unobservable inputs to real estate debt valuation include yield to maturity, which ranges from 3.59% to 7.62% (4.74% weighted average)
and market spread over base rate, which ranges from 1.67% to 4.48% (3.22% weighted average).

Commercial Mortgage Loans—

Separate account assets include $833 million of commercial mortgage loans as of December 31, 2012 that are classified as Level 3 and reported at fair value.
Commercial mortgage loans are primarily valued internally using discounted cash flow techniques, as described further under “Fair Value of Financial Instruments.” The primary unobservable input used is the spread to discount cash flows,
which range from 1.65% to 4.15% (1.87% weighted average). In isolation, an increase (decrease) in the value of this input would result in a lower (higher) fair value measurement.

Valuation Process for Fair Value Measurements Categorized
within Level 3—

The Company has established an internal control infrastructure over the valuation of financial instruments that requires ongoing oversight by its various Business Groups. These management control functions are segregated from
the trading and investing functions. For invested assets, the Company has established oversight teams, often in the form of Pricing Committees within each asset management group. The teams, which typically include representation from investment,
accounting, operations, legal and other disciplines are responsible for overseeing and monitoring the pricing of the Company’s investments and performing periodic due diligence reviews of independent pricing services. An actuarial valuation
unit oversees the valuation of optional living benefit features of the Company’s variable annuity contracts. The valuation unit works with segregated modeling and database administration teams to validate the appropriateness of input data and
logic, data flow and implementation.

The Company
has also established policies and guidelines that require the establishment of valuation methodologies and consistent application of such methodologies. These policies and guidelines govern the use of inputs and price source hierarchies and provide
controls around the valuation processes. These controls include appropriate review and analysis of investment prices against market activity or indicators of reasonableness, approval of price source changes, price overrides, methodology changes and
classification of fair value hierarchy levels. For optional living benefit features of the Company’s variable annuity products, the valuation unit periodically performs baseline testing of contract input data and actuarial assumptions are
reviewed at least annually, and updated based upon historical experience giving consideration to any observable market data, including available industry studies. The valuation policies and guidelines are reviewed and updated as appropriate.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Within the trading and investing functions, the Company has established policies and
procedures that relate to the approval of all new transaction types, transaction pricing sources and fair value hierarchy coding within the financial reporting system. For variable annuity product changes or new launches of optional living benefit
features, the actuarial valuation unit validates input logic and new product features and agrees new input data directly to source documents.

Changes in Level 3 assets and liabilities

—The following tables provide summaries of the changes in fair values of Level 3
assets and liabilities as of the dates indicated, as well as the portion of gains or losses included in income attributable to unrealized gains or losses related to those assets and liabilities still held at the end of their respective periods.

Transfers

—Transfers into Level 3 are generally the result of unobservable
inputs utilized within valuation methodologies and the use of broker quotes (that cannot be validated) for which information from third party pricing services (that can be validated) was previously utilized. Transfers out of Level 3 are generally
due to the use of observable inputs in valuation methodologies as well as the utilization of pricing service information for certain assets that the Company is able to validate. Significant transfers into and/or out of Level 3 are discussed below:

For the year ended December 31, 2012, the
majority of the Equity Securities Available-for-Sale transfers out of Level 3 were due to the determination that the pricing inputs for certain equity securities did not have a material liquidity discount and therefore, should be classified as Level
1, not Level 3.

For the year ended
December 31, 2011, the majority of the Equity Securities Available-for-Sale, Trading Account Assets Supporting Insurance Liabilities—Equity Securities and Other Trading Account Assets—Equity Securities transfers into Level 3 were due
to the determination that the pricing inputs for perpetual preferred stocks provided by third party pricing services were primarily based on indicative broker quotes which could not always be verified against directly observable market information.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, the
majority of the transfers out of Level 3 for Fixed Maturities Available-for-Sale—Asset-Backed Securities and Trading Account Assets Supporting Insurance Liabilities—Asset-Backed Securities resulting from the Company’s conclusion that
the market for asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages had been becoming increasingly active. The pricing received from independent pricing services could be validated by the Company. The market for asset-backed securities was
deemed inactive in 2009.

“Netting” amounts represent cash collateral of $2,086 million and $3,368 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and the impact of
offsetting asset and liability positions held with the same counterparty.

Changes in Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities

—The following tables provide a summary of the changes in fair value of Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities for the year ended
December 31, 2012, as well as the portion of gains or losses included in income for the year ended December 31, 2012, attributable to unrealized gains or losses related to those assets and liabilities still held at December 31, 2012.

Transfers into or out of Level 3 are generally reported as the value as of the beginning of the quarter in which the transfer occurs.

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements

—Certain
assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Nonrecurring fair value adjustments resulted in $2 million of net gains being recorded for the year ended December 31, 2012 on certain commercial mortgage loans. The
carrying value of these loans as of December 31, 2012 was $35 million. Similar nonrecurring fair value adjustments on commercial mortgage loans resulted in net losses of $7 million and $73 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and
2010, respectively. The adjustments were based on discounted cash flows utilizing market rates or the fair value of the underlying real estate collateral and were classified as Level 3 in the hierarchy.

Impairments of $46 million were recorded related to the write
off of intangible assets. The impairments were primarily based on discounted cash flow models, using assumptions and inputs specific to the Company, and are therefore, classified as Level 3 in the hierarchy. Impairments of $4 million, $8 million and
$6 million were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, on certain cost method investments. The impairments were based primarily on discounted future cash flow models and, where appropriate, valuations
provided by the general partners taken into consideration with deal and management fee expenses and classified as Level 3 in the hierarchy.

Impairments of $14 million, $9 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, were
recorded for mortgage servicing rights. The impairments were based on internal models and were classified as Level 3 in the hierarchy. In addition, impairments of $4 million and $22 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011,
respectively, were recorded for real estate investments, some of which were classified as discontinued operations. The impairments were based primarily on appraisal values and were classified as Level 3 in the hierarchy.

Fair Value Option

—The following table presents information regarding changes
in fair values recorded in earnings for commercial mortgage loans, other long-term investments and notes issued by consolidated variable interest entities, where the fair value option has been elected.

Changes in fair value are
reflected in “Realized investment gains (losses), net” for commercial mortgage loans and “Asset management fees and other income” for other long-term investments and notes issued by consolidated variable interest entities.
Changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are estimated based on changes in credit spreads and quality ratings for the period reported.

Interest income on commercial mortgage loans is included in net investment income. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and
2010, the Company recorded $13 million, $12 million and $22 million of interest income, respectively, on these fair value option loans. Interest income on these loans is recorded based on the effective interest rates as determined at the closing of
the loan.

The fair values and aggregate
contractual principal amounts of commercial mortgage loans, for which the fair value option has been elected, were $162 million and $156 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2012, and $603 million and $598 million, respectively, as
December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2012, there were no loans in non-accrual status and none of the loans are more than 90 days past due and still accruing.

The fair value of other long-term investments were $465
million and $366 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

The fair value and aggregate contractual principal amounts of notes issued by consolidated variable interest entities, for which the fair value option has been elected, were $1,406 million and $1,422
million, respectively, as of December 31, 2012, and $282 million and $294 million, respectively, as December 31, 2011. Interest expense recorded for these liabilities was $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The table below presents the carrying amount and fair value by fair value hierarchy level of certain financial
instruments that are not reported at fair value. However, in some cases, as described below, the carrying amount equals or approximates fair value.

(1)

Carrying values presented herein differ from those in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Financial Position because certain items within the respective
financial statement captions are not considered financial instruments or out of scope under authoritative guidance relating to disclosures of the fair value of financial instruments. Financial statement captions excluded from the above table are not
considered financial instruments.

(2)

Amount included in “Other liabilities” in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

The fair values presented above have been determined by using
available market information and by applying market valuation methodologies, as described in more detail below.

Fixed Maturities, Held-to-Maturity

The fair values of public fixed maturity securities are generally based on prices from third-party pricing services, which are reviewed to validate reasonableness. However, for certain public fixed
maturity securities and investments in private placement fixed maturity securities, this information is either not available or not reliable. For these public fixed maturity securities, the fair value is based on indicative broker quotes, if
available, or determined using a discounted cash flow model or internally-developed values. For private fixed maturities, fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model. In determining the fair value of certain fixed maturity
securities, the discounted cash flow model may also use unobservable inputs, which reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the security.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Commercial Mortgage and Other Loans

The fair value of most commercial mortgage loans is based
upon the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the appropriate U.S. Treasury rate or foreign government bond rate (for non-U.S. dollar-denominated loans) plus an appropriate credit spread for similar quality loans. The
quality ratings for these loans, a primary determinant of the credit spreads and a significant component of the pricing process, are based on an internally-developed methodology.

Certain commercial mortgage loans are valued incorporating
other factors, including the terms of the loans, the principal exit strategies for the loans, prevailing interest rates and credit risk. Other loan valuations are primarily based upon the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at
the appropriate Japanese government bond rate and local market swap rates or credit default swap spreads, plus an appropriate credit spread and liquidity premium. The credit spread and liquidity premium are a significant component of the pricing
inputs, and are based upon an internally-developed methodology, which takes into account, among other factors, the credit quality of the loans, the property type of the collateral, the weighted average coupon and the weighted average life of the
loans.

Policy Loans

The fair value of U.S. insurance policy loans is calculated
using a discounted cash flow model based upon current U.S. Treasury rates and historical loan repayment patterns, while Japanese insurance policy loans use the risk-free proxy based on the yen LIBOR. For group corporate-, bank- and trust-owned life
insurance contracts and group universal life contracts, the fair value of the policy loans is the amount due, excluding interest, as of the reporting date.

Short-Term Investments, Cash & Equivalents, Accrued Investment Income and Other Assets

The Company believes that due to the short-term nature of
certain assets, the carrying value approximates fair value. These assets include: certain short-term investments which are not securities, are recorded at amortized cost and include quality loans; cash and cash equivalent instruments; accrued
investment income; and other assets that meet the definition of financial instruments, including receivables, such as reinsurance recoverables, unsettled trades, accounts receivable and restricted cash.

Policyholders’ Account Balances—Investment Contracts

Only the portion of policyholders’
account balances related to products that are investment contracts (those without significant mortality or morbidity risk) are reflected in the table above. For fixed deferred annuities, single premium endowments, payout annuities and other similar
contracts without life contingencies, fair values are derived using discounted projected cash flows based on interest rates that are representative of the Company’s financial strength ratings, and hence reflect the Company’s own
non-performance risk. For guaranteed investment contracts, funding agreements, structured settlements without life contingencies and other similar products, fair values are derived using discounted projected cash flows based on interest rates being
offered for similar contracts with maturities consistent with those of the contracts being valued. For those balances that can be withdrawn by the customer at any time without prior notice or penalty, the fair value is the amount estimated to be
payable to the customer as of the reporting date, which is generally the carrying value. For defined contribution and defined benefit contracts and certain other products, the fair value is the market value of the assets supporting the liabilities.

Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase

The Company receives collateral for
selling securities under agreements to repurchase, or pledges collateral under agreements to resell. Repurchase and resale agreements are also generally short-term in nature, and therefore, the carrying amounts of these instruments approximate fair
value.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Cash Collateral for Loaned Securities

Cash collateral for loaned securities represents the
collateral received or paid in connection with loaning or borrowing securities, similar to the securities sold under agreement to repurchase above. For these transactions, the carrying value of the related asset or liability approximates fair value,
as they equal the amount of cash collateral received/paid.

Debt

The fair value of short-term and long-term debt, as well as notes issued by consolidated VIEs, is generally determined by either prices
obtained from independent pricing services, which are validated by the Company, or discounted cash flow models. With the exception of the notes issued by consolidated VIEs for which recourse is limited to the assets of the respective VIE and does
not extend to the general credit of the Company, the fair values of these instruments consider the Company’s own non-performance risk. Discounted cash flow models predominately use market observable inputs such as the borrowing rates currently
available to the Company for debt and financial instruments with similar terms and remaining maturities. For commercial paper issuances and other debt with a maturity of less than 90 days, the carrying value approximates fair value.

A portion of the senior secured notes issued by Prudential
Holdings, LLC (the “IHC debt”) is insured by a third-party financial guarantee insurance policy. The effect of the third-party credit enhancement is not included in the fair value measurement of the IHC debt and the methodologies used to
determine fair value consider the Company’s own non-performance risk.

Bank Customer Liabilities

The carrying amount for certain deposits (interest and non-interest demand, savings and money market accounts) approximates or equals their fair values. Fair values for fixed-rate certificates of deposit
are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates being offered on certificates at the reporting dates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities. Bank customer liabilities are reflected within
“Other liabilities.” During 2012, the Company divested bank customer liabilities as part of a previously announced decision to limit banking operations to trust services.

Other Liabilities

Other liabilities are primarily payables, such as
reinsurance payables, unsettled trades, drafts and accrued expense payables. Due to the short term until settlement of most of these liabilities, the Company believes that carrying value approximates fair value.

Separate Account Liabilities—Investment Contracts

Only the portion of separate account
liabilities related to products that are investments contracts are reflected in the table above. Separate account liabilities are recorded at the amount credited to the contractholder, which reflects the change in fair value of the corresponding
separate account assets including contractholder deposits less withdrawals and fees. Therefore, carrying value approximates fair value.

21.    DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

Types of Derivative Instruments and Derivative
Strategies used in a non-dealer or broker capacity

Interest Rate Contracts

Interest rate swaps and exchange-traded futures and options are used by the Company to reduce risks from changes in interest rates, manage
interest rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities (including duration mismatches) and to hedge against changes in the value of assets it owns or anticipates



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

acquiring or selling. Swaps may be attributed to specific assets or liabilities or may be used on a portfolio basis. Under interest rate swaps, the Company agrees with other parties to exchange,
at specified intervals, the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. Generally, no cash is exchanged at the outset of the contract and no principal payments
are made by either party. These transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that provide for a single net payment to be made by one counterparty at each due date.

In exchange-traded futures transactions, the Company agrees
to purchase or sell a specified number of contracts, the values of which are determined by the values of underlying referenced investments, and to post variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal to the difference in the daily market values
of those contracts. The Company enters into exchange-traded futures and options with regulated futures commission’s merchants who are members of a trading exchange.

Equity Contracts

Equity index options are contracts which will settle in cash
based on differentials in the underlying indices at the time of exercise and the strike price. The Company uses combinations of purchases and sales of equity index options to hedge the effects of adverse changes in equity indices within a
predetermined range. These hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting.

Foreign Exchange Contracts

Currency derivatives, including exchange-traded currency futures and options, currency forwards and currency swaps, are used by the Company to reduce risks from changes in currency exchange rates with
respect to investments denominated in foreign currencies that the Company either holds or intends to acquire or sell, and to hedge the currency risk associated with net investments in foreign operations and anticipated earnings of its foreign
operations.

Under currency forwards, the Company
agrees with other parties to deliver a specified amount of an identified currency at a specified future date. Typically, the price is agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for such a contract is made at the specified future date. As
noted above, the Company uses currency forwards to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on U.S. dollar equivalent earnings generated by certain of its non-U.S. businesses, primarily its international insurance and investments
operations. The Company executes forward sales of the hedged currency in exchange for U.S. dollars at a specified exchange rate. The maturities of these forwards correspond with the future periods in which the non-U.S. dollar-denominated earnings
are expected to be generated. These earnings hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting.

Under currency swaps, the Company agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between one currency and another at an exchange rate and calculated by reference to an
agreed principal amount. Generally, the principal amount of each currency is exchanged at the beginning and termination of the currency swap by each party. These transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that provide for a single
net payment to be made by one counterparty for payments made in the same currency at each due date.

Credit Contracts

Credit derivatives are used by the Company to enhance the return on the Company’s investment portfolio by creating credit exposure similar to an investment in public fixed maturity cash instruments.
With credit derivatives the Company sells credit protection on an identified name, or an index of names, and in return receives a quarterly premium. With credit default derivatives, this premium or credit spread generally corresponds to the
difference between the yield on the referenced name’s (or index reference names’) public fixed maturity cash instruments and swap rates, at the time the agreement is executed. If there is an event of



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

default by the referenced name or one of the referenced names in the index, as defined by the agreement, then the Company is obligated to pay the counterparty the referenced amount of the
contract and receive in return the referenced defaulted security or similar security or (in the case of a credit default index) pay the referenced amount less the auction recovery rate. See credit derivatives written section for discussion of
guarantees related to credit derivatives written. In addition to selling credit protection the Company has purchased credit protection using credit derivatives in order to hedge specific credit exposures in the Company’s investment portfolio.

Other Contracts

TBAs.

The Company uses “to be
announced” (“TBA”) forward contracts to gain exposure to the investment risk and return of mortgage-backed securities. TBA transactions can help the Company enhance the return on its investment portfolio. TBAs can provide a more
liquid and cost effective method of achieving these goals than purchasing or selling individual mortgage-backed pools. Typically, the price is agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for such a contract is made at a specified future
date. Additionally, pursuant to the Company’s mortgage dollar roll program, TBAs or mortgage-backed securities are transferred to counterparties with a corresponding agreement to repurchase them at a future date. These transactions do not
qualify as secured borrowings and are accounted for as derivatives.

Loan Commitments.

In its mortgage operations, the Company enters into commitments to fund commercial mortgage loans at specified interest rates and other applicable terms within
specified periods of time. These commitments are legally binding agreements to extend credit to a counterparty. Loan commitments for loans that will be held for sale are recognized as derivatives and recorded at fair value. The determination of the
fair value of loan commitments accounted for as derivatives considers various factors including, among others, terms of the related loan, the intended exit strategy for the loans based upon either securitization valuation models or investor purchase
commitments, prevailing interest rates, origination income or expense, and the value of service rights. Loan commitments that relate to the origination of mortgage loans that will be held for investment are not accounted for as derivatives and
accordingly are not recognized in the Company’s financial statements. See Note 23 for a further discussion of these loan commitments.

Embedded Derivatives.

The Company sells variable annuity products, which may include guaranteed benefit features that
are accounted for as embedded derivatives. These embedded derivatives are marked to market through “Realized investment gains (losses), net” based on the change in value of the underlying contractual guarantees, which are determined using
valuation models. The Company maintains a portfolio of derivative instruments that is intended to economically hedge the risks related to the above products’ features. The derivatives may include, but are not limited to equity options, total
return swaps, interest rate swap options, caps, floors, and other instruments. In addition, some variable annuity products feature an automatic rebalancing element, also referred to as an asset transfer feature, to minimize risks inherent in the
Company’s guarantees which reduces the need for derivatives.

The Company invests in fixed maturities that, in addition to a stated coupon, provide a return based upon the results of an underlying portfolio of fixed income investments and related investment
activity. The Company accounts for these investments as available-for-sale fixed maturities containing embedded derivatives. Such embedded derivatives are marked to market through “Realized investment gains (losses), net,” based upon the
change in value of the underlying portfolio.

Synthetic Guarantees.

The Company sells synthetic guaranteed investment contracts, through both full service and
investment-only sales channels, to qualified pension plans. The assets are owned by the trustees of such plans, who invest the assets according to the contract terms agreed to with the Company. The contracts contain a guarantee of a minimum rate of
return on participant balances supported by the underlying assets, and a guarantee of liquidity to meet certain participant-initiated withdrawals from the contract. Under U.S. GAAP, these contracts are accounted for as derivatives and recorded at
fair value.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The table below provides a summary of the gross notional amount and fair value of
derivatives contracts used in a non-dealer or broker capacity, excluding embedded derivatives which are recorded with the associated host, by the primary underlying. Many derivative instruments contain multiple underlyings. The fair value amounts
below represent the gross fair value of derivative contracts prior to taking into account the netting effects of master netting agreements and cash collateral held with the same counterparty. This netting impact results in total derivative assets of
$3,075 million and $2,611 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and total derivative liabilities of $307 million and $349 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, reflected in the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position.

(1)

Excludes embedded derivatives which contain multiple underlyings. The fair value of these embedded derivatives was a net liability of $3,438 million as of
December 31, 2012 and a net liability of $3,131 million as of December 31, 2011, included in “Future policy benefits” and “Fixed maturities, available-for-sale.”

Cash Flow, Fair Value and Net Investment Hedges

The primary derivative instruments used by the Company in
its fair value, cash flow, and net investment hedge accounting relationships are interest rate swaps, currency swaps and currency forwards. These instruments are only designated for hedge accounting in instances where the appropriate criteria are
met. The Company does not use futures, options, credit, equity or embedded derivatives in any of its fair value, cash flow or net investment hedge accounting relationships.

Relates to the sale of equity method investments.

For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the ineffective portion of derivatives accounted for using hedge accounting was
not material to the Company’s results of operations and there were no material amounts reclassified into earnings relating to instances in which the Company discontinued cash flow hedge accounting because the forecasted transaction did not
occur by the anticipated date or within the additional time period permitted by the authoritative guidance for the accounting for derivatives and hedging. In addition, there were no instances in which the Company discontinued fair value hedge
accounting due to a hedged firm commitment no longer qualifying as a fair value hedge.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Presented below is a roll forward of current period cash flow hedges in
“Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” before taxes:

Using December 31, 2012
values, it is anticipated that a pre-tax loss of approximately $23 million will be reclassified from “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” to earnings during the subsequent twelve months ending December 31, 2013, offset by
amounts pertaining to the hedged items. As of December 31, 2012, the Company does not have any qualifying cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions other than those related to the variability of the payment or receipt of interest or foreign
currency amounts on existing financial instruments. The maximum length of time for which these variable cash flows are hedged is 21 years. Income amounts deferred in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” as a result of cash flow
hedges are included in “Net unrealized investment gains (losses)” in the Consolidated Statements of Equity.

For effective net investment hedges, the amounts, before applicable taxes, recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment account
within “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” were $117 million in 2012, $(102) million in 2011 and, $(73) million in 2010.

Credit Derivatives Written

The following table sets forth the Company’s exposure from credit derivatives where the Company has written credit protection, by
NAIC rating of the underlying credits as of December 31, 2012 and 2011. The Company’s maximum amount at risk under these credit derivatives listed below assumes the value of the underlying referenced securities become worthless. These
credit derivatives have maturities of less than 5 years. The table excludes a credit derivative related to surplus notes issued by a subsidiary of Prudential Insurance and embedded derivatives contained in externally-managed investments in the
European market.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The following table sets
forth the composition of the Company’s credit derivatives where the Company has written credit protection by industry category as of the dates indicated.

(1)

Includes Credit Default Index derivative with various industry categories.

In addition to the above, the Company entered into a credit
derivative that will require the Company to make certain payments in the event of deterioration in the value of the surplus notes issued by a subsidiary of Prudential Insurance. The notional of this credit derivative is $500 million and the fair
value as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 was a liability of $32 million and $77 million, respectively. No collateral was pledged in either period.

The Company holds certain externally-managed investments in the European market which contain embedded derivatives whose fair values are
primarily driven by changes in credit spreads. These investments are medium-term notes that are collateralized by investment portfolios primarily consisting of investment grade European fixed income securities, including corporate bonds and
asset-backed securities, and derivatives, as well as varying degrees of leverage. The notes have a stated coupon and provide a return based on the performance of the underlying portfolios and the level of leverage. The Company invests in these notes
to earn a coupon through maturity, consistent with its investment purpose for other debt securities. The notes are accounted for under U.S. GAAP as available-for-sale fixed maturity securities with bifurcated embedded derivatives (total return
swaps). Changes in the value of the fixed maturity securities are reported in Equity under the heading “Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)” and changes in the market value of the embedded total return swaps are included in
current period earnings in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” The Company’s maximum exposure to loss from these investments was $314 million and $664 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

In addition to writing credit protection, the Company has purchased credit protection
using credit derivatives in order to hedge specific credit exposures in the Company’s investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company had $1.680 billion and $1.978 billion of outstanding notional amounts, respectively,
reported at fair value as a liability of $35 million and an asset of $2 million, respectively.

Types of Derivative Instruments and Derivative Strategies used in a dealer or broker capacity

Futures, forwards and options contracts, and swap agreements, were also used in a derivative dealer or broker capacity in the
Company’s commodities operations, prior to the sale of this business to Jefferies on July 1, 2011, to facilitate transactions of clients, hedge proprietary trading activities and as a means of risk management. These derivatives allowed the
Company to structure transactions to manage its exposure to commodities and securities prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Risk exposures were managed through diversification, by controlling position sizes and by entering into
offsetting positions.

The fair value of the
Company’s derivative contracts used in a derivative dealer or broker capacity were reported on a net-by-counterparty basis in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Position when management believes a legal right of setoff
exists under an enforceable netting agreement.

Realized and unrealized gains and losses from marking-to-market the derivatives used in proprietary positions were recognized on a trade
date basis and reported in “Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes. The pre-tax amounts reported in “Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes” for these derivatives were gains of $0 million, $63 million and
$97 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Counterparty Credit Risk

The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial derivative transactions. The Company manages credit risk by entering into derivative
transactions with highly rated major international financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties, and by obtaining collateral where appropriate. Additionally, limits are set on single party credit exposures which are subject to
periodic management review.

The credit exposure
of the Company’s over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivative transactions is represented by the contracts with a positive fair value (market value) at the reporting date. To reduce credit exposures, the Company seeks to (i) enter into
OTC derivative transactions pursuant to master agreements that provide for a netting of payments and receipts with a single counterparty (ii) enter into agreements that allow the use of credit support annexes, which are bilateral
rating-sensitive agreements that require collateral postings at established threshold levels. Likewise, the Company effects exchange-traded futures and options transactions through regulated exchanges and these transactions are settled on a daily
basis, thereby reducing credit risk exposure in the event of non-performance by counterparties to such financial instruments.

Under fair value measurements, the Company incorporates the market’s perception of its own and the counterparty’s
non-performance risk in determining the fair value of the portion of its OTC derivative assets and liabilities that are uncollateralized. Credit spreads are applied to the derivative fair values on a net basis by counterparty. To reflect the
Company’s own credit spread a proxy based on relevant debt spreads is applied to OTC derivative net liability positions. Similarly, the Company’s counterparty’s credit spread is applied to OTC derivative net asset positions.

Certain of the Company’s derivative
agreements with some of its counterparties contain credit-rating related triggers. If the Company’s credit rating were to fall below a certain level, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request termination at the then fair
value of the derivative or demand immediate full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. If a downgrade occurred and the derivative



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

positions were terminated, the Company anticipates it would be able to replace the derivative positions with other counterparties in the normal course of business. The aggregate fair value of all
derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position were $84 million as of December 31, 2012. In the normal course of business the Company has posted collateral related to these instruments
of $63 million as of December 31, 2012. If the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered on December 31, 2012, the Company estimates that it would be required to post a maximum of $21 million of
additional collateral to its counterparties.

22.    SEGMENT INFORMATION

Segments

The Company has organized its principal operations into the
Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. Within the Financial Services Businesses, the Company operates through three divisions, which together encompass six reportable segments. Businesses that are not sufficiently material to
warrant separate disclosure and divested businesses are included in Corporate and Other operations within the Financial Services Businesses. Collectively, the businesses that comprise the three operating divisions and Corporate and Other are
referred to as the Financial Services Businesses.

U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division.

The U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management division
consists of the Individual Annuities, Retirement, and Asset Management segments. The Individual Annuities segment manufactures and distributes individual variable and fixed annuity products, primarily to the U.S. mass affluent market. The Retirement

investments financed by business segments; (3) capital debt that is used or will be used to meet the capital requirements of the Company and the related interest expense; (4) income and
expense from qualified pension and other employee benefit plans, after allocations to business segments; (5) corporate-level income and expense, after allocations to business segments, including corporate governance, corporate advertising,
philanthropic activities, deferred compensation, and costs related to certain contingencies; (6) certain retained obligations relating to pre-demutualization policyholders whom the Company had previously agreed to provide insurance for reduced
or no premium in accordance with contractual settlements related to prior individual life insurance sales practices remediation; (7) results related to the Company’s capital protection framework; (8) results related to a life
insurance joint venture and an asset management company joint venture in China and (9) the impact of transactions with other segments.

Closed Block Business

. The Closed Block Business, which is managed separately from the Financial Services Businesses, was
established on the date of demutualization. It includes the Closed Block (as discussed in Note 12); assets held outside the Closed Block necessary to meet insurance regulatory capital requirements related to products included within the Closed
Block; deferred policy acquisition costs related to the Closed Block policies; the principal amount of the IHC debt (as discussed in Note 14) and certain related assets and liabilities.

Segment Accounting Policies.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
Note 2. Results for each segment include earnings on attributed equity established at a level which management considers necessary to support each segment’s risks. Operating expenses specifically identifiable to a particular segment are
allocated to that segment as incurred. Operating expenses not identifiable to a specific segment that are incurred in connection with the generation of segment revenues are generally allocated based upon the segment’s historical percentage of
general and administrative expenses.

For
information related to significant acquisitions and disposition, see Note 3. For information related to the adoption of new accounting pronouncements, see Note 2. The segments’ results in prior years have been revised for these items, as
applicable, to conform to the current year presentation.

In addition, as discussed in Note 1, the Company recorded out of period adjustments during 2012 that resulted in a decrease in adjusted operating income, the Company’s measure of segment performance
discussed below, of $160 million for the year, principally $61 million to the Asset Management segment and $99 million to Corporate and Other operations. In addition, the adjustments resulted in a reduction of $16 million to the Closed Block
Business.

Adjusted Operating Income

In managing the Financial Services Businesses, the Company
analyzes the operating performance of each segment using “adjusted operating income.” Adjusted operating income does not equate to “income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint
ventures” or “net income” as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP but is the measure of segment profit or loss used by the Company to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources, and consistent with authoritative guidance,
is the measure of segment performance presented below. Adjusted operating income is calculated by adjusting each segment’s “income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint
ventures” for the following items, which are described in greater detail below:

•

realized investment gains (losses), net, and related charges and adjustments;

•

net investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities
due to asset value changes;

•

the contribution to income/loss of divested businesses that have been or will be sold or exited, including businesses that have been placed in wind
down status, but that did not qualify for “discontinued operations” accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP; and

•

equity in earnings of operating joint ventures and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

These items are important to an understanding of overall results of operations. Adjusted
operating income is not a substitute for income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and the Company’s definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies. However, the Company believes that the presentation
of adjusted operating income as measured for management purposes enhances the understanding of results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability factors of the Financial Services Businesses.

Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related charges
and adjustments

Realized investment gains (losses),
net

Adjusted operating income excludes
“Realized investment gains (losses), net,” except for certain items described below. Significant activity excluded from adjusted operating income includes impairments and credit-related gains and losses from sales of securities, the timing
of which depends largely on market credit cycles and can vary considerably across periods, and interest rate-related gains and losses from sales of securities, which are largely subject to the Company’s discretion and influenced by market
opportunities, as well as the Company’s tax and capital profile. Additionally, certain gains and losses pertaining to derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are also excluded from adjusted operating income.
Trends in the underlying profitability of the Company’s businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of these transactions.

The following table sets forth the components of “Realized investment gains (losses), net” that are included in adjusted
operating income and, as a result, are reflected as adjustments to “Realized investment gains (losses), net” for purposes of calculating adjusted operating income:

Terminated Hedges of
Foreign Currency Earnings.

The amounts shown in the table above primarily reflect the impact of an intercompany arrangement between Corporate and Other operations and the International Insurance segment, pursuant to which the non-U.S.
dollar-denominated earnings in all countries for a particular year, including its interim reporting periods, are translated at fixed currency exchange rates. The fixed rates are determined in connection with a currency hedging program designed to
mitigate the risk that unfavorable rate changes will reduce the segment’s U.S. dollar equivalent earnings. Pursuant to this program, the Company’s Corporate and Other operations may execute forward currency contracts with third parties to
sell the net exposure of projected earnings from the hedged currency in exchange for U.S. dollars at a specified exchange rate. The maturities of these contracts correspond with the future periods in which the identified non-U.S. dollar-denominated
earnings are expected to be generated. These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP, so the resulting profits or losses are recorded in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” When the contracts are terminated in
the same period that the expected earnings emerge, the resulting positive or negative cash flow effect is included in adjusted operating income.

Current Period Yield Adjustments.

The Company uses interest rate and currency swaps and other derivatives to manage interest and
currency exchange rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities, including duration mismatches. For derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the periodic swap settlements, as well as certain
other derivative related yield adjustments are recorded in “Realized investment gains (losses), net”, and are included in adjusted operating income to reflect the after-hedge yield of the underlying instruments. In certain instances, when
these derivative contracts are terminated or offset before their final maturity, the resulting realized gains or losses are recognized in adjusted operating income over



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

periods that generally approximate the expected terms of the derivatives or underlying instruments in order for adjusted operating income to reflect the after-hedge yield of the underlying
instruments. Included in the amounts shown in the table above are gains on certain derivatives contracts that were terminated or offset in prior periods of $64 million, $50 million and $35 million for the years ended 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively. Additionally, as of December 31, 2012, there was a $575 million deferred net gain related to certain derivative contracts that were terminated or offset in prior periods, primarily in the International Insurance segment.

Principal Source of Earnings.

The Company
conducts certain activities for which realized investment gains and losses are a principal source of earnings for its businesses and therefore included in adjusted operating income, particularly within the Company’s Asset Management segment.
For example, Asset Management’s strategic investing business makes investments for sale or syndication to other investors or for placement or co-investment in the Company’s managed funds and structured products. The realized investment
gains and losses associated with the sale of these strategic investments, as well as related derivative results, are a principal activity for this business and included in adjusted operating income. In addition, the realized investment gains and
losses associated with loans originated by the Company’s commercial mortgage operations, as well as related derivative results and retained mortgage servicing rights, are a principal activity for this business and included in adjusted operating
income.

Other items reflected as adjustments to Realized
investment gains (losses), net

The
following table sets forth certain other items excluded from adjusted operating income and reflected as an adjustment to “Realized investment gains (losses), net” for purposes of calculating adjusted operating income:

Other Trading Account
Assets.

The Company has certain investments in its general account portfolios that are classified as trading. These trading investments are carried at fair value and included in “Other trading account assets, at fair value” on the
Company’s statements of financial position. Realized and unrealized gains and losses for these investments are recorded in “Asset management fees and other income.” Consistent with the exclusion of realized investment gains and losses
with respect to other investments managed on a consistent basis, the net gains or losses on these investments are excluded from adjusted operating income.

Foreign Currency Exchange Movements.

The Company has certain assets and liabilities for which, under U.S. GAAP, the changes in
value, including those associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period, are recorded in “Asset management fees and other income.” To the extent the foreign currency exposure on these assets and liabilities is
economically hedged or considered part of the Company’s capital funding strategies for its international subsidiaries, the change in value included in “Asset management fees and other income” is excluded from adjusted operating
income. The amounts in the table above are largely driven by non-yen denominated insurance liabilities in the Company’s Japanese insurance operations. The insurance liabilities are supported by investments denominated in corresponding
currencies, including a significant portion designated as available-for-sale. While these non-yen denominated assets and liabilities are economically hedged, under U.S. GAAP, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments, including
those arising from foreign currency exchange rate movements, are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” while the non-yen denominated liabilities are re-measured for foreign currency exchange rate movements, and the
related change in value is recorded in earnings within “Asset management fees and other income.” Due to this non-economic volatility that is reflected in U.S. GAAP earnings, the change in value recorded within “Asset management fee
and other income” is excluded from adjusted operating income.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Other Activities.

The Company excludes certain other items from adjusted
operating income that are consistent with similar adjustments described above. The significant items within other activities shown in the table above included the following:

In connection with the settlement of disputes arising out of
the Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition filed by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., the Company recorded additional losses of $65 million in the first quarter of 2011 related to a portion of its counterparty exposure on derivative transactions it had
previously held with Lehman Brothers and its affiliates. These losses are recorded within “Asset management fees and other income” within the Company’s Corporate and Other operations. Consistent with the exclusion of credit-related
losses recorded in “Realized investment gains (losses), net”, the impact of this settlement is excluded from adjusted operating income. In the second quarter of 2012, the Company recorded a $12 million estimated recovery of this
settlement, which is also excluded from adjusted operating income.

The Company records an adjustment for non-performance risk that relates to the uncollateralized portion of certain derivative contracts between a subsidiary of the Company and third parties. These
adjustments are recorded within “Asset management fees and other income.” Consistent with the exclusion of the mark-to-market on derivatives recorded in “Realized investment gains (losses), net”, the impact of the non-performance
risk is excluded from adjusted operating income. The net impact of the non-performance risk was to exclude from adjusted operating income net gains of $36 million, net losses of $22 million and net gains of $3 million for the years ended 2012, 2011
and 2010, respectively.

Related charges

Charges that relate to realized investment gains and losses
are also excluded from adjusted operating income, and include the following:

•

The portion of the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, value of business acquired, unearned revenue reserves and deferred sales
inducements for certain products that is related to net realized investment gains and losses.

•

Policyholder dividends and interest credited to policyholders’ account balances that relate to certain foreign life policies and certain domestic
group life policies, respectively, that pass back certain realized investment gains and losses to the policyholder, and reserves for future policy benefits for certain policies where cash flows are affected by net realized investment gains and
losses.

•

Market value adjustments paid or received upon a contractholder’s surrender of certain of the Company’s annuity products as these amounts
mitigate the net realized investment gains or losses incurred upon the disposition of the underlying invested assets.

Investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities due
to asset value changes

Certain products
included in the Retirement and International Insurance segments are experience-rated in that investment results associated with these products are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. The majority of investments supporting these
experience-rated products are classified as trading and are carried at fair value, with realized and unrealized gains and losses reported in “Asset management fees and other income.” To a lesser extent, these experience-rated products are
also supported by derivatives and commercial mortgage and other loans. The derivatives are carried at fair value, with realized and unrealized gains and losses reported in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” The commercial mortgage
and other loans are carried at unpaid principal, net of unamortized discounts and an allowance for losses, with gains and losses on sales and changes in the valuation allowance for commercial mortgage and other loans reported in “Realized
investment gains (losses), net.”



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Adjusted operating income excludes net investment gains and losses on trading account
assets supporting insurance liabilities, which is consistent with the exclusion of realized investment gains and losses with respect to other investments supporting insurance liabilities managed on a consistent basis. In addition, to be consistent
with the historical treatment of charges related to realized investment gains and losses on investments, adjusted operating income also excludes the change in contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes in the pool of investments
(including changes in the fair value of commercial mortgage and other loans) supporting these experience-rated contracts, which are reflected in “Interest credited to policyholders’ account balances.” These adjustments are in addition
to the exclusion from adjusted operating income of net investment gains and losses on the related derivatives and commercial mortgage and other loans through

“Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related charges and
adjustments,”

as discussed above. The result of this approach is that adjusted operating income for these products includes net fee revenue and interest spread the Company earns on these experience-rated contracts, and excludes changes in
fair value of the pool of investments, both realized and unrealized, that are expected to ultimately accrue to the contractholders.

Divested businesses

The contribution to income/loss of divested businesses that have been or will be sold or exited, including businesses that have been
placed in wind down, but that did not qualify for “discontinued operations” accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP, are excluded from adjusted operating income as the results of divested businesses are not relevant to understanding the
Company’s ongoing operating results.

In July
2012, the Company announced its decision to cease sales of group long-term care insurance reflecting the challenging economics of the long-term care market including the continued low interest rate environment as well as its desire to focus
resources on its core group life and disability businesses. The Company discontinued sales of group long-term care products effective August 1, 2012, or a later date as may be required by specific state law. The Company notified its clients of
its intent to continue to accept enrollments on existing group long-term care contracts through June 30, 2013 or later as required by contractual provisions. In March 2012, the Company also discontinued sales of individual long-term care
products. As a result of the decision to wind down this business, the Company has reflected the results of the long-term care insurance business, previously reported within the Group Insurance segment, as a divested business for all periods
presented.

Equity in earnings of operating joint ventures and
earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests

Equity in earnings of operating joint ventures, on a pre-tax basis, are included in adjusted operating income as these results are a principal source of earnings. These earnings are reflected on a U.S.
GAAP basis on an after-tax basis as a separate line on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests are excluded from adjusted operating income. Earnings attributable to noncontrolling
interests represents the portion of earnings from consolidated entities that relates to the equity interests of minority investors, and are reflected on a U.S. GAAP basis as a separate line on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

23.    COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND LITIGATION AND
REGULATORY MATTERS

Commitments and Guarantees

The Company occupies leased office space in many locations
under various long-term leases and has entered into numerous leases covering the long-term use of computers and other equipment. Rental expense, net of sub-lease income, incurred for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $287
million, $280 million and $199 million, respectively.

The following table presents, at December 31, 2012, the Company’s future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases along with associated sub-lease income:

Occasionally, for business
reasons, the Company may exit certain non-cancelable operating leases prior to their expiration. In these instances, the Company’s policy is to accrue, at the time it ceases to use the property being leased, the future rental expense net of any
expected sub-lease income, and to release this reserve over the remaining commitment period. Of the total non-cancelable operating leases and sub-lease income amounts listed above, $10 million and $10 million, respectively, has been accrued at
December 31, 2012.

Commercial Mortgage Loan
Commitments



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

In connection with the Company’s commercial mortgage operations, it originates
commercial mortgage loans. Commitments for loans that will be held for sale are recognized as derivatives and recorded at fair value. In certain of these transactions, the Company pre-arranges that it will sell the loan to an investor, including to
governmental sponsored entities as discussed below, after the Company funds the loan.

Commitments to Purchase Investments (excluding Commercial Mortgage Loans)

(1)

Includes remaining commitments of $200 million and $385 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, related to the Company’s agreement to co-invest
with the Fosun Group (Fosun) in a private equity fund, managed by Fosun, for the Chinese marketplace.

The Company has other commitments to purchase or fund investments, some of which are contingent upon events or circumstances not under the
Company’s control, including those at the discretion of the Company’s counterparties. The Company anticipates a portion of these commitments will ultimately be funded from its separate accounts. Some of the separate account commitments
have recourse to Prudential Insurance if the separate accounts are unable to fund the amounts when due.

Guarantees of Investee Debt

A number of guarantees
provided by the Company relate to real estate investments held in its separate accounts, in which entities that the separate account has invested in have borrowed funds, and the Company has guaranteed their obligations. The Company provides these
guarantees to assist these entities in obtaining financing. The Company’s maximum potential exposure under these guarantees is mostly limited to the assets of the separate account. The exposure that is not limited to the separate account assets
relates mostly to guarantees limited to fraud, criminal activity or other bad acts. These guarantees generally expire at various times over the next twenty four years. At December 31, 2012, the Company’s assessment is that it is unlikely
payments will be required. Any payments that may become required under these guarantees would either first be reduced by proceeds received by the creditor on a sale of the underlying collateral, or would provide rights to obtain the underlying
collateral.

Indemnification of Securities Lending
Transactions



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

In the normal course of business, the Company may facilitate securities lending
transactions on behalf of mutual funds and separate accounts for which the Company is the investment advisor and/or the asset manager. In certain of these arrangements, the Company has provided an indemnification to the mutual funds or separate
accounts to hold them harmless against losses caused by counterparty (i.e., borrower) defaults associated with the securities lending activity facilitated by the Company. Collateral is provided by the counterparty to the mutual fund or separate
account at the inception of the loan equal to or greater than 102% of the fair value of the loaned securities and the collateral is maintained daily at 102% or greater of the fair value of the loaned securities. The Company is only at risk if the
counterparty to the securities lending transaction defaults and the value of the collateral held is less than the value of the securities loaned to such counterparty. The Company believes the possibility of any payments under these indemnities is
remote.

Credit Derivatives Written

As discussed further in Note 21, the Company writes credit
derivatives under which the Company is obligated to pay the counterparty the referenced amount of the contract and receive in return the defaulted security or similar security.

Guarantees of Asset Values

Certain contracts
underwritten by the Retirement segment include guarantees related to financial assets owned by the guaranteed party. These contracts are accounted for as derivatives and carried at fair value. The collateral supporting these guarantees is not
reflected on the Company’s balance sheet.

Guarantees
of Credit Enhancements

The Company arranges for
credit enhancements of certain debt instruments that provide financing primarily for affordable multi-family real estate assets, including certain tax-exempt bond financings. The credit enhancements provide assurances to the debt holders as to the
timely payment of amounts due under the debt instruments. The remaining contractual maturities for these guarantees are up to fifteen years. The Company’s obligations to reimburse required credit enhancement payments are secured by mortgages on
the related real estate. The Company receives certain ongoing fees for providing these enhancement arrangements and anticipates the extinguishment of its obligation under these enhancements prior to maturity through the aggregation and transfer of
its positions to a substitute enhancement provider.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Indemnification of Serviced Mortgage Loans

As part of the commercial
mortgage activities of the Company’s Asset Management segment, the Company provides commercial mortgage origination, underwriting and servicing for certain government sponsored entities, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Company has
agreed to indemnify the government sponsored entities for a portion of the credit risk associated with certain of the mortgages it services through a delegated authority arrangement. Under these arrangements, the Company originates multi-family
mortgages for sale to the government sponsored entities based on underwriting standards they specify, and makes payments to them for a specified percentage share of losses they incur on certain loans serviced by the Company. The Company’s
percentage share of losses incurred generally varies from 2% to 20% of the loan balance, and is typically based on a first-loss exposure for a stated percentage of the loan balance, plus a shared exposure with the government sponsored entity for any
losses in excess of the stated first-loss percentage, subject to a contractually specified maximum percentage. The Company services $8,428 million of mortgages subject to these loss-sharing arrangements as of December 31, 2012, all of which are
collateralized by first priority liens on the underlying multi-family residential properties. As of December 31, 2012, these mortgages had an average debt service coverage ratio of 1.83 times and an average loan-to-value ratio of 63%. The
Company’s total share of losses related to indemnifications that were settled was $2 million, $1 million, and $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.

Contingent Consideration

In connection with an
acquisition of an operating joint venture, the Company has agreed to pay additional consideration in future periods, contingent upon the attainment by the acquired business of defined operating objectives. The arrangement will be resolved over the
following six months. Any payment would result in an increase to the Company’s investment in the operating joint venture. The Company considers the likelihood that the acquired business attains the defined operating objectives to be remote.

Other Guarantees

The Company is also subject
to other financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements. The Company has provided indemnities and guarantees related to acquisitions, dispositions, investments and other transactions that are triggered by, among other things, breaches of
representations, warranties or covenants provided by the Company. These obligations are typically subject to various time limitations, defined by the contract or by operation of law, such as statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum
potential obligation is subject to



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

contractual limitations, while in other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable. Included above are $299 million and $300 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011,
respectively, of yield maintenance guarantees related to certain investments the Company sold. The Company does not expect to make any payments on these guarantees and is not carrying any liabilities associated with these guarantees.

Since certain of these obligations are not subject to
limitations, it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount due under these guarantees. The accrued liabilities identified above do not include retained liabilities associated with sold businesses.

Insolvency Assessments

Most of the jurisdictions in which the Company is admitted
to transact business require insurers doing business within the jurisdiction to participate in guarantee associations, which are organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issues by impaired, insolvent or failed
insurers. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired,
insolvent or failed insurer engaged. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. In addition, Japan has established the Japan Policyholders Protection Corporation as a contingency to
protect policyholders against the insolvency of life insurance companies in Japan through assessments to companies licensed to provide life insurance.

Assets and liabilities held for insolvency assessments were as follows:

Contingent Liabilities

On an ongoing basis, the Company’s
internal supervisory and control functions review the quality of sales, marketing and other customer interface procedures and practices and may recommend modifications or enhancements. From time to time, this review process results in the discovery
of product administration, servicing or other errors, including errors relating to the timing or amount of payments or contract values due to customers. In certain cases, if appropriate, the Company may offer customers remediation and may incur
charges, including the cost of such remediation, administrative costs and regulatory fines.

The Company is subject to the laws and regulations of states and other jurisdictions concerning the identification, reporting and escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned funds, and is subject to audit and
examination for compliance with these requirements. For additional discussion of these matters, see “Litigation and Regulatory Matters” below.

It is possible that the results of operations or the cash flow of the Company in a particular quarterly or annual period could be
materially affected as a result of payments in connection with the matters discussed above or other matters depending, in part, upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period. Management believes, however, that ultimate payments in
connection with these matters, after consideration of applicable reserves and rights to indemnification, should not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Litigation and Regulatory Matters

The Company is subject to legal and regulatory actions in the ordinary course of its businesses. Pending legal
and regulatory actions include proceedings relating to aspects of the Company’s businesses and operations that are specific to it and proceedings that are typical of the businesses in which it operates, including in both cases businesses that
have been either divested or placed in wind-down status. Some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants. In certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts,
including punitive or exemplary damages. The outcome of litigation or a regulatory matter, and the amount or range of potential loss at any particular time, is often inherently uncertain.

The Company establishes accruals for litigation and regulatory matters when it is probable that a loss has been
incurred and the amount of that loss can be reasonably estimated. For litigation and regulatory matters where a loss may be reasonably possible, but not probable, or is probable but not reasonably estimable, no accrual is established but the matter,
if material, is disclosed, including matters discussed below. The Company estimates that as of December 31, 2012, the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accruals established for those litigation and regulatory matters
for which such an estimate currently can be made is $0 to approximately $225 million. This estimate is not an indication of expected loss, if any, or the Company’s maximum possible loss exposure on such matters. The Company reviews relevant
information with respect to its litigation and regulatory matters on a quarterly and annual basis and updates its accruals, disclosures and estimates of reasonably possible loss based on such reviews.

action on behalf of the State of Florida,

Total Asset Recovery Services v. Met Life Inc., et al., Manulife Financial Corporation, et. al., Prudential Financial, Inc., The Prudential Insurance Company of America, and Prudential Insurance
Agency, LLC.,

filed in the Circuit Court of Leon County, Florida, was served on the Company. The complaint alleges that the Company failed to escheat life insurance proceeds to the State of Florida in violation of the Florida False Claims Act
and seeks injunctive relief, compensatory damages, civil penalties, treble damages, prejudgment interest, attorneys’ fees and costs.

In September 2012, the State of West Virginia, through its State Treasurer, filed a lawsuit,

State of West Virginia ex. Rel. John D.

violation of the Minnesota False Claims Act and seeks injunctive relief, compensatory damages, civil penalties, treble damages, prejudgment interest, attorneys’ fees and costs. In June 2012,
the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. In December 2012, the Court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss, and the complaint was dismissed with prejudice.

In January 2012, a Global Resolution Agreement entered into
by the Company and a third party auditor became effective upon its acceptance by the unclaimed property departments of 20 states and jurisdictions. Under the terms of the Global Resolution Agreement, the third party auditor acting on behalf of the
signatory states will compare expanded matching criteria to the Social Security Master Death File (“SSMDF”) to identify deceased insureds and contract holders where a valid claim has not been made. In February 2012, a Regulatory Settlement
Agreement entered into by the Company to resolve a multi-state market conduct examination regarding its adherence to state claim settlement practices became effective upon its acceptance by the insurance departments of 20 states and jurisdictions.
The Regulatory Settlement Agreement applies prospectively and requires the Company to adopt and implement additional procedures comparing its records to the SSMDF to identify unclaimed death benefits and prescribes procedures for identifying and
locating beneficiaries once deaths are identified. Other jurisdictions that are not signatories to the Regulatory Settlement Agreement are considering proposals that would apply prospectively and require life insurance companies to take additional
steps to identify unreported deceased policy and contract holders. These prospective changes and any escheatable property identified as a result of the audits and inquiries could result in: (1) additional payments of previously unclaimed death
benefits; (2) the payment of abandoned funds to U.S. jurisdictions; and (3) changes in the Company’s practices and procedures for the identification of escheatable funds and beneficiaries, which would impact claim payments and
reserves, among other consequences.

The Company
is one of several companies subpoenaed by the New York Attorney General regarding its unclaimed property procedures. Additionally, the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) has requested that 172 life insurers
(including the Company) provide data to the NYDFS regarding use of the SSMDF. The New York Office of Unclaimed Funds recently notified the Company that it intends to conduct an audit of the Company’s compliance with New York’s unclaimed
property laws. The Minnesota Attorney General has also requested information regarding the Company’s use of the SSMDF and its claim handling procedures and the Company is one of several companies subpoenaed by the Minnesota Department of
Commerce, Insurance Division. In February, 2012, the Massachusetts Office of the Attorney General requested information regarding the Company’s unclaimed property procedures.

From July 2010 to December 2010, four purported nationwide
class actions were filed challenging the use of retained asset accounts to settle death benefit claims of beneficiaries of a group life insurance contract owned by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs that covers the lives of members and
veterans of the U.S. armed forces. In 2011, the cases were consolidated in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts by the Judicial Panel for Multi-District Litigation as

In re Prudential Insurance Company of America
SGLI/VGLI Contract Litigation.

The consolidated complaint alleges that the use of the retained assets accounts that earn interest and are available to be withdrawn by the beneficiary, in whole or in part, at any time, to settle death benefit
claims is in violation of federal law, and asserts claims of breach of contract, breaches of fiduciary duty and the duty of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and unjust enrichment and seeks compensatory and punitive damages, disgorgement of
profits, equitable relief and pre and post-judgment interest. In March 2011, the motion to dismiss was denied. In January 2012, plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the class. In August 2012, the court denied plaintiffs’ class certification
motion without prejudice pending the filing of summary judgment motions on the issue of whether plaintiffs sustained an actual injury. In October 2012, the parties filed their summary judgment motions.

In September 2010,

Huffman v. The Prudential Insurance
Company

, a purported nationwide class action brought on behalf of beneficiaries of group life insurance contracts owned by ERISA-governed employee welfare benefit plans was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania, challenging the use of retained asset accounts in employee welfare benefit plans to settle death benefit claims as a violation of ERISA and seeking injunctive relief and disgorgement of profits. In July 2011, the Company’s motion
for



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

judgment on the pleadings was denied. In February 2012, plaintiffs filed a motion to certify the class. In April 2012, the Court stayed the case pending the outcome of a case involving another
insurer that is on appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.

In January 2011, a purported state-wide class action,

Garcia v. The Prudential Insurance Company of America

was dismissed by the Second Judicial District Court, Washoe County, Nevada. The complaint
was brought on behalf of Nevada beneficiaries of individual life insurance policies for which, unless the beneficiaries elected another settlement method, death benefits were placed in retained asset accounts. The complaint alleges that by failing
to disclose material information about the accounts, the Company wrongfully delayed payment and improperly retained undisclosed profits, and seeks damages, injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees and pre and post-judgment interest. In February 2011,
plaintiff appealed the dismissal to the Nevada Supreme Court. As previously reported, in December 2009, an earlier purported nationwide class action raising substantially similar allegations brought by the same plaintiff in the United States
District Court for the District of New Jersey,

Garcia v. Prudential Insurance Company of America

, was dismissed. In December 2011, plaintiff appealed the dismissal. In January 2013, the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the
complaint.

In December 2010, a purported
state-wide class action complaint,

Phillips v. Prudential Financial, Inc

., was filed in state court and removed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. The complaint makes allegations under Illinois law,
substantially similar to the

Garcia

cases, on behalf of a class of Illinois residents whose death benefit claims were settled by retained assets accounts. In March 2011, the complaint was amended to drop the Company as a defendant and add
Pruco Life Insurance Company as a defendant and is now captioned

Phillips v. Prudential Insurance and Pruco Life Insurance Company

. In November 2011, the complaint was dismissed. In December 2011, plaintiff appealed the dismissal.

In July 2010, the Company, along with other life insurance
industry participants, received a formal request for information from the State of New York Attorney General’s Office in connection with its investigation into industry practices relating to the use of retained asset accounts. In August 2010,
the Company received a similar request for information from the State of Connecticut Attorney General’s Office. The Company is cooperating with these investigations. The Company has also been contacted by state insurance regulators and other
governmental entities, including the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Congressional committees regarding retained asset accounts. These matters may result in additional investigations, information requests, claims, hearings, litigation,
adverse publicity and potential changes to business practices.

In February 2011, a fifth amended complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in

Clark v. Prudential Insurance Company

. The complaint
brought on behalf of a purported class of California, Indiana, Ohio and Texas residents who purchased individual health insurance policies alleges that Prudential Insurance failed to disclose that it had ceased selling this type of policy in 1981
and that, as a result, premiums would increase significantly. The complaint alleges claims of fraudulent misrepresentation and omission, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and California’s Unfair Competition Law and seeks
compensatory and punitive damages. The matter was originally filed in 2008 and certain of the claims in the first four complaints were dismissed. In February 2012, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification. In July 2012, Prudential Insurance
moved for summary judgment on certain of plaintiffs’ claims. In February 2013, the Court denied plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and granted the motion by Prudential Insurance for summary judgment against two of the named
plaintiffs and denied summary judgment against two other plaintiffs.

In April 2009,

Schultz v. The Prudential Insurance Company of America,

a purported nationwide class action on behalf of participants claiming disability benefits under certain employee benefit
plans insured by Prudential, was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. As amended, the complaint alleges that Prudential Insurance and the defendant plans violated ERISA by characterizing family Social
Security benefits as “loss of time” benefits that were offset against Prudential contract benefits. The complaint seeks a declaratory judgment that the offsets were improper, damages and other relief. The Company has agreed to indemnify
the named defendant plans. In April 2011,

Schultz

was dismissed with prejudice, and plaintiffs appealed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. In March 2012, the court affirmed the dismissal.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

From November 2002 to March 2005, eleven separate complaints were filed against the
Company and the law firm of Leeds Morelli & Brown in New Jersey state court and in the New Jersey Superior Court, Essex County as

Lederman v. Prudential Financial, Inc., et al.

The complaints allege that an alternative dispute
resolution agreement entered into among Prudential Insurance, over 235 claimants who are current and former Prudential Insurance employees, and Leeds Morelli & Brown (the law firm representing the claimants) was illegal and that Prudential
Insurance conspired with Leeds Morelli & Brown to commit fraud, malpractice, breach of contract, and violate racketeering laws by advancing legal fees to the law firm with the purpose of limiting Prudential’s liability to the
claimants. In February 2010, the New Jersey Supreme Court assigned the cases for centralized case management to the Superior Court, Bergen County. The Company participated in a court-ordered mediation that resulted in a settlement involving 193 of
the remaining 235 plaintiffs. The amounts paid to the 193 plaintiffs were within existing reserves for this matter. The remaining plaintiffs continue to pursue their individual lawsuits, and have filed offers of judgment totaling approximately $90
million. In February 2012, the court granted summary judgment against two of the remaining plaintiffs. In June 2012, the court granted summary judgment against an additional plaintiff reducing to 39 the number of plaintiffs asserting claims against
the Company.

Retirement Solutions and
Investment Management

In October 2007,
Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity Co. (“PRIAC”) filed an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,

Prudential Retirement Insurance & Annuity Co. v. State Street Global
Advisors,

in PRIAC’s fiduciary capacity and on behalf of certain defined benefit and defined contribution plan clients of PRIAC, against an unaffiliated asset manager, State Street Global Advisors (“SSgA”) and SSgA’s
affiliate, State Street Bank and Trust Company (“State Street”). This action seeks, among other relief, restitution of certain losses attributable to certain investment funds sold by SSgA as to which PRIAC believes SSgA employed investment
strategies and practices that were misrepresented by SSgA and failed to exercise the standard of care of a prudent investment manager. Given the unusual circumstances surrounding the management of these SSgA funds and in order to protect the
interests of the affected plans and their participants while PRIAC pursues these remedies, PRIAC implemented a process under which affected plan clients that authorized PRIAC to proceed on their behalf have received payments from funds provided by
PRIAC for the losses referred to above. The Company’s consolidated financial statements, and the results of the Retirement segment included in the Company’s U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division, for the year ended
December 31, 2007 include a pre-tax charge of $82 million, reflecting these payments to plan clients and certain related costs. In September 2008, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York denied the State Street
defendants’ motion to dismiss claims for damages and other relief under Section 502(a)(2) of ERISA, but dismissed the claims for equitable relief under Section 502(a)(3) of ERISA. In October 2008, defendants answered the complaint and
asserted counterclaims for contribution and indemnification, defamation and violations of Massachusetts’ unfair and deceptive trade practices law. In February 2010, State Street reached a settlement with the SEC over charges that it misled
investors about their exposure to sub-prime investments, resulting in significant investor losses in mid-2007. Under the settlement, State Street paid approximately $313 million in disgorgement, pre-judgment interest, penalty and compensation into a
Fair Fund that was distributed to injured investors and consequently, State Street paid PRIAC, for deposit into its separate accounts, approximately $52.5 million. By the terms of the settlement, State Street’s payment to PRIAC does not resolve
any claims PRIAC has against State Street or SSgA in connection with the losses in the investment funds SSgA managed, and the penalty component of State Street’s SEC settlement cannot be used to offset or reduce compensatory damages in the
action against State Street and SSgA. In June 2010, PRIAC moved for partial summary judgment on State Street’s counterclaims. At the same time, State Street moved for summary judgment on PRIAC’s complaint. In March 2011, the district court
denied State Street’s motion for summary judgment and denied in part and granted in part PRIAC’s motion for partial summary judgment on State Street’s counterclaims. In October 2011, the court held a bench trial to determine whether
State Street had breached its fiduciary duty to PRIAC’s plan clients. In February 2012, the court issued a decision holding that State Street breached its fiduciary duty to the plans under ERISA to manage the investment funds prudently and
to diversify them. The court held that PRIAC did not prove that State Street breached its duty of loyalty to the plans under ERISA. The court held that State Street’s breaches caused the plans’ losses in the amount of $76.7
million and,



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

after crediting State Street for an earlier payment, awarded $28.1 million in damages in addition to the amount previously recovered as a result of the SEC settlement. The court
did not rule on State Street’s counterclaims and reserved judgment on PRIAC’s requests for pre-judgment interest and attorney’s fees. In May 2012, the Company filed a motion seeking partial summary judgment to dismiss State
Street’s counterclaims which was denied by the court in November 2012. In December 2012, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the matter. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, PRIAC received $33 million in addition to the
amount previously recovered as a result of the SEC settlement. These recoveries reimburse PRIAC for amounts previously paid to the plans for their losses and related costs. In January 2013, the action was dismissed with prejudice in accordance with
the settlement.

Other Matters

In October 2012, a shareholder derivative lawsuit,

Stephen
Silverman, Derivatively on Behalf of Prudential Financial, Inc. v. John R. Strangfeld, et. al.

, was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging breaches of fiduciary duties, waste of corporate assets and
unjust enrichment by certain senior officers and directors. The complaint names as defendants the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Principal Accounting Officer, the Company’s Board of Directors and a
former Director. The complaint alleges that the defendants made false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s current and future financial condition based on, among other things, the alleged failure to disclose: (i) potential
liability for benefits that should either have been paid to policyholders or their beneficiaries, or escheated to applicable states; and (ii) the extent of the Company’s exposure for alleged state and federal law violations concerning the
settlement of claims and the escheatment of unclaimed property. The complaint seeks an undetermined amount of damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, and equitable relief including a direction for the Company to reform and to improve its corporate
governance and internal procedures to comply with applicable laws.

In October 2012, the Board of Directors received a shareholder demand letter (the “Demand”), containing allegations of wrongdoing similar to those alleged in the

Silverman

complaint. The
Demand alleges that the Company’s Senior Management: (i) breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and good faith in connection with the management, operation and oversight of the Company’s business; (ii) breached their
fiduciary duty of good faith to establish and maintain adequate internal controls; and (iii) breached their fiduciary duties by disseminating false, misleading and/or incomplete information, all in connection with the Company’s alleged
failure to use the SSDMF and to pay beneficiaries and escheat funds to states. The Demand requests that the Board of Directors: (a) undertake an independent internal investigation into Senior Management’s violations of New Jersey and/or
federal law; and (b) commence a civil action against each member of Senior Management to recover for the benefit of the Company the amount of damages sustained by the Company as a result of the alleged breaches described above.

In August 2012, a purported class action lawsuit,

City of
Sterling Heights General Employees’ Retirement System v. Prudential Financial, Inc., et al.

, was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging violations of federal securities law. The complaint names as
defendants the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Principal Accounting Officer and certain Company Board of Directors. The complaint alleges that knowingly false and misleading statements were made regarding the
Company’s current and future financial condition based on, among other things, the alleged failure to disclose: (i) potential liability for benefits that should either have been paid to policyholders or their beneficiaries, or escheated to
applicable states; and (ii) the extent of the Company’s exposure for alleged state and federal law violations concerning the settlement of claims and the escheatment of unclaimed property. The complaint seeks an undetermined amount of
damages, interest, attorneys’ fees and costs.

In October 2006, a purported class action lawsuit,

Bouder v. Prudential Financial, Inc. and Prudential Insurance Company of
America

, was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey,



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

claiming that Prudential failed to pay overtime to insurance agents in violation of federal and Pennsylvania law, and that improper deductions were made from these agents’ wages in violation
of state law. The complaint seeks back overtime pay and statutory damages, recovery of improper deductions, interest, and attorneys’ fees. In March 2008, the court conditionally certified a nationwide class on the federal overtime claim.
Separately, in March 2008, a purported nationwide class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California,

Wang v. Prudential Financial, Inc. and Prudential Insurance,

claiming that the
Company failed to pay its agents overtime and provide other benefits in violation of California and federal law and seeking compensatory and punitive damages in unspecified amounts. In September 2008,

Wang

was transferred to the United States
District Court for the District of New Jersey and consolidated with the

Bouder

matter. Subsequent amendments to the complaint have resulted in additional allegations involving purported violations of an additional nine states’ overtime
and wage payment laws. In February 2010, Prudential moved to decertify the federal overtime class that had been conditionally certified in March 2008 and moved for summary judgment on the federal overtime claims of the named plaintiffs. In July
2010, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification of the state law claims. In August 2010, the district court granted Prudential’s motion for summary judgment, dismissing the federal overtime claims. In January 2013, the Court denied
plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in its entirety.

In April 2012, the Company filed two actions in New Jersey state court captioned

The Prudential Insurance Company of America, et al. v. JP Morgan Chase, et al.

and

The Prudential Insurance
Company of America, et al. v. Morgan Stanley, et al.

Both matters seek to recover damages attributable to Company and affiliate entities’ and funds’ investments in residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”). Among other
allegations stemming from the defendants’ origination, underwriting and sales of RMBS, the complaints assert claims of common law fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breaches of the New Jersey Uniform Securities Act and breaches of the New
Jersey Civil RICO statute. The complaints seek unspecified damages. In August 2012, the Company filed four additional actions in New Jersey state court captioned

The Prudential Insurance Company of America, et al.

v.

Nomura Securities
International, Inc., et al.

,

The Prudential Insurance Company of America, et al.

v.

Barclays Bank PLC, et al,, The Prudential Insurance Company of America, et al.

v.

Goldman Sachs & Company, et al.

and

The
Prudential Insurance Company of America, et al.

v.

RBS Financial Products, Inc., et al.

upon the same grounds and seeking the same damages, as articulated above. In November 2012, the Company filed a similar matter captioned

The
Prudential Insurance Company of America v. Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, et al.

In December 2012, the

Goldman Sachs

matter was removed to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In December 2012, defendants
filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. In January 2013, the

Morgan Stanley

defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.

Summary

The Company’s litigation and regulatory matters are subject to many uncertainties, and given their complexity and scope, their
outcome cannot be predicted. It is possible that the Company’s results of operations or cash flow in a particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of pending litigation and regulatory
matters depending, in part, upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period. In light of the unpredictability of the Company’s litigation and regulatory matters, it is also possible that in certain cases an ultimate unfavorable
resolution of one or more pending litigation or regulatory matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. Management believes, however, that, based on information currently known to it, the ultimate outcome of
all pending litigation and regulatory matters, after consideration of applicable reserves and rights to indemnification, is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position.

24.    QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED)

The unaudited quarterly results of
operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 are summarized in the table below:

(1)

Quarterly earnings per share amounts may not add to the full year amounts due to the averaging of shares.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The quarterly historical information presented in the table above has been revised to
reflect the impact of the retrospective adoption of the amended guidance related to the deferral of acquisition costs as well as the impact of retrospective application of a change in method of applying an accounting principle for the Company’s
pension plans. The pension plan accounting change resulted in an increase in net income of $24 million for each quarter of 2012 ($0.05 diluted earnings per share of Common stock). For further information, see Notes 2 and 18.

Results for the second quarter of 2012 include a total
pre-tax charge of $122 million related to two out of period adjustments recorded by the Company. The first adjustment related to a decline in the value of a real estate-related investment. Based on a review of the underlying collateral and a related
guarantee, the Company determined that impairments of $75 million should have been recognized, $61 million of which related to prior periods. The second adjustment consisted of an increase of $61 million in reserves for estimated payments arising
from use of new Social Security Master Death File matching criteria to identify deceased policy and contract holders. The initial calculation of the reserve excluded certain life policies in extended term status from the analysis used to identify
potential claims.

Results for the fourth quarter
of 2012 include a total pre-tax charge of $54 million related to an out of period adjustment recorded by the Company due to an understatement of recorded liabilities for certain employee benefits based on a review of the consistency of recognition
of such liabilities.

Results for the first
quarter of 2011 include a pre-tax charge of $95 million related to an out of period adjustment recorded by the Company. The adjustment is related to the amortization of unrealized losses associated with U.S. dollar-denominated collateralized
mortgage-backed securities held by the Gibraltar Life Insurance Company, Ltd. consolidated operations (“Gibraltar Life operations”), that were reclassified from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity in December 2008. The adjustment, which
had no impact on the carrying value of these securities, resulted from using the contractual maturities of the securities rather than the expected effective duration of the securities as the basis for the amortization of the unrealized losses that
existed when the securities were reclassified.

PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Supplemental Combining Financial Information

1.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The supplemental combining financial
information presents the consolidated financial position and results of operations for Prudential Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries (together, the “Company”), separately reporting the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block
Business. The Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business are both fully integrated operations of the Company and are not separate legal entities. The supplemental combining financial information presents the results of the Financial
Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business as if they were separate reporting entities and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company has outstanding two classes of common stock. The
Common Stock reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Class B Stock reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business.

The Closed Block Business was established on the date of demutualization and includes the assets and liabilities of the Closed Block (see
Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Closed Block). It also includes assets held outside the Closed Block necessary to meet insurance regulatory capital requirements related to products included within the Closed
Block; deferred policy acquisition costs related to the Closed Block policies; the principal amount of the IHC debt (as discussed below and in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and related unamortized debt issuance costs, as well as
an interest rate swap related to the IHC debt; and certain other related assets and liabilities. The Financial Services Businesses consist of the U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management, U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance, and
International Insurance divisions and Corporate and Other operations.

2.    ALLOCATION OF RESULTS

This supplemental combining financial
information reflects the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses directly attributable to the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, as well as allocations deemed reasonable by management in order to fairly present the
financial position and results of operations of the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business on a stand-alone basis. While management considers the allocations utilized to be reasonable, management has the discretion to make
operational and financial decisions that may affect the allocation methods and resulting assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of each business. In addition, management has limited discretion over accounting policies and the appropriate
allocation of earnings between the two businesses. The Company is subject to agreements which provide that, in most instances, the Company may not change the allocation methodology or accounting policies for the allocation of earnings between the
Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business without the prior consent of the Class B Stock holders or IHC debt bond insurer.

General corporate overhead not directly attributable to a specific business that has been incurred in connection with the generation of
the businesses’ revenues is generally allocated between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business based on the general and administrative expenses of each business as a percentage of the total general and administrative
expenses for all businesses.

PHLLC has
outstanding IHC debt, of which net proceeds of $1.66 billion were allocated to the Financial Services Businesses concurrent with the demutualization on December 18, 2001. The IHC debt is serviced by the cash flows of the Closed Block Business,
and the results of the Closed Block Business reflect interest expense associated with the IHC debt.

Income taxes are allocated between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business as if they were separate companies based on the taxable income or losses and other tax characterizations
of each business. If the Financial Services Businesses generate tax benefits, such as net operating losses, it is entitled to record such tax benefits to the extent they are expected to be utilized on a consolidated basis. However, if the Closed
Block Business generates tax benefits, it will receive the full benefit in cash, and the Financial Services Businesses will subsequently recover the payment at the time the benefits are actually utilized on a consolidated basis.



Holders of Common Stock have no interest in a separate legal entity representing the
Financial Services Businesses; holders of the Class B Stock have no interest in a separate legal entity representing the Closed Block Business; and holders of each class of common stock are subject to all of the risks associated with an investment
in the Company.

In the event of a liquidation,
dissolution or winding-up of the Company, holders of Common Stock and holders of Class B Stock would be entitled to receive a proportionate share of the net assets of the Company that remain after paying all liabilities and the liquidation
preferences of any preferred stock.

The results
of the Financial Services Businesses are subject to certain risks pertaining to the Closed Block. These include any expenses and liabilities from litigation affecting the Closed Block policies as well as the consequences of certain potential adverse
tax determinations. In connection with the sale of the Class B Stock and IHC debt, the cost of indemnifying the investors with respect to certain matters will be borne by the Financial Services Businesses.

shares of Common Stock, respectively, were distributed to former participants of the Plan upon their retirement from the Board, leaving a balance of 241,700

s

hares of Common Stock available for future distribution. The Company will register
additional shares on Form S-8 in the future, if necessary.

Prudential Financial, Inc. (“Prudential Financial”) was incorporated on December 28, 1999 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
The Prudential Insurance Company of America. On December 18, 2001, The Prudential Insurance Company of America converted from a mutual life insurance company to a stock life insurance company and became an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of
Prudential Financial.

The condensed financial
statements of Prudential Financial reflect its direct wholly-owned subsidiaries using the equity method of accounting.

Certain amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

2.    OTHER INVESTMENTS

Prudential Financial’s other investments as of
December 31, 2012 and 2011 primarily consisted of government agency securities and money market funds.

The weighted average interest rate on outstanding commercial paper was 0.41% and 0.38% at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

to 6.6% in 2011.

Long-term Debt

In order to modify exposure to interest
rate movements, Prudential Financial utilizes derivative instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt issues. The impact of these derivative instruments are not reflected in the rates presented in the table above.

5.    COMMITMENTS AND
GUARANTEES

Prudential Financial has issued a
subordinated guarantee covering a subsidiary’s domestic commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2012, there was $359 million outstanding under this commercial paper program.

Prudential Financial has provided guarantees of the payment of principal and interest on inter-company loans
between affiliates. As of December 31, 2012, Prudential Financial had issued guarantees of outstanding loans totaling $4.2 billion between International Insurance subsidiaries and other affiliates.

In 2011, Prudential Financial provided a guarantee of the
obligations of a captive reinsurance subsidiary under a $2.0 billion letter of credit facility entered into by the captive subsidiary in support of its obligations under a reinsurance arrangement relating to the Closed Block Business within
Prudential Insurance. Prudential Financial guarantees all obligations of the captive reinsurance subsidiary under the facility, including its obligation to reimburse any draws on a letter of credit issued under the facility.

In 2004, Prudential Financial entered into a $200 million
liquidity facility agreement with a subsidiary. Under the facility, Prudential Financial may provide loans to the subsidiary from time to time in order to support payment obligations of the subsidiary arising under affiliated reinsurance
arrangements and borrowings. There were no outstanding loans under the facility as of December 31, 2012.

Prudential Financial is also subject to other financial guarantees, net worth maintenance agreements and indemnity arrangements, including
those made in the normal course of businesses guaranteeing the performance of, or representations made by, Prudential Financial subsidiaries. Prudential Financial has provided indemnities and guarantees related to acquisitions and dispositions,
including the sale of its Global Commodities Business in 2011, investments, debt issuances and other transactions, including those provided as part of its on-going operations that are triggered by, among other things, breaches of representations,
warranties or covenants provided by Prudential Financial or its subsidiaries. These obligations are typically subject to various time limitations, defined by the contract or by operation of law, such as statutes of limitation. In some cases, the
maximum potential obligation is subject to contractual limitations, while in other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable. Since certain of these obligations are not subject to limitations, it is not possible to determine the maximum
potential amount due under these guarantees. At December 31, 2012, Prudential Financial has accrued liabilities of $6 million associated with all other financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements.
