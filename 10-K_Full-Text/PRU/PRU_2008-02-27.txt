PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Overview

Prudential Financial, Inc., a financial services leader with approximately $648 billion of assets under management as of December 31, 2007, has operations in the United States, Asia, Europe and Latin America. Through our subsidiaries
and affiliates, we offer a wide array of financial products and services, including life insurance, annuities, mutual funds, pension and retirement-related services and administration, investment management, real estate brokerage and relocation
services, and, through a joint venture, retail securities brokerage services. We provide these products and services to individual and institutional customers through one of the largest distribution networks in the financial services industry. Our
principal executive offices are located in Newark, New Jersey.

The businesses of Prudential Financial are separated into the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. The Financial Services Businesses comprises our Insurance, Investment and International Insurance and Investments
divisions and our Corporate and Other operations. The Closed Block Business comprises the assets and related liabilities of the Closed Block described below and certain related assets and liabilities.

Prudential Financial has two classes of common stock outstanding. The Common
Stock, which is publicly traded (NYSE:PRU), reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses, while the Class B Stock, which was issued through a private placement and does not trade on any exchange, reflects the performance of the
Closed Block Business.

Demutualization and Separation of the
Businesses

Demutualization

On December 18, 2001, our date of demutualization, Prudential Insurance
converted from a mutual life insurance company owned by its policyholders to a stock life insurance company and became an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial. The demutualization was carried out under Prudential
Insurance’s Plan of Reorganization, dated as of December 15, 2000, as amended, which we refer to as the Plan of Reorganization. On the date of demutualization, eligible policyholders, as defined in the Plan of Reorganization, received
shares of Prudential Financial’s Common Stock or the right to receive cash or policy credits, which are increases in policy values or increases in other policy benefits, upon the extinguishment of all membership interests in Prudential
Insurance.

On the date of demutualization, Prudential
Financial completed an initial public offering of its Common Stock, as well as the sale of shares of Class B Stock, a separate class of common stock, through a private placement. In addition, on the date of demutualization, Prudential Holdings, LLC,
a wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial that owns the capital stock of Prudential Insurance, issued $1.75 billion in senior secured notes, which we refer to as the IHC debt. A portion of the IHC debt was insured by a bond insurer.
Concurrent with the demutualization, various subsidiaries of Prudential Insurance were reorganized, becoming direct or indirect subsidiaries of Prudential Financial.



The Plan of Reorganization required us to establish and operate a regulatory mechanism known as the
Closed Block. The Closed Block is designed generally to provide for the reasonable expectations of holders of participating individual life insurance policies and annuities included in the Closed Block for future policy dividends after
demutualization by allocating assets that will be used for payment of benefits, including policyholder dividends, on these policies. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Closed Block. The Plan of
Reorganization provided that Prudential Insurance may, with the prior consent of the New Jersey Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, enter into agreements to transfer to a third party all or any part of the risks under the Closed Block policies.
In 2005, we completed the process of arranging reinsurance of the Closed Block. The Closed Block is 90% reinsured, including 17% by a wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial.

Separation of the Businesses

The businesses of Prudential Financial are separated into the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business for financial statement
purposes. For a discussion of the operating results of the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The Financial
Services Businesses comprises our Insurance division, Investment division, and International Insurance and Investments division as well as our Corporate and Other operations. See “—Financial Services Businesses” below for a more
detailed discussion of the divisions comprising the Financial Services Businesses. The Closed Block Business comprises the assets and related liabilities of the Closed Block and certain other assets and liabilities, including the IHC debt. See
“—Closed Block Business” below for a more detailed discussion of the Closed Block Business. We refer to the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business collectively as the Businesses.

The following diagram reflects the allocation of Prudential Financial’s
consolidated assets and liabilities between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business:

There is no legal separation of the
two Businesses. The foregoing allocation of assets and liabilities does not require Prudential Financial, Prudential Insurance, any of their subsidiaries or the Closed Block to transfer any specific assets or liabilities to a separate legal entity.
Financial results of the Closed Block Business, including debt service on the IHC debt, will affect Prudential Financial’s consolidated results of operations, financial position and borrowing costs. In addition, any net losses of the Closed
Block Business, and any dividends or distributions on, or repurchases of, the Class B Stock, will reduce the assets of Prudential Financial legally available for dividends on the Common Stock. Accordingly, you should read the financial information
for the Financial Services Businesses together with the consolidated financial information of Prudential Financial.



The Common Stock reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Class B Stock
reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business. However, the market value of the Common Stock may not reflect solely the performance of the Financial Services Businesses.

In order to separately reflect the financial performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business
since the date of demutualization, we have allocated all our assets and liabilities and earnings between the two Businesses, and we account for them as if they were separate legal entities. All assets and liabilities of Prudential Financial and its
subsidiaries not included in the Closed Block Business constitute the assets and liabilities of the Financial Services Businesses. Assets and liabilities allocated to the Closed Block Business are those that we consider appropriate to operate that
Business. The Closed Block Business consists principally of:

•

within Prudential Insurance, the Closed Block Assets, Surplus and Related Assets (see below), deferred policy acquisition costs and other assets in respect of the
policies included in the Closed Block and, with respect to liabilities, the Closed Block Liabilities;

•

within Prudential Holdings, LLC, the principal amount of the IHC debt, related unamortized debt issuance costs and hedging activities, and a guaranteed investment
contract; and

•

within Prudential Financial, dividends received from Prudential Holdings, LLC, and reinvestment proceeds thereof, and other liabilities of Prudential Financial, in
each case attributable to the Closed Block Business.

The Closed Block Assets consist of (1) those assets initially allocated to the Closed Block including fixed maturities, equity securities, commercial loans and other long- and short-term investments, (2) cash flows from such
assets, (3) assets resulting from the reinvestment of such cash flows, (4) cash flows from the Closed Block Policies, and (5) assets resulting from the investment of cash flows from the Closed Block Policies. The Closed Block Assets
include policy loans, accrued interest on any of the foregoing assets and premiums due on the Closed Block Policies. The Closed Block Liabilities are Closed Block Policies and other liabilities of the Closed Block associated with the Closed Block
Assets. The Closed Block Assets and Closed Block Liabilities are supported by additional assets held outside the Closed Block by Prudential Insurance to provide additional capital with respect to the Closed Block Policies, as well as invested assets
held outside the Closed Block that represent the difference between the Closed Block Assets and the sum of the Closed Block Liabilities and the interest maintenance reserve. We refer to these additional assets and invested assets outside the Closed
Block collectively as the Surplus and Related Assets. The interest maintenance reserve, recorded only under statutory accounting principles, captures realized capital gains and losses resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates.
These gains and losses are amortized into statutory investment income over the expected remaining life of the investments sold.

On the date of demutualization, the majority of the net proceeds from the issuances of the Class B Stock and the IHC debt was allocated to our Financial
Services Businesses. Also, on the date of demutualization, Prudential Holdings, LLC distributed $1.218 billion of the net proceeds of the IHC debt to Prudential Financial to use for general corporate purposes in the Financial Services Businesses.
Prudential Holdings, LLC deposited $437 million of the net proceeds of the IHC debt in a debt service coverage account maintained in the Financial Services Businesses that, together with reinvested earnings thereon, constitutes a source of payment
and security for the IHC debt. The remainder of the net proceeds, $72 million, was used to purchase a guaranteed investment contract to fund a portion of the bond insurance related to the IHC debt. To the extent we use the debt service coverage
account to service payments with respect to the IHC debt or to pay dividends to Prudential Financial for purposes of the Closed Block Business, a loan from the Financial Services Businesses to the Closed Block Business would be established. Such an
inter-business loan would be repaid by the Closed Block Business to the Financial Services Businesses when earnings from the Closed Block Business replenish funds in the debt service coverage account to a specified level.

We believe that the proceeds from the issuances of the Class B Stock and IHC
debt allocated to the Financial Services Businesses reflected capital in excess of that necessary to support the Closed Block Business and that the Closed Block Business as established has sufficient assets and cash flows to service the IHC debt.
The Closed Block Business was financially leveraged through the issuance of the IHC debt, and dividends on the



Class B Stock are subject to prior servicing of the IHC debt. It is expected that any inter-business loan referred to above will be repaid in full out of the
Surplus and Related Assets, but not the Closed Block Assets. Any such loan will be subordinated to the IHC debt.

The Financial Services Businesses will bear any expenses and liabilities from litigation affecting the Closed Block Policies and, as discussed below, the
consequences of certain potential adverse tax determinations. In connection with the sale of the Class B Stock and IHC debt, we agreed to indemnify the investors in those securities with respect to certain matters, and any cost of that
indemnification would be borne by the Financial Services Businesses.

Within the Closed Block Business, the assets and cash flows attributable to the Closed Block accrue solely to the benefit of the Closed Block policyholders through policyholder dividends after payment of benefits, expenses and taxes. The
Surplus and Related Assets accrue to the benefit of the holders of Class B Stock. The earnings on, and distribution of, the Surplus and Related Assets over time will be the source or measure of payment of the interest and principal of the IHC debt
and of dividends on the Class B Stock. The earnings of the Closed Block are reported as part of the Closed Block Business, although no cash flows or assets of the Closed Block accrue to the benefit of the holders of Common Stock or Class B Stock.
The Closed Block Assets are not available to service interest or principal of the IHC debt or dividends on the Class B Stock.

Inter-Business Transfers and Allocation Policies

Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors has adopted certain policies with respect to inter-business transfers and accounting and tax matters,
including the allocation of earnings. Such policies are summarized below. In the future, the Board of Directors may modify, rescind or add to any of these policies. However, the decision of the Board of Directors to modify, rescind or add to any of
these policies is subject to the Board of Directors’ general fiduciary duties. In addition, we have agreed with the investors in the Class B Stock and the insurer of the IHC debt that, in most instances, the Board of Directors may not change
these policies without their consent.

Inter-Business
Transactions and Transfers

The transactions permitted
between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, subject to any required regulatory approvals and the contractual limitations noted above, include the following:

•

The Closed Block Business may lend to the Financial Services Businesses, and the Financial Services Businesses may lend to the Closed Block Business, in each case
on terms no less favorable to the Closed Block Business than comparable internal loans and only for cash management purposes in the ordinary course of business and on market terms pursuant to our internal short-term cash management facility.

•

Other transactions between the Closed Block and businesses outside of the Closed Block, including the Financial Services Businesses, are permitted if, among other
things, such transactions benefit the Closed Block, are at fair market value and do not exceed, in any calendar year, a specified formula amount.

•

Capital contributions to Prudential Insurance may be for the benefit of either the Financial Services Businesses or the Closed Block Business and assets of the
Financial Services Businesses within Prudential Insurance may be transferred to the Closed Block Business within Prudential Insurance in the form of a loan which is subordinated to all existing obligations of the Closed Block Business and on market
terms.

•

An inter-business loan from the Financial Services Businesses to the Closed Block Business may be established to reflect usage of the net proceeds of the IHC debt
initially deposited in the debt service coverage account, and any reinvested earnings thereon, to pay debt service on the IHC debt or dividends to Prudential Financial for purposes of the Closed Block Business.

•

In addition to the foregoing, the Financial Services Businesses may lend to the Closed Block Business, on either a subordinated or non-subordinated basis, on market
terms as may be approved by Prudential Financial.



•

The Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business may engage in such other transactions on market terms as may be approved by Prudential Financial
and, if applicable, Prudential Insurance.

•

The Board of Directors has discretion to transfer assets of the Financial Services Businesses to the Closed Block, or use such assets for the benefit of Closed
Block policyholders, if it believes such transfer or usage is in the best interests of the Financial Services Businesses, and such transfer or usage may be made without requiring any repayment of the amounts transferred or used or the payment of any
other consideration from the Closed Block Business.

•

Cash payments for administrative purposes from the Closed Block Business to the Financial Services Businesses are based on formulas that initially approximated the
actual expenses incurred by the Financial Services Businesses to provide such services based on insurance and policies in force and statutory cash premiums. Administrative expenses recorded by the Closed Block Business, and the related income tax
effect, are based upon actual expenses incurred under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP, utilizing the Company’s methodology for the allocation of such expenses. Any difference in the cash amount transferred and
actual expenses incurred as reported under U.S. GAAP will be recorded, on an after-tax basis at the applicable current rate, as direct adjustments to the respective equity balances of the Closed Block Business and the Financial Services Businesses,
without the issuance of shares of either Business to the other Business. This direct equity adjustment modifies earnings available to each class of common stock for earnings per share purposes. Internal investment expenses recorded and paid by the
Closed Block Business, and the related income tax effect, are based upon actual expenses incurred under U.S. GAAP and in accordance with internal arrangements governing recordkeeping, bank fees, accounting and reporting, asset allocation, investment
policy and planning and analysis.

Accounting Policies

Accounting policies
relating to the allocation of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses between the two Businesses include:

•

All our assets, liabilities, equity and earnings are allocated between the two Businesses and accounted for as if the Businesses were separate legal entities.
Assets and liabilities allocated to the Closed Block Business are those that we consider appropriate to operate that Business. All remaining assets and liabilities of Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries constitute the assets and liabilities of
the Financial Services Businesses.

•

For financial reporting purposes, revenues; administrative, overhead and investment expenses; taxes other than federal income taxes; and certain commissions and
commission-related expenses associated with the Closed Block Business are allocated between the Closed Block Business and the Financial Services Businesses in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Interest expense and routine maintenance and administrative
costs generated by the IHC debt are considered directly attributable to the Closed Block Business and are therefore allocated to the Closed Block Business, except as indicated below.

•

Any transfers of funds between the Closed Block Business and the Financial Services Businesses will typically be accounted for as either reimbursement of expense,
investment income, return of principal or a subordinated loan, except as described under “—Inter-Business Transactions and Transfers” above.

•

The Financial Services Businesses will bear any expenses and liabilities from litigation affecting the Closed Block Policies and the consequences of certain
potential adverse tax determinations noted below. In connection with the sale of the Class B Stock and IHC debt, we agreed to indemnify the investors with respect to certain matters, and any such indemnification would be borne by the Financial
Services Businesses.

Tax Allocation and
Tax Treatment

The Closed Block Business within each legal
entity is treated as if it were a consolidated subsidiary of Prudential Financial. Accordingly, if the Closed Block Business has taxable income, it recognizes its share of income tax as if it were a consolidated subsidiary of Prudential Financial.
If the Closed Block Business has losses or credits, it recognizes a current income tax benefit.



If the Closed Block Business within any legal entity has taxable income, it pays its share of income tax
in cash to the Financial Services Businesses. If it has losses or credits, it receives its benefit in cash from the Financial Services Businesses. If the losses or credits cannot be currently utilized in the consolidated federal income tax return of
Prudential Financial for the year in which such losses or credits arise, the Closed Block Business will receive the full benefit in cash, and the Financial Services Businesses will subsequently recover the payment at the time the losses or credits
are actually utilized in computing estimated payments or in the consolidated federal income tax return of Prudential Financial. Certain tax costs and benefits are determined under the Plan of Reorganization with respect to the Closed Block using
statutory accounting rules that may give rise to tax costs or tax benefits prior to the time that those costs or benefits are actually realized for tax purposes. If at any time the Closed Block Business is allocated any such tax cost or a tax
benefit under the Plan of Reorganization that is not realized at that same time under the relevant tax rules but will be realized in the future, the Closed Block Business will pay such tax cost or receive such tax benefit at that time, but it will
be paid to or paid by the Financial Services Businesses. When such tax cost or tax benefit is subsequently realized under the relevant tax rules, the tax cost or tax benefit will be allocated to the Financial Services Businesses.

The foregoing principles are applied so as to prevent any item of income,
deduction, gain, loss, credit, tax cost or tax benefit being taken into account more than once by the Closed Block Business or the Financial Services Businesses. For this purpose, items determined under the Plan of Reorganization with respect to any
period prior to the date of demutualization were taken into account, with any such pre-demutualization tax attributes relating to the Closed Block being attributed to the Closed Block Business and all other pre-demutualization tax attributes being
attributed to the Financial Services Businesses. The Closed Block Business will also pay or receive its appropriate share of tax or interest resulting from adjustments attributable to the settlement of tax controversies or the filing of amended tax
returns to the extent that the tax or interest relates to controversies or amended returns arising with respect to the Closed Block Business and attributable to tax periods after the date of demutualization, except to the extent that the tax is
directly attributable to the characterization of the IHC debt for tax purposes, in which case the tax will be borne by the Financial Services Businesses. In particular, if a change of tax law after the date of demutualization, including any change
in the interpretation of any tax law, results in the recharacterization of all or part of the IHC debt for tax purposes or a significant reduction in the income tax benefit associated with the interest expense on all or part of the IHC debt, the
Financial Services Businesses will continue to pay the foregone income tax benefit to the Closed Block Business until the IHC debt has been repaid or Prudential Holdings, LLC has been released from its obligations to the bond insurer and under the
IHC debt as if such recharacterization or reduction of actual benefit had not occurred.

Internal Short-Term Cash Management Facility

The Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business participate in the Company’s commingled internal short-term cash management facility, pursuant to which they invest cash from securities lending and
repurchase activities as well as certain trading and operating activities. The net funds invested in the facility are generally held in investments that are short-term, including mortgage- and asset-backed securities. A proportionate interest in
each security held in the portfolio is allocated to the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business based upon their proportional cash contributions to the facility as of the balance sheet date. See Note 2 to the Supplemental
Combining Financial Information for additional information concerning our internal short-term cash management facility.

Financial Services Businesses

The Financial Services Businesses is comprised of three divisions, containing eight segments, and our Corporate and Other operations. The Insurance
division is comprised of the Individual Life, Individual Annuities and Group Insurance segments. The Investment division is comprised of the Asset Management, Financial Advisory and Retirement segments. The International Insurance and Investments
division is comprised of the International Insurance and International Investments segments.

See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for revenues, income and loss, and total assets by segment of the Financial Services Businesses.



Insurance Division

The Insurance division conducts its business through the Individual Life, Individual Annuities and Group Insurance segments.

Individual Life

Our Individual Life segment manufactures and distributes individual variable life, term life, universal life and
non-participating whole life insurance products, primarily to the U.S. mass affluent market and mass market. In general, we consider households with investable assets or annual income in excess of $100,000 to be mass affluent in the U.S. market. Our
life products are distributed through Prudential Agents and independent third party distributors.

The Individual Life segment competes with large, well-established life insurance companies. In the markets for our products, we compete primarily based
upon price, service, distribution channel relationships, brand recognition and financial stability.

Products

Our
primary insurance products are variable life, term life and universal life, and represent 57%, 35% and 6%, respectively, of our net face amount of individual life insurance in force at the end of 2007. In recent years, as our individual life
insurance in force continues to grow, we have seen our term life insurance become a larger percentage of our net in force.

A significant portion of our Individual Life insurance segment’s profits are associated with the large in force block of older variable policies. As
the policies age, insureds begin receiving reduced policy charges. This, coupled with policy count and insurance in force runoff over time, reduces our expected future profits from this product line. In addition, certain fixed expenses are allocated
between the Individual Life segment and the Closed Block Business based upon allocation policies consistent with U.S. GAAP reporting; however, as policies in force within the Closed Block Business continue to mature or terminate, the level of
expenses to be allocated to the Closed Block Business will decrease, potentially affecting the profitability of the Individual Life segment.

Individual Life profits from term insurance are not expected to directly correlate, from a timing perspective, with the increase in term insurance in
force because of the expected product profitability patterns, as well as the effects of our capital management activities.

Variable Life Insurance

We offer a number of individual variable life insurance products that provide a return linked to an underlying investment portfolio designated by the
policyholder while providing the policyholder with the flexibility to change both the death benefit and premium payments. Each product provides for the deduction of charges and expenses from the customer’s investment account. While we continue
to sell a significant amount of variable life insurance, marketplace demand continues to favor term and universal life insurance.

Term Life Insurance

We offer a variety of term life insurance products. Most term products include a conversion feature that allows the policyholder to convert the policy
into permanent life insurance coverage. We also offer term life insurance that provides for a return of premium if the insured is alive at the end of the coverage period. There continues to be significant growth in the demand for term life insurance
protection.

Universal Life Insurance

We offer universal life insurance products that feature a market rate fixed
interest investment account, flexible premiums and a choice of guarantees against lapse.



Non-participating Whole Life Insurance

We offer a non-participating whole life insurance product with guaranteed
fixed level premiums and guaranteed cash values, which is principally used in the group term to whole life conversion market.

Marketing and Distribution

Prudential Agents

Our Prudential Agents distribute proprietary variable, term, universal and non-participating whole life insurance, variable and fixed annuities, and
investment and other protection products with proprietary and non-proprietary investment options as well as selected insurance and investment products manufactured by others. The number of Prudential Agents was 2,425, 2,562 and 2,946 at
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. While the number of Prudential Agents has declined over the past several years, average agent productivity, based upon average commissions on new sales of all products by Prudential Agents, has
increased from $46,300 for 2005 to $60,500 for 2007.

Prudential Agents sell life insurance products primarily to customers in the U.S. mass and mass affluent markets, as well as small business owners. Other than certain training allowances or salary paid at the beginning of their employment,
we pay Prudential Agents on a commission basis for the products they sell. In addition to commissions, Prudential Agents receive the employee benefits that we provide to other Prudential employees generally, including medical and disability
insurance, an employee savings program and qualified retirement plans.

Prior to the sale of our property and casualty insurance operations in 2003, the Individual Life segment had been compensated for property and casualty insurance products sold through its distribution network. Following the sale, Prudential
Agents have continued access to non-proprietary property and casualty products under distribution agreements entered into with the purchasers of these businesses; therefore, the Individual Life segment continues to be compensated for sales of these
products.

The compensation arrangements for certain
non-proprietary products provide an opportunity for additional compensation to the Individual Life segment based on multi-year profitability of the products sold. This additional compensation is not predictable since the multi-year profitability of
the products is subject to substantial variability and, additionally, the compensation arrangements are periodically renegotiated which will affect the amount of additional compensation we are eligible to receive.

Third Party Distribution

Our individual life products are offered through a variety of third party
channels, including independent brokers, general agencies and producer groups. We focus on sales through independent intermediaries who provide life insurance solutions to protect individuals, families and businesses and support estate and wealth
transfer planning. The life insurance products offered are generally the same as those available through Prudential Agents. Our third party efforts are supported by a network of internal and external wholesalers.

Underwriting and Pricing

Our life insurance underwriters follow detailed and uniform policies and
procedures to assess and quantify the risk of our individual life insurance products. We require the applicant to take a variety of underwriting tests, such as medical examinations, electrocardiograms, blood tests, urine tests, chest x-rays and
consumer investigative reports, depending on the age of the applicant and the amount of insurance requested. We base premiums and policy charges for individual life insurance on expected death benefits, surrender benefits, expenses and required
reserves. We use assumptions for mortality, interest, expenses, policy persistency, and premium payment pattern in pricing policies. Some of our policies are fully guaranteed. Others have current premiums/charges and interest credits that we can
change subject to contractual guarantees. We routinely update the interest crediting rates on our universal life policies and on the fixed account of our variable life policies. In resetting these rates, we consider the returns on our portfolios
supporting these policies, current interest rates, the competitive environment and our profit objectives.



Our operating results are impacted by differences between actual mortality experience and the assumptions
used in pricing these policies and, as a result, can fluctuate from period to period. Our Individual Life segment employs capital management activities, including financing of regulatory capital requirements associated with statutory reserves, to
maximize product returns and enable competitive pricing.

Reserves

We establish and carry as liabilities actuarially
determined reserves for future policy benefits that we believe will meet our future obligations for our in force life policies. We base these reserves on assumptions we believe to be appropriate for investment yield, persistency, expenses, mortality
and morbidity rates, as well as margins for adverse deviation. For variable and interest-sensitive life insurance contracts, we establish liabilities for policyholders’ account balances that represent cumulative gross premium payments plus
credited interest and/or fund performance, less withdrawals, expenses and mortality charges.

Reinsurance

Since 2000, we have reinsured a significant portion of the mortality risk we assume under our newly sold individual life insurance policies. The maximum amount of individual life insurance we generally retain on any new policy is $30
million for a single life plan and $35 million for a second-to-die life plan. In situations where no reinsurance is available, we limit newly issued policies on our primary term life plan to only $10 million.

Individual Annuities

Our Individual Annuities segment manufactures and distributes individual variable and fixed annuity products, primarily to
the U.S. mass affluent market. In general, we consider households with investable assets or annual income in excess of $100,000 to be mass affluent in the U.S. market. We compete in the individual annuities business primarily based on the ability to
offer innovative product features. Our risk management allows us to offer these features and hedge the related risks that we assume, utilizing externally purchased hedging instruments or, for certain of our variable annuity features, an automatic
rebalancing element. We also compete based on brand recognition and the breadth of our distribution platform. Our annuity products are distributed through a diverse group of independent financial planners, wirehouses and banks, as well as through
Prudential Agents. During the past five years we have completed two acquisitions that had a significant impact on our business, as discussed below. In the second half of 2006, we began distributing our annuity products through Allstate’s
proprietary distribution force, as discussed further below.

American Skandia

On May 1, 2003, we
acquired Skandia U.S. Inc., which included American Skandia Life Assurance Corporation, or American Skandia, one of the largest distributors of variable annuities through independent financial planners in the U.S., from Skandia Insurance Company
Ltd. for a total purchase price of $1.184 billion. Our acquisition of Skandia U.S. Inc. also included a mutual fund business that was combined with our Asset Management segment. The acquisition significantly expanded and diversified our third party
distribution capabilities in the U.S. and broadened our array of product offerings.

Skandia Insurance Company Ltd. agreed to indemnify us for certain losses, including losses resulting from litigation or regulatory matters relating to events prior to closing the transaction, subject to an aggregate
cap of $1 billion. See “Legal Proceedings—Insurance and Annuities” for additional information regarding items pending under this indemnification. Under the terms of a License Agreement, we acquired the right to use the “American
Skandia” name in conjunction with our own name in the U.S. in the annuity business for five years and in the mutual fund business for two years. Skandia Insurance Company Ltd. agreed not to compete with us in the U.S. in the annuity business
for five years and in the mutual fund business for two years. During 2007, we began the process of changing the names of various legal entities that currently include “American Skandia” in the name, and will complete these changes on or
before April 30, 2008. Among the name changes already completed, on January 1, 2008 we changed the name of American Skandia Life Assurance Corporation to Prudential Annuities Life Assurance Corporation.



Allstate Variable Annuity Business

On June 1, 2006, we acquired the variable annuity business of The Allstate Corporation, or Allstate, through a
reinsurance transaction for $635 million of total consideration. Beginning June 1, 2006, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the results of operations of the acquired variable annuity business have been included in our consolidated
financial statements. The acquisition increased our scale and third party distribution capabilities in the U.S., including exclusive distribution through Allstate’s agency distribution force of nearly 14,000 independent contractors and
financial professionals. The integration of the variable annuity business acquired from Allstate is expected to be completed during the first half of 2008. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the
acquisition.

Products

We offer variable annuities that provide our customers with a full suite of
optional guaranteed death and living benefits. Our investment options provide our customers with the opportunity to invest in proprietary and non-proprietary mutual funds, frequently under asset allocation programs, and fixed-rate options. The
investments made by customers in the proprietary and non-proprietary mutual funds represent an interest in separate investment companies that provide a return linked to an underlying investment portfolio. The investments made in the fixed rate
options are credited with interest at rates we determine, subject to certain minimums. We also offer fixed annuities that provide a guarantee of principal and interest credited at rates we determine, subject to certain contractual minimums.

Marketing and Distribution

Prudential Agents

Our Prudential Agents distribute variable annuities with proprietary and
non-proprietary investment options, as well as fixed annuities. For additional information regarding our Prudential Agent force, see “—Insurance Division—Individual Life.”

Third Party Distribution

Our individual annuity products are also offered through a variety of third
party channels, including independent brokers, general agencies, producer groups, wirehouses, banks, and, beginning in the second half of 2006, Allstate’s proprietary distribution force. The annuity products offered via third party channels
include both Prudential and American Skandia branded products. Completion of the various American Skandia legal entity name changes to Prudential Annuities will occur on or before April 30, 2008. Our third party efforts are supported by a
network of 222 internal and external wholesalers as of December 31, 2007.

Underwriting and Pricing

We earn asset
management fees based upon the average assets of the proprietary mutual funds in our variable annuity products and mortality and expense fees and other fees for various insurance-related options and features, including optional guaranteed death and
living benefit features, based on the average daily net assets value of the annuity separate accounts or the amount of guaranteed value. We receive administrative service fees from many of the proprietary and non-proprietary mutual funds. We price
our variable annuities, including optional guaranteed death and living benefits, based on evaluation of risks assumed and considering applicable hedging costs. As part of our risk management strategy, we utilize interest rate and equity based
derivatives, as well as an automatic rebalancing element, to hedge the benefit features of our variable annuity contracts, with the exception of our guaranteed minimum income benefits and guaranteed minimum death benefits, which include risks we
have deemed suitable to retain. We price our fixed annuities as well as the fixed-rate options of our variable annuities based on assumptions as to investment returns, expenses and persistency. Competition also influences our pricing. We seek to
maintain a spread between the return on our general account invested assets and the interest we credit on our fixed annuities. To encourage persistency, most of our variable and fixed annuities have declining surrender or withdrawal charges for a
specified number of years. In addition, the living benefit features of our variable annuity products encourage persistency because the potential value of the living benefit is fully realized only if the contract persists.



Reserves

We establish and carry as liabilities actuarially determined reserves for future policy benefits that we believe will meet our future obligations for our
in force annuity contracts, including the minimum death benefit and living benefit guarantee features of some of these contracts. We base these reserves on assumptions we believe to be appropriate for investment yield, persistency, withdrawal rates,
mortality rates, expenses and margins for adverse deviation. For variable and fixed annuity contracts, we establish liabilities for policyholders’ account balances that represent cumulative gross premium payments plus credited interest and/or
fund performance, less withdrawals, expenses and mortality charges.

Group
Insurance

Our Group Insurance segment manufactures and
distributes a full range of group life, long-term and short-term group disability, long-term care, and group corporate- and trust-owned life insurance in the U.S. primarily to institutional clients for use in connection with employee and membership
benefits plans. Group Insurance also sells accidental death and dismemberment and other ancillary coverages and provides plan administrative services in connection with its insurance coverages.

The Group life segment competes with other large, well-capitalized life and
health insurance providers. The markets in which we compete are mature markets, hence we compete primarily based on strong brand recognition, service standards, customer relationships, and financial stability. Due to the large number of competitors,
price competition is strong. We have a strong portfolio of products and the ability to meet complex needs of the large clients, providing opportunities for continuing stabilized premiums and growth. The majority of our premiums are derived from
large corporations, affinity groups or other organizations, such as those with over 10,000 insured individuals.

Products

Group Life Insurance

We offer group life insurance products including basic and supplemental term life insurance to employees, optional term life insurance to dependents of
employees and universal life insurance. We also offer group variable universal life insurance, voluntary accidental death and dismemberment insurance and business travel accident insurance. Many of our employee-pay coverages include a portability
feature, allowing employees to retain their coverage when they change employers or retire. We also offer a living benefits option that allows insureds that are diagnosed with a terminal illness to receive a portion of their life insurance benefit
upon diagnosis, in advance of death, to use as needed. Also, the majority of claim payments are automatically deposited into a demand deposit account for the beneficiary to withdraw at their option.

Group Disability Insurance

We offer short- and long-term group disability insurance, which protects
against loss of wages due to illness or injury. Short-term disability generally provides coverage for three to six months, and long-term disability covers the period after short-term disability ends. We also offer absence management and integrated
disability management services in conjunction with a third party.

Other

We offer individual and group long-term
care insurance and group corporate- and trust-owned life insurance. Long-term care insurance protects the insured from the costs of an adult day care center, a nursing home or similar live-in care situation or a home health or a personal care aide.
Group corporate- and trust-owned life insurance are group variable life insurance contracts typically used by large corporations to fund benefit plans for retired employees. They also may be used as vehicles to deliver deferred compensation or
non-qualified benefits to active employees.



Marketing and Distribution

Group Insurance has its own dedicated sales force that is organized around products and market segments and distributes primarily through
employee benefits brokers and consultants. Group Insurance also distributes individual long-term care products through Prudential Agents as well as third party brokers and agents.

Underwriting and Pricing

We have developed standard rating systems for each product line in the Group Insurance segment based on our past experience and relevant industry
experience. For our earlier generation long-term care products, experience data was very limited. As the long-term care industry is maturing, the information available, both our own and industry experience, for use in underwriting has improved. We
are not obligated to accept any application for a policy or group of policies from any distributor. We follow standard underwriting practices and procedures. If the coverage amount exceeds certain prescribed age and amount limits, we may require a
prospective insured to submit evidence of insurability.

We
determine premiums on some of our policies on a retrospective experience rated basis, in which case the policyholder bears some of the risk or receives some of the benefit associated with claim experience fluctuations during the policy period. We
base product pricing of group insurance products on the expected pay-out of benefits that we calculate using assumptions for mortality, morbidity, interest, expenses and persistency, depending upon the specific product features.

Some of our other policies are not eligible to receive experience based
refunds. The adequacy of our pricing of these policies determines their profitability during the rate guarantee period. In addition, our profitability is subject to fluctuate period to period, based on the differences between actual mortality
experience and the assumptions used in pricing our policies, but we anticipate that over the rate guarantee period we will achieve mortality levels more closely aligned with the assumptions used in pricing our policies. Market demand for multiple
year rate guarantees for new policies increases the adverse consequences of mispricing coverage and lengthens the time it takes to improve benefits ratios.

We routinely make pricing adjustments, when contractually permitted, that take into account the emerging experience on our group insurance products. While
there can be no assurance, we expect these actions, as well as pricing discipline in writing new business, will allow us to maintain benefits ratios that are consistent with our profit objectives.

Reserves

We establish and carry as liabilities actuarially determined reserves that we believe will be adequate to meet our future
policyholder benefit obligations. We base these reserves on actuarially recognized methods using morbidity and mortality tables in general use in the U.S., which we modify to reflect our actual experience when appropriate. Reserves also include
claims reported but not yet paid, and claims incurred but not reported. We also establish a liability for policyholders’ account balances that represent cumulative deposits plus credited interest and/or fund performance, less withdrawals,
expenses and cost of insurance charges as applicable.

Investment Division

The Investment division
conducts its business through the Asset Management, Financial Advisory and Retirement segments.

Asset Management

The
Asset Management segment provides a broad array of investment management and advisory services by means of institutional portfolio management, mutual funds, asset securitization activity and other structured products, and proprietary investments.
These products and services are provided to the public and private marketplace, as well as our Insurance division, International Insurance and Investments division and Retirement segment.



The Asset Management segment competes with numerous asset managers and other financial institutions. In
the markets for our products, we compete based upon investment performance, investment process and investment talent.

Operating Data

The following tables set forth the assets under management of the investment management and advisory services group of our Asset Management segment at
fair market value by asset class and source as of the dates indicated.

(1)

Consists of third party institutional assets and group insurance contracts.

(2)

Consists of individual mutual funds, defined contribution plan products and both variable annuities and variable life insurance assets in our separate accounts. Fixed annuities and
the fixed rate options of both variable annuities and variable life insurance are included in our general account.

(3)

Includes private fixed income and commercial mortgage assets of institutional customers of $9.7 billion as of December 31, 2007, $8.7 billion as of December 31, 2006 and
$8.6 billion as of December 31, 2005, and private fixed income and commercial mortgage assets in our general account of $62.4 billion, $54.7 billion and $53.4 billion, as of those dates, respectively.

Products and Services

In our asset management areas, we offer the following products and services:

Public Fixed Income Asset Management

Our public fixed income organization manages fixed income portfolios for
U.S. and international, institutional and retail clients, as well as for our general account. Our products include traditional broad market fixed income strategies and single-sector strategies. We manage traditional asset liability strategies, as
well as customized asset liability strategies. We also manage hedge strategies in both the liquidity and credit sectors, as well as collateralized debt obligations. We also serve as a non-custodial securities lending agent.



Strategies are managed by seasoned portfolio managers with securities selected by our nine sector
specialist teams: Corporate, High Yield, Bank Loan, Emerging Markets Debt, U.S. Liquidity (U.S. government and mortgage-backed securities), Money Market, Municipal Bonds, Global and Structured Product. A separate team is dedicated to securities
lending activities. All strategies are managed using a research-based approach, supported by large credit research, quantitative research, and risk management organizations.

Public Equity Asset Management

Our public equity organization provides discretionary and non-discretionary asset management services to a wide range of
clients. We manage a broad array of publicly traded equity asset classes using various investment styles. The public equity organization is comprised of two wholly owned registered investment advisors, Jennison Associates LLC and Quantitative
Management Associates, LLC. Jennison Associates uses fundamental, team-based research to manage portfolios for institutional and private clients through separately managed accounts and commingled vehicles, including mutual funds through subadvisory
relationships. Quantitative Management Associates specializes in the discipline of quantitative investing tailored to client objectives.

Private Fixed Income

Our private fixed income organization provides asset management services by investing predominantly in private placement investment grade debt securities,
as well as below investment grade debt securities, and mezzanine debt financing. These investment capabilities are utilized by our general account and institutional clients through direct advisory accounts, separate accounts, or private fund
structures. A majority of the private placement investments are directly originated by our investment staff.

Commercial Mortgage Origination, Servicing and Securitization

Our commercial mortgage operations provide mortgage origination and servicing for our general account, institutional
clients, and government sponsored entities such as Fannie Mae, the Federal Housing Administration, and Freddie Mac. We also originate and purchase commercial mortgages that we in turn sell through securitization transactions. We also originate
interim loans when we expect the loans will lead to securitization or other sale opportunities. These interim loans generally have terms that are shorter than those that would qualify for securitization. As of December 31, 2007, the principal
balance of interim loans and mortgages pending securitization totaled $1.9 billion.

Real Estate Asset Management

Our global real estate organization provides asset management services for single-client and commingled real estate portfolios and manufactures and manages a variety of real estate investment vehicles, primarily for institutional clients in
19 offices worldwide. Our domestic and international real estate investment vehicles range from fully diversified open-end funds to specialized closed-end funds that invest in specific types of properties or specific geographic regions or follow
other specific investment strategies. Our real estate organization has established its global platform in Europe, Asia and Latin America.

Proprietary Investments

We make proprietary investments in real estate and private equity, as well as debt, public equity and real estate securities, including controlling
interests. The fair value of these investments was approximately $1.7 billion and $900 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Certain of these investments are made primarily for purposes of co-investment in our managed funds
and structured products. Other proprietary investments are made with the intention to sell or syndicate to investors, including our general account, or for placement in funds and structured products that we offer and manage. We also make short term
loans to our managed funds that are secured by equity commitments from investors or assets of the funds.

Mutual Funds and Other Retail Services

We manufacture, distribute and service investment management products primarily utilizing proprietary asset management expertise in the U.S. retail
market. Our products are designed to be sold primarily by financial



professionals including both Prudential Agents and third party advisors. We offer a family of retail investment products consisting of 47 mutual funds as of
December 31, 2007. These products cover a wide array of investment styles and objectives designed to attract and retain assets of individuals with varying objectives and to accommodate investors’ changing financial needs. On May 1,
2003, we acquired Skandia U.S. Inc., which included a mutual fund business that has been combined with our existing mutual fund business.

We also provide services for the private label wrap-fee products of other financial services firms that provide access to mutual funds and separate
account products. Wrap-fee products have higher minimum investment levels than our mutual funds and offer a choice of both proprietary and non-proprietary investment management. During 2004, we became a provider of program services for certain
mutual fund wrap and separately managed account platforms of Wachovia Securities. The contractual agreement with Wachovia Securities related to managed account services was amended effective July 1, 2005 to provide essentially for a fixed fee
for managed account services and is scheduled to expire July 1, 2008.

Marketing and Distribution

We provide
investment management services for our institutional customers through a proprietary sales force.

Most of the retail customer assets under management are invested in our mutual funds and our variable annuities and variable life insurance products.
These assets are gathered by the Insurance division, the International Insurance and Investments division and third party networks, including financial advisors associated with our joint venture with Wachovia Corporation discussed under
“—Financial Advisory” below. Third party intermediary sales represent the fastest growing sales channel on a net basis. Additionally, we work with third party product manufacturers and distributors to include our investment options in
their products and platforms.

We also provide investment
management services across a broad array of asset classes for our general account, as described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Realized Investment Gains and General Account
Investments—General Account Investments.”

Financial Advisory

The Financial Advisory segment consists of our investment in
Wachovia Securities.

Wachovia Securities

On July 1, 2003, we combined our retail securities brokerage and
clearing operations with those of Wachovia Corporation, or Wachovia, and formed Wachovia Securities Financial Holdings, LLC, or Wachovia Securities, a joint venture now headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri. As of December 31, 2007, we had a 38%
ownership interest in the joint venture, with Wachovia owning the remaining 62%. We account for our ownership of the joint venture under the equity method of accounting. Prior to the formation of the joint venture on July 1, 2003, the results
of our previously wholly owned securities brokerage and clearing operations were included on a fully consolidated basis.

On October 1, 2007, Wachovia completed the acquisition of A.G. Edwards, Inc., or A.G. Edwards, for $6.8 billion and on January 1, 2008 combined
the retail securities brokerage business of A.G. Edwards with Wachovia Securities. We have elected the “lookback” option under the terms of the agreements relating to the joint venture in connection with the combination of the A.G. Edwards
business with Wachovia Securities. The “lookback” option permits us to delay for approximately two years following the combination of the A.G. Edwards business with Wachovia Securities our decision to make or not to make payments to avoid
or limit dilution of our ownership interest in the joint venture. During this “lookback” period, our share in the earnings of the joint venture, as well as our share of the one-time costs associated with the combination, will be based on
our diluted ownership level, which is in the process of being determined. Any payment at the end of the “lookback” period to restore all or part of our ownership interest in the joint venture would be based on the appraised or agreed value



of the existing joint venture and the A.G. Edwards business. In such event, we would also need to make a true-up payment of one-time costs to reflect the
incremental increase in our ownership interest in the joint venture. Alternatively, we may at the end of the “lookback” period “put” our joint venture interests to Wachovia based on the appraised value of the joint venture,
excluding the A.G. Edwards business, as of the date of the combination of the A.G. Edwards business with Wachovia Securities.

We also retain our separate right to “put” our joint venture interests to Wachovia at any time after July 1, 2008 based on the appraised value
of the joint venture, including the A.G. Edwards business, determined as if it were a public company and including a control premium such as would apply in the case of a sale of 100% of its common equity. However, if in connection with the
“lookback” option we elect at the end of the “lookback” period to make payments to avoid or limit dilution, we may not exercise this separate right or “put” option prior to the first anniversary of the end of the
“lookback” period. The agreement between Prudential Financial and Wachovia also gives us put rights, and Wachovia call rights, in certain other specified circumstances, at prices determined in accordance with the agreement.

Wachovia Securities, one of the nation’s largest retail brokerage and
clearing organizations, provides full service securities brokerage and financial advisory services to individuals and businesses. As of December 31, 2007, it had total client assets of $799 billion and approximately 11,600 registered
representatives.

Wachovia and Wachovia Securities are key
distribution partners for certain of our products, including our mutual funds and individual annuities that are distributed through their financial advisors, bank channel and independent channel. In addition, we are a service provider to the managed
account platform and certain wrap-fee programs offered by Wachovia Securities.

The segment results reflect expenses relating to obligations and costs we retained in connection with the contributed businesses, primarily for litigation and regulatory matters, including settlement costs related to
market timing issues involving the former Prudential Securities operations. The Company announced that a settlement was reached in August 2006 with respect to the market timing issues. The segment results for 2003, 2004 and 2005 reflect transition
costs, including our allocable share of transition costs incurred by the joint venture, in connection with the contributed businesses. Prudential Financial and Wachovia have each agreed to indemnify the other for certain losses, including losses
resulting from litigation or regulatory matters relating to certain events prior to March 31, 2004, arising from the operations of their respective contributed businesses.

Retirement

Our Retirement segment, which we refer to in the marketplace as Prudential Retirement, provides retirement investment and income products and services to
retirement plan sponsors in the public, private, and not-for-profit sectors. Our full service business provides recordkeeping, plan administration, actuarial advisory services, tailored participant education and communication services, trustee
services and institutional and retail investment funds. While we are focused primarily on servicing defined contribution and defined benefit plans, we also service non-qualified plans. For clients with both defined contribution and defined benefit
plans, we offer integrated defined benefit/defined contribution recordkeeping services. For participants leaving our clients’ plans, we provide a broad range of retail and rollover products through our broker-dealer and bank. In addition, in
our institutional investment products business, we offer guaranteed investment contracts, or GICs, funding agreements, institutional and retail notes, structured settlement annuities, and group annuities for defined contribution plans, defined
benefit plans, non-qualified entities, and individuals. Results of our institutional investment products business include proprietary spread lending activities where we borrow on a secured or unsecured basis to support investments on which we earn a
spread between the asset yield and liability cost.

The
Retirement segment competes with other large, well-capitalized insurance companies, asset managers and diversified financial institutions. In our full service business, we compete primarily based on pricing, service offerings, investment offerings,
investment performance, and our ability to offer product features to meet the retirement income needs of clients. In our institutional investment products business, we compete primarily based on our pricing and structuring capabilities, which are
supported by our claims-paying ability.



On April 1, 2004, we acquired the retirement business of CIGNA Corporation, or CIGNA, for $2.1
billion. This acquisition broadened our array of product offerings by adding integrated defined benefit/defined contribution services, actuarial advisory services and institutional separate account investment funds to our product and service mix.
The process of integrating CIGNA’s retirement business with our original retirement business was completed in the first quarter of 2006.

On December 31, 2007, we acquired a portion of the retirement business of Union Bank of California, N.A. for $103 million of cash consideration. This
acquisition increases the scale of our product and service offerings and expands our sales and distribution capabilities on the west coast of the U.S. We expect the integration of this business to be completed by the end of the second quarter of
2008.

Products and Services

Full Service

Our full service business offers plan sponsors and their participants a
broad range of products and services to assist in the delivery and administration of defined contribution, defined benefit, and non-qualified retirement plans, including recordkeeping and administrative services, comprehensive investment offerings
and consulting services to assist plan sponsors in managing fiduciary obligations. We offer as part of our investment products a variety of general and separate account stable value products, as well as retail mutual funds and institutional funds
advised by affiliated and non-affiliated investment managers. In addition, certain products that are designed for the benefit of participants are marketed and sold on an investment-only basis through our full service distribution channels. Revenue
is generated from asset-based fees, recordkeeping and other advisory fees, and the spread between the rate of return on investments we make and the interest rates we credit, less expenses, on certain stable value products that are discussed in
greater detail below. Prudential Financial’s asset management units earn fees from management of general account assets supporting retirement products including stable value products as discussed below and, to the extent these units are
selected to manage client assets associated with fee-based products, they also earn asset management fees related to those assets.

Our full service general account stable value products contain an obligation to pay interest at a specified rate for a specific period of time and to
repay account balances or market value upon contract termination. Substantially all of these stable value general account products are either fully or partially participating, with annual or semi-annual rate resets giving effect to previous
investment experience. We earn asset management fees for these general account products for managing the related assets as well as administrative fees for providing recordkeeping and other administrative services. In addition, profits from partially
participating general account products result from the spread between the rate of return on the investments we make and the interest rates we credit, less expenses.

We also offer fee-based separate account products, through which customer funds are held in either a separate account or a
client-owned trust. These products generally pass all of the investment results to the customer. In certain cases, these contracts are subject to a minimum interest rate guarantee. Additionally, we offer retirement account based variable annuities
that contain guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits. We earn administrative fees for these separate account products and to the extent that Prudential Financial’s asset management units are selected to manage the client assets, those units also
earn asset management fees.

Our full service offerings are
supported by participant communications and education programs, and a broad range of plan consulting services, including nondiscrimination testing, plan document services, signature-ready documents for required filings, and full actuarial support
for defined benefit plans. Additional services include non-qualified plan administration, investment advisory services, and merger and acquisition support.

In addition, we offer a broad range of brokerage and banking solutions, including rollover individual retirement accounts, or IRA’s, mutual funds,
and guaranteed income products. Our rollover products and services are marketed to participants who terminate or retire from organizations that are clients of our retirement plan recordkeeping services.



Institutional Investment Products

The institutional investment products business primarily offers products to the stable value and payout annuity markets.

Stable Value Markets.

Our stable
value markets area manufactures general account investment-only products for use in retail and institutional capital markets and qualified plan markets. Our primary investment-only products are GICs, funding agreements, retail notes and
institutional notes. This unit also manufactures general and separate account stable value products for our full service business, the results of which are reflected in the results of the full service business.

Our investment-only general account products offered within this market
contain an obligation to pay interest at a specified rate and to repay principal at maturity or following contract termination. Because these obligations are backed by our general account, we bear the investment and asset/liability management risk
associated with these contracts. Generally, profits from our general account products result from the spread between the rate of return on the investments we make and the interest rates we credit, less expenses. The credited interest rates we offer
and the volume of issuance are impacted by many factors, including the financial strength ratings of our U.S. insurance companies.

We also offer investment-only fee-based stable value products, through which customers’ funds are held in either a separate account or a client-owned
trust. We pass investment results through to the customer, subject to a minimum interest rate guarantee.

Payout Annuity Markets.

Our payout annuity markets area offers traditional general and separate account products designed to
provide a predictable source of monthly income, generally for the life of the participant, such as structured settlements, voluntary income products and close-out annuities, which fulfill the payment guarantee needs of the personal injury lawsuit
settlement market, the distribution needs of defined contribution participants and the payment obligations of defined benefit plans, respectively. With our general account products, the obligation to make annuity payments to our annuitants is backed
by our general account assets, and we bear all of the investment, mortality, retirement, asset/liability management, and expense risk associated with these contracts. Our profits from structured settlements, voluntary income products and close-out
annuities result from the emerging experience related to investment returns, timing of retirements, mortality, and expenses being more or less favorable than assumed in the original pricing.

We also offer participating separate account annuity contracts, which are
fee-based products that cover payments to retirees to be made by defined benefit plans. These contracts permit a plan sponsor to retain the risks and rewards of investment and actuarial results while receiving a general account guarantee for all
annuity payments covered by the contract. To the extent that Prudential Financial’s asset management units are selected to manage client assets associated with fee-based products, those units also earn asset management fees.

Marketing and Distribution

We distribute our products through a variety of channels. In our full
service business, we market to plan sponsors through a centralized wholesaling force, as well as through field sales representatives who manage our distribution efforts in offices across the country. We also sell our products and services through
financial advisors of our Wachovia Securities joint venture, as well as through other third-party financial advisors, brokers, and benefits consultants and, to a lesser extent, directly to plan sponsors. We market our rollover IRA products and
services to plan participants through a centralized service team.

In our stable value markets area within our institutional investment products business, we distribute GICs and funding agreements to institutional investors through our direct sales force and through intermediaries. In 2003, we broadened
our distribution by establishing a global Funding Agreement Notes Issuance Program, or FANIP, pursuant to which a Delaware statutory trust issues medium-term notes secured by funding agreements issued to the trust by Prudential Insurance. The
medium-term notes are sold to institutional investors through intermediaries under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”). In addition, a portion of Prudential Financial’s
SEC-registered medium-term notes program is allocated for sales to retail investors. The proceeds from the sale of the retail notes are used by Prudential Financial to purchase funding agreements from Prudential Insurance.



In our payout annuity markets area within our institutional investment products business, structured
settlements are distributed through structured settlement specialists. Voluntary income products are distributed through the defined contribution portion of our full service business, directly to plan sponsors, or as part of annuity shopping
services. Close-out annuities and participating separate account annuity products are typically distributed through actuarial consultants and third-party brokers.

Underwriting and Pricing

We set our rates for our stable value products within our full service and institutional investment products businesses using a pricing model that
considers the investment environment and our risk, expense and profitability assumptions. In addition, for products within our payout annuity market area, our model also uses assumptions for mortality and early retirement risks. Upon sale of a
product, we adjust the duration of our asset portfolio and lock in the prevailing interest rates. Management continuously monitors cash flow experience and works closely with our Asset Liability Management and Risk Management Groups to review
performance and ensure compliance with our investment policies.

Reserves

We establish reserves for future policy benefits and
policyholders’ account balances to recognize our future obligations for our products. Our liabilities for accumulation products generally represent cumulative policyholder account balances and additional reserves for investment experience that
will accrue to the customer but have not yet been reflected in credited rates. Our liabilities for products within our payout annuity market area represent the present value of future guaranteed benefits plus maintenance expenses and are based on
our actuarial assumptions. We perform a cash flow analysis in conjunction with determining our reserves for future policy benefits.

International Insurance and Investments Division

The International Insurance and Investments division conducts its business through the International Insurance and International Investments segments.

International Insurance

Our International Insurance segment manufactures and distributes individual
life insurance products to the mass affluent and affluent markets in Japan, Korea and other foreign countries through its Life Planner operations. In addition, we offer similar products to the broad middle income market across Japan through Life
Advisors, who are associated with our separately-operated Gibraltar Life Insurance Company, Ltd., or Gibraltar Life, operation, which we acquired in April 2001. We commenced sales in foreign markets through our Life Planner operations, as follows:
Japan, 1988; Taiwan, 1990; Italy, 1990; Korea, 1991; Brazil, 1998; Argentina, 1999; Poland, 2000; and Mexico, 2006. We also have representative offices in China and India. During 2007, we entered into a joint venture in India where we have a 26%
interest, the maximum currently allowed by regulation in India. We expect the joint venture to receive its insurance license and begin sales in 2008. In addition, we also have an investment, through a consortium of investors, that holds a minority
interest in China Pacific Insurance (Group) Co., Ltd.

In
certain countries where we operate, particularly Japan and Korea, our products are highly regulated and, as a result, premium levels do not vary significantly between competitors. Therefore, we generally compete more on service provided to the
customer than on price. In our operations other than Gibraltar Life, we compete by focusing on a limited market using our Life Planner model to offer high quality service and needs-based protection products. The success of our model in some markets
makes us vulnerable to imitation and targeted recruitment of our sales force; thus the loss of highly skilled and productive Life Planners to competitors is a significant competitive risk. We direct substantial efforts to recruit and retain our Life
Planners by continuously evaluating and adjusting our training and compensation programs, where appropriate, to positively impact retention and satisfaction.



We manage each operation on a stand-alone basis with local management and sales teams with oversight by
senior executives based in Asia and Newark, New Jersey. Each operation has its own marketing, underwriting and claims, and investment management functions. In addition, large portions of the general account investment portfolios are managed by our
International Investments segment. Each operation invests primarily in local currency securities, typically bonds issued by the local government or its agencies. In our larger operations, we have more diversified portfolios that include investments
in U.S. dollar securities.

On November 1, 2004, we
acquired Aoba Life Insurance Company, Ltd., or Aoba Life, for $191 million of total consideration. Aoba Life was a Japanese life insurer with a run-off book of insurance contracts. We integrated and merged Aoba Life into our Life Planner operation
in Japan in February 2005.

Products

We currently offer various traditional whole life, term life, endowment
policies, which provide for payment on the earlier of death or maturity, and retirement income life insurance products that combine an insurance protection element similar to that of whole life policies with a retirement income feature. In some of
our operations we also offer certain health products with fixed benefits, as well as annuity products, primarily U.S. dollar denominated fixed annuities in Gibraltar Life. We also offer variable life products in Japan, Korea and Taiwan and
interest-sensitive life products in Japan, Taiwan and Argentina. Generally, our international insurance products are non-participating and denominated in local currency, with the exception of products in Argentina, which are mostly U.S. dollar
denominated, and certain policies in Japan, Korea, and Mexico that are also U.S. dollar denominated. For these dollar denominated products, both premiums and benefits are guaranteed in U.S. dollars.

Marketing and Distribution

The following table sets forth the number of Life Planners and Life Advisors
for the periods indicated.

(1)

In 2007, 82 Life Planners were transferred to Gibraltar primarily to support our efforts to expand our bank channel distribution.

Life Planner Model

Our Life Planner model is significantly different from the way traditional
industry participants offer life insurance in Japan and in most of the other countries where we do business. It differs from the way we market through the Life Advisors of Gibraltar Life as well. We believe that our selection standards, training,
supervision and compensation package are key to the Life Planner model and have helped our Life Planner operations achieve higher rates of agent retention, agent productivity and policy persistency than our local competitors. In general, we recruit
Life Planners with:

•

university degrees, so that the Life Planner will have the same educational background and outlook as the target customer;

•

a minimum of two years of sales or sales management experience;

•

no life insurance sales experience; and

•

a pattern of job stability and success.

The Life Planner’s objective is to sell protection-oriented life insurance products on a needs basis to mass affluent and affluent customers.



The rate of increase in our Life Planners in our Japanese operations was lower, from December 31,
2006 to December 31, 2007, as compared to the prior period, reflecting the impact of the transfer of 82 Life Planners to Gibraltar in 2007 primarily to support our efforts to expand our bank channel distribution. The increase in Life Planners
in all other countries, from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007, was driven by increases of 66 and 90 in Korea and Taiwan, respectively.

Life Advisors

Our Life Advisors are the proprietary distribution force for products offered by Gibraltar Life. Their focus is to provide individual protection products
to the broad middle income market in Japan, particularly through relationships with affinity groups. Following the acquisition of Gibraltar Life in 2001, and continuing through 2003, the number of Life Advisors decreased as we instituted measures to
increase the cost-effectiveness of this distribution channel, including a transition from a compensation structure that was formerly based mainly on fixed compensation to a variable compensation plan designed to improve productivity and persistency
that is similar to compensation plans in our Life Planner operations. The number of Life Advisors has increased over the last few years. However, growth in Life Advisors slowed in 2007 due to an increased focus on hiring practices to improve
productivity and retention.

Bank Distribution Channel

In 2006, Gibraltar Life commenced sales, primarily of U.S.
dollar denominated fixed annuity products, through banks to supplement its core Life Advisor distribution channel. As of December 31, 2007, Gibraltar Life had distribution agreements with seven banks. Beginning in early 2008, Gibraltar Life
will introduce a Yen-denominated variable annuity product in the bank channel, and expects to begin selling protection products as a result of the liberalization of banking regulations allowing for the sale of additional insurance products.

Underwriting and Pricing

Our International Insurance segment is subject to substantial local
regulation that is generally more restrictive for product offerings, pricing and structure than U.S. insurance regulation. Each International Insurance operation has its own underwriting department that employs variations of U.S. practices in
underwriting individual policy risks. In setting underwriting limits, we also consider local industry standards to prevent adverse selection and to stay abreast of industry trends. In addition, we set underwriting limits together with each
operation’s reinsurers.

Pricing of individual life
insurance products, particularly in Japan and Korea, is more regulated than in the U.S. Generally, premiums in each country are different for participating and non-participating products, but within each product type they are generally similar for
all companies. Mortality and morbidity rates and interest rates that we use to calculate premiums are restricted by regulation on the basis of product type by country. Interest rates guaranteed under our insurance contracts may exceed the rates of
return we earn on our investments, and, as a result, we may experience negative spreads between the rate we guarantee and the rate we earn on investments. These spreads had a negative impact on the overall results of our Life Planner operations over
the past four years. The profitability on our products from these operations results primarily from margins on mortality, morbidity and expense charges. In addition, the profitability of our products is impacted by differences between actual
mortality experience and the assumptions used in pricing these policies and, as a result, can fluctuate from period to period. However, we anticipate over the long-term to achieve the mortality levels reflected in the assumptions used in pricing our
products.

Reserves

We establish and carry as liabilities actuarially determined reserves for
future policy benefits that we believe will meet our future obligations. We base fixed death benefit reserves on assumptions we believe to be appropriate for investment yield, persistency, mortality and morbidity rates, expenses and margins for
adverse deviation. For variable and interest-sensitive life products, as well as annuity products, we establish liabilities for policyholders’ account balances that represent cumulative gross premiums collected plus interest or investment



results credited less surrenders, and charges for cost of insurance and administration fees. The reserves for many of our products have long durations and,
in some of these markets, it is difficult to find appropriate assets with the same long duration.

Reinsurance

International Insurance reinsures portions of its insurance risks with both selected third party reinsurers and Prudential Insurance under reinsurance agreements primarily on a yearly renewable term basis. International Insurance also buys
catastrophe reinsurance that covers multiple deaths from a single occurrence in our Life Planner operations in Japan, Taiwan and Brazil. We also have coinsurance agreements with Prudential Insurance for the U.S. dollar denominated business in our
Japanese Life Planner insurance operations.

International Investments

Our International Investments segment offers proprietary and
non-proprietary asset management, investment advice and services to retail and institutional clients in selected international markets. These services are marketed through proprietary and third party distribution networks and encompass the
businesses of our international investments operations and our global commodities group, which are described in more detail below.

Our international investments operations include manufacturing of proprietary products and distribution of both proprietary and non-proprietary products,
tailored to meet client needs. In this business, we invest in asset management and distribution businesses in targeted countries to expand our mass affluent customer base outside the U.S. and to increase our global assets under management. We seek
to establish long-term relationships with our clients through our proprietary distribution network and we believe this provides an advantage over some competitors who provide only asset management services. Additionally, this business manages large
portions of the general account investment portfolios of our international insurance operations.

Our global commodities group provides advice, sales and trading on a global basis covering a wide variety of commodity, financial and foreign exchange
futures, swap and forward contracts, including agricultural commodities, base and precious metals, major currencies, interest rate and stock indices. We conduct these operations through offices in the U.S., Europe and Asia, and are members of most
major futures exchanges. Our client base is primarily institutional. We conduct futures transactions on margin according to the regulations of the different futures exchanges. To the extent clients are unable to meet their commitments and margin
deposits are insufficient to cover outstanding liabilities, we may be required to purchase or sell financial instruments at prevailing market prices in order to fulfill the client’s obligations.

In 2004, our international investments operations acquired an 80 percent
interest in Hyundai Investment and Securities Co., Ltd., a Korean asset management firm, from an agency of the Korean government, for $301 million in cash, including $210 million used to repay debt assumed. Subsequent to the acquisition, the company
was renamed Prudential Investment & Securities Co., Ltd., or PISC. On January 25, 2008, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 20 percent for $90 million and PISC is now a wholly owned operation.

On July 12, 2007, our international investments operations sold its
50% interest in the operating joint ventures Oppenheim Pramerica Fonds Trust GmbH and Oppenheim Pramerica Asset Management S.a.r.l., which were accounted for under the equity method, to our partner Oppenheim S.C.A. for $121 million. These businesses
establish, package and distribute mutual fund products to German and other European retail investors. We recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of $37 million in 2007.

On January 18, 2008, we made an additional investment of $154 million in our UBI Pramerica operating joint venture in
Italy, which we account for under the equity method. This additional investment was necessary to maintain our ownership interest at 35% and was a result of the merger of our joint venture partner with another Italian bank, and their subsequent
consolidation of their asset management companies into the UBI Pramerica joint venture.



Corporate and Other

Corporate and Other includes corporate operations that are not allocated to any of our business segments and the real estate and relocation
services business, as well as divested businesses except for those that qualify for “discontinued operations” accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP.

Corporate Operations

Corporate operations consist primarily of: (1) corporate-level income and expenses, after allocation to any of our business segments, including
income and expense from our qualified pension and other employee benefit plans and investment returns on our capital that is not deployed in any of our business segments; (2) returns from investments that we do not allocate to any of our
business segments, including debt-financed investment portfolios, as well as tax credit investments and other tax enhanced investments financed by our business segments; and (3) businesses that we have placed in wind-down status but have not
been divested as well as the impact of transactions with other segments. Corporate operations also include certain retained obligations relating to policyholders whom we had previously agreed to provide insurance for reduced or no premium in
accordance with contractual settlements related to prior individual life insurance sales practices remediation.

Wind-down Businesses

We have not actively engaged in the life reinsurance market since the early 1990s; however, we remain subject to mortality risk for certain assumed
individual life insurance polices under the terms of the reinsurance treaties.

In 1992, we ceased writing individual disability income policies and a year later ceased writing hospital expense and major medical policies. Most of our individual disability income policies are non-cancelable;
however, we reinsured all of these policies as of July 1999. For our hospital expense and major medical policies, the 1997 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act guarantees renewal. Under certain circumstances, with appropriate
approvals from state regulatory authorities, we are permitted to change the premiums charged for these policies if we can demonstrate the premiums have not been sufficient to pay claims and expenses.

Residential Real Estate Brokerage Franchise and Relocation Services

Prudential Real Estate and Relocation Services is our integrated real estate
brokerage franchise and relocation services business. The real estate group markets franchises primarily to existing real estate companies. Our franchise agreements grant the franchisee the right to use the Prudential name and real estate service
marks in return for royalty payments on gross commissions generated by the franchisees. The franchises generally are independently owned and operated. This business also has a finance subsidiary that makes debt and equity investments in a limited
number of franchisees.

Our relocation group offers
institutional clients and government agencies a variety of services in connection with the relocation of their employees. These services include: coordination of appraisal; inspection, purchase and sale of relocating employees’ homes; equity
advances to relocating employees; assistance in locating homes at the relocating employee’s destination; household goods moving services; client cost-tracking and a variety of relocation policy and group move consulting services. Generally the
client is responsible for carrying costs and any loss on sale with respect to a relocating employee's home that is purchased by us. Our government clients and certain corporate clients utilize a fixed price program under which we assume the benefits
and burdens of ownership, including carrying costs and any loss on sale.

Divested Businesses

The following operations
are businesses that have been or will be sold or exited that did not qualify for “discontinued operations” accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP. We include the results of these divested businesses in our income from continuing operations,
but we exclude these results from our adjusted operating income. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Consolidated Results of Operations” for an explanation of adjusted
operating income.



Property and Casualty Insurance

In the fourth quarter of 2003, we sold our property and casualty insurance companies that operated nationally in 48 states
outside of New Jersey, and the District of Columbia, to Liberty Mutual Group, or Liberty Mutual, and our New Jersey property and casualty insurance companies to Palisades Group. Historically, the companies we sold manufactured and distributed
personal lines property and casualty insurance products, principally automobile and homeowners coverages, to the U.S. retail market.

We have reinsured Liberty Mutual for certain losses, including any adverse loss development on the stop-loss reinsurance agreement with Everest Re Group,
Ltd., or Everest, discussed below; any adverse loss development on losses occurring prior to the sale that arise from insurance contracts generated through certain discontinued distribution channels or due to certain loss events; and stop-loss
protection on losses occurring after the sale and arising from those same distribution channels of up to $95 million, in excess of related premiums and other adjustments. The reinsurance covering the losses associated with the discontinued
distribution channels will be settled based upon loss experience through December 31, 2008 with a provision that profits on the insurance business from these channels will be shared, with Liberty Mutual receiving up to $20 million of the first
$50 million. We believe that we have adequately reserved for the obligations under these reinsurance contracts based on the current information available; however, we may be required to take additional charges in the future that could be material to
our results of operations in a particular quarterly or annual period. We have also retained certain liabilities for pre-closing litigation for which we believe we have adequately reserved.

We have agreed not to compete with the buyers. In New Jersey, the non-compete
agreement is effective until the earlier of December 31, 2008 or the termination of our distribution agreement with Palisades Group. Outside of New Jersey, the non-compete agreement is effective until the termination of our distribution
agreement with Liberty Mutual.

Prudential Securities Capital Markets

In the fourth quarter of 2000, we announced a
restructuring of Prudential Securities’ activities to implement a fundamental shift in our business strategy. We subsequently exited the lead-managed equity underwriting business for corporate issuers and the institutional fixed income
business. As of December 31, 2007 we had remaining assets amounting to $116 million related to Prudential Securities’ institutional fixed income activities.

Exchange shares previously held by Prudential Equity Group

In the second quarter of 2007, we exited the equity sales, trading and research operations of the Prudential Equity Group,
and retained certain securities relating to trading exchange memberships of these former operations. These securities were received in 2006 in connection with the commencement of public trading of stock exchange shares.

Other

We previously marketed individual life insurance in Canada through Prudential of America Life Insurance Company, or PALIC.
In 2000, we sold our interest in PALIC and indemnified the purchaser for certain liabilities with respect to claims related to sales practices or market conduct issues arising from operations prior to the sale. We also remain subject to mortality
risk related to certain policies sold by PALIC under assumed reinsurance.

In September 2000, we sold all of the stock of Gibraltar Casualty Company, a commercial property and casualty insurer that we had placed in wind-down status in 1985, to Everest. Upon closing of the sale, a subsidiary
of the Company entered into a stop-loss reinsurance agreement with Everest whereby the subsidiary reinsured Everest for up to 80% of the first $200 million of any adverse loss development in excess of Gibraltar Casualty’s carried reserves as of
the closing of the sale to Everest. Subsequently, as part of the sale of our property and casualty operations discussed above, we sold this subsidiary, along with $106 million of reserves related to the reinsurance agreement with Everest, to Liberty
Mutual. We reinsured Liberty Mutual with regard to any further adverse loss development on the stop-loss reinsurance agreement with Everest and recorded a liability for the remaining $54 million of this obligation in 2003 under the reinsurance
contracts with Liberty Mutual discussed above.



Prior to May 1996, we conducted substantial residential first mortgage banking and related operations
through The Prudential Home Mortgage Company, Inc. and its affiliates. During 1996 and 1997, we sold substantially all of the operations, mortgage loan inventory and loan servicing rights of this business. In 2002, we negotiated a release from
future indemnification obligations with Wells Fargo, buyer of the largest portion of the portfolio, related to pre-sale activity. However, we remain liable with respect to certain claims concerning these operations prior to sale. We believe that we
have adequately reserved in all material respects for the remaining liabilities.

Discontinued Operations

Discontinued operations reflect the results of the following businesses which qualified for “discontinued operations” accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP:

•

We sold substantially all of the assets and liabilities of our group managed and indemnity healthcare business to Aetna Inc. in 1999.

•

We discontinued certain branches of our international securities operations in the fourth quarter of 2002. In the fourth quarter of 2004 we discontinued the
remaining branches of our international securities operations.

•

We discontinued our retail broker-dealer operations in Tokyo in the fourth quarter of 2002 and subsequently sold these operations in the third quarter of 2003.

•

We discontinued our specialty automobile insurance business in the first quarter of 2003 and subsequently sold these operations in the third quarter of 2003.

•

We discontinued our existing consumer banking business in the third quarter of 2003 and subsequently sold these operations in 2004.

•

We discontinued our work-place distribution property and casualty insurance operations in the fourth quarter of 2003. We subsequently sold these operations in the
first quarter of 2004.

•

We discontinued our Dryden Wealth Management business, which offered financial advisory, private banking and portfolio management services primarily to retail
investors in Europe and Asia, in the second quarter of 2005. We subsequently sold these operations in the fourth quarter of 2005.

•

We discontinued our Philippine insurance operations in the second quarter of 2006 and subsequently sold these operations in the third quarter of 2006.

•

We sold substantially all of Prudential Insurance’s Canadian branch operations and policies in force and all of our Canadian property and casualty operations
in 1996. In the third quarter of 2006, we entered into a reinsurance transaction related to the Canadian Intermediate Weekly Premium and Individual Health operations, which resulted in these operations being accounted for as “discontinued
operations.”

•

We discontinued the equity sales, trading and research operations of the Prudential Equity Group in the second quarter of 2007.

In addition, direct real estate investments that are sold or held for sale
may require “discontinued operations” accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP.

Closed Block Business

In connection with the demutualization, we ceased offering domestic participating individual life insurance products, under which policyholders are eligible to receive policyholder dividends reflecting experience. The liabilities for our
individual in force participating products were segregated, together with assets that will be used exclusively for the payment of benefits and policyholder dividends, expenses and taxes with respect to these products, in the Closed Block. We
selected the amount of Closed Block Assets that we expect will generate sufficient cash flow, together with anticipated revenues from the Closed Block Policies, over the life of the Closed Block to fund payments of all expenses, taxes, and
policyholder benefits to be paid to, and the reasonable



dividend expectations of, holders of the Closed Block Policies. We also segregated for accounting purposes the Surplus and Related Assets that we needed to
hold outside the Closed Block to meet capital requirements related to the policies included within the Closed Block at the time of demutualization. No policies sold after demutualization will be added to the Closed Block, and its in force business
is expected to decline ultimately as we pay policyholder benefits in full. We also expect the proportion of our business represented by the Closed Block to decline as we grow other businesses. For a discussion of the Closed Block Business,
see “—Demutualization and Separation of the Businesses—Separation of the Businesses.”

Our strategy for the Closed Block Business is to maintain the Closed Block as required by our Plan of Reorganization over the time period of its gradual
diminishment as policyholder benefits are paid in full. We are permitted under the Plan of Reorganization, with the prior consent of the New Jersey Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, to enter into agreements to transfer to a third party all or
any part of the risks under the Closed Block policies. In 2005, we completed the process of arranging reinsurance of the Closed Block. The Closed Block is 90% reinsured, including 17% by a wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial. As
discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, if the performance of the Closed Block is more favorable than we originally assumed in funding and not otherwise offset by future Closed Block performance that is less favorable than we
originally expected, we will pay the excess to Closed Block policyholders as part of policyholder dividends, and it will not be available to shareholders. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for revenues, income and loss, and total
assets of the Closed Block Business.

Intangible and
Intellectual Property

We use numerous federal, state and foreign servicemarks and trademarks. We believe that the goodwill associated with many of our servicemarks and trademarks, particularly “Prudential

®

,” “Prudential Financial

®

,” “Growing and Protecting Your Wealth

®

” and
our “Rock” logo, are significant competitive assets in the U.S.

On April 20, 2004, we entered into a servicemark and trademark agreement with Prudential plc of the United Kingdom, with whom we have no affiliation, concerning the parties’ respective rights worldwide to
use the names “Prudential” and “Pru.” The agreement is intended to avoid customer confusion in areas where both companies compete. Under the agreement, there are restrictions on our use of the “Prudential” name and mark
in a number of countries outside the Americas, including Europe and parts of Asia. Where these limitations apply, we combine our “Rock” logo with alternative word marks. We believe that these limitations do not materially affect our
ability to operate or expand internationally.

Ratings

Claims-paying and credit ratings are important factors
affecting public confidence in an insurer and its competitive position in marketing products. Rating organizations continually review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including Prudential Insurance and our other insurance company
subsidiaries. Our credit ratings are also important to our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt and to the cost of such financing.



Claims-paying ratings, which are sometimes referred to as “financial strength” ratings,
represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding the financial ability of an insurance company to meet its obligations under an insurance policy. Credit ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding an entity’s ability to repay
its indebtedness. The following table summarizes the ratings for Prudential Financial, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries as of the date of this filing.

*

“NR” indicates not rated.

(1)

A.M. Best Company, which we refer to as A.M. Best, claims-paying ratings for insurance companies currently range from “A++ (superior)” to “F (in liquidation).”
A.M. Best’s ratings reflect its opinion of an insurance company’s financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders.

An A.M. Best long-term credit rating is an opinion of the capacity and willingness of an obligor to pay interest and principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation. A.M.
Best long-term credit ratings range from “aaa (exceptional)” to “d (in default),” with ratings from “aaa” to “bbb” considered as investment grade. An A.M. Best short-term credit rating reflects an opinion of
the issuer’s fundamental credit quality. Ratings range from “AMB-1+,” which represents an exceptional ability to repay short-term debt obligations, to “AMB-4,” which correlates with a speculative (“bb”) long-term
rating.

(2)

Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, which we refer to as S&P, claims-paying ratings currently range from “AAA (extremely strong)” to “R (regulatory
supervision).” These ratings reflect S&P’s opinion of an operating insurance company’s financial capacity to meet the obligations of its insurance policies in accordance with their terms. A “+” or “-” indicates
relative strength within a category.

An S&P credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation, a specific class of financial obligations or a
specific financial program. S&P’s long-term issue credit ratings range from “AAA (extremely strong)” to “D (default).” S&P short-term ratings range from “A-1 (highest category)” to “D (default).”

(3)

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., which we refer to as Moody’s, insurance claims-paying ratings currently range from “Aaa (exceptional)” to “C
(lowest).” Moody’s insurance ratings reflect the ability of insurance companies to repay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations. Numeric modifiers are used to refer to the ranking within the group—with 1 being the
highest and 3 being the lowest. However, the financial strength of companies within a generic rating symbol (“Aa” for example) is broadly the same.

Moody’s credit ratings currently range from “Aaa (highest)” to “C (default).” Moody’s credit ratings grade debt according to its investment quality.
Moody’s considers “A1,” “A2” and “A3” rated debt to be upper medium grade obligations, subject to low credit risk. Moody’s short-term ratings are opinions of the ability of issuers to honor senior financial
obligations and contracts. Prime ratings range from “Prime-1 (P-1),” which represents a superior ability for repayment of senior short-term debt obligations, to “Prime-3 (P-3),” which represents an acceptable ability for
repayment of such obligations. Issuers rated “Not Prime” do not fall within any of the Prime rating categories.

(4)

Fitch Ratings Ltd., which we refer to as Fitch, claims-paying ratings currently range from “AAA (exceptionally strong)” to “D (distressed).” Fitch’s ratings
reflect its assessment of the likelihood of timely payment of policyholder and contractholder obligations.

Fitch long-term credit ratings currently range from “AAA (highest credit quality),” which denotes exceptionally strong capacity for timely payment of financial
commitments, to “D (default).” Investment grade ratings range between “AAA” and “BBB.” Short-term ratings range from “F1 (highest credit quality)” to “C (high default risk).” Within long-term and
short-term ratings, a “+” or a “–” may be appended to a rating to denote relative status within major rating categories.

(5)

Includes the retail medium-term notes program.

(6)

Formerly known as American Skandia Life Assurance Corporation.



The ratings set forth above with respect to Prudential Financial, Prudential Funding, LLC, Prudential
Insurance and our other insurance and financing subsidiaries reflect current opinions of each rating organization with respect to claims-paying ability, financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet obligations to policyholders or
debt holders, as the case may be. These ratings are of concern to policyholders, agents and intermediaries. They are not directed toward shareholders and do not in any way reflect evaluations of the safety and security of the Common Stock. A
downgrade in our claims-paying or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, reduce our competitiveness, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered, increase our borrowing costs, cause additional collateral
requirements under certain agreements, and/or hurt our relationships with creditors or trading counterparties. Our claims-paying ratings are an important factor affecting public confidence in most of our products and, as a result, our
competitiveness. The interest rates we pay on our borrowings are largely dependent on our credit ratings. Provided below is a discussion of the major rating changes that occurred from the beginning of 2007 through the date of this filing.

On May 3, 2007, Standard & Poor’s raised
Prudential Insurance, PRUCO Life Insurance, PRUCO Life Insurance of New Jersey, American Skandia Life Assurance, Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity, Prudential Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (Prudential of Japan) and Gibraltar Insurance Co., Ltd.
financial strength ratings to “AA” from “AA-.” Standard & Poor’s also raised the counterparty credit ratings on Prudential Financial to “A+/A-1” from “A/A-1”, the counterparty credit rating on
the capital and surplus notes of Prudential Insurance to “A+” from “A”, the long-term senior debt rating of Prudential Funding, LLC to “AA” from “AA-” and the long-term senior debt rating of PRICOA Global
Funding to “AA” from “AA-”. S&P stated that the outlook on all these companies is stable.

Competition

In each of our businesses we face intense competition from U.S. and international insurance companies, asset managers and diversified financial institutions. Many of our competitors are large and well-capitalized and some have greater
market share or breadth of distribution, offer a broader range of products, services or features, assume a greater level of risk, have lower profitability expectations or have higher claims-paying or credit ratings than we do. We compete in our
businesses based on a number of factors including brand recognition, reputation, quality of service, quality of investment advice, investment performance of our products, product features, scope of distribution and distribution arrangements, price,
risk management capabilities, capital management capabilities, perceived financial strength, and claims-paying and credit ratings. The relative importance of these factors varies across our products and the markets we serve.

In recent years, there has been consolidation among companies in the
financial services industry. We expect that the trend toward consolidation in the financial services industry will continue and may result in competitors with increased market shares, or the introduction of larger or financially stronger competitors
through acquisitions or otherwise, in lines of business in which we compete.

We could be subject to claims by competitors that our products infringe their patents, which could adversely affect our sales, profitability and financial position.

Certain of our products compete on the basis of investment performance. A
material decline in the investment performance of these products could have an adverse effect on our sales. Rankings and ratings of investment performance have a significant effect on our ability to increase our assets under management.

Competition for personnel in our businesses is intense, including our
captive sales personnel and our investment managers. In the ordinary course of business, we lose personnel from time to time in whom we have invested significant training. We direct substantial efforts to recruit and retain our agents and to
increase their productivity. The loss of key investment managers could have a material adverse effect on our Asset Management segment.

Many of our businesses are in industries where access to multiple sales channels may be a competitive advantage. We currently sell insurance and
investment products through both affiliated and non-affiliated distribution channels, including (1) our captive sales channel, (2) independent agents, brokers and financial



planners, (3) broker-dealers that generally are members of the New York Stock Exchange, including “wirehouse” and regional broker-dealer
firms, (4) broker-dealers affiliated with banks or that specialize in marketing to customers of banks, and (5) intermediaries such as retirement plan administrators. While we believe that certain insurance and investment products will
continue to be sold primarily through face-to-face sales channels, customers’ desire for objective and not product-related advice will, over time, increase the amount of such insurance and investment products sold through non-affiliated
distributors. In addition, we expect that certain insurance and investment products will increasingly be sold through direct marketing, including through electronic commerce.

The proliferation and growth of non-affiliated distribution channels puts pressure on our captive sales channels to remain
competitive with respect to product offerings, compensation, services offered, and recruiting and retention. We continue our efforts to strengthen and broaden our sales channels, but we cannot assure that we will be successful. We run the risk that
our competitors will have more distribution channels, stronger relationships with non-affiliated distribution channels, or will make a more significant or rapid shift to direct distribution alternatives than we anticipate or are able to achieve
ourselves. If this happens, our market share and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our ability to sell certain insurance products, including traditional guaranteed products depends significantly on our claims-paying ratings. A downgrade
in our claims-paying ratings could adversely affect our ability to sell our insurance products and reduce our profitability.

Regulation

Overview

Our businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision. The purpose of these regulations is primarily to protect our customers and not
necessarily our shareholders. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are regularly re-examined, and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations. U.S. law and
regulation of our international business, particularly as it relates to monitoring customer activities, is likely to increase as a result of terrorist activity in the U.S. and abroad and may affect our ability to attract and retain customers. The
discussion immediately below is primarily focused on applicable U.S. regulation. A separate discussion of the regulations affecting our international businesses is provided later in this section under “—Regulation of our International
Businesses.”

Insurance Operations

State insurance laws regulate all aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses,
and state insurance departments in the fifty states, the District of Columbia and various U.S. territories and possessions monitor our insurance operations. Prudential Insurance is domiciled in New Jersey and its principal insurance regulatory
authority is the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance. Our other U.S. insurance companies are principally regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled. Generally, our insurance products must be approved
by the insurance regulators in the state in which they are sold. Our insurance products are substantially affected by federal and state tax laws. Products in the U.S. that also constitute “securities,” such as variable life insurance and
variable annuities, are also subject to federal and some state securities laws and regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, and some state securities commissions regulate
and supervise these products.

Investment Products and Asset Management
Operations

Our investment products and services are
subject to federal and state securities, fiduciary, including the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, and other laws and regulations. The SEC, FINRA, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, state securities commissions, state
insurance departments and the United States Department of Labor are the principal U.S. regulators that regulate our asset management operations.



Securities Operations

Our securities operations, principally conducted by a number of SEC-registered broker-dealers are subject to federal and
state securities, commodities and related laws. The SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or the CFTC, state securities authorities, FINRA, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, and similar authorities are the principal regulators of
our securities operations.

Regulation Affecting Prudential Financial

Prudential Financial is the holding company for all of our
operations. Prudential Financial itself is not licensed as an insurer, investment advisor, broker-dealer, bank or other regulated entity. However, because it owns regulated entities, Prudential Financial is subject to regulation as an insurance
holding company and, as discussed under “—Other Businesses” below, a savings and loan holding company. As a company with publicly traded securities, Prudential Financial is subject to legal and regulatory requirements applicable
generally to public companies, including the rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE relating to public reporting and disclosure, securities trading, accounting and financial reporting, and corporate governance matters. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002 and rules and regulations adopted in furtherance of that Act have substantially increased the requirements in these and other areas for public companies such as Prudential Financial.

Insurance Holding Company Regulation

Prudential Financial is subject to the insurance holding company laws in the
states where our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, which currently include New Jersey, Arizona, Connecticut and Indiana, or are treated as commercially domiciled, such as New York. These laws generally require each insurance company directly or
indirectly owned by the holding company to register with the insurance department in the insurance company’s state of domicile and to furnish annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company
system. Generally, all transactions affecting the insurers in the holding company system must be fair and at arm’s length and, if material, require prior notice and approval or non-disapproval by the state’s insurance department.

Most states, including the states in which our U.S. insurance
companies are domiciled, have insurance laws that require regulatory approval of a direct or indirect change of control of an insurer or an insurer’s holding company. Laws such as these that apply to us prevent any person from acquiring control
of Prudential Financial or of our insurance subsidiaries unless that person has filed a statement with specified information with the insurance regulators and has obtained their prior approval. Under most states’ statutes, acquiring 10% or more
of the voting stock of an insurance company or its parent company is presumptively considered a change of control, although such presumption may be rebutted. Accordingly, any person who acquires 10% or more of the voting securities of Prudential
Financial without the prior approval of the insurance regulators of the states in which our U.S. insurance companies are domiciled will be in violation of these states’ laws and may be subject to injunctive action requiring the disposition or
seizure of those securities by the relevant insurance regulator or prohibiting the voting of those securities and to other actions determined by the relevant insurance regulator.

In addition, many state insurance laws require prior notification of state insurance departments of a change in control of a
non-domiciliary insurance company doing business in that state. While these prenotification statutes do not authorize the state insurance departments to disapprove the change in control, they authorize regulatory action in the affected state if
particular conditions exist such as undue market concentration. Any future transactions that would constitute a change in control of Prudential Financial may require prior notification in those states that have adopted preacquisition notification
laws.

These laws may discourage potential acquisition
proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of Prudential Financial, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some shareholders of Prudential Financial might consider desirable.



Insurance Operations

State Insurance Regulation

State insurance authorities have broad administrative powers with respect to all aspects of the insurance business including:

•

licensing to transact business,

•

licensing agents,

•

admittance of assets to statutory surplus,

•

regulating premium rates for certain insurance products,

•

approving policy forms,

•

regulating unfair trade and claims practices,

•

establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards,

•

fixing maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans and minimum accumulation or surrender values, and

•

regulating the type, amounts and valuations of investments permitted and other matters.

State insurance laws and regulations require our U.S. insurance companies to
file financial statements with state insurance departments everywhere they do business, and the operations of our U.S. insurance companies and accounts are subject to examination by those departments at any time. Our U.S. insurance companies prepare
statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by these departments. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or the NAIC, has approved a series of statutory accounting
principles that have been adopted, in some cases with minor modifications, by all state insurance departments.

State insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the books and records, financial reporting, policy filings and market conduct of insurance
companies domiciled in their states, generally once every three to five years. Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the NAIC. In May 2007, the
Connecticut insurance regulator completed a routine financial examination of American Skandia Life Assurance Corporation for the five year period ended December 31, 2005, and found no material deficiencies. In February 2008, the New Jersey
insurance regulator, along with the insurance regulators of Arizona and Connecticut, substantially completed a coordinated financial examination for the five year period ended December 31, 2006 for all of our U.S. life insurance companies as
part of the normal five year examination cycle and found no material deficiencies.

Financial Regulation

Dividend Payment Limitations.

The New Jersey insurance law and the insurance laws of the other states in which our insurance companies are domiciled regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid by
Prudential Insurance and our other U.S. insurance companies. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information.

Risk-Based Capital.

In order to enhance the
regulation of insurers’ solvency, the NAIC adopted a model law to implement risk-based capital requirements for life, health and property and casualty insurance companies. All states have adopted the NAIC’s model law or a substantially
similar law. The risk-based capital, or RBC, calculation, which regulators use to assess the sufficiency of an insurer’s capital, measures the risk characteristics of a company’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. In
general, RBC is calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and reserve items. Within a given risk category, these factors are higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for items with lower underlying
risk. Insurers that have less statutory capital than the RBC calculation requires are considered to have inadequate capital and are subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending upon the level of capital inadequacy. The RBC ratios for
each of our U.S. insurance companies currently are well above the ranges that would require any regulatory or corrective action.



IRIS Tests.

The NAIC has developed a set of financial relationships or
tests known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System, or IRIS, to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of U.S. insurance companies and identifying companies that require special attention or action by insurance
regulatory authorities. Insurance companies generally submit data annually to the NAIC, which in turn analyzes the data using prescribed financial data ratios, each with defined “usual ranges.” Generally, regulators will begin to
investigate or monitor an insurance company if its ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios. If an insurance company has insufficient capital, regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance it can issue. None of our
U.S. insurance companies is currently subject to regulatory scrutiny based on these ratios.

Insurance Reserves.

State insurance laws require us to analyze the adequacy of our reserves annually. The respective appointed actuaries for each of our life insurance companies must each
submit an opinion that our reserves, when considered in light of the assets we hold with respect to those reserves, make adequate provision for our contractual obligations and related expenses.

Market Conduct Regulation

State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing
the marketplace activities of insurers, including provisions governing the form and content of disclosure to consumers, illustrations, advertising, sales practices and complaint handling. State regulatory authorities generally enforce these
provisions through periodic market conduct examinations.

Insurance Guaranty Association Assessments

Each state has insurance guaranty association laws under which insurers doing business in the state are members and may be assessed by state insurance guaranty associations for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to
policyholders and claimants. Typically, states assess each member insurer in an amount related to the member insurer’s proportionate share of the business written by all member insurers in the state. For the years ended December 31, 2007,
2006, and 2005, we paid approximately $1.9 million, $1.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively, in assessments pursuant to state insurance guaranty association laws. While we cannot predict the amount and timing of any future assessments on our
U.S. insurance companies under these laws, we have established reserves that we believe are adequate for assessments relating to insurance companies that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings.

State Securities Regulation

Our mutual funds, and in certain states our variable life insurance and
variable annuity products, are “securities” within the meaning of state securities laws. As securities, these products are subject to filing and certain other requirements. Also, sales activities with respect to these products generally
are subject to state securities regulation. Such regulation may affect investment advice, sales and related activities for these products

.

Federal Regulation

Our variable life insurance products, as well as our variable annuity and mutual fund products, generally are “securities” within the meaning of
federal securities laws, registered under the federal securities laws and subject to regulation by the SEC and FINRA. Federal and some state securities regulation similar to that discussed below under “—Investment Products and Asset
Management Operations” and “—Securities Operations” affect investment advice, sales and related activities with respect to these products. In addition, although the federal government does not comprehensively regulate the
business of insurance, federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including taxation, financial services regulation and pension and welfare benefits regulation, can significantly affect the insurance industry. Congress also
periodically considers and is considering laws affecting privacy of information and genetic testing that could significantly and adversely affect the insurance industry.



Tax Legislation

Current U.S. federal income tax laws generally permit certain holders to defer taxation on the build-up of value of annuities and life
insurance products until payments are actually made to the policyholder or other beneficiary and to exclude from taxation the death benefit paid under a life insurance contract. Congress from time to time considers legislation that could make our
products less attractive to consumers, including legislation that would reduce or eliminate the benefit of this deferral on some annuities and insurance products, as well as other types of changes that could reduce or eliminate the attractiveness of
annuities and life insurance products to consumers, such as repeal of the estate tax. In addition, legislative changes could impact the amount of taxes that we pay, thereby affecting our consolidated net income.

In June 2001, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001
was enacted. The 2001 Act contains provisions that have over time significantly reduced individual tax rates. This has the effect of reducing the benefits of tax deferral on the build-up of value of annuities and life insurance products. The 2001
Act also includes provisions that eliminate, over time, the estate, gift and generation-skipping taxes and partially eliminates the step-up in basis rule applicable to property held in a decedent’s estate. Some of these changes might hinder our
sales and result in the increased surrender of insurance and annuity products.

In May 2003, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 was enacted. Individual taxpayers are the principal beneficiaries of the 2003 Act, which includes an acceleration of certain of the income tax
rate reductions enacted originally under the 2001 Act, as well as capital gains and dividend tax rate reductions. In May 2006, the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2005 (the “2005 Act”) was enacted. The 2005 Act extends the lower tax rates
on capital gains and dividends through 2010. These rate reductions had been due to expire in 2008. Although most of the other rate reductions expire after 2008 or later, these reductions have the effect of reducing the benefits of tax deferral on
the build-up of value of annuities and life insurance products. These changes may hinder our sales and result in increased surrender of insurance and annuity products.

In October of 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 was signed into law. The 2004 Act contains a provision that subjected the
repatriation of foreign earnings to a reduced tax rate under certain circumstances through the end of 2005. During 2005, we repatriated earnings of approximately $160 million from foreign operations under the 2004 Act, for which we recorded income
tax expense of $9 million.

The U.S. Treasury Department and
the Internal Revenue Service are addressing through new regulations the methodology to be followed in determining the dividends received deduction related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts. The dividends received deduction reduces the
amount of dividend income subject to tax and is a significant component of the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate of 35%. A change in the dividends received deduction, including the possible elimination of
this deduction, could reduce our consolidated net income.

The
products we sell have different tax characteristics, including taxable income and tax deductions. Certain of our products are significantly dependent on these characteristics, which are taken into consideration when pricing products and are a
component of our capital management strategies. Accordingly, a change in tax law, or other factors impacting the availability of the tax characteristics generated by our products, could impact product pricing and returns.

ERISA

ERISA is a comprehensive federal statute that applies to U.S. employee benefit plans sponsored by private employers and
labor unions. Plans subject to ERISA include pension and profit sharing plans and welfare plans, including health, life and disability plans. ERISA provisions include reporting and disclosure rules, standards of conduct that apply to plan
fiduciaries and prohibitions on transactions known as “prohibited transactions,” such as conflict-of-interest transactions and certain transactions between a benefit plan and a party in interest. ERISA also provides for a scheme of civil
and criminal penalties and enforcement. Our insurance, asset management, plan administrative services and other businesses provide services to employee benefit plans subject to ERISA, including services where we may act as an ERISA fiduciary. In
addition to ERISA regulation of businesses providing products and services to ERISA plans, we become subject to ERISA’s prohibited transaction rules for



transactions with those plans, which may affect our ability to enter transactions, or the terms on which transactions may be entered, with those plans, even
in businesses unrelated to those giving rise to party in interest status.

USA Patriot Act

The
USA Patriot Act of 2001, enacted in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various new regulations applicable to broker-dealers
and other financial services companies, including insurance companies. The Patriot Act seeks to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or
money laundering. Anti-money laundering laws outside of the U.S. contain provisions that may be different, conflicting or more rigorous. The increased obligations of financial institutions to identify their customers, watch for and report suspicious
transactions, respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and share information with other financial institutions require the implementation and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and
controls.

Investment Products and Asset Management Operations

Some of the separate account, mutual fund and other
pooled investment products offered by our businesses, in addition to being registered under the Securities Act, are registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the shares of certain of these entities
are qualified for sale in some states and the District of Columbia. Separate account investment products are also subject to state insurance regulation as described above. We also have several subsidiaries that are registered as broker-dealers under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and are subject to federal and state regulation, including but not limited to the SEC’s Uniform Net Capital Rule, described under “—Securities Operations”
below. In addition, we have several subsidiaries that are investment advisors registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Our Prudential Agents and other employees, insofar as they sell products that are securities, are subject
to the Exchange Act and to examination requirements and regulation by the SEC, FINRA and state securities commissioners. Regulation and examination requirements also extend to various Prudential entities that employ or control those individuals. The
federal securities laws could also require reapproval by customers of our investment advisory contracts to manage mutual funds, including mutual funds included in annuity products, upon a change in control.

Federal and state regulators are devoting substantial attention to the mutual
fund and variable annuity businesses. As a result of publicity relating to widespread perceptions of industry abuses, numerous legislative and regulatory reforms have been proposed or adopted with respect to mutual fund governance, disclosure
requirements concerning mutual fund share classes, commission breakpoints, revenue sharing, advisory fees, market timing, late trading, portfolio pricing, annuity products, hedge funds, disclosures to retirement plan participants and other issues.
It is difficult to predict at this time whether changes resulting from new laws and regulations will affect our investment product offerings or asset management operations and, if so, to what degree.

Congress from time to time considers pension reform legislation that could
decrease or increase the attractiveness of certain of our retirement products and services to retirement plan sponsors and administrators, or have an unfavorable or favorable effect on our ability to earn revenues from these products and services.
In this regard, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (“PPA”) makes significant changes in employer pension funding obligations associated with defined benefit pension plans which are likely to increase sponsors’ costs of maintaining
these plans. These changes could hinder our sales of defined benefit pension products and services and cause sponsors to discontinue existing plans for which we provide asset management, administrative, or other services, but could increase the
attractiveness of certain products we offer in connection with terminating pension plans. Among other changes introduced by PPA were facilitation of automatic enrollment and escalation provisions for defined contribution plans. To the extent that
these provisions result in adoption of defined contribution plan changes by plan sponsors, they may enhance growth of participant account values.

The PPA also includes qualified default investment alternatives regulation, whereby plan sponsors select approved default investment options for defined
contribution plan participants who are automatically enrolled but



do not make affirmative investment elections. While our full service stable value products are not among the qualified default investment options, we offer a
wide variety of retirement products that are approved under this regulation. These rules do not require previously invested funds to be transferred. In addition, participants may continue to affirmatively select our stable value products.

For a discussion of potential federal tax legislation and
other federal regulation affecting our variable annuity products, see “—Insurance Operations—Federal Regulation” above.

Securities Operations

A number of our subsidiaries and Wachovia Securities, in which we had a 38% ownership interest as of December 31, 2007, are registered as
broker-dealers with the SEC and with some or all of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. In addition, a number of our subsidiaries are also registered as investment advisors with the SEC. Our broker-dealer affiliates are members of, and are
subject to regulation by, “self-regulatory organizations,” including FINRA. Many of these self-regulatory organizations conduct examinations of, and have adopted rules governing, their member broker-dealers. In addition, state securities
and certain other regulators have regulatory and oversight authority over our registered broker-dealers.

Broker-dealers and their sales forces in the U.S. and in certain other jurisdictions are subject to regulations that cover many aspects of the securities
business, including sales methods and trading practices. The regulations cover the suitability of investments for individual customers, use and safekeeping of customers’ funds and securities, capital adequacy, recordkeeping, financial reporting
and the conduct of directors, officers and employees.

The
commodity futures and commodity options industry in the U.S. is subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended. The CFTC is the federal agency charged with the administration of the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations
adopted under that Act. A number of our subsidiaries are registered with the CFTC as futures commission merchants, commodity pool operators or commodity trading advisors. Our futures business is also regulated in the U.S. by the National Futures
Association and in the United Kingdom by the FSA.

The SEC and
other governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S., have the power to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or
suspension, termination or limitation of the activities of a broker-dealer or an investment advisor or its employees.

As registered broker-dealers and members of various self-regulatory organizations, our U.S. registered broker-dealer subsidiaries and Wachovia Securities
are subject to the SEC’s Uniform Net Capital Rule. The Uniform Net Capital Rule sets the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that at least a minimum part of a broker-dealer’s assets be kept in
relatively liquid form. These net capital requirements are designed to measure the financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. Our broker-dealers are also subject to the net capital requirements of the CFTC and the various securities and
commodities exchanges of which they are members. Compliance with the net capital requirements could limit those operations that require the intensive use of capital, such as underwriting and trading activities, and may limit the ability of these
subsidiaries to pay dividends to Prudential Financial.

Other Businesses

Our U.S. banking operations are subject to federal and
state regulation. As a result of its ownership of Prudential Bank & Trust, FSB, Prudential Financial and Prudential IBH Holdco, Inc. are considered to be savings and loan holding companies and are subject to annual examination by the Office
of Thrift Supervision of the U.S. Department of Treasury. Federal and state banking laws generally provide that no person may acquire control of Prudential Financial, and gain indirect control of either Prudential Bank & Trust, FSB or
Prudential Trust Company, which is discussed below, without prior regulatory approval. Generally, beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the voting securities of Prudential Financial would be presumed to constitute control. We provide trust



services through Prudential Trust Company, a state-chartered trust company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and offer both
trust directed services and investment products through Prudential Bank & Trust, FSB.

The sale of real estate franchises by our real estate brokerage franchise operation is regulated by various state laws and the Federal Trade Commission. The federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and state real
estate brokerage and unfair trade practice laws regulate payments among participants in the sale or financing of residences or the provision of settlement services such as mortgages, homeowner’s insurance and title insurance.

Privacy Regulation

Federal and state law and regulation require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of personal
information, including health-related and customer information, and to notify customers and other individuals about their policies and practices relating to their collection and disclosure of health-related and customer information and their
practices relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. State laws regulate use and disclosure of social security numbers and require notice to affected individuals, law enforcement, regulators and others if there is a
breach of the security of certain personal information, including social security numbers. Federal and state laws and regulations regulate the ability of financial institutions to make telemarketing calls and to send unsolicited e-mail or fax
messages to consumers and customers. Federal law and regulation regulate the permissible uses of certain personal information, including consumer report information. Federal and state governments and regulatory bodies may be expected to consider
additional or more detailed regulation regarding these subjects and the privacy and security of personal information.

Environmental Considerations

Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations apply to our ownership and operation of real property. Inherent in owning and operating real
property are the risk of hidden environmental liabilities and the costs of any required clean-up. Under the laws of certain states, contamination of a property may give rise to a lien on the property to secure recovery of the costs of clean-up,
which could adversely affect our commercial mortgage lending business. In several states, this lien has priority over the lien of an existing mortgage against such property. In addition, in some states and under the federal Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, we may be liable, as an “owner” or “operator,” for costs of cleaning-up releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at a property mortgaged
to us. We also risk environmental liability when we foreclose on a property mortgaged to us. Federal legislation provides for a safe harbor from CERCLA liability for secured lenders that foreclose and sell the mortgaged real estate, provided that
certain requirements are met. However, there are circumstances in which actions taken could still expose us to CERCLA liability. Application of various other federal and state environmental laws could also result in the imposition of liability on us
for costs associated with environmental hazards.

We routinely
conduct environmental assessments for real estate we acquire for investment and before taking title through foreclosure to real property collateralizing mortgages that we hold. Although unexpected environmental liabilities can always arise, based on
these environmental assessments and compliance with our internal procedures, we believe that any costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations or any clean-up of properties would not have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations.

Regulation of our International Businesses

Our international businesses are subject to comprehensive
regulation and supervision. As in the U.S., the purpose of these regulations is primarily to protect our customers and not necessarily our shareholders. Many of the laws and regulations to which our international businesses are subject are regularly
re-examined, in some instances resulting in comprehensive restatements of applicable laws, regulations and reorganization of supervising authorities. Existing or future laws or regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect
our operations. It is also becoming increasingly common for regulatory developments originating in the U.S., such as those discussed above, to be studied and adopted in some form in other jurisdictions in which we do business. For example, the
insurance regulatory authorities in Korea have introduced



new Sarbanes-Oxley type financial control requirements to become effective in 2008. Changes such as these can increase compliance costs and potential
regulatory exposure. In some instances, such jurisdictions may also impose different, conflicting or more rigorous laws and requirements, including regulations governing privacy, consumer protection, employee protection, corporate governance and
capital adequacy.

In addition, our international operations
face political, legal, operational and other risks that we do not face in the U.S., including the risk of discriminatory regulation, labor issues in connection with workers’ associations and trade unions, nationalization or expropriation of
assets, dividend limitations, price controls and currency exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which they operate or converting local currencies we hold into
U.S. dollars or other currencies.

Our international insurance
operations are principally supervised by regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate, including the Japanese Ministry of Finance and Financial Services Agency. We operate insurance companies in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Mexico,
Argentina, Brazil, Italy and Poland and anticipate that we will begin insurance operations in India in 2008. The insurance regulatory bodies for these businesses typically oversee such issues as company licensing, the licensing of insurance sales
staff, insurance product approvals, sales practices, claims payment practices, permissible investments, solvency and capital adequacy, and insurance reserves, among other items. In some jurisdictions for certain products regulators will also mandate
premium rates (or components of pricing) or minimum guaranteed interest rates. Periodic examinations of insurance company books and records, financial reporting requirements, market conduct examinations and policy filing requirements are among the
techniques used by these regulators to supervise our non-U.S. insurance businesses. Certain of our international insurance operations, including those in Japan, may be subject to assessments, generally based on their proportionate share of business
written in the relevant jurisdiction, for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. As we cannot predict the timing of future assessments, they may materially affect the results of operations of our
international insurance operations in particular quarterly or annual periods. In addition, in some jurisdictions, some of our insurance products are considered “securities” under local law. In those instances, we may also be subject to
local securities regulations and oversight by local securities regulators.

The insurance regulatory bodies in some of the countries where our international insurance businesses are located regulate the amount of dividends that they can pay to shareholders. The Prudential Life Insurance
Company, Ltd., or Prudential of Japan, began paying dividends in 2006. Pursuant to Gibraltar Life’s reorganization, in addition to regulatory restrictions, there are certain restrictions on Gibraltar Life’s ability to pay dividends and we
anticipate that it will be several years before these restrictions will allow Gibraltar Life to pay dividends. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital
Resources” for additional information.

Our international
investment operations are also supervised primarily by regulatory authorities in the countries in which they operate, including the Korean Ministry of Finance and Economy and the Financial Supervisory Commission, and the United Kingdom’s
Financial Services Authority. We operate investment related businesses in, among other jurisdictions, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Germany and Singapore, and participate in investment related joint ventures in Italy,
Mexico and China. These businesses may provide investment-related products such as investment management products and services, mutual funds, brokerage, separately managed accounts, as well as commodities and derivatives products. The regulatory
authorities for these businesses typically oversee such issues as company licensing, the licensing of investment product sales staff, sales practices, solvency and capital adequacy, mutual fund product approvals and related disclosures, securities,
commodities and related laws, among other items.

In some
cases, our international investment businesses are also subject to U.S. securities laws and regulations. One is regulated as a broker-dealer in the U.S. under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and another is a registered investment
adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Our international insurance and investment businesses may also be subject to other U.S. laws governing businesses controlled by U.S. companies such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
and certain regulations issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Asset Controls. In addition, under current U.S. law and regulations we may be prohibited from dealing with certain individuals or entities in certain circumstances and we may be required
to monitor customer activities, which may affect our ability to attract and retain customers.



In addition to the foregoing, non-U.S. regulatory and legislative bodies may enact or adopt laws and
regulations that can affect Prudential Financial as the ultimate holding company of our international businesses. For example, the European Union has adopted a directive, to be enacted by its member states, that subjects financial groups operating
within the European Union, including their operations outside the European Union, to broad capital adequacy and other regulatory requirements. The application of this directive to Prudential Financial, in particular whether it will result in new
solvency oversight, appears to be unlikely given the Company’s business mix. Similar regulatory actions may be taken in other jurisdictions with potentially significant implications, and the European Union directive discussed above may be
applicable to Prudential Financial at a later time because of changes in our business or how the directive is interpreted.

Our international businesses are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the countries in which they are organized and in which they operate. Foreign
governments from time to time consider legislation that could impact the amount of taxes that we pay or impact the sales of our products. For example, during 2007, Mexico enacted an alternative flat tax that becomes effective in 2008, while China,
Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom reduced corporate tax rates that will apply in 2008. In March 2007, the Japanese National Tax Authority (“NTA”) indicated that it would change the tax treatment of certain term life products sold to
corporations, which resulted in a significant decrease in the sale of Increasing Term Life insurance to corporations in Japan. On December 26, 2007, the NTA confirmed in an official announcement its intention to revise the corporate tax
deductibility of insurance premiums paid with respect to certain Increasing Term insurance products.

Employees

As of December 31, 2007, we had 40,703 employees, including 20,657 located outside of the U.S. We believe our relations with our employees are satisfactory.

The collective bargaining agreement between Prudential Insurance and the Office of Professional Employees International Union, Local 153
(AFL-CIO), expired on October 31, 2007. At the time of its expiration the agreement covered approximately 11 Prudential Agents. By letter dated November 13, 2007, the Office of Professional Employees International Union, Local 153
(AFL-CIO) disclaimed interest in representing these Prudential Agents.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the following risks. These risks could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition,
cause the trading price of our Common Stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. These risks are not
exclusive, and additional risks to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, the factors mentioned under “Forward-Looking Statements” above and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Market fluctuations and general economic, market and political conditions may adversely affect our business and
profitability.

Our insurance products and certain of our
investment products, as well as our investment returns and our access to and cost of financing, are sensitive to fixed income, equity, real estate and other market fluctuations and general economic, market and political conditions and these
fluctuations and changes could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity, including in the following respects:

•

The profitability of many of our insurance products depends in part on the value of the separate accounts supporting these products, which may fluctuate
substantially depending on the foregoing conditions.

•

Market conditions resulting in reductions in the value of assets we manage would have an adverse effect on the revenues and profitability of our asset management
services, which depend on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management, and would decrease the value of our proprietary investments.

•

A change in market conditions, including prolonged periods of high inflation, could cause a change in consumer sentiment adversely affecting sales and persistency
of our long-term savings and protection products. Similarly, changing economic conditions can influence customer behavior including but not limited to increasing claims in certain product lines.

•

Sales of our investment-based and asset management products and services may decline and lapses of variable life and annuity products and withdrawals of assets from
other investment products may increase if a market downturn, increased market volatility or other market conditions result in customers becoming dissatisfied with their investments or products.

•

A market decline could result in guaranteed minimum benefits contained in many of our variable annuity products being higher than current account values or our
pricing assumptions would support, requiring us to materially increase reserves for such products.

•

Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase. Accordingly, we may be forced to incur
additional expenses for reinsurance or may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms which could adversely affect the profitability of future business or our willingness to write future business.

•

Certain of our businesses originate loans and acquire investments with the intent to resell or repackage such assets within a relatively short period of time. Exit
strategies for such assets can change due to market conditions or changes in investor preferences, resulting in lower profitability or realized losses.

•

Hedging instruments we hold to manage foreign exchange, product, and other risks might not perform as intended or expected resulting in higher realized losses and
unforeseen cash needs. Market conditions can also increase the cost of executing product related hedges and such costs may not be recovered in the pricing of the underlying products being hedged.

•

We have significant investment and derivative portfolios and adverse capital market conditions, including but not limited to volatility, credit spread changes, and
benchmark interest rate changes, will impact the liquidity and value of our investments and derivatives, potentially resulting in higher realized or unrealized losses. Values of our investments and derivatives can also be impacted by reductions in
price transparency and changes in investor confidence and preferences, potentially resulting in higher realized or unrealized losses. Regardless of market conditions, certain investments we hold, including private bonds and commercial mortgages, are
relatively illiquid. If we needed to sell these investments, we may have difficulty doing so in a timely manner at a price that we could otherwise realize.

•

Adverse capital market conditions could affect our ability to borrow funds, including issuing commercial paper, as well as impact our ability to refinance existing
borrowings, ultimately impacting profitability and also our ability to support or grow our businesses.

•

Market conditions could also impact our ability to fund foreseen and unforeseen cash and collateral requirements, potentially inhibiting our ability to perform
under our obligations, support business initiatives and increasing realized losses.



The latter half of 2007 was characterized by adverse market conditions generally affecting the value and
liquidity of asset-backed securities supported by sub-prime mortgages and commercial mortgage backed securities, as well as other investments we hold. These market conditions also impacted the cost of refinancing debt, including commercial paper
borrowings. These conditions have persisted into 2008 and it is uncertain how or when such conditions will change.

Interest rate fluctuations could adversely affect our businesses and profitability.

Our insurance products and certain of our investment products, and our investment returns, are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, and
changes in interest rates could adversely affect our investment returns and results of operations, including in the following respects:

•

Some of our products expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce the spread between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts
and the rate of return we are able to earn on our general account investments supporting the contracts. When interest rates decline, we have to reinvest the cash income from our investments in lower yielding instruments. Since many of our policies
and contracts have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates or limit the resetting of interest rates, the spreads could decrease and potentially become negative. When interest rates rise, we may not be able to replace the assets in our general
account with the higher yielding assets needed to fund the higher crediting rates necessary to keep these products and contracts competitive.

•

Changes in interest rates may reduce our spreads or result in potential losses in our investment activities in which we borrow funds and purchase investments to
earn additional spread income on the borrowed funds. A decline in market interest rates could also reduce our returns from investment of equity.

•

When interest rates rise, policy loans and surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts may increase as policyholders seek to buy
products with perceived higher returns, requiring us to sell investment assets potentially resulting in realized investment losses, or requiring us to accelerate the amortization of DAC or VOBA (both defined below).

•

A decline in interest rates accompanied by unexpected prepayments of certain investments could result in reduced investments and a decline in our profitability. An
increase in interest rates accompanied by unexpected extensions of certain lower yielding investments could result in a decline in our profitability.

•

Changes in the relationship between long-term and short-term interest rates could adversely affect the profitability of some of our products.

•

Changes in interest rates could increase our costs of financing.

If our reserves for future policyholder benefits and claims are inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserves, which would adversely affect
our results of operations and financial condition.

We
establish and carry reserves to pay future policyholder benefits and claims. Our reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but rather are actuarial or statistical estimates based on models that include many assumptions and
projections which are inherently uncertain and involve the exercise of significant judgment, including as to the levels of and/or timing of receipt or payment of premiums, benefits, claims, expenses, interest credits, investment results, retirement,
mortality, morbidity and persistency. We cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts that we will pay for, or the timing of payment of, actual benefits, claims and expenses or whether the assets supporting our policy liabilities, together
with future premiums, will be sufficient for payment of benefits and claims. If we conclude that our reserves, together with future premiums, are insufficient to cover future policy benefits and claims, we would be required to increase our reserves
and incur income statement charges for the period in which we make the determination, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Our profitability may decline if mortality rates, morbidity rates or persistency rates differ significantly from our pricing
expectations.

We set prices for many of our insurance and
annuity products based upon expected claims and payment patterns, using assumptions for mortality rates, or likelihood of death, and morbidity rates, or likelihood of



sickness, of our policyholders. In addition to the potential effect of natural or man-made disasters, significant changes in mortality or morbidity could
emerge gradually over time, due to changes in the natural environment, the health habits of the insured population, treatment patterns for disease or disability, or other factors. Pricing of our insurance and deferred annuity products are also based
in part upon expected persistency of these products, which is the probability that a policy or contract will remain in force from one period to the next. Results may also vary based on differences between actual and expected premium deposits and
withdrawals for these products. The development of a secondary market for life insurance, including life settlements or “viaticals” and investor owned life insurance, could adversely affect the profitability of existing business and our
pricing assumptions for new business. Significant deviations in actual experience from our pricing assumptions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our products. Although some of our products permit us to increase premiums or adjust
other charges and credits during the life of the policy or contract, the adjustments permitted under the terms of the policies or contracts may not be sufficient to maintain profitability. Many of our products do not permit us to increase premiums
or adjust other charges and credits or limit those adjustments during the life of the policy or contract.

We may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC, or valuation of business acquired, or VOBA, or recognize impairment in the value of our goodwill, which could
adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.

Deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC, represent the costs that vary with and are related primarily to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance and annuity contracts, and we amortize these costs over the expected lives of the
contracts. Valuation of business acquired, or VOBA, represents the present value of future profits embedded in acquired insurance, annuity and investment-type contracts and is amortized over the expected effective lives of the acquired contracts.
Goodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. Management, on an ongoing basis, tests the DAC and VOBA recorded on our balance
sheet to determine if these amounts are recoverable under current assumptions. In addition, we regularly review the estimates and assumptions underlying DAC and VOBA for those products for which we amortize DAC and VOBA in proportion to gross
profits or gross margins. Management tests goodwill for impairment at least annually based upon estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates. Given changes in facts and circumstances, these tests and reviews could
lead to reductions in goodwill, DAC and/or VOBA that could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations and our financial condition.

A downgrade or potential downgrade in our claims-paying or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being
surrendered, increase our borrowing costs and/or hurt our relationships with creditors or trading counterparties.

Claims-paying ratings, which are sometimes referred to as “financial strength” ratings, represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding the
financial ability of an insurance company to meet its obligations under an insurance policy, and are important factors affecting public confidence in an insurer and its competitive position in marketing products, including Prudential Insurance and
our other insurance company subsidiaries. Credit ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding an entity’s ability to repay its indebtedness, and Prudential Financial’s credit ratings are important to our ability to raise
capital through the issuance of debt and to the cost of such financing. A downgrade in our claims-paying or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, reduce our competitiveness, increase the number or value of policies being
surrendered, increase our borrowing costs, cause additional collateral requirements under certain agreements, and/or hurt our relationships with creditors or trading counterparties.

Losses due to defaults by others, including issuers of investment securities or reinsurance, bond insurers and derivative instrument
counterparties, or a downgrade in the ratings of bond insurers, could adversely affect the value of our investments or reduce our profitability.

Issuers and borrowers whose securities or loans we hold, customers, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts,
reinsurers, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries and guarantors, including bond insurers, may default on their obligations to us due to



bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud or other reasons. Such defaults could have an adverse
effect on our results of operations and financial condition. A downgrade in the ratings of bond insurers could also result in declines in the value of our fixed maturity investments supported by guarantees from bond insurers.

Intense competition could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our market
share or profitability.

In each of our businesses we face
intense competition from domestic and foreign insurance companies, asset managers and diversified financial institutions, both for the ultimate customers for our products and, in many businesses, for distribution through non-affiliated distribution
channels. We compete based on a number of factors including brand recognition, reputation, quality of service, quality of investment advice, investment performance of our products, product features, scope of distribution and distribution
arrangements, price, perceived financial strength and claims-paying and credit ratings. A decline in our competitive position as to one or more of these factors could adversely affect our profitability and assets under management. Many of our
competitors are large and well capitalized and some have greater market share or breadth of distribution, offer a broader range of products, services or features, assume a greater level of risk, have lower profitability expectations or have higher
claims-paying or credit ratings than we do. We could be subject to claims by competitors that our products infringe their patents, which could adversely affect our sales, profitability and financial position. The proliferation and growth of
non-affiliated distribution channels puts pressure on our captive sales channels to increase their productivity and reduce their costs in order to remain competitive, and we run the risk that the marketplace will make a more significant or rapid
shift to non-affiliated or direct distribution alternatives than we anticipate or are able to achieve ourselves, potentially adversely affecting our market share and results of operations. Competition for personnel in all of our businesses is
intense, including for Prudential Agents, Life Planners and Life Advisors, other face-to-face sales personnel, desirable non-affiliated distribution channels and our investment managers. The loss of personnel could have an adverse effect on our
business and profitability.

Changes in U.S. federal income tax law or in
the income tax laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate could make some of our products less attractive to consumers and increase our tax costs.

Current U.S. federal income tax laws generally permit certain holders to defer taxation on the build-up of value of annuities and life insurance products
until payments are actually made to the policyholder or other beneficiary and to exclude from taxation the death benefit paid under a life insurance contract. Congress from time to time considers legislation that could make our products less
attractive to consumers, including legislation that would reduce or eliminate the benefit of this deferral on some annuities and insurance products, as well as other types of changes that could reduce or eliminate the attractiveness of annuities and
life insurance products to consumers, such as repeal of the estate tax.

For example, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 generally provide for lower income tax, capital gains and dividend tax rates that might have the effect
of reducing the benefits of tax deferral on the build-up of value of annuities and life insurance products. The Bush Administration continues to propose that many of the rate reductions pursuant to these Acts be made permanent as well as to propose
several tax-favored savings initiatives. These proposals or other tax law changes might hinder our sales and result in the increased surrender of insurance and annuity products.

Congress, as well as state and local governments, also considers from time to time legislation that could increase the
amount of taxes that we pay. If such legislation is adopted our consolidated net income could decline.

For example, the U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service are addressing through new regulations the methodology to be followed in
determining the dividends received deduction related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts. The dividends received deduction reduces the amount of dividend income subject to tax and is a significant component of the difference between our
effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate of 35%. A change in the dividends received deduction, including the possible elimination of this deduction, could reduce our consolidated net income.



The products we sell have different tax characteristics, including taxable income and tax deductions.
Certain of our products are significantly dependent on these characteristics, which are taken into consideration when pricing products and are a component of our capital management strategies. Accordingly, a change in tax law, or other factors
impacting the availability of the tax characteristics generated by our products, could impact product pricing and returns.

We have substantial international operations and our international operations face political, legal, operational and other risks that could adversely affect those
operations or our profitability.

A substantial portion of
our revenues and income from continuing operations is derived from our operations in foreign countries, primarily Japan and Korea. These operations are subject to restrictions on transferring funds out of the countries in which these operations are
located. Some of our foreign insurance and investment management operations are, and are likely to continue to be, in emerging markets where this risk as well as risks of discriminatory regulation, labor issues in connection with workers’
associations and trade unions, price controls, currency exchange controls, nationalization or expropriation of assets, are heightened. If our business model is not successful in a particular country, we may lose all or most of our investment in
building and training our sales force in that country.

Many of
our insurance products sold in international markets provide for the buildup of cash values for the policyholder at contractually fixed guaranteed interest rates, including in Japan. Actual returns on the underlying investments do not necessarily
match the guaranteed interest rates and there may be times when the spread between the actual investment returns and these guaranteed rates of return to the policyholder is negative and in which this negative spread may not be offset by the
mortality, morbidity and expense charges we earn on the products.

Our international businesses are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the countries in which they are organized and in which they operate. Foreign governments from time to time consider legislation that could increase the amount of
taxes that we pay or impact the sales of our products. For example, in March 2007 the Japanese National Tax Authority (“NTA”) indicated that it would change the tax treatment of certain term life products sold to corporations, which
resulted in a significant decrease in the sale of Increasing Term Life insurance to corporations in Japan. On December 26, 2007 the NTA confirmed in an official announcement that it intends to revise the corporate tax deductibility of insurance
premium paid with respect to certain Increasing Term insurance products.

Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our profitability.

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks in our general account investment portfolios, other proprietary investment portfolios and through our
operations in foreign countries. Currency fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. For a discussion of our currency exposures and related hedging activities, see “Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk.”

Our businesses are heavily regulated
and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability.

Our businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision. The purpose of this regulation is primarily to protect our customers and not necessarily our shareholders. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject,
including those to which our international businesses are subject, are regularly re-examined, and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations.

Prudential Financial is subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC and
the NYSE relating to public reporting and disclosure, securities trading, accounting and financial reporting, and corporate governance matters. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules and regulations adopted in furtherance of that Act have
substantially increased the requirements in these and other areas for public companies such as Prudential Financial.



Many insurance regulatory and other governmental or self-regulatory bodies have the authority to review
our products and business practices and those of our agents and employees and to bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our agents or employees, are improper. These actions can result in
substantial fines, penalties or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations or financial condition. For a discussion of material pending litigation and regulatory
matters, see “Legal Proceedings.”

Congress from time
to time considers pension reform legislation that could decrease the attractiveness of certain of our retirement products and services to retirement plan sponsors and administrators, or have an unfavorable effect on our ability to earn revenues from
these products and services. In this regard, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (“PPA”) makes significant changes in employer pension funding obligations associated with defined benefit pension plans which are likely to increase
sponsors’ costs of maintaining these plans. These changes could hinder our sales of defined benefit pension products and services and cause sponsors to discontinue existing plans for which we provide asset management, administrative, or other
services, but could increase the attractiveness of certain group annuity products we offer in connection with terminating pension plans. The Bush Administration also has proposed several tax-favored savings initiatives. These initiatives could
hinder sales and persistency of our products and services that support employment based retirement plans.

The NAIC has adopted a Model Regulation entitled “Valuation of Life Insurance Policies,” commonly known as “Regulation XXX,” and a
supporting Guideline entitled “The Application of the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies,” commonly known as “Guideline AXXX.” The Regulation and supporting Guideline require insurers to establish statutory reserves for term
and universal life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees that are consistent with the statutory reserves required for other individual life insurance policies with similar guarantees. Many market participants believe that this level
of reserves is excessive, and we have implemented reinsurance and capital management actions to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX on our term and universal life insurance business. However, we may not be able to implement
actions to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX or Guideline AXXX on future sales of term or universal life insurance products, thereby potentially resulting in an adverse impact on returns on capital associated with these products, and possibly
requiring us to reduce our sales of these products or implement measures that may be disruptive to our business.

For certain of our products, market performance impacts the level of statutory reserves we are required to hold, which impacts capital requirements and
may have an adverse effect on returns on capital associated with these products.

Insurance regulators, as well as industry participants, have also begun to consider potentially significant changes in the way in which statutory reserves and statutory capital are determined, particularly for
products with embedded options and guarantees. New regulatory capital requirements have already gone into effect for variable annuity products. The timing of, and extent of, such changes to the statutory reporting framework are uncertain; however,
the result could be increases to statutory reserves and capital, and an adverse effect on our products, sales and operating costs.

See “Business—Regulation” for further discussion of the impact of regulations on our businesses.

Legal and regulatory actions are inherent in our businesses and could adversely affect our
results of operations or financial position or harm our businesses or reputation.

We are, and in the future may be, subject to legal and regulatory actions in the ordinary course of our businesses, including in businesses that we have divested or placed in wind-down status. Some of these
proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants. In certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. Substantial legal liability in
these or future legal or regulatory actions could have an adverse affect on us or cause us reputational harm, which in turn could harm our business prospects.

Material pending litigation and regulatory matters affecting us, and certain risks to our businesses presented by such matters, are discussed under
“Legal Proceedings.” Our litigation and regulatory matters are subject to



many uncertainties, and given their complexity and scope, their outcome cannot be predicted. Our reserves for litigation and regulatory matters may prove to
be inadequate. It is possible that our results of operations or cash flow in a particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of pending litigation and regulatory matters depending, in part,
upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period. In light of the unpredictability of the Company’s litigation and regulatory matters, it is also possible that in certain cases an ultimate unfavorable resolution of one or more
pending litigation or regulatory matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position.

The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

The occurrence of natural disasters, including hurricanes, floods,
earthquakes, tornadoes, fires, explosions, pandemic disease and man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism and military actions, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition, including in the following respects:

•

Catastrophic loss of life due to natural or man-made disasters could cause us to pay benefits at higher levels and/or materially earlier than anticipated and could
lead to unexpected changes in persistency rates.

•

A natural or man-made disaster could result in losses in our investment portfolio or the failure of our counterparties to perform, or cause significant volatility
in global financial markets.

•

A terrorist attack affecting financial institutions in the United States or elsewhere could negatively impact the financial services industry in general and our
business operations, investment portfolio and profitability in particular. As previously reported, in August 2004, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security identified our Newark, New Jersey facilities, along with those of several other financial
institutions in New York and Washington, D.C., as possible targets of a terrorist attack.

•

Pandemic disease, caused by a virus such as H5N1 (the “Avian flu” virus), could have a severe adverse effect on Prudential Financial’s business. The
potential impact of such a pandemic on Prudential Financial’s results of operations and financial position is highly speculative, and would depend on numerous factors, including: the probability of the virus mutating to a form that can be
passed from human to human; the rate of contagion if and when that occurs; the regions of the world most affected; the effectiveness of treatment for the infected population; the rates of mortality and morbidity among various segments of the insured
versus the uninsured population; the collectibility of reinsurance; the possible macroeconomic effects of a pandemic on the Company’s asset portfolio; the effect on lapses and surrenders of existing policies, as well as sales of new policies;
and many other variables.

There can be no
assurance that our business continuation plans and insurance coverages would be effective in mitigating any negative effects on our operations or profitability in the event of a terrorist attack or other disaster.

Our risk management policies and procedures and minority investments in joint ventures may
leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could adversely affect our businesses or result in losses.

Our policies and procedures to monitor and manage risks, including hedging programs that utilize derivative financial instruments, may not be fully
effective and may leave us exposed to unidentified and unanticipated risks. The Company uses models in its hedging programs and many other aspects of its operations, including but not limited to the estimation of actuarial reserves, the amortization
of deferred acquisition costs and the value of business acquired, and the valuation of certain other assets and liabilities. These models rely on assumptions and projections that are inherently uncertain. Management of operational, legal and
regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Past or future misconduct by our employees
or employees of our vendors could result in violations of law by us, regulatory sanctions and/or serious reputational or financial harm and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. A failure of
our computer systems or a compromise of their security could also subject us to regulatory sanctions or other claims, harm our reputation, interrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In
our investments in which we hold a minority interest, including Wachovia Securities Financial Holdings, LLC, we lack management and operational control over its operations, which may prevent us from taking or causing to be taken actions to protect
or increase the value of those investments.



We face risks arising from acquisitions, divestitures and restructurings, including client losses, surrenders and
withdrawals, difficulties in integrating and realizing the projected results of acquisitions and contingent liabilities with respect to dispositions.

We face a number of risks arising from acquisition transactions, including the risk that, following the acquisition or reorganization of a business, we
could experience client losses, surrenders or withdrawals materially different from those we anticipate, as well as difficulties in integrating and realizing the projected results of acquisitions and restructurings and managing the litigation and
regulatory matters to which acquired entities are party. We have retained insurance or reinsurance obligations and other contingent liabilities in connection with our divestiture or winding down of various businesses, including with respect to the
retail securities brokerage and securities clearing operations that we contributed to the joint venture with Wachovia Corporation, and our reserves for these obligations and liabilities may prove to be inadequate. These risks may adversely affect
our results of operations or financial condition.

Changes in our discount
rate, expected rate of return and expected compensation increase assumptions for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans may result in increased expenses and reduce our profitability.

We determine our pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs based
on assumed discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and expected increases in compensation levels and trends in health care costs. Changes in these assumptions may result in increased expenses and reduce our profitability.

Our ability to pay shareholder dividends, to continue share repurchases and to meet
obligations may be adversely affected by limitations imposed on inter-affiliate distributions and transfers by Prudential Insurance and our other subsidiaries.

Prudential Financial is the holding company for all our operations, and dividends, returns of capital and interest income
from its subsidiaries are the principal source of funds available to Prudential Financial to pay shareholder dividends, to make share repurchases and to meet its other obligations. These sources of funds are complemented by Prudential
Financial’s access to the capital markets and bank facilities. As described under “Business—Regulation” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and
Capital Resources,” our domestic and foreign insurance and various other subsidiary companies, including Prudential Insurance, are subject to regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends and on other transfers of funds to Prudential
Financial. In addition to these regulatory limitations, the terms of the IHC debt contain restrictions potentially limiting dividends by Prudential Insurance applicable to the Financial Services Businesses in the event the Closed Block Business is
in financial distress and under other circumstances. These restrictions on Prudential Financial’s subsidiaries may limit such subsidiaries from making dividend payments to Prudential Financial in an amount sufficient to fund Prudential
Financial’s cash requirements and shareholder dividends. From time to time, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, and various state and foreign insurance regulators have considered, and may in the future consider,
proposals to further limit dividend payments that an insurance company may make without regulatory approval.

Regulatory requirements, provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and our shareholder rights plan could delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider in their best
interests.

Various states in which our insurance
companies are domiciled, including New Jersey, must approve any direct or indirect change of control of insurance companies organized in those states. Under most states’ statutes, an entity is presumed to have control of an insurance company if
it owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting stock of that insurance company or its parent company. Federal, and in some cases, state, banking authorities would also have to approve the indirect change of control of our banking
operations. The federal securities laws could also require reapproval by customers of our investment advisory contracts to manage mutual funds, including mutual funds included in annuity products, upon a change in control. In addition, the New
Jersey Business Corporation Act prohibits certain business combinations with interested shareholders.



These regulatory and other restrictions may delay a potential merger or sale of Prudential Financial, even if the Board of Directors decides that it is in
the best interests of shareholders to merge or be sold.

Prudential Financial’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws also contain provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider in their best interests. These provisions may adversely affect
prevailing market prices for our Common Stock and include: a restriction on the filling of vacancies on the Board of Directors by shareholders; restrictions on the calling of special meetings by shareholders; a requirement that shareholders may take
action without a meeting only by unanimous written consent; advance notice procedures for the nomination of candidates to the Board of Directors and shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholder meetings; and supermajority voting
requirements for the amendment of certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws. Prudential Financial's shareholders rights plan also creates obstacles that may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might
consider in their best interests.

Holders of our Common Stock are subject
to risks due to the issuance of our Class B Stock, a second class of common stock.

The businesses of Prudential Financial are separated into the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, and our Common Stock reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the
Class B Stock reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business. There are a number of risks to holders of our Common Stock by virtue of this dual common stock structure, including:

•

Even though we allocate all our consolidated assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flow between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block
Business for financial statement purposes, there is no legal separation between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. Holders of Common Stock have no interest in a separate legal entity representing the Financial Services
Businesses; holders of the Class B Stock have no interest in a separate legal entity representing the Closed Block Business; and therefore holders of each class of common stock are subject to all of the risks associated with an investment in the
Company.

•

The financial results of the Closed Block Business, including debt service on the IHC debt, will affect Prudential Financial’s consolidated results of
operations, financial position and borrowing costs.

•

The market value of our Common Stock may not reflect solely the performance of the Financial Services Businesses.

•

We cannot pay cash dividends on our Common Stock for any period if we choose not to pay dividends on the Class B Stock in an aggregate amount at least equal to the
lesser of the CB Distributable Cash Flow or the Target Dividend Amount on the Class B Stock for that period. See “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity
Securities—Convertibility” for the definition of these terms. Any net losses of the Closed Block Business, and any dividends or distributions on, or repurchases of the Class B Stock, would reduce the assets of Prudential Financial legally
available for dividends on the Common Stock.

•

Net income for the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business includes general and administrative expenses charged to each of the respective
Businesses based on the Company’s methodology for the allocation of such expenses. Cash flows to the Financial Services Businesses from the Closed Block Business related to administrative expenses are determined by a policy servicing fee
arrangement that is based upon insurance and policies in force and statutory cash premiums. The difference between the administrative expenses allocated to the Closed Block Business and these cash flow amounts are recorded, on an after tax basis, as
direct equity adjustments to the equity balances of the businesses and included in the determination of earnings per share for each Business. A change in cash flow amounts between the Businesses that is inconsistent with changes in general and
administrative expenses we incur will affect the earnings per share of the Common Stock and Class B Stock.

•

Holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock vote together as a single class of common stock under New Jersey law, except as otherwise required by law and except that
the holders of the Class B Stock have class voting or consent rights with respect to specified matters directly affecting the Class B Stock.



•

Shares of Class B Stock are entitled to a higher proportionate amount upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Prudential Financial, than shares of Common
Stock.

•

We may exchange the Class B Stock for shares of Common Stock at any time, and the Class B Stock is mandatorily exchangeable in the event of a sale of all or
substantially all of the Closed Block Business or a “change of control” of Prudential Financial. Under these circumstances, shares of Class B Stock would be exchanged for shares of Common Stock with an aggregate average market value equal
to 120% of the then appraised “Fair Market Value” of the Class B Stock. For a description of “change of control” and “Fair Market Value”, see “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters
and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—Convertibility.” Holders of Class B Stock may at their discretion, beginning in 2016, and at any time in the event of specified regulatory events, convert their shares of Class B Stock into shares
of Common Stock with an aggregate average market value equal to 100% of the then appraised Fair Market Value of the Class B Stock. Any exchange or conversion could occur at a time when either or both of the Common Stock and Class B Stock may be
considered overvalued or undervalued. Accordingly, any such exchange or conversion may be disadvantageous to holders of Common Stock.

•

Our Board of Directors has adopted certain policies regarding inter-business transfers and accounting and tax matters, including the allocation of earnings, with
respect to the Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business. Although the Board of Directors may change any of these policies, any such decision is subject to the Board of Directors’ general fiduciary duties, and we have agreed with
investors in the Class B Stock and the insurer of the IHC debt that, in most cases, the Board of Directors may not change these policies without their consent.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

We own our headquarters building located at 751 Broad Street, Newark, New Jersey, which comprises approximately 0.6 million square feet. Excluding our headquarters building and properties used by the
International Insurance and Investments division, which are discussed below, we own eight and lease 14 other principal properties throughout the U.S., some of which are used for home office functions. Our domestic operations also lease approximately
230 other locations throughout the U.S.

For our International
Insurance segment, we own three home offices located in Korea, Taiwan, and Brazil and lease eight home offices located in Argentina, China, Italy, Japan, Mexico, India and Poland. We also own approximately 170 and lease approximately 400 other
properties, primarily field offices, located throughout these same countries. For our International Investments segment, we own two branch offices and lease approximately 100 other branch offices throughout Korea, Mexico, Taiwan, Japan and Hong
Kong, as well as certain countries in Europe.

We believe our
properties are adequate and suitable for our business as currently conducted and are adequately maintained. The above properties do not include properties we own for investment only.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS

We are subject to legal and regulatory actions in the ordinary course of our businesses, including class action lawsuits. Our pending legal and regulatory
actions include proceedings specific to us and proceedings generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which we operate, including in both cases businesses that have either been divested or placed in wind-down status. In our
insurance operations, we are subject to class action lawsuits and individual lawsuits involving a variety of issues, including sales practices, underwriting practices, claims payment and procedures, additional premium charges for premiums paid on a
periodic basis, denial or delay of benefits, return of premiums or excessive premium charges and breaching fiduciary duties to customers. In our investment-related operations, we are subject to litigation involving commercial disputes with
counterparties or partners and class action lawsuits and other litigation alleging, among other things, that we made improper or inadequate disclosures in connection with the sale of assets and annuity and investment products or charged excessive or
impermissible fees on these products, recommended unsuitable products to customers, mishandled customer accounts or breached fiduciary duties to customers. In our securities operations, we are subject to class action lawsuits, arbitrations and other
actions arising out of our former retail securities brokerage, account management, underwriting, former investment banking and other activities, including claims of improper or inadequate disclosure regarding investments or charges, recommending
investments or products that were unsuitable for tax advantaged accounts, assessing impermissible fees or



charges, engaging in excessive or unauthorized trading, making improper underwriting allocations, breaching alleged duties to non-customer third parties and
breaching fiduciary duties to customers. We may be a defendant in, or be contractually responsible to third parties for, class action lawsuits and individual litigation arising from our other operations, including claims for breach of contract. We
are also subject to litigation arising out of our general business activities, such as our investments, contracts, leases and labor and employment relationships, including claims of discrimination and harassment and could be exposed to claims or
litigation concerning certain business or process patents. Regulatory authorities from time to time make inquiries and conduct investigations and examinations relating particularly to us and our businesses and products. In addition, we, along with
other participants in the businesses in which we engage, may be subject from time to time to investigations, examinations and inquiries, in some cases industry-wide, concerning issues or matters upon which such regulators have determined to focus.
In some of our pending legal and regulatory actions, parties are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. The outcome of a litigation or regulatory matter, and the amount or range of potential loss at any
particular time, is often inherently uncertain. The following is a summary of certain pending proceedings.

Insurance and Annuities

From November 2002 to March 2005, eleven separate complaints were filed against the Company and the law firm of Leeds Morelli & Brown in New Jersey state court. The cases were consolidated for pre-trial
proceedings in New Jersey Superior Court, Essex County and captioned

Lederman v. Prudential Financial, Inc., et al

. The complaints allege that an alternative dispute resolution agreement entered into among Prudential Insurance, over 350
claimants who are current and former Prudential Insurance employees, and Leeds Morelli & Brown (the law firm representing the claimants) was illegal and that Prudential Insurance conspired with Leeds Morelli & Brown to commit
fraud, malpractice, breach of contract, and violate racketeering laws by advancing legal fees to the law firm with the purpose of limiting Prudential’s liability to the claimants. In 2004, the Superior Court sealed these lawsuits and compelled
them to arbitration. In May 2006, the Appellate Division reversed the trial court’s decisions, held that the cases were improperly sealed, and should be heard in court rather than arbitrated. In March 2007, the court granted plaintiffs’
motion to amend the complaint to add over 200 additional plaintiffs and a claim under the New Jersey discrimination law but denied without prejudice plaintiffs’ motion for a joint trial on liability issues. In June 2007, Prudential Financial
and Prudential Insurance moved to dismiss the complaint. In November 2007, the court granted the motion, in part, and dismissed the commercial bribery and conspiracy to commit malpractice claims, and denied the motion with respect to other claims.
In January 2008, plaintiffs filed a demand pursuant to New Jersey law stating that they were seeking damages in the amount of $6.5 billion.

The Company, along with a number of other insurance companies, received formal requests for information from the State of New York Attorney General’s
Office (“NYAG”), the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Connecticut Attorney General’s Office, the Massachusetts Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Labor, the United States Attorney for the
Southern District of California, the District Attorney of the County of San Diego, and various state insurance departments relating to payments to insurance intermediaries and certain other practices that may be viewed as anti-competitive. The
Company may receive additional requests from these and other regulators and governmental authorities concerning these and related subjects. The Company is cooperating with these inquiries and has had discussions with certain authorities in an effort
to resolve the inquiries into this matter. In December 2006, Prudential Insurance reached a resolution of the NYAG investigation. Under the terms of the settlement, Prudential Insurance paid a $2.5 million penalty and established a $16.5 million
fund for policyholders, adopted business reforms and agreed, among other things, to continue to cooperate with the NYAG in any litigation, ongoing investigations or other proceedings. Prudential Insurance also settled the litigation brought by the
California Department of Insurance and agreed to business reforms and disclosures as to group insurance contracts insuring customers or residents in California and to pay certain costs of investigation. These matters are also the subject of
litigation brought by private plaintiffs, including purported class actions that have been consolidated in the multidistrict litigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey,

In re Employee Benefit Insurance Brokerage
Antitrust Litigation.

In August and September 2007, the court dismissed the anti-trust and RICO claims. In January 2008, the court dismissed the ERISA claims with prejudice but has not yet resolved the state law claims. The regulatory settlement
may adversely affect the existing litigation or cause additional litigation and result in adverse publicity and other potentially adverse impacts to the Company’s business.



In April 2005, the Company voluntarily commenced a review of the accounting for its reinsurance
arrangements to confirm that it complied with applicable accounting rules. This review included an inventory and examination of current and past arrangements, including those relating to the Company’s wind down and divested businesses and
discontinued operations. Subsequent to commencing this voluntary review, the Company received a formal request from the Connecticut Attorney General for information regarding its participation in reinsurance transactions generally and a formal
request from the SEC for information regarding certain reinsurance contracts entered into with a single counterparty since 1997 as well as specific contracts entered into with that counterparty in the years 1997 through 2002 relating to the
Company’s property and casualty insurance operations that were sold in 2003. These investigations are ongoing and not yet complete and it is possible that the Company may receive additional requests from regulators relating to reinsurance
arrangements. The Company intends to cooperate with all such requests.

The Company’s subsidiary, American Skandia Life Assurance Corporation, has commenced a remediation program to correct errors in the administration of approximately 11,000 annuity contracts issued by that company. The owners of these
contracts did not receive notification that the contracts were approaching or past their designated annuitization date or default annuitization date (both dates referred to as the “contractual annuity date”) and the contracts were not
annuitized at their contractual annuity dates. Some of these contracts also were affected by data integrity errors resulting in incorrect contractual annuity dates. The lack of notice and data integrity errors, as reflected on the annuities
administrative system, all occurred before the acquisition of the American Skandia entities by the Company. The remediation and administrative costs of the remediation program are subject to the indemnification provisions of the acquisition
agreement pursuant to which the Company purchased the American Skandia entities in May 2003 from Skandia.

Securities

Prudential Securities has been named as a defendant in a number of industry-wide purported class actions in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York relating to its former securities underwriting business.
Plaintiffs in one consolidated proceeding, captioned

In re: Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation

, allege, among other things, that the underwriters engaged in a scheme involving tying agreements, undisclosed compensation arrangements
and research analyst conflicts to manipulate and inflate the prices of shares sold in initial public offerings in violation of the federal securities laws. Certain issuers of these securities and their current and former officers and directors have
also been named as defendants. In October 2004, the district court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in six “focus cases.” In December 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated that
decision and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. In August 2000, Prudential Securities was named as a defendant, along with other underwriters, in a purported class action, captioned

CHS Electronics Inc. v. Credit
Suisse First Boston Corp. et al

., which alleges on behalf of issuers of securities in initial public offerings that the defendants conspired to fix at 7% the discount that underwriting syndicates receive from issuers in violation of federal
antitrust laws. Plaintiffs moved for class certification in September 2004 and for partial summary judgment in November 2005. The summary judgment motion has been deferred pending disposition of the class certification motion. In April 2006, the
district court denied class certification. In September 2007, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the district court’s decision denying class certification and remanded the cases to the district court for further proceedings. In a
related action, captioned

Gillet v. Goldman Sachs et al.

, plaintiffs allege substantially the same antitrust claims on behalf of investors, though only injunctive relief is currently being sought.

Other Matters

Mutual Fund Market Timing Practices

In August 2006, Prudential Equity Group, LLC (“PEG”), a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company, reached a resolution of the previously disclosed regulatory and criminal investigations into deceptive market related activities involving PEG’s former Prudential Securities operations. The settlements relate to
conduct that generally occurred between 1999 and 2003 involving certain former Prudential Securities brokers in Boston and



certain other branch offices in the U.S., their supervisors, and other members of the Prudential Securities control structure with responsibilities that
related to the market timing activities, including certain former members of Prudential Securities senior management. The Prudential Securities operations were contributed to a joint venture with Wachovia Corporation in July 2003, but PEG retained
liability for the market timing related activities. In connection with the resolution of the investigations, PEG entered into separate settlements with each of the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts (“USAO”), the
Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Securities Division, SEC, the National Association of Securities Dealers, the New York Stock Exchange, the New Jersey Bureau of Securities and the New York Attorney Generals Office. These settlements
resolve the investigations by the above named authorities into these matters as to all Prudential entities without further regulatory proceedings or filing of charges so long as the terms of the settlement are followed and provided, in the case of
the settlement agreement reached with the USAO, that the USAO has reserved the right to prosecute PEG if there is a material breach by PEG of that agreement during its five year term and in certain other specified events. Under the terms of the
settlements, PEG paid $270 million into a Fair Fund administered by the SEC to compensate those harmed by the market timing activities. In addition, $330 million was paid in fines and penalties. Pursuant to the settlements, PEG retained, at
PEG’s ongoing cost and expense, the services of an Independent Distribution Consultant acceptable to certain of the authorities to develop a proposed distribution plan for the distribution of Fair Fund amounts according to a methodology
developed in consultation with and acceptable to certain of the authorities. In addition, as part of the settlements, PEG has agreed, among other things, to continue to cooperate with the above named authorities in any litigation, ongoing
investigations or other proceedings relating to or arising from their investigations into these matters. In connection with the settlements, the Company has agreed with the USAO, among other things, to cooperate with the USAO and to maintain and
periodically report on the effectiveness of its compliance procedures. The settlement documents include findings and admissions that may adversely affect existing litigation or cause additional litigation and result in adverse publicity and other
potentially adverse impacts to the Company’s businesses.

In addition to the regulatory proceedings described above that were settled in 2006, in October 2004, the Company and Prudential Securities were named as defendants in several class actions brought on behalf of purchasers and holders of
shares in a number of mutual fund complexes. The actions are consolidated as part of a multi-district proceeding,

In re: Mutual Fund Investment Litigation,

pending in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. The
complaints allege that the purchasers and holders were harmed by dilution of the funds’ values and excessive fees, caused by market timing and late trading, and seek unspecified damages. In August 2005, the Company was dismissed from several of
the actions, without prejudice to repleading the state claims, but remains a defendant in other actions in the consolidated proceeding. In July 2006, in one of the consolidated mutual fund actions,

Saunders v. Putnam American Government Income
Fund, et al.,

the United States District Court for the District of Maryland granted plaintiffs leave to refile their federal securities law claims against Prudential Securities. In August 2006, the second amended complaint was filed alleging
federal securities law claims on behalf of a purported nationwide class of mutual fund investors seeking compensatory and punitive damages in unspecified amounts. Discovery is ongoing. Motions to dismiss the other actions are pending.

Commencing in 2003, the Company received formal requests for information from
the SEC and NYAG relating to market timing in variable annuities by certain American Skandia entities. In connection with these investigations, with the approval of Skandia Insurance Company Ltd. (publ) (“Skandia”), an offer was made by
American Skandia to the authorities investigating its companies, the SEC and NYAG, to settle these matters by paying restitution and a civil penalty of $95 million in the aggregate. While not assured, the Company believes these discussions are
likely to lead to settlements with these authorities. Any regulatory settlement involving an American Skandia entity would be subject to the indemnification provisions of the acquisition agreement pursuant to which the Company purchased the American
Skandia entities in May 2003 from Skandia. If achieved, settlement of the matters relating to American Skandia also could involve continuing monitoring, changes to and/or supervision of business practices, findings that may adversely affect existing
or cause additional litigation, adverse publicity and other adverse impacts to the Company’s businesses.

Other

In August 1999, a Prudential Insurance employee and several Prudential Insurance retirees filed an action in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of Florida,

Dupree, et al., v. Prudential Insurance, et

al.

, against Prudential Insurance and its Board of Directors in connection with a group annuity contract entered



into in 1989 between the Prudential Retirement Plan and Prudential Insurance. The suit alleged that the annuitization of certain retirement benefits violated
ERISA and that, in the event of demutualization, Prudential Insurance would retain shares distributed under the annuity contract in violation of ERISA’s fiduciary duty requirements. In July 2001, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint dropping
three counts, and the Company filed an answer denying the essential allegations of the complaint. The amended complaint seeks injunctive and monetary relief, including the return of what are claimed to be excess investment and advisory fees paid by
the Retirement Plan to Prudential. In March 2002, the court dismissed certain of the claims against the individual defendants. A non-jury trial was concluded in January 2005. In August 2007, the court issued its decision and order dismissing the
case. In September 2007, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. In December 2007, the appeal was withdrawn.

In October 2007, Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity Co. (“PRIAC”) filed an action in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York,

Prudential Retirement Insurance & Annuity Co. v. State Street Global Advisors,

in PRIAC’s fiduciary capacity and on behalf of certain defined benefit and defined contribution plan clients of PRIAC, against
an unaffiliated asset manager, State Street Global Advisors (“SSgA”) and SSgA’s affiliate, State Street Bank and Trust Company (“State Street”). This action seeks, among other relief, restitution of certain losses
attributable to certain investment funds sold by SSgA as to which PRIAC believes SSgA employed investment strategies and practices that were misrepresented by SSgA and failed to exercise the standard of care of a prudent investment manager. PRIAC
also intends to vigorously pursue any other available remedies against SSgA and State Street in respect of this matter. Given the unusual circumstances surrounding the management of these SSgA funds and in order to protect the interests of the
affected plans and their participants while PRIAC pursues these remedies, PRIAC implemented a process under which affected plan clients that authorized PRIAC to proceed on their behalf have received payments from funds provided by PRIAC for the
losses referred to above. The Company’s consolidated financial statements, and the results of the Retirement segment included in the Company’s Investment Division, for the year ended December 31, 2007 include a pre-tax charge of $82
million, reflecting these payments to plan clients and certain related costs.

In September and October 2005, five purported class action lawsuits were filed against the Company, PSI and PEG claiming that stockbrokers were improperly classified as exempt employees under state and federal wage
and hour laws, were improperly denied overtime pay and that improper deductions were made from the stockbrokers’ wages. Two of the stockbrokers’ complaints,

Janowsky v. Wachovia Securities, LLC

and

Prudential Securities
Incorporated

and

Goldstein v. Prudential Financial, Inc

., were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The

Goldstein

complaint purports to have been filed on behalf of a nationwide class.
The

Janowsky

complaint alleges a class of New York brokers. Motions to dismiss and compel arbitration were filed in the

Janowsky

and

Goldstein

matters, which have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes. The three stockbrokers
complaints filed in California Superior Court,

Dewane v. Prudential Equity Group, Prudential Securities Incorporated,

and

Wachovia Securities LLC

;

DiLustro v. Prudential Securities Incorporated,
Prudential Equity Group Inc. and Wachovia Securities

; and

Carayanis v. Prudential Equity Group LLC and Prudential Securities Inc.

, purport to have been brought on behalf of classes of California brokers. The

Carayanis

complaint was
subsequently withdrawn without prejudice in May 2006. In June 2006, a purported New York state class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York,

Panesenko v. Wachovia Securities, et
al

., alleging that the Company failed to pay overtime to stockbrokers in violation of state and federal law and that improper deductions were made from the stockbrokers’ wages in violation of state law. In September 2006, Prudential
Securities was sued in

Badain v. Wachovia Securities, et al.,

a purported nationwide class action filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York. The complaint alleges that Prudential Securities failed to pay
overtime to stockbrokers in violation of state and federal law and that improper deductions were made from the stockbrokers’ wages in violation of state law. In December 2006, these cases were transferred to the United States District Court for
the Central District of California by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings. In October 2006, a purported class action lawsuit,

Bouder v. Prudential Financial, Inc. and Prudential
Insurance Company of America

, was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, claiming that the Company failed to pay overtime to insurance agents who were registered representatives in violation of federal and
state law, and that improper deductions were made from these agents’ wages in violation of state law. The complaints seek back overtime pay and statutory damages, recovery of improper deductions, interest, and attorneys’ fees. In December
2007, plaintiffs moved to certify the class. The motion is pending.



Summary

Our litigation and regulatory matters are subject to many uncertainties, and given its complexity and scope, their outcome cannot be predicted. It is
possible that our results of operations or cash flow in a particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of pending litigation and regulatory matters depending, in part, upon the results of
operations or cash flow for such period. In light of the unpredictability of the Company’s litigation and regulatory matters, it is also possible that in certain cases an ultimate unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or
regulatory matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. Management believes, however, that, based on information currently known to it, the ultimate outcome of all pending litigation and regulatory matters, after
consideration of applicable reserves and rights to indemnification, is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position.

PART II

ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

General

Prudential Financial’s Common Stock was issued to eligible policyholders in Prudential Insurance’s demutualization
and sold to investors in Prudential Financial’s initial public offering. The Common Stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “PRU” on December 13, 2001. The following table presents the high and low
closing prices for the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange during the periods indicated and the dividends declared per share during such periods:

On January 31,
2008, there were 2,505,853 registered holders of record for the Common Stock and 444 million shares outstanding.

The Class B Stock was issued to institutional investors (two subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. and Pacific Life Corp.) in a private
placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 on the date of demutualization. There is no established public trading market for the Class B Stock. During the fourth quarter of 2007 and 2006, Prudential Financial paid an
annual dividend of $9.625 per share of Class B Stock. On January 31, 2008, there were three holders of record for the Class B Stock and 2 million shares outstanding.

Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors currently intends to continue to declare and pay annual dividends on the
Common Stock and Class B Stock. Future dividend decisions will be based on, and affected by, a number of factors including the financial performance of the Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business;



our overall financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements and future prospects; regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by
Prudential Financial’s subsidiaries; and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant. Dividends payable by Prudential Financial are limited to the amount that would be legally available for payment under New Jersey corporate
law. For additional information on dividends and related regulatory restrictions, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” and Note 13 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In November 2005, Prudential Financial issued in a private placement $2.0 billion of floating rate convertible senior notes, convertible by the holders at any time after issuance into cash and shares of the
Company’s Common Stock. The Company used substantially all of the offering proceeds to purchase an investment grade fixed income investment portfolio as well as to repurchase, under the Company’s 2005 share repurchase authorization, shares
of its Common Stock. In April 2007, Prudential Financial announced its intention to call all such outstanding floating rate convertible senior notes for redemption on May 21, 2007. Prior to the redemption, substantially all holders elected to
convert their senior notes as provided under their terms. The senior notes required net settlement in shares; therefore, upon conversion, the holders received cash equal to the par amount of the senior notes surrendered for conversion plus accrued
interest and shares of Prudential Financial Common Stock for the portion of the settlement amount in excess of the par amount. The settlement amount in excess of the par amount was based upon the excess of the closing market price of Prudential
Financial Common Stock for a 10-day period defined under the terms of the senior notes, or $100.80 per share, over the initial conversion price of $90 per share. Accordingly, at conversion the Company issued 2,367,887 shares of Common Stock from
treasury. The conversion had no impact on the Company’s results of operations and resulted in a net increase to shareholders’ equity of $44 million, reflecting the tax benefit associated with the conversion of the senior notes. The payment
of principal and accrued interest was funded primarily through the liquidation of the investment grade fixed income investment portfolio purchased with the proceeds from the original issuance of these notes.

In December 2006, Prudential Financial issued in a private placement $2.0
billion of floating rate convertible senior notes, convertible by the holders at any time after issuance into cash and shares of the Company’s Common Stock. The Company used the majority of the offering proceeds initially to invest in an
investment grade fixed income investment portfolio, while the remainder of the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and to repurchase shares of its Common Stock under the 2006 share repurchase authorization. On December 12, 2007,
$117 million of senior notes were repurchased by Prudential Financial at the request of the holders and prior to this event we liquidated the investment portfolio. The remaining proceeds are invested in short-term instruments and may be used to fund
operations in lieu of other short-term borrowings in future periods.

In December 2007, Prudential Financial issued in a private placement $3.0 billion of floating rate convertible senior notes, convertible by the holders at any time after issuance into cash and shares of the Company’s Common Stock. The
Company used the majority of the offering proceeds to fund operating needs of our subsidiaries, to purchase short-term investment grade fixed income investments and for general corporate purposes, as well as to repurchase shares of its Common Stock
under the 2007 share repurchase authorization.

For additional
information about our convertible senior notes see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

See Item 12 for information about our equity compensation plans.

Common Stock and Class B Stock

The Common Stock and the Class B Stock are separate classes of common stock under New Jersey corporate law.

Holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock will be entitled to dividends if
and when declared by Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors out of funds legally available to pay those dividends. To the extent



dividends are paid on the Class B Stock, shares of Class B Stock are repurchased or the Closed Block Business has net losses, the amount legally available
for dividends on the Common Stock will be reduced. In addition, payment of dividends will be subject to the following additional conditions:

•

Common Stock will be entitled to receive dividends, if and when declared by Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors, only out of assets of the Financial
Services Businesses legally available for the payment of dividends under the New Jersey Business Corporation Act as if the Financial Services Businesses were a separate New Jersey corporation; and

•

Class B Stock will be entitled to receive dividends, if and when declared by Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors, only out of assets of the Closed Block
Business legally available for the payment of dividends under the New Jersey Business Corporation Act, as if the Closed Block Business were a separate New Jersey corporation.

Dividends declared and paid on the Common Stock will depend upon the
financial performance of the Financial Services Businesses. Dividends declared and paid on the Class B Stock will depend upon the financial performance of the Closed Block Business and, as the Closed Block matures, the holders of the Class B Stock
will receive the surplus of the Closed Block Business no longer required to support the Closed Block for regulatory purposes. Dividends on the Class B Stock will be payable in an aggregate amount per year at least equal to the lesser of (1) a
“Target Dividend Amount” of $19.25 million or (2) the “CB Distributable Cash Flow,” as defined below in “—Convertibility,” for such year, which is a measure of the net cash flows of the Closed Block Business.
Notwithstanding this formula, as with any common stock, we will retain the flexibility to suspend dividends on the Class B Stock; however, if CB Distributable Cash Flow exists for any period and Prudential Financial chooses not to pay dividends on
the Class B Stock in an aggregate amount at least equal to the lesser of the CB Distributable Cash Flow or the Target Dividend Amount for that period, then cash dividends cannot be paid on the Common Stock with respect to such period. The principal
component of “CB Distributable Cash Flow” will be the amount by which Surplus and Related Assets, determined according to statutory accounting principles, exceed surplus that would be required for the Closed Block Business considered as a
separate insurer; provided, however, that “CB Distributable Cash Flow” counts such excess only to the extent distributable as a dividend by Prudential Insurance under specified, but not all, provisions of New Jersey insurance law. Subject
to the discretion of the Board of Directors of Prudential Financial, we currently anticipate paying dividends on the Class B Stock at the Target Dividend Amount for the foreseeable future.

The shares of Common Stock will vote together with the shares of Class B
Stock on all matters (one share, one vote) except as otherwise required by law and except that holders of the Class B Stock will have class voting or consent rights with respect to specified matters directly affecting the Class B Stock.

If shares of Class B Stock are outstanding at the time of a liquidation,
dissolution or winding-up of Prudential Financial, each share of Common Stock and Class B Stock will be entitled to a share of net liquidation proceeds in proportion to the respective liquidation units of such class. Each share of Common Stock will
have one liquidation unit, and each share of Class B Stock will have 2.83215 liquidation units.

On December 18, 2001, Prudential Financial’s shareholder rights agreement became effective. Under the shareholder rights agreement, one
shareholder protection right is attached to each share of Common Stock but not to any share of Class B Stock. Each right initially entitles the holder to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of a series of Prudential Financial preferred stock upon
payment of the exercise price. At the time of the demutualization, the Board of Directors of Prudential Financial determined that the initial exercise price per right is $110, subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in the shareholder
rights agreement. The shareholders rights agreement will expire by its terms on December 18, 2011.

Convertibility

The Common Stock is not convertible.

Prudential Financial may, at its option, at any time, exchange all outstanding shares of Class B Stock into such number of shares of Common Stock as have an aggregate average market value (discussed below) equal to 120% of the appraised
“Fair Market Value” (discussed below) of the outstanding shares of Class B Stock.



In addition, if (1) Prudential Financial sells or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of
the Closed Block Business or (2) a “change of control” of Prudential Financial occurs, Prudential Financial must exchange all outstanding shares of Class B Stock into such number of shares of Common Stock as have an aggregate average
market value of 120% of the appraised Fair Market Value of such shares of Class B Stock. For this purpose, “change of control” means the occurrence of any of the following events (whether or not approved by the Board of Directors of
Prudential Financial): (a)(i) any person(s) (as defined) (excluding Prudential Financial and specified related entities) is or becomes the beneficial owner (as defined), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the total voting power of the then
outstanding equity securities of Prudential Financial; or (ii) Prudential Financial merges with, or consolidates with, another person or disposes of all or substantially all of its assets to any person, other than, in the case of either clause
(i) or (ii), any transaction where immediately after such transaction the persons that beneficially owned immediately prior to the transaction the then outstanding voting equity securities of Prudential Financial beneficially own more than 50%
of the total voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the surviving person; or (b) during any year or any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the Board of Directors of
Prudential Financial (together with any new directors whose election by such Board of Directors or whose nomination for election by the shareholders of Prudential Financial was approved by a vote of a majority of the directors of Prudential
Financial then still in office who were either directors at the beginning of such period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved) cease for any reason, other than pursuant to (x) a proposal or request that the
Board of Directors be changed as to which the holder of the Class Stock seeking the conversion has participated or assisted or is participating or assisting or (y) retirements in the ordinary course (as defined), to constitute a majority of the
Board of Directors then in office.

Holders of Class B Stock
will be permitted to convert their shares of Class B Stock into such number of shares of Common Stock as have an aggregate average market value equal to 100% of the appraised Fair Market Value of the outstanding shares of Class B Stock (1) in
the holder’s sole discretion, in the year 2016 or at any time thereafter, and (2) at any time in the event that (a) the Class B Stock will no longer be treated as equity of Prudential Financial for federal income tax purposes or
(b) the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance amends, alters, changes or modifies the regulation of the Closed Block, the Closed Block Business, the Class B Stock or the IHC debt in a manner that materially adversely affects the CB
Distributable Cash Flow (as defined below); provided, however, that in no event may a holder of Class B Stock convert shares of Class B Stock to the extent such holder immediately upon such conversion, together with its affiliates, would be the
“beneficial owner,” as defined under the Exchange Act, of in excess of 9.9% of the total outstanding voting power of Prudential Financial’s voting securities. In the event a holder of shares of Class B Stock requests to convert shares
pursuant to clause (2)(a) in the preceding sentence, Prudential Financial may elect, instead of effecting such conversion, to increase the Target Dividend Amount to $12.6875 per share per annum retroactively from the time of issuance of the
Class B Stock.

“CB Distributable Cash Flow” means,
for any quarterly or annual period, the sum of (i) the excess of (a) the Surplus and Related Assets over (b) the “Required Surplus” applicable to the Closed Block Business within Prudential Insurance, to the extent that
Prudential Insurance is able to distribute such excess as a dividend to Prudential Holdings, LLC (“PHLLC”) under New Jersey law without giving effect, directly or indirectly, to the “earned surplus” requirement of
Section 17:27A-4c.(3) of the New Jersey Insurance Holding Company Systems Law, plus (ii) any amount held by PHLLC allocated to the Closed Block Business in excess of remaining debt service payments on the IHC debt. For purposes of the
foregoing, “Required Surplus” means the amount of surplus applicable to the Closed Block Business within Prudential Insurance that would be required to maintain a quotient (expressed as a percentage) of (i) the “Total Adjusted
Capital” applicable to the Closed Block Business within Prudential Insurance (including any applicable dividend reserves) divided by (ii) the “Company Action Level RBC” applicable to the Closed Block Business within Prudential
Insurance, equal to 100%, where “Total Adjusted Capital” and “Company Action Level RBC” are as defined in the regulations promulgated under the New Jersey Dynamic Capital and Surplus Act of 1993. These amounts are determined
according to statutory accounting principles.

In the event of
any reclassification, recapitalization or exchange of, or any tender offer or exchange offer for, the outstanding shares of Common Stock, including by merger, consolidation or other business combination, as a result of which shares of Common Stock
are exchanged for or converted into another security which is both registered under the Exchange Act and publicly traded, then the Class B Stock will remain outstanding (unless



exchanged by virtue of a “change of control” occurring or otherwise, or otherwise converted) and, in the event 50% or more of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock are so exchanged or converted, holders of outstanding Class B Stock will be entitled to receive, in the event of any subsequent exchange or conversion, the securities into which the Common Stock has been exchanged or converted
by virtue of such reclassification, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer or other business combination. If, in the event of any reclassification, recapitalization or exchange, or any tender or exchange offer for, the
outstanding shares of Common Stock, including by merger, consolidation or other business combination, as a result of which a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock are converted into or exchanged or purchased for either cash or
securities which are not public securities, or a combination thereof, the Class B Stock will be entitled to receive cash and/or securities of the type and in the proportion that such holders of Class B Stock would have received if an exchange or
conversion of the Class B Stock had occurred immediately prior to the conversion, exchange or purchase of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock and the holders of Class B Stock had participated as holders of Common Stock in such
conversion, exchange or purchase. The amount of cash and/or securities payable upon such exchange or conversion will be calculated based upon the Fair Market Value of the Class B Stock as of the date on which the Common Stock was exchanged,
converted or purchased and will be multiplied by 120%.

For
purposes of all exchanges and conversions, the “average market value” of the Common Stock will be determined during a specified 20 trading day period preceding the time of the exchange or conversion. “Fair Market Value” of the
Class B Stock means the fair market value of all of the outstanding shares of Class B Stock as determined by appraisal by a nationally recognized actuarial or other competent firm independent of and selected by the Board of Directors of Prudential
Financial and approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B Stock. Fair Market Value will be the present value of expected future cash flows to holders of the Class B Stock, reduced by any payables to the Financial
Services Businesses. Future cash flows will be projected consistent with the policy, as described in the Plan of Reorganization, for the Board of Directors of Prudential Insurance to declare policyholder dividends based on actual experience in the
Closed Block. Following the repayment in full of the IHC debt, these cash flows shall be the excess of statutory surplus applicable to the Closed Block Business over Required Surplus (as defined in the definition of “CB Distributable Cash
Flow”) for each period that would be distributable as a dividend under New Jersey law if the Closed Block Business were a separate insurer. These cash flows will be discounted at an equity rate of return, to be estimated as a risk-free rate
plus an equity risk premium. The risk-free rate will be an appropriate ten-year U.S. Treasury rate reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The equity risk premium will be eight and one quarter percent initially, declining evenly to four
percent over the following 21 years and remaining constant thereafter. Fair Market Value will be determined by appraisal as of a specified date preceding the time of the exchange or conversion.

Any exchange or conversion of Class B Stock into Common Stock could occur at
a time when either or both of the Common Stock and Class B Stock may be considered to be overvalued or undervalued. In the future, if the Class B Stock is exchanged for or converted into Common Stock, the number of shares of Common Stock then
obtainable by the Class B Stockholders might constitute a higher proportion of the total shares of Common Stock then outstanding than the proportion represented by (x) the number of shares of Class B Stock initially issued divided by
(y) the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding upon completion of the demutualization. The degree of any such proportionate increase would depend principally on: the performance of the Closed Block Business over time and the
valuation of the Closed Block Business at the time of exchange or conversion; whether the exchange or conversion implemented involves a premium; the number of any new shares of Common Stock we issue after the demutualization for financing,
acquisition or other purposes or any repurchases of Common Stock that we may make; and the market value of our Common Stock at the time of exchange or conversion.



Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

The following table provides information about purchases by the Company during the three months ended December 31, 2007
of its Common Stock.

(1)

In November 2006, Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which Prudential Financial was authorized to repurchase up to $3.0
billion of its outstanding Common Stock in 2007.

(2)

Includes shares of Common Stock withheld from participants for income tax withholding purposes whose shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units vested during the period.
Restricted stock and restricted stock units were issued to participants pursuant to the Prudential Financial, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan that was adopted by the Company’s Board of Directors in March 2003 (as subsequently amended and restated).

(3)

The stock repurchase program authorized in 2006 expired on December 31, 2007 and, therefore, the Company can no longer purchase any additional shares of Common Stock under this
authorization. In November 2007, the Board authorized the Company to repurchase up to $3.5 billion of its outstanding Common Stock during calendar year 2008.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

You should read the following analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction
with the Forward-Looking Statements included below the Table of Contents, “Risk Factors,” “Selected Financial Data” and the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Overview

Prudential Financial has two classes of common stock outstanding. The Common Stock, which is publicly traded (NYSE:PRU),
reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses, while the Class B Stock, which was issued through a private placement and does not trade on any exchange, reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business. The Financial Services
Businesses and the Closed Block Business are discussed below.

Financial
Services Businesses

Our Financial Services Businesses
consist of three operating divisions, which together encompass eight segments, and our Corporate and Other operations. The Insurance division consists of our Individual Life, Individual Annuities and Group Insurance segments. The Investment division
consists of our Asset Management, Financial Advisory and Retirement segments. The International Insurance and Investments division consists of our International Insurance and International Investments segments. Our Corporate and Other operations
include our real estate and relocation services business, as well as corporate items and initiatives that are not allocated to business segments. Corporate and Other operations also include businesses that have been or will be divested and
businesses that we have placed in wind-down status.

We
attribute financing costs to each segment based on the amount of financing used by each segment, excluding financing costs associated with corporate debt. The net investment income of each segment includes earnings on the amount of equity that
management believes is necessary to support the risks of that segment.

We seek growth internally and through acquisitions, joint ventures or other forms of business combinations or investments. Our principal acquisition focus is in our current business lines, both domestic and international.



Closed Block Business

In connection with the demutualization, we ceased offering domestic participating products. The liabilities for our traditional domestic in force
participating products were segregated, together with assets, in a regulatory mechanism referred to as the “Closed Block.” The Closed Block is designed generally to provide for the reasonable expectations for future policy dividends after
demutualization of holders of participating individual life insurance policies and annuities included in the Closed Block by allocating assets that will be used exclusively for payment of benefits, including policyholder dividends, expenses and
taxes with respect to these products. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Closed Block. At the time of demutualization, we determined the amount of Closed Block assets so that the Closed Block assets
initially had a lower book value than the Closed Block liabilities. We expect that the Closed Block assets will generate sufficient cash flow, together with anticipated revenues from the Closed Block policies, over the life of the Closed Block to
fund payments of all expenses, taxes, and policyholder benefits to be paid to, and the reasonable dividend expectations of, holders of the Closed Block policies. We also segregated for accounting purposes the assets that we need to hold outside the
Closed Block to meet capital requirements related to the Closed Block policies. No policies sold after demutualization will be added to the Closed Block, and its in force business is expected to ultimately decline as we pay policyholder benefits in
full. We also expect the proportion of our business represented by the Closed Block to decline as we grow other businesses.

Concurrently with our demutualization, Prudential Holdings, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial that owns the capital stock of
Prudential Insurance, issued $1.75 billion in senior secured notes, which we refer to as the IHC debt. The net proceeds from the issuances of the Class B Stock and IHC debt, except for $72 million used to purchase a guaranteed investment contract to
fund a portion of the bond insurance cost associated with that debt, were allocated to the Financial Services Businesses. However, we expect that the IHC debt will be serviced by the net cash flows of the Closed Block Business over time, and we
include interest expenses associated with the IHC debt when we report results of the Closed Block Business.

The Closed Block Business consists principally of the Closed Block, assets that we must hold outside the Closed Block to meet capital requirements related
to the Closed Block policies, invested assets held outside the Closed Block that represent the difference between the Closed Block assets and Closed Block liabilities and the interest maintenance reserve, deferred policy acquisition costs related to
Closed Block policies, the principal amount of the IHC debt and related hedging activities, and certain other related assets and liabilities.

Revenues and Expenses

We earn our revenues principally from insurance premiums; mortality, expense, and asset management and administrative fees from insurance and investment
products; and investment of general account and other funds. We earn premiums primarily from the sale of individual life insurance and group life and disability insurance. We earn mortality, expense, and asset management fees from the sale and
servicing of separate account products including variable life insurance and variable annuities. We also earn asset management and administrative fees from the distribution, servicing and management of mutual funds, retirement products and other
asset management products and services. Our operating expenses principally consist of insurance benefits provided, general business expenses, dividends to policyholders, commissions and other costs of selling and servicing the various products we
sell and interest credited on general account liabilities.

Profitability

Our profitability depends principally on our ability to
price and manage risk on insurance products, our ability to attract and retain customer assets and our ability to manage expenses. Specific drivers of our profitability include:

•

our ability to manufacture and distribute products and services and to introduce new products that gain market acceptance on a timely basis;

•

our ability to price our insurance products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the expense of acquiring customers
and administering those products;



•

our mortality and morbidity experience on individual and group life insurance, annuity and group disability insurance products, which can fluctuate significantly
from period to period;

•

our persistency experience, which affects our ability to recover the cost of acquiring new business over the lives of the contracts;

•

our cost of administering insurance contracts and providing asset management products and services;

•

our returns on invested assets, net of the amounts we credit to policyholders’ accounts;

•

the performance of our investment in Wachovia Securities Financial Holdings, LLC, or Wachovia Securities;

•

the amount of our assets under management and changes in their fair value, which affect the amount of asset management fees we receive;

•

our ability to generate favorable investment results through asset/liability management and strategic and tactical asset allocation;

•

our ability to maintain our credit and financial strength ratings; and

•

our ability to manage risk and exposures.

In addition, factors such as regulation, competition, interest rates, taxes, foreign exchange rates, securities, credit and real estate market conditions
and general economic conditions affect our profitability. In some of our product lines, particularly those in the Closed Block Business, we share experience on mortality, morbidity, persistency and investment results with our customers, which can
offset the impact of these factors on our profitability from those products.

Historically, the participating products included in the Closed Block have yielded lower returns on capital invested than many of our other businesses. As we have ceased offering domestic participating products, we
expect that the proportion of the traditional participating products in our in force business will gradually diminish as these older policies age, and we grow other businesses. However, the relatively lower returns to us on this existing block of
business will continue to affect our consolidated results of operations for many years. Our Common Stock reflects the performance of our Financial Services Businesses, but there can be no assurance that the market value of the Common Stock will
reflect solely the performance of these businesses.

See
“Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks that could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, cause the trading price of our Common Stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ
materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.

Executive Summary

Prudential Financial, one of the largest financial services companies in the U.S., offers individual and institutional clients a wide array of financial
products and services, including life insurance, annuities, mutual funds, pension and retirement-related services and administration, investment management, real estate brokerage and relocation services, and, through a joint venture, retail
securities brokerage services. We offer these products and services through one of the largest distribution networks in the financial services industry.

Significant developments and events in 2007 reflect our continued efforts to redeploy capital effectively to seek enhanced returns. These developments
included:

•

The continuation of our share repurchase program. In 2007, we repurchased 32.0 million shares of Common Stock at a total cost of $3.0 billion. In November
2007, Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors authorized us, under a new stock repurchase program, to repurchase up to $3.5 billion of our outstanding Common Stock during 2008.

•

A 21% increase in our annual Common Stock dividend, to $1.15 per share.



We analyze performance of the segments and Corporate and Other operations of the Financial Services
Businesses using a measure called adjusted operating income. See “—Consolidated Results of Operations” for a definition of adjusted operating income and a discussion of its use as a measure of segment operating performance.

Shown below are the contributions of each segment and
Corporate and Other operations to our adjusted operating income for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 and a reconciliation of adjusted operating income of our segments and Corporate and Other operations to income from continuing
operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures.

Results for 2007
presented above reflect the following, including the impact of adverse market conditions in the latter half of 2007 which impacted results of certain of our segments:

•

Results of several segments reflect decreases in the market value of certain externally managed investments in the European market during 2007. These decreases in
market value had an aggregate negative impact of $161 million on the adjusted operating income of the segments of the Financial Services Businesses for 2007.

•

Individual Life segment results for 2007 improved in comparison to 2006 as results for the current year reflect a greater benefit from reductions in amortization of
deferred policy acquisition costs and other costs, reflecting updates of our actuarial assumptions based on annual reviews in both 2007 and 2006, and a greater benefit in 2007 from compensation received based on multi-year profitability of
third-party products we distribute.

•

Individual Annuities segment results for 2007 improved in comparison to 2006 due primarily to higher fee income reflecting higher average variable annuity asset
balances. Results for 2007 also reflect a greater contribution from the operations of the variable annuity business acquired from The Allstate Corporation, for which prior year results reflect operations from the June 1, 2006 date of
acquisition.

•

Group Insurance segment results improved in 2007, compared to 2006, primarily reflecting more favorable claims experience in our group life business.

•

Asset Management segment results in 2007 improved in comparison to 2006 primarily reflecting higher asset management fees as a result of increased asset values due
to market appreciation and net asset



flows, and increased transaction fees primarily related to real estate investment management. These increases were partially offset by less favorable results
from the segment’s commercial mortgage operations driven by 2007 losses associated with unfavorable credit market conditions in the second half of the year.

•

Financial Advisory segment results for 2007 improved in comparison to 2006 primarily due to lower expenses in 2007 related to obligations and costs we retained in
connection with businesses contributed to the retail brokerage joint venture with Wachovia, as well as higher income from our share of the joint venture reflecting the venture’s greater income from fees and commissions.

•

Retirement segment results for 2007 decreased from 2006 primarily reflecting an $82 million charge related to payments made to plan clients associated with a legal
action filed against an unaffiliated asset manager. This charge, and decreases in the market value of certain externally managed investments in the European market included in adjusted operating income in 2007, more than offset improved investment
results from a larger base of invested assets in our institutional investment products business and growth in fee income due to higher full service retirement account balances.

•

The International Insurance segment is comprised of its Life Planner and Gibraltar Life operations. Results from the segment’s Life Planner operations were
lower in 2007, reflecting decreases in the market value of certain externally managed investments in the European market, which more than offset the continued growth of our Japanese Life Planner operations and a more favorable impact from foreign
currency exchange rates. Results from the segment’s Gibraltar Life operation improved in 2007, due primarily to improved investment income margins reflecting investment portfolio strategies and growth of account values for its U.S. dollar
denominated fixed annuity product.

•

International Investments segment results improved in 2007, compared to 2006, primarily reflecting the gain from the sale of an interest in operating joint ventures
during 2007, higher income from market value changes on securities relating to exchange memberships, and a benefit in 2007 from recoveries related to a former investment, as well as more favorable results in the segment’s asset management
businesses.

•

Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments for the Financial Services Businesses in 2007 amounted to $106 million. Results for 2007 reflect
gains on sales of equity securities primarily by our Japanese and Korean insurance operations, partially offset by derivative losses and other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturity and equity securities.

•

Income from continuing operations before income taxes in the Closed Block Business decreased $113 million in 2007 compared to 2006. Results reflect an increase in
dividends to policyholders resulting from an increase in the dividend scale, as well as an increase in the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation expense and claim costs that continue to increase with the aging of the Closed Block
policyholders, in addition to a reserve release in the prior year period. These items are partially offset by increases in net realized investment gains and net investment income.

Accounting Policies & Pronouncements

Application of Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. Management, on an ongoing basis, reviews estimates and assumptions used
in the preparation of financial statements. If management determines that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate given current facts and circumstances, results of operations and financial position as reported in the Consolidated
Financial Statements could change significantly.

The following
sections discuss the accounting policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions.

Valuation of Investments

As prescribed by U.S. GAAP, we present our investments classified as available for sale, including fixed maturity and equity securities, and our
investments classified as trading, such as our trading account assets



supporting insurance liabilities, at fair value in the statements of financial position. The fair values for our public fixed maturity securities and our
public equity securities are based on quoted market prices or prices obtained from independent pricing services. However, for our investments in private securities such as private placement fixed maturity securities, which comprise 14% of our
investments as of December 31, 2007, this information is not available. For these private fixed maturities, fair value is determined typically by using a discounted cash flow model, which relies upon the average of spread surveys collected from
private market intermediaries who are active in both primary and secondary transactions and takes into account, among other factors, the credit quality of the issuer and the reduced liquidity associated with private placements. In determining the
fair value of certain securities, the discounted cash flow model may also use unobservable inputs, which reflect our own assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset. See “—Realized Investment Gains and
General Account Investments—General Account Investments—Fixed Maturity Securities—Private Fixed Maturities—Credit Quality” and “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments—General Account
Investments—Trading Account Assets supporting Insurance Liabilities” for information regarding the credit quality of the private fixed maturity securities included in our general account.

For our investments classified as available for sale, the impact of changes
in fair value is recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net,” a separate component of equity. For our investments classified as trading, the impact of changes in fair value is recorded
within “Asset management fees and other income.” In addition, investments classified as available for sale, as well as those classified as held to maturity, are subject to impairment reviews to identify when a decline in value is
other-than-temporary. Factors we consider in determining whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary include: the extent (generally if greater than 20%) and duration (generally if greater than six months) of the decline; the reasons for the
decline in value (credit event, currency or interest rate related); our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value; and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. When it is
determined that a decline in value is other-than-temporary, the carrying value of the security is reduced to its fair value, with a corresponding charge to earnings. In addition, for our impairment review of asset-backed fixed maturity securities
with a credit rating below AA, we forecast the prospective future cash flows of the security and determine if the present value of those cash flows, discounted using the effective yield of the most recent interest accrual rate, has decreased from
the previous reporting period. When a decrease from the prior reporting period has occurred and the security’s market value is less than its carrying value, the carrying value of the security is reduced to its fair value, with a corresponding
charge to earnings. In both cases, this corresponding charge to earnings is referred to as an impairment. Impairments are reflected in “Realized investment gains (losses), net” in the statements of operations and are excluded from adjusted
operating income. The new cost basis of an impaired security is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value. In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment, the impaired security is accounted for as
if it had been purchased on the measurement date of the impairment. Accordingly, the discount (or reduced premium) based on the new cost basis is accreted into net investment income, and included in adjusted operating income in future periods based
upon the amount and timing of the expected future cash flows of the security, if the recoverable value of the investment based upon those cash flows is greater than the carrying value of the investment after the impairment. The level of impairment
losses can be expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and decrease when economic conditions improve. See “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments—Realized Investment Gains” for a discussion of the
effects of impairments on our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Commercial loans, which comprise 12% of our investments as of December 31, 2007, are carried primarily at unpaid principal balances, net of
unamortized premiums or discounts and a valuation allowance for losses. This valuation allowance includes a loan specific portion as well as a portfolio reserve for probable incurred but not specifically identified losses. The loan specific portion
is based on the Company’s assessment as to ultimate collectibility of loan principal. Valuation allowances for non-performing loans are recorded based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective
interest rate or based on the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. A non-performing loan is defined as a loan for which it is probable that amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be
collected. The portfolio reserve is based on a number of factors, such as historical experience and portfolio diversification. We record subsequent adjustments to our valuation allowances when appropriate. Adjustments to the allowance are reflected
in “Realized investment gains (losses), net,” in our statements of operations. Similar to impairment losses discussed above, the allowance for losses can be expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and decrease when economic
conditions improve. See “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account



Investments—General Account Investments—Commercial Loans—Commercial Loan Quality” for a discussion of the effects of the valuation
allowance on our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.

See “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments—General Account Investments” for a discussion of our investment portfolio, including the gross unrealized gains and losses as of
December 31, 2007, related to the fixed maturity and equity securities of our general account, our policies and procedures regarding the identification of other than temporary declines in investment value, and the carrying value, credit
quality, and allowance for losses related to the commercial loans of our general account.

Policyholder Liabilities

Future Policy Benefit Reserves, other than Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses

We establish reserves for future policy benefits to or on behalf of policyholders in the same period in which the policy is issued. These reserves relate
primarily to the traditional participating whole life policies of our Closed Block Business and the non-participating whole life, term life, and life contingent structured settlement and group annuity products of our Financial Services Businesses.

The future policy benefit reserves for the traditional
participating life insurance products of our Closed Block Business, which as of December 31, 2007, represented 47% of our total future policy benefit reserves are determined using the net level premium method as prescribed by U.S. GAAP. Under
this method, the future policy benefit reserves are accrued as a level proportion of the premium paid by the policyholder. In applying this method, we use mortality assumptions to determine our expected future benefits and expected future premiums,
and apply an interest rate to determine the present value of both the expected future benefit payments and the expected future premiums. The mortality assumptions used are based on data from the standard industry mortality tables that were used to
determine the cash surrender value of the policies, and the interest rates used are the contractually guaranteed interest rates used to calculate the cash surrender value of the policy. Gains or losses in our results of operations resulting from
deviations in actual experience compared to the experience assumed in establishing our reserves for this business are recognized in the determination of our annual dividends to these policyholders. Given our current level of policy dividends, we do
not anticipate significant volatility in our results of operations in future periods as a result of these deviations.

The future policy benefit reserves for our International Insurance segment and Individual Life segment, which as of December 31, 2007, represented
36% of our total future policy benefit reserves combined, relate primarily to non-participating whole life and term life products and are determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP as the present value of expected future benefits to or on behalf of
policyholders plus the present value of future maintenance expenses less the present value of future net premiums. The expected future benefits and expenses are determined using assumptions as to mortality, lapse, and maintenance expense. Reserve
assumptions are based on best estimate assumptions as of the date the policy is issued with provisions for the risk of adverse deviation. After our reserves are initially established, we perform premium deficiency tests using best estimate
assumptions as of the testing date without provisions for adverse deviation. If reserves determined based on these best estimate assumptions are greater than the net U.S. GAAP liabilities (i.e., reserves net of any DAC asset), the existing net U.S.
GAAP liabilities are adjusted to the greater amount. Our best estimate assumptions are determined by product group. Mortality assumptions are generally based on the Company’s historical experience or standard industry tables, as applicable; our
expense assumptions are based on current levels of maintenance costs, adjusted for the effects of inflation; and our interest rate assumptions are based on current and expected net investment returns. We review our mortality assumptions annually.
Generally, we do not expect our mortality trends to change significantly in the short-term and to the extent these trends may change we expect such changes to be gradual over the long-term.

The reserves for future policy benefits of our Retirement segment, which as
of December 31, 2007 represented 13% of our total future policy benefit reserves, relate to our non-participating life contingent group annuity and structured settlement products. These reserves are generally determined as the present value of
expected future benefits and expenses based on assumptions as to mortality, retirement, maintenance expense, and interest rates. Reserves are based on best estimate assumptions as of the date the contract is issued with



provisions for the risk of adverse deviation. After our reserves are initially established, we perform premium deficiency testing by product group using best
estimate assumptions as of the testing date without provisions for adverse deviation. If reserves determined based on these assumptions are greater than the existing reserves, the existing reserves are adjusted to the greater amount. Our best
estimate assumptions are determined by product group. Our mortality and retirement assumptions are based on Company or industry experience; our expense assumptions are based on current levels of maintenance costs, adjusted for the effects of
inflation; and our interest rate assumptions are based on current and expected net investment returns. We generally review our mortality assumptions and conduct a full actuarial study of these assumptions annually. We conduct a full actuarial study
of our retirement assumptions every three to five years. Generally, we do not expect our actual mortality or retirement trends to change significantly in the short-term and to the extent these trends may change we expect such changes to be gradual
over the long-term.

Unpaid claims and claim adjustment
expenses

Our liability for unpaid claims and claim
adjustment expenses of $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2007 is reported as a component of “Future policy benefits” and relates primarily to the group long-term disability products of our Group Insurance segment. This liability
represents our estimate of future disability claim payments and expenses as well as estimates of claims that we believe have been incurred, but have not yet been reported as of the balance sheet date. We do not establish loss liabilities until a
loss has occurred. As prescribed by U.S. GAAP, our liability is determined as the present value of expected future claim payments and expenses. Expected future claims payments are estimated using assumed mortality and claim termination factors and
an assumed interest rate. The mortality and claim termination factors are based on standard industry tables and the Company’s historical experience. Our interest rate assumptions are based on factors such as market conditions and expected
investment returns. Of these assumptions, our claim termination assumptions have historically had the most significant effects on our level of liability. We regularly review our claim termination assumptions compared to actual terminations and
conduct full actuarial studies every two years. These studies review actual claim termination experience over a number of years with more weight placed on the actual experience in the more recent years. If actual experience results in a materially
different assumption, we adjust our liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses accordingly with a charge or credit to current period earnings.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs

We capitalize costs that vary with and are related primarily to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance and annuity contracts. These costs include
primarily commissions, costs of policy issuance and underwriting, and variable field office expenses. We amortize these deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC, over the expected lives of the contracts, based on the level and timing of gross
margins, gross profits, or gross premiums, depending on the type of contract. As of December 31, 2007, DAC in our Financial Services Businesses was $11.4 billion and DAC in our Closed Block Business was $0.9 billion.

DAC associated with the traditional participating products of our Closed
Block Business is amortized over the expected lives of those contracts in proportion to gross margins. Gross margins consider premiums, investment returns, benefit claims, costs for policy administration, changes in reserves, and dividends to
policyholders. We evaluate our estimates of future gross margins and adjust the related DAC balance with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the effects of actual gross margins and changes in our expected future gross
margins. Since many of the factors that affect gross margins are included in the determination of our dividends to these policyholders, we do not anticipate significant volatility in our results of operations as a result of DAC adjustments, given
our current level of dividends.

DAC associated with the
non-participating whole life and term life policies of our Individual Life segment and the non-participating whole life, term life, endowment and health policies of our International Insurance segment is amortized in proportion to gross premiums. We
evaluate the recoverability of our DAC related to these policies as part of our premium deficiency testing. If a premium deficiency exists, we reduce DAC by the amount of the deficiency or to zero through a charge to current period earnings. If the
deficiency is more than the DAC balance, we then increase the reserve for future policy benefits by the excess, by means of a charge to current period earnings. Generally, we do not expect significant short-term deterioration in experience, and
therefore do not expect significant writedowns to the related DAC.



DAC associated with the variable and universal life policies of our Individual Life and International
Insurance segments and the variable and fixed annuity contracts of our Individual Annuities segment is amortized over the expected life of these policies in proportion to gross profits. In calculating gross profits, we consider mortality,
persistency, and other elements as well as rates of return on investments associated with these contracts. We regularly evaluate and adjust the related DAC balance with a corresponding charge or credit to current period earnings for the effects of
our actual gross profits and changes in our assumptions regarding estimated future gross profits.

For the variable and universal life policies of our Individual Life segment, a significant portion of our gross profits is derived from mortality margins.
As a result, our estimates of future gross profits are significantly influenced by our mortality assumptions. Our mortality assumptions represent our expected claims experience over the life of these policies and are developed based on Company
experience. We review and update our mortality assumptions annually. Updates to our mortality assumptions in future periods could have a significant adverse or favorable effect on the results of our operations in the Individual Life segment. For the
variable and universal life policies in our International Insurance segment, mortality assumptions impact to a much lesser extent our estimates of future gross profits due to differences in policyholder demographics, the overall age of this block of
business, the amount of mortality margins and our actual mortality experience.

The DAC balance associated with the variable and universal life policies of our Individual Life segment as of December 31, 2007 was $2.9 billion. The following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of
that DAC balance relative to our future mortality assumptions by quantifying the adjustments that would be required, assuming both an increase and decrease in our future mortality rate by 1%. This information considers only the effect of changes in
our mortality assumptions and not changes in any other assumptions such as persistency, future rate of return, or expenses included in our evaluation of DAC, and does not reflect changes in reserves, such as the unearned revenue reserve, which would
partially offset the adjustments to the DAC balance reflected below.

For a discussion of
DAC adjustments related to our Individual Life segment for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, see “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—Insurance Division—Individual Life.”

For variable annuity contracts, DAC is more sensitive to the
effects of changes in our estimates of gross profits due primarily to the significant portion of our gross profits that is dependent upon the total rate of return on assets held in separate account investment options, and the shorter average life of
the contracts. This rate of return influences the fees we earn, costs we incur associated with minimum death benefit and other contractual guarantees specific to our variable annuity contracts, as well as other sources of profit. This is also true,
to a lesser degree, for our variable life policies.

The future
rate of return assumptions used in evaluating DAC for our domestic annuity and variable life insurance products are derived using a reversion to the mean approach, a common industry practice. Under this approach, we consider actual returns over a
period of time and adjust future projected returns so that the assets grow at the expected rate of return for the entire period. If the projected future rate of return is greater than our maximum future rate of return, we use our maximum future rate
of return. As part of our approach for variable annuity contracts, we develop a range of total estimated gross profits each period using statistically generated rates of return that take into consideration the latest actual rates of return
experienced to date. If the previously determined total estimated gross profits are greater than or less than the current period’s range, we adjust our future rate of return assumptions accordingly, to reflect the result of the reversion to the
mean approach. For variable annuities products, our expected rate of return across all asset types is 8.2% per annum, which reflects, among other assumptions, an expected rate of return of 9.5% per annum for equity type assets. The future
equity rate of return used varies by product, but was under 9.5% per annum for all of our variable annuity products for our evaluation of deferred policy acquisition costs as of December 31, 2007.



The DAC balance associated with our domestic variable annuity contracts was $1.9 billion as of
December 31, 2007. The following table provides a demonstration of the sensitivity of that DAC balance relative to our future rate of return assumptions by quantifying the adjustments that we would be required to consider, subject to the range
of estimated gross profits determined by the statistically generated rate of returns described above, assuming both an increase and decrease in our future rate of return by 100 basis points. This information considers only the effect of changes in
our future rate of return and not changes in any other assumptions such as persistency, mortality, or expenses included in our evaluation of DAC.

For a discussion of
DAC adjustments related to our Individual Annuities segment for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, see “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—Insurance Division—Individual
Annuities.”

In addition to DAC, we also recognize assets
for deferred sales inducements and valuation of business acquired, or VOBA. The deferred sales inducements are recognized in our Individual Annuities segment and are amortized over the anticipated life of the policy using the same methodology and
assumptions used to amortize deferred policy acquisition costs. For additional information about our deferred sales inducements, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. VOBA represents the present value of future profits embedded in
acquired businesses, and is determined by estimating the net present value of future cash flows from the contracts in force at the date of acquisition. We have established a VOBA asset primarily for our acquired traditional life, deferred annuity,
defined contribution and defined benefit businesses. VOBA is amortized over the effective life of the acquired contracts. For additional information about VOBA including details on items included in our estimates of future cash flows for the various
acquired businesses and its bases for amortization, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Goodwill

We
test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of December 31 of each year and more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. A
reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Impairment testing requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill, and record an impairment charge if
the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The determination of a reporting unit’s fair value is based on management’s best estimate, which generally considers the unit’s expected future earnings and
market-based earning multiples of peer companies. As of December 31, 2007, we have $946 million of goodwill reflected on our statements of financial position. There were no goodwill impairment charges during 2007, 2006 or 2005.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

We sponsor pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering employees
who meet specific eligibility requirements. Our net periodic costs for these plans consider an assumed discount (interest) rate, an expected rate of return on plan assets and expected increases in compensation levels and trends in health care costs.
Of these assumptions, our expected rate of return assumptions, and to a lesser extent our discount rate assumptions, have historically had the most significant effect on our net period costs associated with these plans.

We determine our expected return on plan assets based upon the arithmetical
average of prospective returns, which is based upon a risk free rate as of the measurement date adjusted by a risk premium that considers historical statistics and expected investment manager performance, for equity, debt and real estate markets
applied on a weighted average basis to our asset portfolio. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for our actual asset allocations by asset category and the asset allocation ranges prescribed by our investment



policy guidelines for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Our assumed long-term rate of return for 2007 was 8.00% for our pension plans
and 9.25% for our other postretirement benefit plans. Given the amount of plan assets as of September 30, 2006, the beginning of the measurement year, if we had assumed an expected rate of return for both our pension and other postretirement
benefit plans that was 100 basis points higher or 100 basis points lower than the rates we assumed, the change in our net periodic costs would have been as shown in the table below. The information provided in the table below considers only changes
in our assumed long-term rate of return given the level and mix of invested assets at the beginning of the measurement year, without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany
any changes in our assumed long-term rate of return.

We determine our
discount rate, used to value the pension and postretirement benefit obligations, based upon rates commensurate with current yields on high quality corporate bonds. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the
methodology we employ to determine our discount rate. Our assumed discount rate for 2007 was 5.75% for both our pension plans and our other postretirement benefit plans. Given the amount of pensions and postretirement obligation as of
September 30, 2006, the beginning of the measurement year, if we had assumed a discount rate for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans that was 100 basis points higher or 100 basis points lower than the rates we assumed, the
change in our net periodic costs would have been as shown in the table below. The information provided in the table below considers only changes in our assumed discount rate without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions
described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed discount rate.

Given the application
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions,” and the deferral and amortization of actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in our assumed discount rate, the change
in net periodic pension cost arising from an increase in the assumed discount rate by 100 basis points would not be expected to equal the change in net periodic pension cost arising from a decrease in the assumed discount rate by 100 basis points.

For a discussion of our expected rate of return on plan assets
and discount rate for our qualified pension plan in 2008 see “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—Corporate and Other.”

In addition to the effect of changes in our assumptions, the net periodic cost or benefit from our pension and other postretirement benefit
plans may change due to factors such as actual experience being different from our assumptions, special benefits to terminated employees, or changes in benefits provided under the plans.

Taxes on Income

Our effective tax rate is based on income, non-taxable and non-deductible items, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the
various jurisdictions in which we operate. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes.

Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different
times from the items reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than the actual rate applied on the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent such as
expenses that are not



deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as valuation of insurance reserves. Temporary differences create
deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities
generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expenditures for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized in our financial statements. The
application of U.S. GAAP requires us to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance if necessary to reduce our deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of
certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carry-forward periods. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than
not the deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.

Our accounting represents management’s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates. Certain changes or future events, such as changes in tax legislation,
geographic mix of earnings and completion of tax audits could have an impact on our estimates and effective tax rate. For example, the dividends received deduction reduces the amount of dividend income subject to tax and is a significant component
of the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate of 35%. The U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service, or Service, are addressing through new regulations the methodology to be followed in
determining the dividends received deduction related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts. A change in the dividends received deduction, including the possible elimination of this deduction, could increase our effective tax rate and
reduce our consolidated net income.

On January 1, 2007,
we adopted FIN No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. This interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and
disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. FIN No. 48 is a two-step process, the first step being recognition. We determine whether it is more likely than not, based
on the technical merits, that the tax position will be sustained upon examination. If a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements. The second
step is measurement. We measure the tax position as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. This
measurement considers the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement using the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date.

An increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by one percent of income
from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures, would have resulted in a decline or increase in consolidated income from continuing operations before equity in earnings of operating joint ventures
in 2007 of $47 million.

Our liability for income taxes
includes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties which relate to tax years still subject to review by the Service or other taxing jurisdictions. Audit periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has
passed. Generally, for tax years which produce net operating losses, capital losses or tax credit carryforwards, or tax attributes, the statute of limitations does not close, to the extent of these tax attributes, until the tax year in which they
are fully utilized. The completion of review or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to our liability for income taxes. Any such adjustment could be material to our results of operations
for any given quarterly or annual period based, in part, upon the results of operations for the given period.

On January 26, 2006, the Service officially closed the audit of our consolidated federal income tax returns for the 1997 to 2001 periods. As a result
of certain favorable resolutions, our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 included an income tax benefit of $720 million, reflecting a reduction in our liability for income taxes. The statute of limitations
has closed for these tax years; however, there were tax attributes in the closed years which were utilized in subsequent tax years for which the statute of limitations remains open.

In December 2006, the Service completed all fieldwork with regards to its examination of the consolidated federal income tax
returns for tax years 2002-2003. The final report was submitted to the Joint Committee on



Taxation for their review in April 2007. In July 2007, the Joint Committee returned the report to the Service for additional review of an industry issue
regarding the methodology for calculating the dividends received deduction related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts. The Company is responding to the Service’s request for additional information. As discussed above, the U.S.
Treasury Department and the Service are addressing through new regulations the methodology to be followed in determining the dividends received deduction related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts. The statute of limitations for the
2002-2003 tax years expires in 2009.

The Company’s
affiliates in Japan file separate tax returns and are subject to audits by the local taxing authority. For tax years after April 1, 2004 the general statute of limitations is 5 years from when the return is filed. For tax years prior to
April 1, 2004 the general statute of limitations is 3 years from when the return is filed. The Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau is currently conducting a routine tax audit of the tax returns of Gibraltar Life Insurance Company, Ltd. for the three
years ended March 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007.

In January
2007, the Service began an examination of tax years 2004 through 2006. For the tax year 2007, we participated in the Service’s new Compliance Assurance Program, or CAP. Under CAP, the Service assigns an examination team to review completed
transactions contemporaneously during the 2007 tax year in order to reach agreement with us on how they should be reported in the tax return. If disagreements arise, accelerated resolutions programs are available to resolve the disagreements in a
timely manner before the tax return is filed. It is management’s expectation this new program will significantly shorten the time period between the filing of our federal income tax return and the Service’s completion of its examination of
the return.

Reserves for Contingencies

A contingency is an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty
that will ultimately be resolved upon the occurrence of future events. Under U.S. GAAP, reserves for contingencies are required to be established when the future event is probable and its impact can be reasonably estimated. An example is the
establishment of a reserve for losses in connection with an unresolved legal matter. The initial reserve reflects management’s best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised accordingly as facts and
circumstances change and, ultimately, when the matter is brought to closure.

Accounting Pronouncements Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements, including the effect of adopting FSP
SFAS 13-2, “Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction,” an amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and FIN No. 48, “Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 and SOP 05-1, “Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition Costs in Connection With Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance Contracts.”

The following provides additional discussion of certain accounting policies adopted.

Share-Based Payments

Effect of Adoption

We issued employee stock options during 2001 and 2002 that were previously accounted for using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting
Principles Board, or APB, No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations, an allowable alternative method under SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” prior to its
revision. Under APB No. 25, we did not recognize any stock-based compensation expense for employee stock options as all employee stock options had an exercise price equal to the market value of our Common Stock at the date of grant. Effective
January 1, 2003, we changed our accounting for employee stock options to adopt the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended, prospectively for all new awards granted to employees on or after January 1, 2003. Under
these provisions, the fair value of all employee stock options awarded on or after January 1, 2003, is included in the determination of net income. Accordingly, the amount we included in the determination of net income for periods prior to
January 1, 2006, is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value method had been applied to all awards since inception of the employee stock option plan. We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on



January 1, 2006, using the modified prospective application transition method. There were no unvested stock options issued prior to January 1,
2003, and, therefore, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) had no impact to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations with respect to the unvested employee options.

For the changes required prospectively in accounting for options and awards with non-substantive vesting conditions, see
Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Valuation
of Stock Options Issued to Employees

As described above,
we did not record any compensation cost for employee stock options issued prior to January 1, 2003. However, we are required to disclose the net income and basic and diluted earnings per share that we would have reported if we had been
recognizing compensation cost associated with those options. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for this proforma disclosure. For purposes of this disclosure the fair value of these options was determined using a Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. This model considers dividend yield, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected life of the option and uses an equation to produce a fair value. For options issued on or after January 1, 2003, the fair
value of each option was estimated using a binomial option-pricing model. This model also considers dividend yield, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected life of the option but, unlike the Black-Scholes options pricing model, it
produces an estimated fair value based on the assumed changes in price of a financial instrument over successive periods of time. We selected the binomial option pricing model because, absent observable market prices, we believe it produces a fair
value that best reflects the substantive characteristics of the employee stock options we issue. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the assumptions used in valuing employee stock options issued in 2007, 2006, and 2005.

Excess Tax Benefits

An excess tax benefit is generated whenever the tax deduction associated
with share-based payment arrangements exceeds the related cumulative compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes. Excess tax benefits are included in additional paid-in capital in the period that the related tax deduction reduces
our taxes payable. If the tax deduction associated with share-based payment arrangements is less than the cumulative compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes, the unused portion of the deferred tax asset is first offset against
additional paid-in capital generated from past excess tax benefits then charged to tax expense. As of the date of adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we were required to determine the portion of our additional paid-in capital that was generated from
the realization of excess tax benefits prior to the date of adoption and is therefore available to offset deferred tax assets that may need to be written off in future periods had we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123
beginning in 2001. We chose to calculate this “pool” of additional paid-in capital using the alternative transition, or short cut, method provided for in FASB Staff Position FAS 123(R)-3, “Transition Election to Accounting for the Tax
Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards.” Under the short cut method, this “pool” of additional paid-in capital was calculated as the sum of all net increases of additional paid-in capital recognized in our financial statements related
to tax benefits from share-based payment transactions subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 123 but prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) less the cumulative incremental pre-tax compensation costs that would have been recognized if
SFAS No. 123 had been used to account for share-based payment transactions, tax effected at our statutory tax rate as of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).

Effect on Calculation of Diluted Earnings Per Share of Common Stock

In calculating the dilutive effect of share-based payment arrangements such
as stock options issued to employees, we apply the treasury stock method prescribed by SFAS No. 128, “Earnings Per Share.” In applying the treasury stock method to such arrangements we consider hypothetical excess tax benefits that
would be recognized assuming all employee options are exercised and shares issued to employees vest. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we can now only include in this calculation the hypothetical excess tax benefits that would
have resulted in a reduction of taxes payable in the current period. Prior to our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we considered hypothetical excess tax benefits in applying the treasury stock method if it was probable that the excess tax benefit
would be utilized for tax purposes prior to its expiration.

As
described above, we did not use the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended, for employee stock options issued prior to January 1, 2003. In applying the treasury stock method to these options,



prior to our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the hypothetical excess tax benefit from these options was calculated as the entire amount deductible on our
tax return. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we elected to continue to apply this calculation methodology for options issued to employees prior to January 1, 2003.

Consolidated Results of Operations

The following table summarizes net income for the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business for the
periods presented.



Results of Operations—Financial Services Businesses

2007 to 2006 Annual Comparison.

Income from
continuing operations attributable to the Financial Services Businesses increased $424 million, from $3.073 billion in 2006 to $3.497 billion in 2007. The increase reflects improved investment results, continued growth in our international
operations, the benefit of higher asset based fees, a greater contribution from the variable annuity business acquired from The Allstate Corporation, for which the prior year period includes results from only the June 1, 2006 date of
acquisition, as well as increased earnings from our retail brokerage joint venture with Wachovia, including the benefit of lower retained expenses in 2007. Partially offsetting these items were increased general and administrative expenses,
consistent with the growth in the business, and a lower level of net realized investment gains. On a diluted per share basis, income from continuing operations attributable to the Financial Services Businesses for the year ended December 31,
2007 of $7.58 per share of Common Stock increased from $6.36 per share of Common Stock for the year ended December 31, 2006. This increase reflects the increase in earnings discussed above and the benefit of a lower number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding due to our share repurchase program. We analyze the operating performance of the segments included in the Financial Services Businesses using “adjusted operating income” as described in “—Segment Measures,”
below. For a discussion of our segment results on this basis see “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment,” below. In addition, for a discussion of the realized investment gains (losses), net, attributable
to the Financial Services Businesses, see “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments—Realized Investment Gains,” below.

The direct equity adjustment increased income from continuing operations available to holders of the Common Stock for earnings per share purposes by $53
million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. As described more fully in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the direct equity adjustment modifies earnings
available to holders of the Common Stock and the Class B Stock for earnings per share purposes. The holders of the Common Stock will benefit from the direct equity adjustment as long as reported administrative expenses of the Closed Block Business
are less than the cash flows for administrative expenses determined by the policy servicing fee arrangement that is based upon insurance and policies in force and statutory cash premiums. As statutory cash premiums and policies in force in the
Closed Block Business decline, we expect the benefit to the Common Stock holders from the direct equity adjustment to decline accordingly. If the reported administrative expenses of the Closed Block Business exceed the cash flows for administrative
expenses determined by the policy servicing fee arrangement, the direct equity adjustment will reduce income available to holders of the Common Stock for earnings per share purposes.

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison.

Income from continuing operations attributable to the
Financial Services Businesses of $3.073 billion declined slightly from 2005. Continued growth of international insurance operations, improved investment results, higher asset based fees including the results of the business we acquired from Allstate
in 2006, and increased earnings from our investment in the retail brokerage joint venture with Wachovia were offset by a lower level of net realized investment gains and a higher level of general and administrative expenses consistent with the
growth in the businesses. The benefit of these items as compared to the prior year were more than offset by the benefit recognized in 2005 of $720 million from a reduction of tax liabilities in connection with the Internal Revenue Service
examination of our tax returns for the years 1997 through 2001. On a diluted per share basis, income from continuing operations attributable to the Financial Services Businesses for the year ended December 31, 2006 of $6.36 per share of Common
Stock declined from $6.48 per share of Common Stock for the year ended December 31, 2005. This decline reflects the decrease in earnings discussed above, partially offset by the benefit of a lower number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
due to our share repurchase program, the cost of which contributed to the decline in earnings discussed above.

The direct equity adjustment increased income from continuing operations available to holders of the Common Stock for earnings per share purposes by $68
million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $82 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Results of Operations—Closed Block Business

2007 to 2006 Annual Comparison.

Income from continuing operations attributable to the Closed
Block Business for the year ended December 31, 2007, was $190 million, or $68.50 per share of Class B stock,



compared to $284 million, or $108.00 per share of Class B Stock, for the year ended December 31, 2006. The direct equity adjustment
decreased income from continuing operations available to the Class B Stock holders for earnings per share purposes by $53 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. For a
discussion of the results of operations for the Closed Block Business, see “—Results of Operations of Closed Block Business,” below.

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison.

Income from continuing operations attributable to the Closed
Block Business for the year ended December 31, 2006, was $284 million, or $108.00 per share of Class B Stock, compared to $321 million, or $119.50 per share of Class B Stock, for the year ended December 31, 2005. The direct equity
adjustment decreased income from continuing operations available to the Class B Stock holders for earnings per share purposes by $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $82 million for the year ended December 31,
2005.

Segment Measures

In managing our business, we analyze operating performance separately for
our Financial Services Businesses and our Closed Block Business. For the Financial Services Businesses, we analyze our segments’ operating performance using “adjusted operating income.” Results of the Closed Block Business for all
periods are evaluated and presented only in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted operating income does not equate to “income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures” or “net
income” as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP but is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources, and consistent with SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information,” is our measure of segment performance. Adjusted operating income is calculated for the segments of the Financial Services Businesses by adjusting each segment’s “income from continuing operations
before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures” for the following items:

•

realized investment gains (losses), net, except as indicated below, and related charges and adjustments;

•

net investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities due to asset
value changes;

•

the contribution to income/loss of divested businesses that have been or will be sold or exited that do not qualify for “discontinued operations”
accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP; and

•

equity in earnings of operating joint ventures.

The items above are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income
determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies. However, we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes
enhances understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of the Financial Services Businesses. Adjusted operating income excludes “Realized investment gains
(losses), net,” except as indicated below, and related charges and adjustments. A significant element of realized investment gains and losses are impairments and credit-related and interest rate-related gains and losses. Impairments and losses
from sales of credit-impaired securities, the timing of which depends largely on market credit cycles, can vary considerably across periods. The timing of other sales that would result in gains or losses, such as interest rate-related gains or
losses, is largely subject to our discretion and influenced by market opportunities, as well as our tax profile. Trends in the underlying profitability of our businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of these
transactions. Similarly, adjusted operating income excludes investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes, because these
recorded changes in asset and liability values will ultimately accrue to the contractholders. Adjusted operating income excludes the results of divested businesses because they are not relevant to understanding our ongoing operating results. The
contributions to income/loss of wind-down businesses that we have not divested remain in adjusted operating income. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the presentation of segment results.

As noted above, certain “Realized investment gains (losses), net,”
are included in adjusted operating income. We include in adjusted operating income the portion of our realized investment gains and losses on



derivatives that arise from the termination of contracts used to hedge our foreign currency earnings in the same period that the expected earnings emerge.
Similarly, we include in adjusted operating income the portion of our realized investment gains and losses on derivatives that represent current period yield adjustments. The realized investment gains or losses from products that are free standing
derivatives, or contain embedded derivatives, along with the realized investment gains or losses from associated derivative portfolios that are part of an economic hedging program related to the risk of these products, are included in adjusted
operating income. Adjusted operating income also includes for certain embedded derivatives, as current period yield adjustments, a portion of the cumulative realized investment gains above the original fair value, on an amortized basis over the
remaining life of the related security, or cumulative realized investment losses, and recoveries of such losses, in the period incurred. Adjusted operating income also includes those realized investment gains and losses that represent profit or loss
of certain of our businesses which primarily originate investments for sale or syndication to unrelated investors.

Individual Life

Operating Results

The following table sets
forth the Individual Life segment’s operating results for the periods indicated.

(1)

Revenues exclude Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments. See “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments—Realized Investment
Gains.”

Adjusted Operating Income

2007 to 2006 Annual
Comparison.

Adjusted operating income increased $70 million, from $544 million in 2006 to $614 million in 2007. Adjusted operating income for 2007 includes a $78 million benefit from a net reduction in amortization of
deferred policy acquisition costs and other costs due to an increased estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs and unearned revenue reserves, based on an annual review, primarily reflecting
improved future mortality expectations, compared to a $46 million benefit from the annual review in 2006. Results for 2007 also include a $57 million benefit from compensation received based on multi-year profitability of third-party products we
distribute while 2006 included a $25 million benefit for this item. Absent the effect of these items, adjusted operating income for 2007 increased $6 million from the prior year, reflecting higher fees resulting primarily from higher asset balances
as a result of market value changes and higher margins from growth in term and universal life insurance in force. Mortality experience, net of reinsurance, was slightly more favorable compared to 2006.

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted
operating income increased $46 million, from $498 million in 2005 to $544 million in 2006. Adjusted operating income for 2006 includes a $46 million benefit from a net reduction in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and other costs.
The net reduction in amortization and other costs was due to an increased estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs and unearned revenue reserves, based on an annual review, primarily reflecting
improved



mortality and lower maintenance expenses, partially offset by refinements in other reserves. Results for 2006 also improved $20 million from the prior year,
as 2006 includes a $25 million benefit and the prior year included a $5 million benefit from compensation received based on multi-year profitability of third-party products we distribute. The benefit of these items to 2006 results, together with
higher fees resulting from higher asset balances reflecting market value changes and increased net investment income, net of interest credited and interest expense, primarily reflecting higher yields in 2006, were partially offset by less favorable
mortality experience, net of reinsurance, compared to the prior year.

Revenues

2007 to 2006 Annual
Comparison.

Revenues, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased by $378 million, from $2.216 billion in 2006 to $2.594 billion in 2007. Policy charges and fee income increased $120
million, including $102 million due to the effects of updates in both periods of our assumptions related to the amortization of unearned revenue reserves based on the annual reviews discussed above. Absent this item, policy charges and fee income
increased $18 million reflecting growth in our universal life insurance in force. Asset management fees and other income increased $46 million, including a $32 million increase in compensation received based on multi-year profitability of
third-party products we distribute, as discussed above, as well as higher asset based fees due to higher asset balances reflecting market value changes. Premiums increased $104 million, primarily due to increased premiums on term life insurance
reflecting continued growth of our in force block of term insurance. Net investment income increased $108 million, reflecting higher asset balances primarily from the financing of statutory capital activity for certain term and universal life
insurance policies and higher yields in 2007.

2006 to 2005
Annual Comparison.

Revenues decreased $46 million, from $2.262 billion in 2005 to $2.216 billion in 2006. Policy charges and fee income decreased $175 million, including $190 million due to the update of our assumptions
related to amortization of unearned revenue reserves based on the annual review discussed above, amounting to a $147 million reduction in 2006, and a similar update in 2005 resulting in a $43 million increase that was more than offset by an increase
in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and a decrease in change in reserves. Absent this item, policy charges and fee income increased $15 million. Premiums increased $38 million, primarily due to increased premiums on term life
insurance reflecting continued growth of our in force block of term insurance products. Net investment income increased $52 million, reflecting higher assets and higher yields in 2006, which included the benefit from the sale of lower yielding bonds
and reinvestment of proceeds at higher interest rates. The realized investment losses generated from these sales are excluded from adjusted operating income. For a discussion of realized investment gains and losses, including those related to
changes in interest rates, see “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—Realized Investment Gains.” This increase was partially offset by the collection of investment income on a previously defaulted
bond in 2005. Asset management fees and other income increased $39 million, including the benefit to adjusted operating income from compensation received based on multi-year profitability of third-party products we distribute as discussed above. The
remainder of the increase reflects higher asset based fees due to higher asset balances from market appreciation.

Benefits and Expenses

2007 to 2006 Annual Comparison.

Benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under “—Operating
Results,” increased $308 million, from $1.672 billion in 2006 to $1.980 billion in 2007. Absent the impacts of the annual reviews conducted in both 2007 and 2006 discussed above, benefits and expenses increased $238 million, from $1.865 billion
in 2006 to $2.103 billion in 2007. On this basis, policyholders’ benefits, including interest credited to policyholders’ account balances, increased $137 million, reflecting higher claims payments and increases in reserves on term life
insurance associated with growth in our in force block of term insurance compared to 2006. Also on this basis, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased $8 million, reflecting less favorable separate account fund performance
partially offset by more favorable policy persistency compared to 2006. Interest expense increased $83 million, primarily reflecting interest on borrowings related to the financing of statutory capital activity for certain term and universal life
insurance policies.

2006 to 2005 Annual
Comparison.

Benefits and expenses decreased $92 million, from $1.764 billion in 2005 to $1.672 billion in 2006. Absent the impacts of the annual reviews conducted in both 2006 and 2005, as discussed above, benefits and
expenses increased $158 million, from $1.707 billion in 2005 to $1.865 billion in



2006. On this basis, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased $11 million. Also on this basis, policyholders’ benefits, including
interest credited to policyholders’ account balances, increased $129 million, reflecting methodology refinements to certain reserves, growth in our in force block of term insurance products, as well as less favorable mortality experience
compared to the prior year.

Sales Results

The following table sets forth individual life insurance business sales,
as measured by scheduled premiums from new sales on an annualized basis and first year excess premiums and deposits on a cash-received basis, for the periods indicated. Sales of the individual life insurance business do not correspond to revenues
under U.S. GAAP. They are, however, a relevant measure of business activity. In managing our individual life insurance business, we analyze new sales on this basis because it measures the current sales performance of the business, while revenues
primarily reflect the renewal persistency and aging of in force policies written in prior years and net investment income as well as current sales.

(1)

Scheduled premiums from new sales on an annualized basis and first year excess premiums and deposits on a cash-received basis.

2007 to 2006 Annual Comparison

.    Sales of new
life insurance, excluding corporate-owned life insurance, measured as described above, increased $64 million, from $430 million in 2006 to $494 million in 2007. Sales of term life products increased $64 million. Sales of variable life products
increased $16 million, which included the benefit of several large case sales in 2007. Sales of universal life products decreased $16 million.

The increase in sales of life insurance, excluding corporate-owned life insurance, was driven by a $71 million increase in sales from the third party
distribution channel, primarily in term life and variable life products, with universal life sales slightly lower than the prior year due to a higher level of large universal life cases placed in 2006. Sales by Prudential Agents of $174 million in
2007 were $7 million lower than the prior year, reflecting a large case placed in 2006 and a decline in the number of agents from 2,562 at December 31, 2006 to 2,425 at December 31, 2007.

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison

.    Sales of new
life insurance, excluding corporate-owned life insurance, measured as described above, increased $11 million, from $419 million in 2005 to $430 million in 2006. Sales of our term life and variable life products increased $33 million. This increase
was partially offset by decreased sales of our universal life products.

Sales of life insurance, excluding corporate-owned life insurance, from the third party distribution channel increased $42 million, reflecting increased term and variable life sales, with universal life sales remaining unchanged, as both
periods benefited from a large level of universal life sales. Sales of life insurance by Prudential Agents decreased $31 million, reflecting a decline in the number of agents from 2,946 at December 31, 2005 to 2,562 at December 31, 2006,
which impacted all life insurance product lines. In 2006, for the first time, more than half of our individual life insurance sales were generated through third party channels.



Policy Surrender Experience

The following table sets forth the individual life insurance business’ policy surrender experience for variable and
universal life insurance, measured by cash value of surrenders, for the periods indicated. These amounts do not correspond to expenses under U.S. GAAP. In managing this business, we analyze the cash value of surrenders because it is a measure of the
degree to which policyholders are maintaining their in force business with us, a driver of future profitability. Our term life insurance products do not provide for cash surrender values.

2007 to 2006 Annual
Comparison.

The total cash value of surrenders increased $8 million, from $744 million in 2006 to $752 million in 2007, reflecting a greater volume of surrenders of variable life insurance in 2007 compared to the prior
year. The level of surrenders as a percentage of mean future policy benefit reserves, policyholders’ account balances and separate account balances remained essentially flat.

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison.

The total cash value of surrenders increased $46 million, from
$698 million in 2005 to $744 million in 2006, reflecting an increase in surrenders of variable corporate-owned life insurance in 2006 compared to the prior year. The level of surrenders as a percentage of mean future policy benefit reserves,
policyholders’ account balances and separate account balances remained flat.

Individual Annuities

Operating
Results

The following table sets forth the Individual
Annuities segment’s operating results for the periods indicated.

(1)

Revenues exclude Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related charges and adjustments. The related charges represent payments related to the market value adjustment features
of certain of our annuity products. See “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments—Realized Investment Gains.”

(2)

Benefits and expenses exclude related charges which represent the unfavorable (favorable) impact of Realized investment gains (losses), net, on change in reserves and the
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements and value of business acquired.

On June 1, 2006, we acquired the variable annuity business of The Allstate Corporation, or Allstate, through a reinsurance transaction for $635
million of total consideration, consisting primarily of a $628 million ceding commission. Our initial investment in the business was approximately $600 million, consisting of the total consideration, offset by the related tax benefits and an
additional contribution of $94 million to meet regulatory capital requirements. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this acquisition.



Adjusted Operating Income

2007 to 2006 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income increased $130 million, from $586
million in 2006 to $716 million in 2007. Results for both periods include the impact of annual reviews of our estimate of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs and the reserve for the
guaranteed minimum death and income benefit features of our variable annuity products. Adjusted operating income for 2007 included a $30 million benefit from this annual review, reflecting market value increases in the underlying assets associated
with our variable annuity products, and decreased cost of actual and expected death claims, partially offset by the impact of model refinements and higher expected lapse rates for the variable annuity business acquired from Allstate. Adjusted
operating income for 2006 included a $37 million benefit from the annual review, primarily reflecting improved net interest spread from increased investment yields.

Absent the effect of the annual reviews discussed above, adjusted operating income for 2007 increased $137 million from
2006. Adjusted operating income from the variable annuity business acquired from Allstate, excluding the impact of the annual review discussed above, increased $27 million, reflecting a $81 million contribution for 2007, compared to $54 million for
2006, which reflects results only for the initial seven months of operations from the date of acquisition. The remainder of the increase came primarily from higher fee income driven by higher average asset balances from market appreciation and
positive net asset flows in our variable annuity account values. Also contributing to the increase was a $17 million favorable variance in the mark-to-market of embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with our living benefit
features, net of amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs. Partially offsetting these items was an increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition and other costs reflecting increased gross profits in 2007, and an increase
in general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, reflecting higher distribution and asset management costs associated with growth in variable annuity account values, as well as growth of the business. In addition, interest expense
increased driven by higher borrowings related to growth of the business, and net investment income, net of interest credited to policyholders’ account balances, decreased primarily as a result of declining annuity account values invested in our
general account, reflecting our emphasis on sales of variable annuities together with asset allocation requirements associated with the living benefit features we offer in our variable annuity products.

The contribution of the acquired Allstate business to adjusted operating
income for 2007, excluding the impact of the annual review discussed above, consists of revenues of $383 million and benefits and expenses of $302 million. Revenues from the acquired business consisted primarily of policy charges and fees of $254
million, net investment income of $70 million and asset management fees and other income of $54 million. Benefits and expenses from this business, excluding the impact of the annual review discussed above, consisted primarily of general and
administrative expenses, net of capitalization, of $204 million and policyholders’ benefits, including interest credited to policyholders’ account balances, of $93 million.

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income increased $81 million, from $505
million in 2005 to $586 million in 2006. Adjusted operating income for 2006 included a $37 million benefit from an annual review, as discussed above. Adjusted operating income for 2005 included a net $87 million benefit from an annual review,
reflecting improved net interest spread from increased yields, decreased costs of actual and expected death claims and modeling refinements implemented. Absent the effect of these items, adjusted operating income for 2006 increased $131 million from
the prior year, including a $54 million contribution in 2006 from the variable annuity business acquired from Allstate. The remainder of the $131 million increase came primarily from higher fee income driven by higher average asset balances from
market appreciation and net flows in our variable annuity account values. Partially offsetting these items was an increase in distribution costs charged to expense associated with increased variable annuity sales and account values and increased
general expenses related to expansion initiatives. In addition, results for 2005 benefited $6 million, net of related amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, from the collection of investment income on a previously defaulted bond.

The contribution of the acquired Allstate business to adjusted
operating income for 2006 consists of revenues of $221 million and benefits and expenses of $167 million. Allstate’s revenues consisted primarily of policy charges and fees of $143 million, net investment income of $46 million and asset
management fees and other income of $28 million. Benefits and expenses consisted primarily of general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, of $107 million and policyholders’ benefits, including interest credited to
policyholders’ account balances, of $59 million.



Revenues

2007 to 2006 Annual Comparison.

Revenues, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,”
increased $394 million, from $2.101 billion in 2006 to $2.495 billion in 2007, including increased revenues of $162 million related to the variable annuity business acquired from Allstate. The remainder of the increase in revenues came primarily
from a $306 million increase in policy charges and fees and asset management fees and other income reflecting an increase in variable annuity account values driven by changes in average market value and positive net flows. Included in the increase
in asset management fees and other income is a $37 million favorable variance in the mark-to-market of embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with our living benefit features. Partially offsetting these items was a $62 million
decrease in net investment income, excluding the impact from the business acquired from Allstate, primarily as a result of declining annuity account values invested in our general account, as discussed above.

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison.

Revenues
increased $384 million, from $1.717 billion in 2005 to $2.101 billion in 2006, including revenues of $221 million from the Allstate business acquired during the second quarter of 2006. The remainder of the increase in revenues, $163 million, came
primarily from increases of $131 million in policy charges and fees and $65 million in asset management fees and other income, which includes $9 million from the mark-to-market of embedded derivatives and related hedge positions associated with our
living benefits features. These increases were partially offset by a $43 million decrease in net investment income. The increase in policy charges and fees reflects an increase in the average market value of variable annuity account values and
positive net flows in our variable annuities, including an increase in account values with living benefit options. The increase in asset management fees and other income was primarily due to an increase in asset based fees driven by an increase in
the average market value of variable annuity customer accounts and positive net flows of our variable annuities. The decrease in net investment income came primarily from the impact of a shift in customer funds from fixed income investments to
variable investments. In addition, net investment income for 2005 included the collection of investment income on a previously defaulted bond as indicated above. These decreases were partially offset by higher yields in 2006 which benefited from the
sale of lower yielding bonds and reinvestment of proceeds at higher available interest rates. The realized investment losses generated from these sales are excluded from adjusted operating income. For a discussion of realized investment gains and
losses, including those related to changes in interest rates, see “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—Realized Investment Gains.”

Benefits and Expenses

2007 to 2006 Annual Comparison.

Benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under “—Operating
Results,” increased $264 million, from $1.515 billion in 2006 to $1.779 billion in 2007. Excluding the impact of the annual reviews discussed above and increased benefits and expenses of $135 million related to the variable annuity business
acquired from Allstate, benefits and expenses increased $122 million from 2006 to 2007. Contributing to this increase is a $88 million increase in general and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, due to higher distribution and asset
management costs associated with growth in variable annuity account values, and growth of the business. Also contributing to this increase was a $56 million increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs reflecting increased gross
profits in the current period. In addition, interest expense increased $9 million, driven by higher borrowings related to growth of the business. Partially offsetting these items was an $31 million reduction in policyholders’ benefits,
including interest credited to policyholders’ account balances, primarily reflecting a decrease in interest credited to policyholders resulting from declining annuity account values invested in our general account, as discussed above.

2006 to 2005 Annual
Comparison.

Benefits and expenses increased $303 million, from $1.212 billion in 2005 to $1.515 billion in 2006. Excluding the impact of the annual reviews discussed above and benefits and expenses of $167 million from the
Allstate business acquired during the second quarter of 2006, benefits and expenses increased $86 million. This increase primarily relates to a $75 million increase in general and administrative expenses reflecting increased distribution costs
charged to expense associated with increased variable annuity account value and sales, increased expenses related to expansion initiatives and growth of the business, and increased asset management costs associated with the growth in variable
annuity account values. Also contributing to this increase was a $9 million increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs reflecting increased gross profits in 2006. Partially offsetting these items was a $17 million reduction in



policyholders’ benefits, including interest credited to policyholders’ account balances, reflecting lower costs of our guaranteed benefits in 2006,
resulting from reduction in our net amount at risk.

Account
Values

The following table sets forth changes in account
values for the individual annuity business, for the periods indicated. For our individual annuity business, assets are reported at account value, and net sales (redemptions) are gross sales minus redemptions or surrenders and withdrawals, as
applicable.

(1)

Variable annuities include only those sold as retail investment products. Investments through defined contribution plan products are included with such products within the
Retirement segment.

(2)

As of December 31, 2007, variable annuity account values are invested in equity funds ($39 billion or 49%), balanced funds ($22 billion or 27%), bond funds ($8 billion or 10%),
and other ($11 billion or 14%). Variable annuity account values with living benefit features were $37.1 billion, $28.4 billion, and $14.0 billion as of December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information regarding the net amount at risk related to our variable annuity benefit features.

2007 to 2006 Annual Comparison.

Total account values for fixed and variable annuities amounted to $83.8 billion as of
December 31, 2007, an increase of $5.5 billion from December 31, 2006. The increase came primarily from increases in the market value of customers’ variable annuities and positive variable annuity net flows. Individual variable
annuity gross sales increased by $2.1 billion, from $9.6 billion in 2006 to $11.7 billion in 2007, reflecting increased sales of $838 million related to the business acquired from Allstate, increased sales from our optional living benefit product
features, and growth of our distribution relationships. Individual variable annuity surrenders and withdrawals increased by $1.9 billion, from $7.7 billion in 2006 to $9.6 billion in 2007, including increased surrenders and withdrawals of $1.1
billion related to the business acquired from Allstate, as well as the impact of higher average account values due to market appreciation.

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison.

Total account values for fixed and variable annuities amounted to $78.3 billion as of
December 31, 2006, an increase of $23.5 billion from December 31, 2005, primarily reflecting $16.3 billion of variable annuity account values acquired from Allstate, as well as increases in the market value



of customers’ variable annuities and variable annuity net flows. Individual variable annuity gross sales increased by $2.5 billion, from $7.1 billion in
2005 to $9.6 billion in 2006, reflecting increased sales which benefited from the popularity of our optional living benefit product features, particularly guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit programs introduced in 2005 and 2006, growth of our
distribution relationships, including those associated with the business acquired from Allstate, our retirement marketing strategy and sales of $1.0 billion related to the business acquired from Allstate. Individual variable annuity surrenders and
withdrawals increased by $2.0 billion, from $5.7 billion in 2005 to $7.7 billion in 2006, including $1.4 billion of surrenders and withdrawals in the current year related to the business acquired from Allstate.

Group Insurance

Operating Results

The following table sets forth the Group Insurance segment’s operating results for the periods indicated.

(1)

Revenues exclude Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments. See “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments—Realized Investment
Gains.”

(2)

Benefits and expenses exclude related charges which represent the unfavorable (favorable) impact of Realized investment gains (losses), net, on interest credited to
policyholders’ account balances.

Adjusted Operating Income

2007 to 2006
Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income increased $50 million, from $229 million in 2006 to $279 million in 2007, primarily reflecting more favorable claims experience in our group life business and, to a lesser
extent, growth in our group disability business. The increase in adjusted operating income was partially offset by higher operating expenses in 2007 and a lower benefit in 2007 compared with 2006 from refinements in reserves as a result of annual
reviews. The increase in operating expenses is due to growth in the disability business and increased compensation and benefit costs in 2007, and was partially offset by higher costs incurred in 2006 related to legal and regulatory matters. The
annual reviews discussed above benefited 2007 $13 million, primarily associated with our long-term disability products, while benefiting 2006 $19 million, primarily associated with our long-term care products.

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted
operating income increased $5 million, from $224 million in 2005 to $229 million in 2006. This increase primarily reflects more favorable claims experience in our group disability business and, to a lesser extent, a greater benefit from refinements
in group disability reserves as a result of annual reviews. These reserve refinements benefited 2006 $19 million, primarily associated with our long-term care products, while benefiting 2005 $8 million. In addition, adjusted operating income in 2006
benefited from an increased contribution from investment results, primarily reflecting growth in invested assets and higher interest rates on shorter-term investments. Less favorable claims experience in our group life business and higher expenses,
including higher costs in 2006 related to legal and regulatory matters, largely offset these increases.



Revenues

2007 to 2006 Annual Comparison.

Revenues, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,”
increased by $237 million, from $4.555 billion in 2006 to $4.792 billion in 2007. Group life premiums increased by $37 million, from $2.795 billion in 2006 to $2.832 billion in 2007, primarily reflecting increased premiums on experience-rated group
life business resulting from the increase in policyholder benefits on these contracts as discussed below. Group life persistency remained strong, but deteriorated slightly from 95% in 2006 to 94% in 2007. Group disability premiums, which include
long-term care products, increased by $86 million from $761 million in 2006 to $847 million in 2007, primarily reflecting growth in business in force resulting from new sales and persistency which remained strong, but deteriorated from 90% in
2006 to 88% in 2007. The declines in group life and group disability persistency are reflective of highly competitive pricing in the marketplace and the pricing discipline we apply in writing business. Policy charges and fee income also increased by
$59 million primarily reflecting growth of business in force. In addition, net investment income increased $50 million primarily reflecting a larger base of invested assets due to business growth.

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison.

Revenues
increased $355 million, from $4.200 billion in 2005 to $4.555 billion in 2006. Group life premiums increased $249 million, from $2.546 billion in 2005 to $2.795 billion in 2006, primarily reflecting growth in business in force resulting from new
sales and continued strong persistency, which remain unchanged at 95% for both years. Group disability premiums, which include long-term care products, increased $37 million, from $724 million in 2005 to $761 million in 2006, primarily reflecting
growth in business in force resulting from new sales and continued strong persistency, which improved from 85% in 2005 to 90% in 2006. Net investment income also increased $30 million primarily reflecting a larger base of invested assets due to
business growth, as well as higher interest rates on shorter-term investments.

Benefits and Expenses

The following table sets forth the Group Insurance segment’s benefits and administrative operating expense ratios for the periods indicated.

(1)

Ratio of policyholder benefits to earned premiums, policy charges and fee income. Group disability ratios include long-term care products.

(2)

Ratio of administrative operating expenses (excluding commissions) to gross premiums, policy charges and fee income. Group disability ratios include long-term care products.

2007 to 2006 Annual
Comparison.

Benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased by $187 million, from $4.326 billion in 2006 to $4.513 billion in 2007. The increase was driven by an
increase of $126 million in policyholders’ benefits, including the change in policy reserves, reflecting growth of business in force in our group disability business, the lower benefit in 2007 of the group disability reserve refinements
discussed above, and greater benefits on experience-rated group life business which, as discussed above, resulted in increased premiums. In addition, interest credited to policyholder account balances increased $36 million primarily due to an
increase in policyholder account balances as a result of growth in the business. Also contributing to the increase in benefits and expenses were higher operating expenses reflecting growth in the disability business and increased compensation and
benefit costs, partially offset by lower costs related to legal and regulatory matters.

The group life benefits ratio improved 1.4 percentage points from 2006 to 2007, reflecting more favorable mortality experience in our group life business. The group disability benefits ratio deteriorated 1.1
percentage points from 2006 to 2007. Excluding the effect of the reserve refinements discussed above, the group disability



benefits ratio was relatively unchanged. Both the group life and group disability administrative operating expense ratios improved slightly from 2006 to
2007, reflecting lower costs related to legal and regulatory matters. Excluding these costs, the administrative operating expense ratios for both group life and group disability were relatively flat.

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison.

Benefits and
expenses increased $350 million, from $3.976 billion in 2005 to $4.326 billion in 2006. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of $283 million in policyholders’ benefits, including the change in policy reserves, reflecting the growth
of business in force and less favorable claims experience in our group life business, partially offset by more favorable claims experience in our group disability business. Also contributing to the increase in benefits and expenses were higher
operating expenses primarily reflecting growth in the business, as well as higher costs in 2006 related to legal and regulatory matters.

The group life benefits ratio deteriorated 2.9 percentage points from 2005 to 2006, reflecting less favorable claims experience in our group life
business. The group disability benefits ratio improved by 9.9 percentage points from 2005 to 2006, due to more favorable claims experience in our group disability business, and to a lesser extent, the benefit from the reserve refinements discussed
above. Both the group life and group disability administrative operating expense ratios deteriorated from 2005 to 2006, as a result of the higher costs in 2006 related to legal and regulatory matters.

Sales Results

The following table sets forth the Group Insurance segment’s new
annualized premiums for the periods indicated. In managing our group insurance business, we analyze new annualized premiums, which do not correspond to revenues under U.S. GAAP, because new annualized premiums measure the current sales performance
of the business unit, while revenues primarily reflect the renewal persistency and aging of in force policies written in prior years and net investment income, in addition to current sales.

(1)

Amounts exclude new premiums resulting from rate changes on existing policies, from additional coverage under our Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance contract and from excess
premiums on group universal life insurance that build cash value but do not purchase face amounts, and include premiums from the takeover of claim liabilities.

(2)

Includes long-term care products.

2007 to 2006 Annual Comparison.

Total new annualized premiums decreased $152 million, or 30%, from $504 million in 2006 to
$352 million in 2007. This decrease is primarily due to lower large case sales in the group life business during 2007, reflective of highly competitive pricing in the marketplace and the pricing discipline we apply in writing business. Partially
offsetting this decrease were higher large case and middle-market sales in the group disability business during 2007.

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison.

Total new annualized premiums decreased $20 million, from $524 million in 2005 to $504
million in 2006. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales in our group disability business, as 2005 reflects higher premiums relating to our assumption of existing liabilities from a third party. Group life sales were relatively
unchanged, as a significant large case sale in the first quarter of 2005 was offset by several large case sales during 2006.



Investment Division

Asset Management

Operating Results

The following table sets forth the Asset Management segment’s operating results for the periods indicated.

(1)

Revenues exclude Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments. See “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments—Realized Investment
Gains.”

Adjusted Operating Income

2007 to 2006 Annual
Comparison.

Adjusted operating income increased $45 million, from $593 million in 2006 to $638 million in 2007. Results for 2007 benefited from an increase in asset management fees of $107 million, primarily from
institutional and retail customer assets as a result of increased asset values due to market appreciation and net asset flows. Adjusted operating income also benefited from increased transaction fees primarily from real estate investment management
activities and increased revenues from the segment’s proprietary investing business. Less favorable results from the segment’s commercial mortgage securitization operations, which resulted in pretax losses of $62 million in 2007 compared
to a contribution to adjusted operating income of $45 million in 2006, as well as higher expenses, including performance-related compensation costs, was a partial offset. The losses in the segment’s commercial mortgage securitization operations
in 2007 resulted primarily from unfavorable credit market conditions during the second half of the year, which resulted in decreases in value of positions held and losses on securitizations due to increased credit spreads. As of December 31,
2007, our commercial mortgage operations held $542 million in loans and $188 million in applications and commitments as inventory for future securitizations, in addition to $792 million of bonds it retained from 2007 securitizations. Net of the
derivatives purchased as hedges, about $750 million of these positions continue to be subject to changes in credit spreads.

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income increased $129 million, from $464 million in 2005 to $593 million
in 2006. Results for 2006 benefited from an increase in performance based incentive fees of $61 million associated with appreciation and gains on sale of real estate investments which we manage, and from income from our proprietary investing
business, also associated with appreciation and gains on sale of real estate related investments, including $23 million relating to a single investment in 2006. Proprietary investing income in 2005 included $58 million relating to two sale
transactions. Results for 2006 benefited from increased asset management fees of $88 million, primarily from institutional and retail customer assets as a result of increased asset values due to market appreciation and net asset inflows. Higher
expenses, including performance-related compensation costs, partially offset the foregoing increases.

Revenues

The following tables set forth the Asset Management segment’s revenues, presented on a basis consistent with the table above under
“—Operating Results,” by type, asset management fees by source and assets under management for the periods indicated. In managing our business we analyze assets under management, which do



not correspond to U.S. GAAP assets, because a principal source of our revenues are fees based on assets under management.

(1)

Includes revenues under a contractual arrangement with Wachovia Securities, related to managed account services, which was originally scheduled to expire on July 1, 2006. This
contract was amended effective July 1, 2005 to provide essentially a fixed fee for managed account services and is now scheduled to expire on July 1, 2008. Revenues in 2007 include $40 million for these managed account services. Also
includes payments from Wachovia Corporation under an agreement dated as of July 30, 2004 implementing arrangements with respect to money market mutual funds in connection with the combination of our retail securities brokerage and clearing
operations with those of Wachovia Corporation. The agreement extends for ten years after termination of the joint venture. The revenue from Wachovia Corporation under this agreement was $51 million in 2007, $51 million in 2006 and $54 million in
2005.

(1)

Consists of individual mutual funds and both variable annuities and variable life insurance asset management revenues from our separate accounts. This also includes funds invested
in proprietary mutual funds through our defined contribution plan products. Revenues from fixed annuities and the fixed rate options of both variable annuities and variable life insurance are included in the general account.

(1)

Consists of third party institutional assets and group insurance contracts.

(2)

Consists of individual mutual funds and both variable annuities and variable life insurance assets in our separate accounts. This also includes funds invested in proprietary mutual
funds through our defined contribution plan products. Fixed annuities and the fixed rate options of both variable annuities and variable life insurance are included in the general account.

2007 to 2006 Annual Comparison.

Revenues, as
shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased $215 million, from $2.050 billion in 2006 to $2.265 billion in 2007. Asset management fees increased $107 million, primarily from the management of institutional and
retail customer assets as a result of increased asset values due to market appreciation and net asset flows. Service, distribution and other revenues increased $183 million primarily due to increased revenues in certain real estate funds, which is
fully offset by higher expenses related to minority interest in these funds. Revenues from incentive, transaction, principal investing and capital markets revenues decreased $75 million primarily reflecting a decline in revenues from our commercial
mortgage operations and performance based incentive fees, partially offset by greater transaction fees primarily from real estate investment management activities and increased revenues from the segment’s proprietary investing business. The
decrease in performance based incentive fees resulted from a higher level of gains in



2006 on sale of real estate related investments we manage. Certain of our incentive fees are subject to positive or negative future adjustment based
on cumulative fund performance in relation to specified benchmarks. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $90 million of cumulative incentive fee revenue, net of compensation, is subject to future adjustment.

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison.

Revenues
increased $354 million, from $1.696 billion in 2005 to $2.050 billion in 2006. Incentive, transaction, principal investing and capital markets revenues increased $236 million, including a $155 million increase in performance based incentive fees
primarily related to appreciation and gains on sale of real estate related investments which we manage, for which $92 million of the fees are offset in incentive compensation expense in accordance with the terms of the contractual agreements.
Certain of these incentive fees are subject to positive or negative future adjustment based on cumulative fund performance in relation to specified benchmarks. The increase also reflects $68 million greater revenues from proprietary investing mainly
due to appreciation and gains on sale of real estate related investments, including income of $12 million relating to a single investment in the current period and $58 million relating to two sale transactions in the prior year. Asset management
fees increased $88 million mainly from institutional and retail customer assets as a result of increased asset values due to market appreciation and net asset flows.

Expenses

2007 to 2006 Annual Comparison.

Expenses, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased
$170 million, from $1.457 billion in 2006 to $1.627 billion in 2007. The increase is primarily driven by higher expenses associated with certain real estate funds, as discussed above.

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison.

Expenses
increased $225 million, from $1.232 billion in 2005 to $1.457 billion in 2006. The increase in expenses was primarily due to higher performance-based compensation costs resulting from favorable performance in 2006, higher expenses related to
proprietary investing activities and incentive compensation related to performance based incentive fees, as discussed above.

Financial Advisory

Operating Results

The following table sets forth the Financial Advisory segment’s
operating results for the periods indicated.

(1)

Equity in earnings of operating joint ventures are included in adjusted operating income but excluded from income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in
earnings of operating joint ventures, as they are reflected on a U.S. GAAP basis on an after-tax basis as a separate line on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

On July 1, 2003, we combined our retail securities brokerage and clearing operations with those of Wachovia
Corporation, or Wachovia, and formed Wachovia Securities Financial Holdings, LLC, or Wachovia Securities, a joint venture now headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri. As of December 31, 2007, we had a 38% ownership interest in the joint venture,
with Wachovia owning the remaining 62%. As part of the transaction, we retained certain assets and liabilities related to the contributed businesses, including liabilities for certain litigation and regulatory matters. We account for our ownership
of the joint venture under the equity method of accounting.



On October 1, 2007, Wachovia completed the acquisition of A.G. Edwards, Inc., or A.G. Edwards, for
$6.8 billion and on January 1, 2008 combined the retail securities brokerage business of A.G. Edwards with Wachovia Securities. As discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have elected the “lookback” option
under the terms of the agreements relating to the joint venture in connection with the combination of the A.G. Edwards business with Wachovia Securities. The “lookback” option permits us to delay for approximately two years following the
combination of the A.G. Edwards business with Wachovia Securities our decision to make or not to make payments to avoid or limit dilution of our ownership interest in the joint venture. During this “lookback” period, our share in the
earnings of the joint venture, as well as our share of the one-time costs associated with the combination, will be based on our diluted ownership level, which is in the process of being determined. Any payment at the end of the “lookback”
period to restore all or part of our ownership interest in the joint venture would be based on the appraised or agreed value of the existing joint venture and the A.G. Edwards business. In such event, we would also need to make a true-up payment of
one-time costs associated with the combination to reflect the incremental increase in our ownership interest in the joint venture. Alternatively, we may at the end of the “lookback” period “put” our joint venture interests to
Wachovia based on the appraised value of the joint venture, excluding the A.G. Edwards business, as of the date of the combination of the A.G. Edwards business with Wachovia Securities.

We also retain our separate right to “put” our joint venture interests to Wachovia at any time after July 1,
2008 based on the appraised value of the joint venture, including the A.G. Edwards business, determined as if it were a public company and including a control premium such as would apply in the case of a sale of 100% of its common equity. However,
if in connection with the “lookback” option we elect at the end of the “lookback” period to make payments to avoid or limit dilution, we may not exercise this “put” option prior to the first anniversary of the end of
the “lookback” period.

On June 6, 2007, we
announced our decision to exit the equity sales, trading and research operations of the Prudential Equity Group, or PEG, the results of which were historically included in the Financial Advisory segment. As discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, PEG’s operations were substantially wound down by June 30, 2007 and the results of PEG are excluded from the results of the Financial Advisory segment and reflected in discontinued operations for all periods
presented.

2007 to 2006 Annual
Comparison.

Adjusted operating income increased $270 million, from $27 million in 2006 to $297 million in 2007. The segment’s results for 2007 include our share of earnings from Wachovia Securities, on a pre-tax
basis, of $370 million, compared to $294 million in 2006, reflecting increased income from fees and commissions, including a greater contribution from equity syndication activity, of the joint venture. The segment’s results also include
expenses of $73 million in 2007 related to obligations and costs we retained in connection with the contributed businesses, primarily for litigation and regulatory matters, compared to $267 million in 2006. These expenses, in 2006, reflected an
increase in our reserve for settlement costs related to market timing issues involving the former Prudential Securities operations, with respect to which a settlement was reached in August 2006.

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted
operating income increased $282 million, from a loss of $255 million in 2005 to income of $27 million in 2006. The segment’s results for 2006 include our share of earnings from Wachovia Securities, on a pre-tax basis, of $294 million, compared
to $217 million in 2005 before transition costs, reflecting increased fee income of the joint venture. The segment’s results also include expenses of $267 million in 2006 related to obligations and costs we retained in connection with the
contributed businesses primarily for litigation and regulatory matters, compared to $452 million during 2005. Expenses in 2006 and 2005 reflected increases in our reserve for settlement costs related to market timing issues involving the former
Prudential Securities operations, with respect to which the Company announced that a settlement was reached in August 2006. There are no transition costs in 2006 as the business integration was completed during the first half of 2005. Transition
costs were $20 million in 2005.



Retirement

Operating Results

The following table sets forth the Retirement segment’s operating results for the periods indicated.

(1)

Revenues exclude Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments. See “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments—Realized Investment
Gains.”

(2)

Benefits and expenses exclude related charges which represent the unfavorable (favorable) impact of Realized investment gains (losses), net, on change in reserves and the
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.

(3)

Revenues exclude net investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities. See “—Trading account assets supporting insurance
liabilities.”

(4)

Benefits and expenses exclude changes in contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes in the pool of investments supporting these experience-rated contracts. See
“—Trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities.”

On April 1, 2004, we acquired the retirement business of CIGNA Corporation for cash consideration of $2.1 billion. Beginning April 1, 2004, the results of the former CIGNA retirement business have been
included in our consolidated results. The majority of these results are reflected within our Retirement segment, as discussed below, and the remaining portion is reflected in our Asset Management segment. In addition, as a result of a change in the
reinsurance arrangement governing the purchase of the guaranteed cost business from CIGNA, the results of this business that were previously presented on a net basis in “Asset management fees and other income” are, beginning on
April 1, 2006, presented on a gross basis in our results of operations. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this acquisition, including a discussion of the change in the reinsurance arrangement
associated with the guaranteed cost business.

On
December 31, 2007 we acquired a portion of Union Bank of California, N.A.’s retirement business, including $7.3 billion in full service retirement account values, for $103 million of cash consideration. The retirement account values
related to this acquisition primarily consist of mutual funds and other client assets we administer, and are not reported on our balance sheet.

Adjusted Operating Income

2007 to 2006 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income for the Retirement segment decreased $53 million, from $509
million in 2006 to $456 million in 2007. Included within adjusted operating income in 2007 is an $82 million charge related to payments made to plan clients associated with a legal action filed against an unaffiliated asset manager, State Street
Global Advisors, Inc., or SSgA. This action seeks, among other relief, restitution of certain losses experienced by plan clients attributable to certain investment funds managed by SSgA as to which we believe SSgA employed investment strategies and
practices that were misrepresented by SSgA and failed to exercise the standard of care of a prudent investment manager. In order to protect the interests of the affected plans and their participants while we pursue these remedies, we have made
payments to affected plan clients that authorized us to proceed on their behalf.

Excluding the charge discussed above, adjusted operating income for 2007 increased $29 million compared to 2006, reflecting improved results from our full service business and essentially unchanged results for our



institutional investment products business. The full service business benefited primarily from higher fees, driven by increases in full service retirement
account values related primarily to market appreciation. Contributing to the increase to a lesser extent was the lack of transition expenses in 2007, as 2006 included $6 million of transition expenses related to the completion of the integration of
the retirement business acquired from CIGNA. Partially offsetting these items within the full service business was an increase in general and administrative expenses driven by expenses incurred to expand our product and service capabilities. In
addition, adjusted operating income for 2006 included a benefit from the disposition of real estate within an investment joint venture. In our institutional investment products business, a greater contribution from investment results, primarily due
to a larger base of invested assets and higher portfolio yields, and improved case experience essentially offset decreases in the market value of certain externally managed investments in the European market during 2007, a decrease in the level of
mortgage prepayment income, and a lower benefit from reserve refinements reflecting updates of client census data on a group annuity block of business. For information regarding our externally managed investments in the European market, see
“—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—General Account Investments—Fixed Maturity Securities—Fixed Maturity Securities and Unrealized Gains and Losses by Industry Category.” Contributing
to the higher portfolio yields in 2007 is the benefit from the sale of lower yielding bonds and reinvestment of proceeds at higher available interest rates, which primarily occurred in the first half of 2006. The realized investment losses generated
from these sales are excluded from adjusted operating income. For a discussion of realized investment gains and losses, including those related to changes in interest rates, see “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account
Investments—Realized Investment Gains.”

2006 to
2005 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income for the Retirement segment increased $11 million, from $498 million in 2005 to $509 million in 2006. Results for 2006 include $25 million from mortgage prepayment income, a
$13 million benefit from the disposition of real estate within an investment joint venture, $12 million from reserve releases mainly reflecting updates of client census data on a group annuity block of business and $6 million of transition expenses
related to the integration of the retirement business acquired from CIGNA, which was completed in the first quarter of 2006. Results for 2005 include $49 million from mortgage prepayment income, $27 million from reserve releases mainly reflecting
updates of client census data on a group annuity block of business, $36 million of transition expenses and $7 million from the collection of investment income on a previously defaulted bond.

Excluding the items discussed above, adjusted operating income for the
Retirement segment increased $14 million. This increase primarily reflects an increase in adjusted operating income from our institutional investment products business reflecting a greater contribution from investment results due principally to a
larger base of invested assets. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in adjusted operating income from our full service business. The decrease in our full service business reflects higher general and administrative expenses relating to
the expansion of our distribution and client servicing capabilities, as well as costs associated with expense reduction initiatives. Also contributing to the decrease in our full service business were higher crediting rates on general account
liabilities. Partially offsetting these decreases were increased fees due to higher full service retirement account values primarily resulting from market appreciation. In addition, the adjusted operating income of both businesses reflect the
benefit from the sale of lower yielding bonds and reinvestment of proceeds at higher available interest rates. The realized investment losses generated from these sales are excluded from adjusted operating income. For a discussion of realized
investment gains and losses, including those related to changes in interest rates, see “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—Realized Investment Gains.”

Revenues

2007 to 2006 Annual Comparison.

Revenues, as shown in the table above
under “—Operating Results,” increased $304 million, from $4.378 billion in 2006 to $4.682 billion in 2007. Net investment income increased $251 million, primarily due to a larger base of invested assets due to sales of guaranteed
investment products in the institutional and retail markets and higher portfolio yields, partially offset by a benefit in 2006 from the disposition of real estate within an investment joint venture and decreases in the level of mortgage prepayment
income. Also contributing to the increase in net investment income is $24 million relating to the change in the reinsurance arrangement with respect to the guaranteed cost business acquired from CIGNA. Due to this change, the results of this
business, which were previously presented on a net basis in “Asset management fees and other income” are, beginning on April 1, 2006, presented on a gross basis in our results of operations. In addition, asset



management fees and other income increased $25 million reflecting growth in fees due to higher full service retirement account values primarily
resulting from market appreciation, partially offset by decreases in the market value of certain externally managed investments in the European market. Premiums increased $35 million, driven by higher single premium group annuity and life-contingent
structured settlement sales, and resulted in a corresponding increase in policyholders’ benefits, including the change in policy reserves, as discussed below.

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison.

Revenues increased $353 million, from $4.025 billion in 2005 to $4.378 billion in 2006. Net
investment income increased $385 million, of which $75 million is due to the change in the reinsurance arrangement related to the guaranteed cost business acquired from CIGNA as discussed above. The remainder of the increase in net investment income
primarily reflects a larger base of invested assets due to sales of guaranteed investment products in the institutional and retail markets and investments financed by borrowings. As noted above, net investment income also includes the impact of
mortgage prepayments, the benefit from the disposition of real estate within an investment joint venture, and the collection of investment income on a previously defaulted bond, as well as the benefit from the sale of lower yielding bonds and
reinvestment of proceeds at higher available interest rates. Partially offsetting the increases in revenue discussed above, was a decrease in premiums of $26 million reflecting lower sales of life-contingent structured settlements in 2006, partially
offset by a single large sale of a group annuity product in the first quarter of 2006.

Benefits and Expenses

2007 to 2006 Annual Comparison.

Benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased $357 million, from $3.869 billion in 2006 to $4.226 billion in 2007. Interest credited to
policyholders’ account balances increased $220 million, primarily reflecting higher interest credited on a greater base of guaranteed investment products sold in the institutional and retail markets and higher crediting rates on general account
liabilities. General and administrative expenses, net of capitalization, increased $88 million primarily reflecting payments made to plan clients related to a legal action filed against an unaffiliated asset manager, as discussed above, and
increased expenses incurred to expand our full service product and service capabilities. In addition, policyholders’ benefits, including the change in policy reserves, increased $41 million primarily reflecting the increase in premiums on
higher single premium group annuity and life-contingent structured settlement sales discussed above, as well as a lower benefit from reserve refinements relating to updates of client census data on a group annuity block of business. Also
contributing to the increase in policyholders’ benefits is a $21 million increase due to the change in the reinsurance arrangement with respect to the guaranteed cost business acquired from CIGNA discussed above. These increases in
policyholders’ benefits were partially offset by improved case experience in 2007.

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison.

Benefits and expenses increased $342 million, from $3.527
billion in 2005 to $3.869 billion in 2006. Interest credited to policyholders’ account balances increased $220 million reflecting higher interest credited on the greater base of guaranteed investment products sold in the institutional and
retail markets, as well as higher crediting rates on full service general account liabilities. Interest expense increased $98 million primarily due to increased financing costs on increased borrowings, the proceeds of which were used to purchase
invested assets. Policyholders’ benefits, including the change in policy reserves, increased $55 million and reflects a $66 million increase due to the change in the reinsurance arrangement related to the guaranteed cost business acquired from
CIGNA as discussed above and a $15 million increase due to lower reserve releases in 2006 as discussed above. Excluding these items, policyholders’ benefits, including the change in policy reserves, decreased $26 million, primarily from the $26
million decrease in premiums discussed above. General and administrative expenses were relatively stable as the decrease in transition expenses in 2006, were mostly offset by expenses incurred to expand our full service distribution and client
servicing capabilities, as well as costs incurred related to expense reduction initiatives.

Sales Results and Account Values

The following table shows the changes in the account values and net additions (withdrawals) of Retirement segment products for the periods indicated. Net
additions (withdrawals) are deposits and sales or additions, as



applicable, minus withdrawals and benefits. These concepts do not correspond to revenues under U.S. GAAP, but are used as a relevant measure of business
activity.

(1)

On December 31, 2007 we acquired a portion of Union Bank of California, N.A.’s retirement business for $103 million of cash consideration.

(2)

Ending total account value for the full service business includes assets of Prudential’s retirement plan of $5.7 billion, $5.6 billion and $5.3 billion as of December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

(3)

Change in market value, interest credited and interest income includes $511 million for 2007 representing a transfer from Institutional Investment Products to Full Service as a
result of one client’s change in contract form.

(4)

Ending total account value for the institutional investment products business includes assets of Prudential’s retirement plan of $5.5 billion, $5.3 billion and $6.4 billion as
of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

(5)

Transfers between the Retirement and Asset Management segments, previously presented within Withdrawals and benefits, have been reclassified to Other for all periods presented.

(6)

Other includes transfers from (to) the Asset Management segment of $185 million, $(1,475) million, and $(1,186) million for 2007, 2006, and 2005 respectively. Other also includes
$(511) million for 2007 representing a transfer from Institutional Investment Products to Full Service as a result of one client’s change in contract form. Remaining amounts for all periods presented primarily represent changes in asset
balances for externally managed accounts.

2007 to 2006 Annual Comparison.

Account values in our full service business amounted to $112.2 billion as of December 31, 2007, an increase of $14.8 billion from December 31, 2006. The increase in
account values was driven primarily by an increase in the market value of customer funds and $7.3 billion of account values acquired from Union Bank of California, N.A. Net additions (withdrawals) increased $776 million, from net additions of $167
million in 2006 to net additions of $943 million in 2007, reflecting lower plan lapses, partially offset by lower new plan sales. Net additions in 2006 included three large client sales totaling $2.7 billion, and four large plan terminations
totaling $2.7 billion primarily associated with merger and plan consolidation activity.

Account values in our institutional investment products business amounted to $51.6 billion as of December 31, 2007, an increase of $1.3 billion from December 31, 2006, primarily reflecting interest on
general account business and an increase in the market value of customer funds, partially offset by net withdrawals of $893 million. Net additions (withdrawals) decreased $2.0 billion, from net additions of $1.1 billion in 2006 to net withdrawals of
$893 million in 2007. This decrease reflects lower additions driven by lower sales of guaranteed investment products in the institutional markets due to unfavorable market conditions in 2007, as well as higher withdrawals from fee-based account
values.

2006 to 2005 Annual
Comparison.

Account values in our full service business amounted to $97.4 billion as of December 31, 2006, an increase of $9.045 billion from December 31, 2005. The increase in account values



was driven principally by an increase in the market value of customer funds, together with the reinvestment of income. Net additions (withdrawals) improved
$1.079 billion, from net withdrawals of $912 million in 2005 to net additions of $167 million in 2006, primarily reflecting an increase in net plan sales, as an increase in new plan sales was partially offset by an increase in plan lapses. Partially
offsetting this increase were greater deposits in 2005 for existing defined benefit plans, including a significant deposit by a single client.

Account values in our institutional investment products business amounted to $50.3 billion as of December 31, 2006, an increase of $2.189 billion
from December 31, 2005, primarily reflecting interest on general account business and an increase in the market value of customer funds. Net additions (withdrawals) improved $1.394 billion, from net withdrawals of $282 million in 2005 to net
additions of $1.112 billion in 2006, reflecting higher sales of guaranteed investment products in the institutional and retail markets.

International Insurance and Investments Division

As a U.S.-based company with significant business operations outside the U.S., we seek to mitigate the risk that future unfavorable foreign currency
exchange rate movements will reduce our U.S. dollar equivalent earnings. The operations of our International Insurance and International Investments segments are subject to currency fluctuations that can materially affect their U.S. dollar results
from period to period even if results on a local currency basis are relatively constant. As discussed further below, we enter into forward currency derivative contracts, as well as “dual currency” and “synthetic dual currency”
investments, as part of our strategy to effectively fix the currency exchange rates for a portion of our prospective non-U.S. dollar denominated earnings streams.

The financial results of our International Insurance segment and International Investments segment, excluding the global
commodities group, for all periods presented reflect the impact of an intercompany arrangement with Corporate and Other operations pursuant to which the segments’ non-U.S. dollar denominated earnings in all countries are translated at fixed
currency exchange rates. The fixed rates are determined in connection with a currency income hedging program designed to mitigate the risk that unfavorable exchange rate changes will reduce the segments’ U.S. dollar equivalent earnings.
Pursuant to this program, Corporate and Other operations executes forward currency contracts with third parties to sell the hedged currency in exchange for U.S. dollars at a specified exchange rate. The maturities of these contracts correspond with
the future periods in which the identified non-U.S. dollar denominated earnings are expected to be generated. This program is primarily associated with the International Insurance segment’s businesses in Japan, Korea and Taiwan and the
International Investments segment’s businesses in Korea and Europe. The intercompany arrangement with Corporate and Other operations increased (decreased) revenues and adjusted operating income of each segment as follows for the periods
indicated:

Results of Corporate
and Other operations include any differences between the translation adjustments recorded by the segments and the gains or losses recorded from the forward currency contracts. The consolidated net impact of this program recorded within the Corporate
and Other operations was a gain of $4 million, and losses of $1 million and $11 million, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

In addition, our Japanese insurance operations hold dual currency investments in the form of fixed maturities and loans. The
principal of these dual currency investments are yen-denominated while the related interest income is U.S. dollar denominated. These investments are the economic equivalent of exchanging what would otherwise be fixed streams of yen-denominated
interest income for fixed streams of U.S. dollars. Our Japanese insurance operations also hold investments in yen-denominated investments that have been coupled with cross-currency coupon swap agreements, creating synthetic dual currency
investments. The yen/U.S. dollar



exchange rate is effectively fixed, as we are obligated in future periods to exchange fixed amounts of Japanese yen interest payments generated by the
yen-denominated investments for U.S. dollars at the yen/U.S. dollar exchange rates specified by the cross-currency coupon swap agreements. The effect of these dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments is taken into account as part of our
currency income hedging program. As of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, the principal of these investments were ¥538 billion, or $4.8 billion, and ¥545 billion, or $4.9 billion, respectively. For the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the weighted average yield generated by these investments was 2.3%, 2.7% and 2.5%, respectively. For information regarding the weighted average exchange rate resulting from these investments see
“—Dual Currency Investments,” below.

Presented
below is the fair value of these instruments as reflected on our balance sheet for the periods presented.

We also seek to
mitigate the risk that future unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements will reduce our U.S. dollar equivalent equity in foreign subsidiaries through various hedging strategies. In the case of our Japanese insurance operations, which
constitute our most significant foreign operations, we hedge 100% of our U.S. GAAP equity in these subsidiaries by maintaining U.S. dollar denominated investments equivalent to their U.S. GAAP equity. In addition, we currently hedge a portion of the
economic surplus, which represents the amount by which the present value of the future cash flows of the Japanese insurance operations’ current in force block of business, after considering various shock scenarios, exceeds their current U.S.
GAAP equity, through increased investment in U.S. dollar denominated investments.

As of December 31, 2007, our Japanese insurance operations have U.S. dollar denominated investments of $4.0 billion which serve as a natural hedge of the yen-based U.S. GAAP equity of these operations and $0.9
billion that serve to hedge a portion of the economic surplus in excess of U.S. GAAP equity of these operations. These U.S. dollar denominated investments pay a coupon, which is reflected within ”Net investment income,” and, therefore,
included in adjusted operating income, and generally pay a coupon greater than that which a similar yen-based investment would pay. See “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments—General Account
Investments—Investment Results” for the investment yields generated by our Japanese insurance operations. Since these U.S. dollar assets are recorded on the books of a yen-based entity, changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the
fair value of these investments. To the extent the value of the yen strengthens as compared to the U.S. dollar, the value of these U.S. dollar denominated investments will decrease related to foreign currency exchange rates. These investments are
designated as available-for-sale under U.S. GAAP and are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in fair value, including those from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, recorded as unrealized gains or losses in
“Accumulated other comprehensive income” within Stockholders’ Equity. As of December 31, 2007, the U.S. dollar investments serving as a hedge of our economic surplus in excess of U.S. GAAP equity were in an unrealized gain
position related to foreign currency exchange rates. Upon sale or maturity of these investments any remaining unrealized gain or loss will be included in “Realized gains (losses), net” within the income statement and, excluded from
adjusted operating income. Similarly, any impairment recognized on these investments, including those for an other-than-temporary decline in value that may include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, will be included in
“Realized gains (losses), net” within the income statement, and, as such, excluded from adjusted operating income. See “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments—General Account Investments—Fixed
Maturity Securities—Other-than-Temporary Impairments of Fixed Maturity Securities” for a discussion of our policies regarding impairments. Prospectively, we will seek to continue to hedge 100% of the U.S. GAAP equity, and, to varying
degrees, the economic surplus of the Japanese insurance operations, which we may accomplish through holding U.S. dollar investments within the Japanese insurance operations (either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity) or through yen denominated
borrowings issued within our U.S. operations.



As of December 31, 2007, our Japanese insurance operations also have $4.1 billion of U.S. dollar
denominated investments that offset the foreign currency exposure of U.S. liabilities from U.S. dollar denominated products issued by these operations, as well as $1.1 billion of U.S. dollar denominated investments that are hedged to yen through
third party contracts. See “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments—General Account Investments” for a discussion of our general account investments, including specific discussion of our Japanese general
account investment portfolio.

International Insurance

The results of
our International Insurance operations are translated on the basis of weighted average monthly exchange rates, inclusive of the effects of the intercompany arrangement discussed above. To provide a better understanding of operating performance
within the International Insurance segment, where indicated below, we have analyzed our results of operations excluding the effect of the year over year change in foreign currency exchange rates. Our results of operations excluding the effect of
foreign currency fluctuations were derived by translating foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at uniform exchange rates for all periods presented, including, for constant dollar information discussed below, Japanese yen at a rate of 106 yen per U.S.
dollar; Korean won at a rate of 950 won per U.S. dollar. New annualized premiums presented on a constant exchange rate basis in the “Sales Results” section below reflect translation based on these same uniform exchange rates.

Operating Results

The following table sets forth the International Insurance segment’s
operating results for the periods indicated.

(1)

Revenues exclude Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related charges and adjustments. The related charges represent the impact of Realized investment gains (losses), net,
on the amortization of unearned revenue reserves. See “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments—Realized Investment Gains.”

(2)

Benefits and expenses exclude related charges that represent the element of “Dividends to policyholders” that is based on a portion of certain realized investment gains
required to be paid to policyholders and the impact of Realized investment gains (losses), net, on the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs.

(3)

Revenues exclude net investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities. See “—Trading Account Assets Supporting Insurance
Liabilities.”

(4)

Benefits and expenses exclude changes in contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes in the pool of investments supporting these experience-rated contracts. See
“—Trading Account Assets Supporting Insurance Liabilities.”



Adjusted Operating Income

2007 to 2006 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income from Life Planner operations
decreased $11 million, from $930 million in 2006 to $919 million in 2007, including a $33 million favorable impact of currency fluctuations. These currency fluctuations reflect the year over year change in foreign currency exchange rates. In
addition, 2007 adjusted operating income of our Life Planner operations included a $102 million decrease in the market value of certain externally managed investments in the European market. Excluding the impact of the latter item and currency
fluctuations, adjusted operating income of our Life Planner operations increased $58 million, primarily as a result of the continued growth of our Japanese Life Planner operations. For information regarding our externally managed investments in the
European market, see “—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—General Account Investments—Fixed Maturity Securities—Fixed Maturity Securities and Unrealized Gains and Losses by Industry
Category.”

Gibraltar Life’s adjusted operating
income increased $76 million, from $493 million in 2006 to $569 million in 2007, including a $4 million favorable impact of currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, adjusted operating income for Gibraltar Life increased
$72 million primarily reflecting improved investment income margins. The improvement in investment income margins reflects the benefit of various investment portfolio strategies, including duration lengthening in our Japanese yen investments,
increased credit exposure and increased utilization of U.S. dollar based investments. In addition, the continued growth of our U.S. dollar denominated fixed annuity product contributed to the improvement in investment income margins. Investment
income margins also benefited $15 million in 2007 from investment income associated with a single investment joint venture, reflecting the sale of real estate within the venture. Partially offsetting these benefits to investment income margins was
an $11 million decrease in the market value of certain externally managed investments in the European market and the benefit in 2006 of $6 million from an investment joint venture transaction. The increase in adjusted operating income also reflects
a $17 million charge recognized in 2006 for refinements in policy liabilities.

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income from our Life Planner operations increased $122 million, from $808 million in 2005 to $930 million in 2006, including a $50
million favorable impact of currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, adjusted operating income increased $72 million reflecting continued growth of our Japanese and Korean Life Planner operations and improved investment
margins. The improved investment margins reflect the favorable effect of certain investment portfolio strategies initially implemented in 2005 including increased investments in unhedged U.S. dollar denominated securities. Adjusted operating income
in 2005 included a one-time $44 million benefit from an investment joint venture, $5 million from a reduction in our liability for guaranty fund assessments and a $5 million benefit from reserve refinements on recently introduced products in our
Korean operation.

Gibraltar Life’s adjusted operating
income declined $9 million, from $502 million in 2005 to $493 million in 2006, including a $23 million favorable impact of currency fluctuations. Refinements of certain policy liabilities resulted in a $17 million reduction of Gibraltar Life’s
2006 adjusted operating income, while results for 2005 benefited $9 million from refinements in reserves for a block of business. Excluding the impact of these items and currency fluctuations, adjusted operating income of Gibraltar Life declined $6
million. Adjusted operating income in 2006 includes a $6 million charge for an increase in our estimated liability for guaranty fund assessments, for which 2005 included a benefit of $10 million. In addition, mortality experience and expense levels
were less favorable in 2006. Improved investment income margins were a partial offset, reflecting income in 2006 of $6 million from a single real estate related investment and the favorable effect of certain investment portfolio strategies initially
implemented in 2005, including increased investments in unhedged U.S. dollar denominated securities.

Revenues

2007 to 2006 Annual Comparison.

Revenues, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased
$418 million, from $7.730 billion in 2006 to $8.148 billion in 2007. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, which had no net impact, revenues increased $418 million, from $8.246 billion in 2006 to $8.664 billion in 2007.



Revenues from our Life Planner operations increased $437 million, from $4.876 billion in 2006 to $5.313
billion in 2007, including a net favorable impact of currency fluctuations of $21 million. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, revenues increased $416 million from 2006 to 2007, primarily reflecting increases in premiums and policy
charges and fee income of $386 million, from $4.435 billion in 2006 to $4.821 billion in 2007. Premiums and policy charges and fee income increased $271 million, from $3.061 billion in 2006 to $3.332 billion in 2007, in our Japanese Life Planner
operation and increased $81 million, from $1.072 billion in 2006 to $1.153 billion in 2007, in our Korean operation. The increase in premiums and policy charges and fee income in both operations was primarily the result of new sales and strong
persistency. Net investment income also increased $133 million, from $716 million in 2006 to $849 million in 2007, due to asset growth and higher investment yields reflecting duration lengthening of our Japanese yen investment portfolio and
increased utilization of U.S. dollar based investments. Offsetting the increase in net investment income was a $102 million decrease in the market value of certain externally managed investments in the European market during 2007, which is reflected
in asset management fees and other income.

Revenues from
Gibraltar Life declined $19 million, from $2.854 billion in 2006 to $2.835 billion in 2007, including an unfavorable impact from currency fluctuations of $21 million. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, revenues increased $2 million, from
$3.074 billion in 2006 to $3.076 billion in 2007. Premiums decreased $89 million, from $2.224 billion in 2006 to $2.135 billion in 2007, as premiums in 2006 benefited $92 million from additional face amounts of insurance issued pursuant to a special
dividend arrangement established as part of Gibraltar Life’s reorganization for which 2007 includes no such benefit. Substantially all of these premiums recognized pursuant to the special dividend arrangement were offset by a corresponding
charge to increase reserves for the affected policies. Also reflected in premiums are higher sales of single premium contracts and an increase in first-year premium, mostly offset by a decrease in renewal premiums reflecting the expected attrition
of older business. Our premiums have declined as the market has continued to transition from traditional products, on which we record premiums, to products with a retirement and savings objective, for which customer funds received are recorded as
deposits. More than offsetting the decrease in premium was a $104 million increase in net investment income, from $788 million in 2006 to $892 million in 2007, due to improved investment income margins, as discussed above.

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison

Revenues
increased $59 million, from $7.671 billion in 2005 to $7.730 billion in 2006, including a net unfavorable impact of $179 million relating to currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, revenues increased $238 million, from
$8.008 billion in 2005 to $8.246 billion in 2006.

Revenues
from our Life Planner operations, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, increased $437 million, from $4.735 billion in 2005 to $5.172 billion in 2006. This increase in revenues came primarily from increases in premiums and policy charges
and fee income of $389 million, from $4.046 billion in 2005 to $4.435 billion in 2006, and a $61 million increase in net investment income from 2005 to 2006. Premiums and policy charges and fee income from our Japanese Life Planner operation
increased $262 million, from $2.799 billion in 2005 to $3.061 billion in 2006. Premiums and policy charges and fee income from our Korean operation increased $101 million, from $971 million in 2005 to $1.072 billion in 2006. The increase in premiums
and policy charges and fee income in both operations was primarily the result of business growth and strong persistency. The increase in net investment income reflects business growth and the favorable effect of certain investment portfolio
strategies initially implemented in 2005, as discussed above. Net investment income in 2005 included a one-time, $44 million benefit from an investment joint venture.

Revenues for Gibraltar Life declined $335 million, from $3.189 billion in 2005 to $2.854 billion in 2006, including a $136
million unfavorable impact of currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of the currency fluctuations, revenues declined $199 million, from $3.273 billion in 2005 to $3.074 billion in 2006. The decline in revenues reflects a decline in premiums of
$274 million, from $2.498 billion in 2005 to $2.224 billion in 2006. The decline in premium income reflects a $136 million decrease, from $228 million in 2005 to $92 million in 2006, in premiums recognized in connection with issuance of additional
face amounts of insurance under a special dividend arrangement established as part of Gibraltar Life’s reorganization. The decline in premiums also reflects a decrease of $89 million in single premium contracts, as sales associated with
retirement and savings objectives have transitioned from traditional products on which premiums are recorded to products for which customer funds received are accounted for as deposits. The remainder of the decline in premiums reflected the expected
attrition of older business. A $97 million increase in net investment income, from $691 million in 2005



to $788 million in 2006, was a partial offset. The increase in net investment income reflected the increase in Gibraltar Life’s U.S. dollar denominated
fixed annuity business, the favorable effect of certain investment portfolio strategies initially implemented in 2005, and income of $6 million in 2006 from a single real estate related investment as discussed above.

Benefits and Expenses

2007 to 2006 Annual Comparison.

Benefits and
expenses, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased $353 million, from $6.307 billion in 2006 to $6.660 billion in 2007, including a net favorable impact of $37 million related to currency fluctuations.
Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, benefits and expenses increased $390 million, from $6.816 billion in 2006 to $7.206 billion in 2007.

Benefits and expenses of our Life Planner operations increased $448 million, from $3.946 billion in 2006 to $4.394 billion in 2007, including a net
favorable impact of $12 million from currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, benefits and expenses increased $460 million, from $4.228 billion in 2006 to $4.688 billion in 2007. Benefits and expenses of our Japanese
Life Planner operation increased $290 million, from $2.822 billion in 2006 to $3.112 billion in 2007, while benefits and expenses from our Korean operation increased $126 million, from $975 million in 2006 to $1.101 billion in 2007. The increase in
benefits and expenses in both operations reflects an increase in policyholder benefits, including changes in reserves, which was driven by new sales and strong persistency. Also contributing to the increase in benefits and expenses are higher
general and administrative expenses primarily as a result of business growth.

Gibraltar Life’s benefits and expenses declined $95 million, from $2.361 billion in 2006 to $2.266 billion in 2007, including a $25 million favorable impact of currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of
currency fluctuations, benefits and expenses declined $70 million, from $2.588 billion in 2006 to $2.518 billion in 2007. This decline is primarily due to the effects of the special dividend arrangement discussed above and the $17 million charge
recognized in 2006 for refinements in policy liabilities. Partially offsetting the decline in benefits and expenses, was higher interest credited to policyholders’ account balances resulting from growth in our U.S. dollar denominated fixed
annuity product.

2006 to 2005 Annual
Comparison.

Benefits and expenses declined $54 million, from $6.361 billion in 2005 to $6.307 billion in 2006, including a favorable impact of $252 million related to currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of currency
fluctuations, benefits and expenses increased $198 million, from $6.618 billion in 2005 to $6.816 billion in 2006.

Benefits and expenses of our Life Planner operations, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, increased $365 million, from $3.863 billion in 2005
to $4.228 billion in 2006. Benefits and expenses of our Japanese Life Planner operation increased $217 million, from $2.605 billion in 2005 to $2.822 billion in 2006. Benefits and expenses from our Korean operation increased $103 million, from $872
million in 2005 to $975 million in 2006. The increase in benefits and expenses in both operations reflects a greater volume of business in force, which was driven by new sales and strong persistency. Benefits and expenses in 2005 include the
favorable impacts of a reduction in our liability for guaranty fund assessments in our Japanese Life Planner operation and reserve refinements on recently introduced products in our Korean operation discussed above.

Gibraltar Life’s benefits and expenses declined $326 million, from
$2.687 billion in 2005 to $2.361 billion in 2006, including a $159 million favorable impact of currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of the currency fluctuations, benefits and expenses declined $167 million, from $2.755 billion in 2005 to
$2.588 billion in 2006, reflecting the lower increases in reserves due to $228 million lower premiums associated with the special dividend arrangement and lower single premium contracts as discussed above. These lower reserve increases corresponding
to the level of premiums were partially offset by a less favorable level of policyholder benefits and expenses, which included charges of $17 million in 2006 from refinements in policy liabilities, compared to a favorable impact of $9 million in
2005 from refinements in reserves for a block of business. Additionally, benefits and expenses for 2006 include a $6 million charge to increase our estimated liability for guaranty fund assessments, while 2005 included a favorable impact of $10
million from a reduction of that liability.

Sales Results

In managing our international insurance business, we
analyze revenues, as well as new annualized premiums, which do not correspond to revenues under U.S. GAAP. New annualized premiums measure the



current sales performance of the segment, while revenues primarily reflect the renewal persistency of policies written in prior years and net investment
income, in addition to current sales. New annualized premiums include 10% of first year premiums or deposits from single pay products. New annualized premiums on an actual and constant exchange rate basis are as follows for the periods indicated.

2007 to 2006 Annual
Comparison.

On a constant exchange rate basis, new annualized premiums increased $18 million, from $1.185 billion in 2006 to $1.203 billion in 2007. On this same basis, new annualized premiums from our Japanese Life
Planner operations increased $10 million reflecting increased sales of retirement income and U.S. dollar denominated whole life products, partially offset by lower sales of increasing term life products to corporations as a result of pending tax law
changes. Sales in all other countries, also on a constant exchange rate basis, increased $3 million as decreased sales in Korea mostly offset increased sales in Taiwan and the rest of our Life Planner operations. The number of Life Planners
increased 338, or 6%, from 5,828 as of December 31, 2006 to 6,166 as of December 31, 2007. This increase was driven by increases of 112, 66 and 90 in our Life Planner operations in Japan, Korea and Taiwan, respectively. In addition, during
2007, 82 Life Planners in Japan were transferred to Gibraltar primarily to support our efforts to expand our bank channel distribution.

New annualized premiums, on a constant exchange rate basis, from our Gibraltar Life operation increased $5 million from 2006 to 2007, primarily due to
higher sales of our U.S. dollar whole life product and other traditional insurance products, which was partially offset by lower sales of our U.S. dollar denominated single premium fixed annuity, particularly in our bank distribution channel. The
number of Life Advisor’s increased 320, or 5%, from 5,944 as of December 31, 2006 to 6,264 as of December 31, 2007.

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison.

On a constant exchange rate basis, new annualized premiums declined $33 million, from $1.218
billion in 2005 to $1.185 billion in 2006. On this same basis, new annualized premiums from our Japanese Life Planner operation declined $72 million, primarily reflecting a decline in sales of U.S. dollar denominated products. Higher sales in 2005
reflected the popularity of these products and sales in anticipation of premium rate increases. The decline in these sales was partially offset by increased sales of term life insurance products. Sales in all other countries, also on a constant
exchange rate basis, declined $9 million primarily reflecting declines in sales in Korea and Taiwan.

New annualized premiums from our Gibraltar Life operation increased $48 million, on a constant exchange rate basis, from $329 million in 2005 to $377
million in 2006. Sales of our U.S. dollar denominated single premium fixed annuity product increased $95 million, from $46 million in 2005 to $141 million in 2006, including $49 million of sales through our bank distribution channel which commenced
in the first quarter of 2006. Sales of our U.S. dollar denominated whole life policies increased $18 million, from $5 million in 2005 to $23 million in 2006. These increases were partially offset by a decline in sales of our single pay whole life
products, from $50 million in 2005 to $12 million in 2006, and our traditional whole life products, from $77 million in 2005 to $52 million in 2006.

Investment Margins and Other Profitability Factors

Many of our insurance products sold in international markets provide for the buildup of cash values for the policyholder at mandated guaranteed interest
rates. Japanese authorities regulate interest rates guaranteed in our



Japanese insurance contracts. The regulated guaranteed interest rates do not necessarily match the actual returns on the underlying investments. The spread
between the actual investment returns and these guaranteed rates of return to the policyholder is an element of the profit or loss that we will experience on these products. With regulatory approval, guaranteed rates may be changed on new business.
While these actions enhance our ability to set rates commensurate with available investment returns, the major sources of profitability on our products sold in Japan, other than those sold by Gibraltar Life, are margins on mortality, morbidity and
expense charges rather than investment spreads.

We base
premiums and cash values in most countries in which we operate on mandated mortality and morbidity tables. Our mortality and morbidity experience in the International Insurance segment on an overall basis in the years ended December 31, 2007,
2006, and 2005 was well within our pricing assumptions and below the guaranteed levels reflected in the premiums we charge.

Dual Currency Investments

The table below presents as of December 31, 2007, the yen-denominated earnings subject to our dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments
and the related weighted average exchange rates resulting from these investments.

(1)

Yen amounts are imputed from the contractual U.S. dollar denominated interest cash flows.

The table above does not reflect the currency income hedging program discussed above. In establishing the level of yen-denominated earnings
that will be hedged through the currency income hedging program we take into account the anticipated level of U.S. dollar denominated earnings that will be generated by dual currency and synthetic dual currency investments, as well as the
anticipated level of U.S. dollar denominated earnings that will be generated by U.S. dollar denominated products and investments.

International Investments

Operating Results

The following table sets forth the International Investments segment’s operating results for the periods indicated.

(1)

Revenues exclude Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments. See “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments—Realized Investment
Gains.”



(2)

Benefits and expenses exclude related charges which represent the unfavorable (favorable) impact of Realized investment gains (losses), net, on minority interest.

(3)

Equity in earnings of operating joint ventures are included in adjusted operating income but excluded from income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in
earnings of operating joint ventures as they are reflected on a U.S. GAAP basis on an after-tax basis as a separate line on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

In 2004, we acquired an 80 percent interest in Hyundai Investment and Securities Co., Ltd., a Korean asset management firm,
from an agency of the Korean government. We subsequently renamed the company Prudential Investment & Securities Co., Ltd, or PISC. On January 25, 2008, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 20 percent for $90 million and PISC
is now a wholly owned operation.

On July 12, 2007, we
sold our 50% interest in our operating joint ventures Oppenheim Pramerica Fonds Trust GmbH and Oppenheim Pramerica Asset Management S.a.r.l., which we accounted for under the equity method, to our partner Oppenheim S.C.A. for $121 million. These
businesses establish, package and distribute mutual fund products to German and other European retail investors. We recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of $37 million, which is reflected in the adjusted operating income of our International
Investments segment in 2007. These businesses contributed $3 million, $4 million and $1 million of adjusted operating income to the results of the International Investments segment for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

On January 18, 2008, we made an additional
investment of $154 million in our UBI Pramerica operating joint venture in Italy, which we account for under the equity method. This additional investment was necessary to maintain our ownership interest at 35% and was a result of the merger of our
joint venture partner with another Italian bank, and their subsequent consolidation of their asset management companies into the UBI Pramerica joint venture.

Adjusted Operating Income

2007 to 2006 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income increased $116 million, from $143 million in 2006 to $259 million
in 2007. Adjusted operating income for 2007 includes the $37 million gain from the sale of our Oppenheim joint ventures as discussed above and a $17 million benefit from recoveries related to a former investment of our Korean asset management
operations. In addition, market value changes on securities relating to exchange memberships benefited 2007 by $42 million, while benefiting 2006 by $21 million.

Excluding the benefit of the items discussed above, adjusted operating income increased by $41 million reflecting more
favorable results from our asset management businesses in Korea and China. The adjusted operating income of our Korean asset management operations also includes $17 million and $21 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, of fee revenue from the
Korean government under an agreement entered into in connection with the 2004 acquisition of PISC, related to the provision of asset management and brokerage services, which agreement extends until February 27, 2009.

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted
operating income increased $37 million, from $106 million in 2005 to $143 million in 2006. This increase reflects income recognized in 2006 from market value changes on securities, principally relating to exchange memberships. Also contributing to
the increase in adjusted operating income was improved results from the segment’s asset management operations, principally reflecting higher performance fees and asset management fees in a joint venture, as well as more favorable sales and
trading results from our global commodities group business. Results for 2006 and 2005 include fee revenue from the Korean government under the agreement discussed above of $21 million and $24 million, respectively.

Revenues

2007 to 2006 Annual Comparison.    Revenues, as shown in
the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased $179 million, from $590 million in 2006 to $769 million in 2007. This increase reflects the gain from the sale of our Oppenheim joint ventures, gains from market value changes on
securities relating to exchange memberships, and the gain associated with the recovery of a former investment, as well as higher revenue from our asset management operations.



2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison.

Revenues increased $103 million, from $487
million in 2005 to $590 million in 2006. This increase includes income recognized in 2006 from market value changes on securities, principally relating to exchange memberships. Also contributing to this increase were higher revenues from our global
commodities group business, our Korean asset management operations, and a joint venture as discussed above.

Expenses

2007 to 2006 Annual Comparison.

Expenses, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased
$63 million, from $447 million in 2006 to $510 million in 2007, primarily due to higher expenses corresponding with the higher level of revenues generated by our asset management operations.

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison.

Expenses
increased $66 million, from $381 million in 2005 to $447 million in 2006, primarily due to higher expenses corresponding with the higher level of revenues generated by our global commodities group business and our Korean asset management operations.

Corporate and Other

Corporate and Other includes corporate operations, after allocations to our
business segments, and real estate and relocation services.

Corporate operations consist primarily of: (1) corporate-level income and expenses, after allocations to any of our business segments, including income and expense from our qualified pension and other employee benefit plans and
investment returns on capital that is not deployed in any of our segments; (2) returns from investments that we do not allocate to any of our business segments, including debt-financed investment portfolios, as well as tax credit investments
and other tax enhanced investments financed by our business segments; and (3) businesses that we have placed in wind-down status but have not divested as well as the impact of transactions with other segments.

(1)

Includes consolidating adjustments.

(2)

Revenues exclude Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments. See “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments—Realized Investment
Gains.”

(3)

Revenues exclude net investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities. See “—Trading Account Assets Supporting Insurance
Liabilities.”

(4)

See “—Divested Businesses.”

2007 to 2006 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income decreased $97 million, from income of $47 million in 2006 to a
loss of $50 million in 2007. Adjusted operating income from corporate operations decreased $50 million, from a loss of $28 million in 2006 to a loss of $78 million in 2007. Corporate operations investment income, net of interest expense, decreased
$62 million, primarily reflecting the impact of deployment of our excess capital in our businesses and for share repurchases, increased borrowings and less favorable income from equity method investments, including tax credit investments, partially
offset by investment income, net of related interest expense, from the investment of proceeds from our $2 billion November 2005 convertible debt issuance



and our $2 billion December 2006 convertible debt issuance. In May 2007 the company called for redemption the November 2005 convertible debt securities. The
proceeds from our December 2006 convertible debt issuance were previously used to fund an investment portfolio, but beginning in December of 2007 were reinvested in short-term investments and may be used to fund operations in lieu of other
short-term borrowings in future periods. The proceeds from a $3 billion December 2007 convertible debt issuance have been deployed in a similar manner. We anticipate our investment income, net of interest expense within our corporate operations will
continue to decline in future periods as we continue to repurchase shares and experience less pre-tax earnings on a growing book of equity method tax credit investments.

Corporate operations includes income from our qualified pension plan of $366 million in 2007, an increase of $23 million from $343 million
in 2006. The increase reflects changes in the market value of our plan assets. During 2007 we transferred $1 billion of assets within the qualified pension plan under Section 420 of the Internal Revenue Code from assets supporting pension
benefits to assets supporting retiree medical benefits.

For
purposes of calculating pension income from our own qualified pension plan for the year ended December 31, 2008, we will increase the discount rate to 6.25% from 5.75% in 2007. The expected return on plan assets will decline from 8.00% in 2007
to 7.75% in 2008 and the assumed rate of increase in compensation will remain unchanged at 4.5%. We determined our expected return on plan assets based upon the arithmetic average of prospective returns, which is based upon a risk free interest rate
as of the measurement date adjusted by a risk premium that considers historical information and expected asset manager performance for equity, debt and real estate markets applied on a weighted average basis to our pension asset portfolio. Giving
effect to the foregoing assumptions, the decline in plan assets supporting pension benefits of $1 billion discussed above, as well as other items, including the increase in market value of pension assets, we expect on a consolidated basis income
from our own qualified pension plan will continue to contribute to adjusted operating income in 2008, but at a level of about $70 million to $80 million below that of the year 2007. This decline will be offset by a decline in other postretirement
benefit expenses in a range of $80 million to $90 million. The decline in other postretirement benefit expense is driven primarily by the increase in expected return on assets reflecting the transfer of assets to our retiree medical benefit plans
discussed above. In 2008, pension and other postretirement benefit service costs related to active employees will continue to be allocated to our business segments.

Adjusted operating income of our real estate and relocation services business decreased $47 million, from $75 million in
2006 to $28 million in 2007. The decline reflected lower transaction volume associated with less favorable residential real estate market conditions as well as a fixed asset write-off in 2007.

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison

.    Adjusted
operating income decreased $141 million, from $188 million in 2005 to $47 million in 2006. Adjusted operating income from corporate operations decreased $111 million, from income of $83 million in 2005 to a loss of $28 million in 2006. Corporate
operations investment income, net of interest expense, decreased $79 million primarily reflecting the impact of deployment of our excess capital in our businesses and for share repurchases, increased borrowings, higher short term borrowing rates and
less favorable income from equity method investments. These items were partially offset by income from the investment of proceeds from our convertible debt issuances of $2 billion principal amount in November 2005 and $2 billion principal amount in
December 2006. In 2005, adjusted operating income from corporate operations included $20 million of non-recurring gains from home office property sales.

Corporate operations includes income from our qualified pension plan of $343 million in 2006, a decrease of $68 million from $411 million in 2005. The
decline includes the impact of a reduction in the expected return on plan assets from 8.5% for 2005 to 8.0% for 2006.

General and administrative expenses, excluding income from our qualified pension plan, declined by $93 million, reflecting lower employee benefit costs in
2006. Results for 2005 included the reversal of $30 million of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs recorded in earlier periods.

Adjusted operating income of our real estate and relocation services business decreased $30 million, from $105 million in 2005 to $75 million in 2006. The
decline was driven by less favorable residential real estate market conditions in 2006.



Results of Operations of Closed Block Business

We established the Closed Block Business effective as of the date of
demutualization. The Closed Block Business includes our in force traditional domestic participating life insurance and annuity products and assets that are used for the payment of benefits and policyholder dividends on these policies, as well as
other assets and equity and related liabilities that support these policies. We no longer offer these traditional domestic participating policies. See “—Overview—Closed Block Business” for additional details.

At the end of each year, the Board of Directors of Prudential Insurance
determines the dividends payable on participating policies for the following year based on the experience of the Closed Block, including investment income, net realized and unrealized investment gains, mortality experience and other factors.
Although Closed Block experience for dividend action decisions is based upon statutory results, at the time the Closed Block was established, we developed, as required by U.S. GAAP, an actuarial calculation of the timing of the maximum future
earnings from the policies included in the Closed Block. If actual cumulative earnings in any given period are greater than the cumulative earnings we expected, we will record this excess as a policyholder dividend obligation. We will subsequently
pay this excess to Closed Block policyholders as an additional dividend unless it is otherwise offset by future Closed Block performance that is less favorable than we originally expected. The policyholder dividends we charge to expense within the
Closed Block Business will include any change in our policyholder dividend obligation that we recognize for the excess of actual cumulative earnings in any given period over the cumulative earnings we expected in addition to the actual policyholder
dividends declared by the Board of Directors of Prudential Insurance.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company has recognized a policyholder dividend obligation to Closed Block policyholders for the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings of $732 million. Actual cumulative
earnings, as required by U.S. GAAP, reflect the recognition of realized investment gains in the current period, as well as changes in assets and related liabilities that support the policies. Additionally, net unrealized investment gains have arisen
subsequent to the establishment of the Closed Block due to the impact of lower interest rates on the market value of fixed maturities available for sale. These net unrealized investment gains have been reflected as a policyholder dividend obligation
of $1.047 billion as of December 31, 2007, to be paid to Closed Block policyholders, unless otherwise offset by future experience, with an offsetting amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income.

Operating Results

Management does not consider adjusted operating income to assess the
operating performance of the Closed Block Business. Consequently, results of the Closed Block Business for all periods are presented only in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following table sets forth the Closed Block Business U.S. GAAP results for
the periods indicated.

Income from
Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes and Equity in Earnings of Operating Joint Ventures

2007 to 2006 Annual Comparison.

Income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating
joint ventures decreased $113 million, from $403 million in 2006 to $290 million in 2007. Current year results reflect an increase in dividends to policyholders of $213 million reflecting an increase in dividends paid and accrued to policyholders
primarily due to an increase in the 2008 dividend scale, as well as an increase in the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation expense of $92 million. In addition, results



for 2007 reflect higher claim costs that continue to increase with the aging of the Closed Block policyholders, while results for 2006 included a
reserve release as a result of reserve factor updates. These decreases to income were partially offset by an increase of $79 million in net investment income, net of interest expense, primarily related to higher income on joint venture and limited
partnership investments and higher dividend income from public equity investments, and an increase of $108 million in net realized investment gains, from $481 million in 2006 to $589 million in 2007. For a discussion of Closed Block Business
realized investment gains (losses), net, see “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments—Realized Investment Gains.”

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison.

Income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating
joint ventures decreased $79 million, from $482 million in 2005 to $403 million in 2006. Results for 2006 reflect realized investment gains of $481 million as compared to $636 million in 2005, a decrease of $155 million. For a discussion of Closed
Block Business realized investment gains (losses), net, see “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments—Realized Investment Gains.” The decrease in net realized investment gains was partially offset by a decrease
in dividends to policyholders of $135 million, which is comprised of a decline in the policyholder dividend obligation expense of $169 million, partially offset by a $34 million increase in dividends paid and accrued to policyholders.

Revenues

2007 to 2006 Annual Comparison.

Revenues, as
shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased $169 million, from $7.812 billion in 2006 to $7.981 billion in 2007, principally driven by the $108 million increase in net realized investment gains and an increase of
$109 million in net investment income. The increase in net investment income reflects higher income on joint venture and limited partnership investments and public equity investments. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in
premiums, with a corresponding decline in changes in reserves, as the policies in force have matured or terminated. We expect this decline in premiums for this business to continue as these polices continue to mature or terminate.

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison.

Revenues decreased $214 million,
from $8.026 billion in 2005 to $7.812 billion in 2006. Revenues in 2006 reflect a decrease of $155 million in net realized investment gains and a decrease of $41 million in net investment income. Additionally, results in 2006 reflect a decline in
premiums, with a corresponding decline in changes in reserves, as policies in force in the Closed Block have matured or terminated.

Benefits and Expenses

2007 to 2006 Annual Comparison.

Benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under “—Operating
Results,” increased $282 million, from $7.409 billion in 2006 to $7.691 billion in 2007. This increase reflects a $213 million increase in dividends to policyholders reflecting an increase in dividends paid and accrued to policyholders
primarily due to an increase in the 2008 dividend scale, as well as an increase in the cumulative earnings policyholder dividend obligation expense of $92 million. Policyholders’ benefits, including changes in reserves, increased $54 million
primarily reflecting higher claim costs in 2007 that continue to increase with the aging of the Closed Block policyholders, and a reserve release in 2006.

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison.

Benefits and expenses decreased $135 million, from $7.544 billion in 2005 to $7.409 billion
in 2006, as dividends to policyholders decreased $135 million, reflecting a decline in the policyholder dividend obligation expense of $169 million, partially offset by a $34 million increase in dividends paid and accrued to policyholders.



Income Taxes

Shown below is our income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, separately reflecting the
impact of certain significant items. Also presented below is the income tax provision that would have resulted from application of the statutory 35% federal income tax rate in each of these periods.

We employ various tax
strategies, including strategies to minimize the amount of taxes resulting from realized capital gains.

We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 on
January 1, 2007. For additional information regarding the adoption of this guidance, see Note 17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The dividends received deduction reduces the amount of dividend income subject to tax and in recent years is the primary component of the non-taxable
investment income shown in the table above, and, as such, is a significant component of the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate of 35%. In August 2007, the Internal Revenue Service, or Service, issued Revenue
Ruling 2007-54, which included, among other items, guidance on the methodology to be followed in calculating the dividends received deduction related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts. In September 2007, the Service released Revenue
Ruling 2007-61. Revenue Ruling 2007-61 suspended Revenue Ruling 2007-54 and informed taxpayers that the U.S. Treasury Department and the Service intend to address through new regulations the issues considered in Revenue Ruling 2007-54, including the
methodology to be followed in determining the dividends received deduction related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts. These activities had no impact on our 2007 results.

Discontinued Operations

Included within net income are the results of businesses which are reflected as discontinued operations under U.S. GAAP. A summary of the results of
discontinued operations by business is as follows for the periods indicated:



The year ended December 31, 2007 includes a $21 million tax benefit associated with the discontinued
international securities operations.

Results for our equity
sales, trading and research operations known as Prudential Equity Group, previously included in the Financial Advisory segment, have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented, as a result of our decision to exit these
operations. Included within the table above for the year ended December 31, 2007 is $104 million of pre-tax losses incurred in connection with this decision, primarily related to employee severance costs. We do not anticipate significant
additional costs will be incurred in connection with this decision.

Real estate investments sold or held for sale reflects the income from discontinued real estate investments.

For further information concerning discontinued operations see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments

Realized Investment Gains

Realized investment gains and losses are generated from numerous sources,
including the sale of fixed maturity securities, equity securities, investments in joint ventures and limited partnerships and other types of investments, as well as adjustments to the cost basis of investments for other-than-temporary impairments.
Realized investment gains and losses are also generated from prepayment premiums received on private fixed maturity securities, recoveries of principal on previously impaired securities, provisions for losses on commercial loans, fair value changes
on commercial mortgage operations’ loans, gains and losses on commercial loans in connection with securitization transactions, fair value changes on embedded derivatives and derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, except
those derivatives used in our capacity as a broker or dealer.

We perform impairment reviews on an ongoing basis to determine when a decline in value is other-than-temporary. In evaluating whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, we consider several factors including, but not limited to, the
following: the extent (generally if greater than 20%) and duration (generally if greater than six months) of the decline in value; the reasons for the decline (credit event, currency or interest-rate related); our ability and intent to hold our
investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value; and the financial condition of and near-term prospects of the issuer. When we determine that there is an other-than-temporary impairment, we write down the value of the security to
its fair value, with a corresponding charge recorded in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” The causes of the other-than-temporary impairments discussed below were specific to each individual issuer and did not directly result in
impairments to other securities within the same industry or geographic region.

In addition, for our impairment review of asset-backed securities with a credit rating below AA, we forecast the prospective future cash flows of the security and determine if the present value of those cash flows,
discounted using the effective yield of the most recent interest accrual rate, has decreased from the previous reporting period. When a decrease from the prior reporting period has occurred and the security’s market value is less than its
carrying value, an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized by writing the security down to fair value.

For a further discussion of our policies regarding other-than-temporary declines in investment value and the related methodology for recording fixed
maturity other-than-temporary impairments, see “—General Account Investments—Fixed Maturity Securities—Other-than-Temporary Impairments of Fixed Maturity Securities” below. For a further discussion of our policies regarding
other-than-temporary declines in investment value and the related methodology for recording equity impairments, see “—General Account Investments—Equity Securities—Other-than-Temporary Impairments of Equity Securities”
below.



The level of other-than-temporary impairments generally reflects economic conditions and is expected to
increase when economic conditions worsen and to decrease when economic conditions improve. We may realize additional credit and interest rate related losses through sales of investments pursuant to our credit risk and portfolio management
objectives. Other-than-temporary impairments, interest rate related losses and credit losses (other than those related to certain of our businesses which primarily originate investments for sale or syndication to unrelated investors) are excluded
from adjusted operating income. In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment, the impaired security is accounted for as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of the impairment. Accordingly, the discount
(or reduced premium) based on the new cost basis is accreted into net investment income, and included in adjusted operating income in future periods based upon the amount and timing of expected future cash flows of the security, if the recoverable
value of the investment based upon those cash flows is greater than the carrying value of the investment after the impairment.

We require most issuers of private fixed maturity securities to pay us make-whole yield maintenance payments when they prepay the securities. Prepayments
are driven by factors specific to the activities of our borrowers as well as the interest rate environment.

We use interest and currency swaps and other derivatives to manage interest and currency exchange rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets
and liabilities, including duration mismatches. We use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk that unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates will reduce U.S. dollar equivalent earnings generated by certain of our non-U.S. businesses. We also
use equity-based derivatives to hedge the equity risks embedded in some of our annuity products. Derivative contracts also include forward purchases and sales of to-be-announced mortgage-backed securities primarily related to our mortgage dollar
roll program. Many of these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, and, consequently, we recognize the changes in fair value of such contracts from period to period in current earnings, although we do not necessarily account for
the related assets or liabilities the same way. Accordingly, realized investment gains and losses from our derivative activities can contribute significantly to fluctuations in net income.

Adjusted operating income excludes “Realized investment gains (losses),
net,” (other than those representing profit or loss of certain of our businesses which primarily originate investments for sale or syndication to unrelated investors, and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings,
current period yield adjustments, or product derivatives and the effect of any related economic hedging program) and related charges and adjustments.



The following tables set forth “Realized investment gains (losses), net,” by investment type
for the Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business, as well as related charges and adjustments associated with the Financial Services Businesses, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, and gross
realized investment gains and losses on fixed maturity securities by segment for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. For a discussion of our general account investment portfolio and related results, including
overall income yield and investment income, as well as our policies regarding other-than-temporary declines in investment value and the related methodology for recording impairment charges, see “—General Account Investments” below.
For additional details regarding adjusted operating income, which is our measure of performance for the segments of our Financial Services Businesses, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



(1)

The Financial Services Businesses include $76 million of losses on sales in 2007, and $65 million of other-than-temporary impairments in 2007, related to asset-backed securities
collateralized by sub-prime mortgages. The Closed Block Business includes $11 million of losses on sales in 2007, and $15 million of other-than-temporary impairments in 2007, related to asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages.

(2)

Includes $171 million of losses on embedded derivatives associated with certain externally managed investments in the European market in 2007.

(3)

Related adjustments include that portion of realized investment gains (losses), net that are included in adjusted operating income, including those related to our Asset Management
segment’s commercial mortgage operations and proprietary investing business, as well as gains and losses pertaining to certain derivatives contracts including losses on embedded derivatives associated with certain externally managed investments
in the European market. Related adjustments also include that portion of “Asset management fees and other income” that are excluded from adjusted operating income, including the change in value due to the impact of changes in foreign
currency exchange rates during the period on certain assets and liabilities for which we economically hedge the foreign currency exposure. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these adjustments.

2007 to 2006 Annual Comparison

Financial Services Businesses

The Financial Services Businesses’ net realized investment gains in
2007 were $24 million, compared to net realized investment gains of $293 million in 2006. Net realized losses on fixed maturity securities were $64 million in 2007 and reflect impairments of $139 million and credit-related losses of $11
million, partially offset by net gains on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities of $46 million and private bond prepayment premiums of $40 million. Net gains on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities in 2007 included gross
losses of $219 million, mainly in the Retirement and International Insurance segments, and were primarily related to credit spread increases in the credit markets resulting generally from concerns over sub-prime mortgage exposures, and interest
rates. Gross losses include $76 million related to sales of asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, primarily in the second half of 2007. See “—General Account Investments—Fixed Maturity Securities” for
additional information regarding our exposure to sub-prime mortgages. Net realized losses on fixed maturity securities were $219 million in 2006 and reflect net losses on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities of $203 million, fixed
maturity other-than-temporary impairments of $23 million and credit-related losses of $25 million partially offset by private bond prepayment premiums of $32 million. Net losses on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities in 2006 included
gross losses of $517 million, mainly in the Retirement, Individual Annuities, and International Insurance segments, which were primarily interest-rate related. Interest-rate related losses on fixed maturities primarily reflect sales of lower
yielding bonds in a higher rate environment, primarily in the first half of 2006, in order to meet various cash flow needs and manage portfolio duration, and reflect our strategy for maximizing portfolio yield while minimizing the amount of taxes on
realized capital gains. Interest-rate related losses, which are excluded from adjusted operating income, where the proceeds from the sale of the securities are reinvested, will generally result in higher net investment income to be included in
adjusted operating income in future periods. See “—General Account Investments—Investment Results” for a discussion of current period yields of the Financial Services Businesses.

Net realized gains on equity securities were $297 million in 2007, of which
net trading gains on sales of equity securities were $340 million, partially offset by other-than-temporary impairments of $43 million. Net realized gains on equity securities were $122 million in 2006, of which net trading gains on sales of equity
securities were $136 million, partially offset by other-than-temporary impairments of $14 million. Net realized gains on equity securities for both periods were primarily due to sales of Japanese equities in our Gibraltar Life and Japanese Life
Planner operations from portfolio restructuring and equity sales in our Korean Life Planner operations.

Net realized losses on derivatives were $336 million in 2007, compared to net derivative gains of $171 million in 2006. The net derivative losses in
2007 primarily reflect net losses of $171 million on embedded derivatives associated with certain externally managed investments in the European market, net losses of $101 million from interest rate derivative contracts mainly used to manage
the duration of the U.S. dollar fixed



maturity investment portfolio, and net losses of $77 million due to the impact of increased credit spreads on credit derivatives used to enhance the return
on our investment portfolio by creating credit exposure. The derivative gains in 2006 primarily relate to net gains of $86 million from interest rate derivative contracts mainly used to manage the duration of the U.S. dollar fixed maturity
investment portfolio, net gains of $37 million from foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge the future income of non-U.S. businesses, mainly driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, and net gains of $27
million on credit derivatives used to enhance the return on our investment portfolio by creating credit exposure. For information regarding our externally managed investments in the European market, see “—General Account
Investments—Fixed Maturity Securities—Fixed Maturity Securities and Unrealized Gains and Losses by Industry Category.”

Net realized investment gains on other investments were $127 million in 2007, primarily related to gains from real estate related investments. Net
realized investment gains on other investments were $219 million in 2006, primarily related to gains from real estate related investments and loan securitizations.

During 2007, we recorded total other-than-temporary impairments of $185 million attributable to the Financial Services
Businesses, compared to total other-than-temporary impairments of $46 million attributable to the Financial Services Businesses in 2006. The other-than-temporary impairments in 2007 consisted of $139 million relating to fixed maturities, $43
million relating to equity securities, and $3 million relating to other invested assets, which include real estate investments and investments in joint ventures and partnerships. The other-than-temporary impairments in 2006 consisted of $23 million
relating to fixed maturities, $14 million relating to equity securities, and $9 million relating to other invested assets, as defined above.

securities, compared with fixed maturity other-than-temporary impairments of $16 million on public securities and $7 million on private securities in 2006. Included in the other-than-temporary impairments recorded on fixed maturities in 2007 are $65
million of other-than-temporary impairments on asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, primarily recorded in the second half of 2007. Fixed maturity other-than-temporary impairments in 2007 were concentrated in asset-backed
securities and the services and finance sectors of our corporate securities, and were primarily driven by credit spread increases as discussed above, interest rates, downgrades in credit, bankruptcy or other adverse financial conditions of the
respective issuers. Fixed maturity other-than-temporary impairments in 2006 were concentrated in the manufacturing sector and were primarily driven by interest rates, downgrades in credit, bankruptcy or other adverse financial conditions of the
respective issuers.

Closed Block Business

$589 million, compared to net realized investment gains of $481 million in 2006. Net realized gains on fixed maturity securities were $182 million in 2007 and reflect net gains on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities of $205
million and private bond prepayment premiums of $39 million, partially offset by other-than-temporary impairments of $48 million and credit-related losses of $14 million. Net gains on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities included
gross losses of $262 million, of which $11 million related to sales of asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, primarily in the second half of 2007. See “—General Account Investments—Fixed Maturity
Securities” for additional information regarding our exposure to sub-prime mortgages. Net realized gains on fixed maturity securities were $279 million in 2006 and reflect net gains on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities of $284

$23 million. Net gains on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities in 2006 included gross losses of $184 million.

Net realized gains on equity securities were $337 million in 2007, of which net trading gains on equity securities were $369 million, partially offset by
other-than-temporary impairments of $32 million. Net realized gains on equity securities were $187 million in 2006, of which net trading gains on equity securities were $204 million, partially offset by other-than-temporary impairments of $17
million. These gains were a result of sales pursuant to our active management strategy.



Net gains on derivatives were $61 million in 2007, compared to net losses of $68 million in 2006.
Derivative gains in 2007 primarily reflect the impact of interest derivatives used to manage the duration of the fixed maturity investment portfolio partially offset by net losses on currency derivatives used to hedge foreign investments. Derivative
losses in 2006 primarily relate to currency derivatives used to hedge foreign investments.

Net realized investment gains on other investments were $9 million in 2007. Net realized investment gains on other investments were $83 million in 2006 primarily related to net gains from real estate related
investments.

During 2007, we recorded total
other-than-temporary impairments of $86 million attributable to the Closed Block Business, compared to total other-than-temporary impairments of $51 million attributable to the Closed Block Business in 2006. The other-than-temporary impairments in
2007 consisted of $48 million relating to fixed maturities, $32 million relating to equity securities, and $6 million relating to other invested assets, which include real estate investments and investments in joint ventures and partnerships. The

maturities in 2007 are $15 million of other-than-temporary impairments on asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, primarily recorded in the second half of 2007. Other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities
include amounts which are currently expected to be accreted into net investment income in future periods based on the future estimated cash flows of the securities. Other-than-temporary impairments in 2007 were concentrated in asset-backed
securities and the services and manufacturing sectors of our corporate securities and were primarily driven by credit spread increases as discussed above, interest rates, downgrades in credit, bankruptcy or other adverse financial conditions of the
respective issuers. Other-than-temporary impairments in 2006 were concentrated in the services and manufacturing sectors and were primarily driven by interest rates, downgrades in credit, bankruptcy or other adverse financial conditions of the

2006 to 2005 Annual Comparison

Financial Services Businesses

The Financial Services Businesses’ net realized investment gains in
2006 were $293 million, compared to net realized investment gains of $742 million in 2005. Net realized losses on fixed maturity securities were $219 million in 2006 and reflect net losses on sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities of
$203 million, impairments of $23 million and credit losses of $25 million, partially offset by private bond prepayment premiums of $32 million. Net realized losses on fixed maturity securities include gross losses on sales and maturities of fixed
maturity securities of $517 million mainly in the Retirement, Individual Annuities and International Insurance segments, which were primarily interest-rate related. Interest-rate related losses on fixed maturities primarily reflect sales of lower
yielding bonds in a higher rate environment in order to meet various cash flow needs, manage portfolio duration and reflect our strategy for maximizing portfolio yield while minimizing the amount of taxes on realized capital gains. Interest-rate
related losses, which are excluded from adjusted operating income, where the proceeds from the sale of the securities are reinvested will generally result in higher net investment income to be included in adjusted operating income in future periods.

driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. Net realized investment gains on other investments were $219 million in 2006, which were primarily related to net gains from real estate related investments and loan
securitizations. Net realized investment gains on other investments were $207 million in 2005 which included a $110 million net gain for a Gibraltar Life settlement with Dai Ichi Fire and Marine Insurance Company related to certain capital
investments made by Gibraltar Life’s predecessor, Kyoei Life Insurance Company Ltd., in Dai Ichi. This amount was partially offset in our Consolidated Statements of Operations by a $68 million increase in “Dividends to policyholders”
in accordance with the reorganization plan entered into at the time of the Company’s acquisition of Gibraltar Life, which is reflected as a related charge.

concentrated in the manufacturing and utilities sectors and were primarily driven by downgrades in credit, bankruptcy or other adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers. Included in private fixed maturity other-than-temporary
impairments for 2005 were impairments relating to an electric power plant and an electronic test equipment distributor.

General Account Investments

We maintain a diversified investment portfolio in our insurance companies to support our liabilities to customers in our Financial Services Businesses and
the Closed Block Business, as well as our other general liabilities. Our general account does not include: (1) assets of our securities brokerage, securities trading, banking operations, real estate and relocation services, and (2) assets
of our asset management operations, including assets managed for third parties, and (3) those assets classified as “separate account assets” on our balance sheet.

The general account portfolio is managed pursuant to the distinct objectives of the Financial Services Businesses and the
Closed Block Business. The primary investment objectives of the Financial Services Businesses include:

•

matching the liability characteristics of the major products and other obligations of the Company;

•

maximizing the portfolio book yield within risk constraints; and

•

for certain portfolios, maximizing total return, including both investment yield and capital gains, and preserving principal, within risk constraints, while
matching the liability characteristics of their major products.

Our strategies for maximizing the portfolio book yield of the Financial Services Businesses include: (1) the investment of proceeds from investment sales, repayments and prepayments, and operating cash flows,
into optimally yielding investments, and (2) where appropriate, the sale of the portfolio’s lower yielding investments, either to meet various cash flow needs or to manage the portfolio's duration, credit, currency and other risk
constraints, all while minimizing the amount of taxes on realized capital gains.

The primary investment objectives of the Closed Block Business include:

•

providing for the reasonable dividend expectations of the participating policyholders within the Closed Block Business and the Class B shareholders; and

•

maximizing total return and preserving principal, within risk constraints, while matching the liability characteristics of the major products in the Closed Block
Business.

Management of Investments

We design asset mix strategies for our general
account to match the characteristics of our products and other obligations and seek to closely approximate the interest rate sensitivity, but not necessarily the exact cash flow characteristics, of the assets with the estimated interest rate
sensitivity of the product liabilities. In certain



markets, primarily outside the U.S., capital market limitations hinder our ability to closely approximate the duration of some of our liabilities. We achieve
income objectives through asset/liability management and strategic and tactical asset allocations within a disciplined risk management framework. For a discussion of our risk management process see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk—Risk Management, Market Risk and Derivative Instruments and—Other Than Trading Activities—Insurance and Annuity Products Asset/Liability Management.” Our asset allocation also reflects our desire for broad
diversification across asset classes, sectors and issuers. The Asset Management segment manages virtually all of our investments, other than those managed by our International Insurance segment, under the direction and oversight of the Asset
Liability Management and Risk Management groups. Our International Insurance segment manages the majority of its investments locally, in some cases using the international asset management capabilities of our International Investments segment.

The Investment Committee of our Board of Directors oversees
our proprietary investments. It also reviews performance and risk positions quarterly. Our Asset Liability Management and Risk Management groups develop the investment policy for the general account assets of our insurance subsidiaries and oversee
the investment process for our general account and have the authority to initiate tactical shifts within exposure ranges approved annually by the Investment Committee.

The Asset Liability Management and Risk Management groups work closely with each of our business units to develop investment objectives,
performance factors and measures and asset allocation ranges and to ensure that the specific characteristics of our products are incorporated into their processes. We adjust this dynamic process as products change, as customer behavior changes and
as changes in the market environment occur. We develop asset strategies for specific classes of product liabilities and attributed or accumulated surplus, each with distinct risk characteristics. Most of our products can be categorized into the
following three classes:

•

interest-crediting products for which the rates credited to customers are periodically adjusted to reflect market and competitive forces and actual investment
experience, such as fixed annuities and universal life insurance;

•

participating individual and experience rated group products in which customers participate in actual investment and business results through annual dividends,
interest or return of premium; and

•

guaranteed products for which there are price or rate guarantees for the life of the contract, such as GICs.

We determine a target asset mix for each product class, which we reflect in
our investment policies. Our asset/liability management process has permitted us to manage interest-sensitive products successfully through several market cycles.

Portfolio Composition

Our investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity securities, commercial loans, equity securities and other invested assets. The
composition of our general account reflects, within the discipline provided by our risk management approach, our need for competitive results and the selection of diverse investment alternatives available primarily through our Asset Management
segment. The size of our portfolio enables us to invest in asset classes that may be unavailable to the typical investor.

Our total general account investments were $232.5 billion and $229.7 billion as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively, which
are segregated between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. Total general account investments attributable to the Financial Services Businesses were $163.0 billion and $159.6 billion as of December 31, 2007 and
December 31, 2006, respectively, while total general account investments attributable to the Closed Block Business were $69.5 billion and $70.1 billion as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. The following table
sets forth the composition of the investments of our general account as of the dates indicated. The average duration of our general account investment portfolio attributable to the domestic Financial Services Businesses as of December 31, 2007
is between 4 and 5 years.



(1)

Other long-term investments consist of real estate and non-real estate related investments in joint ventures (other than our investment in operating joint ventures, which includes
our investment in Wachovia Securities) and partnerships, investment real estate held through direct ownership and other miscellaneous investments.

(2)

Short-term investments consist primarily of money market funds, with virtually no sub-prime exposure.

(3)

Includes invested assets of securities brokerage, securities trading, banking operations, real estate and relocation services, and asset management operations. Excludes assets of
our asset management operations managed for third parties and those assets classified as “separate account assets” on our balance sheet.

The increase in general account investments attributable to the Financial Services Businesses in 2007 was primarily a result of the reinvestment of net
investment results and the investment of proceeds related to the issuance of surplus notes, as discussed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These increases were partially offset by the liquidation of investments purchased using the
proceeds of the convertible senior notes issued in 2005. These notes were called for redemption during the second quarter of 2007, as discussed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Also offsetting the increase was net operating and
capital outflows, and net declines in market value primarily attributable to increased credit spreads. The decrease in general account investments attributable to the Closed Block Business in 2007 was primarily due to net operating outflows and a
net decrease in market value partially offset by portfolio growth as a result of reinvestment of net investment income.

We have substantial insurance operations in Japan, with 31% and 30% of our Financial Services Businesses’ general account investments relating to our
Japanese insurance operations as of December 31, 2007 and



December 31, 2006, respectively. Total general account investments related to our Japanese insurance operations were $50.7 billion and $47.5 billion as
of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. The increase in general account investments related to our Japanese insurance operations in 2007 is primarily attributable to portfolio growth as a result of business growth, the
reinvestment of net investment income and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The following table sets forth the composition of the investments of our Japanese insurance operations’ general account as of the dates indicated.

(1)

Other long-term investments consist of real estate and non-real estate related investments in joint ventures and partnerships, investment real estate held through direct ownership,
and other miscellaneous investments.

(2)

Excludes assets classified as “separate accounts assets” on our balance sheet.

Our Japanese insurance operations use the yen as their functional currency, as it is the currency in which they conduct the majority of
their operations. Although the majority of the Japanese general account is invested in yen denominated investments, our Japanese insurance operations also hold significant investments denominated in U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2007, our
Japanese insurance operations had $10.2 billion of investments denominated in U.S. dollars, including $1.1 billion that were hedged to yen through third party derivative contracts and $4.1 billion that support liabilities denominated in U.S.
dollars. As of December 31, 2006, our Japanese insurance operations had $9.3 billion of investments denominated in U.S. dollars, including $1.2 billion that were hedged to yen through third party derivative contracts and $3.1 billion that
support liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars. For additional information regarding U.S. dollar investments held in our Japanese insurance operations see, “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by
Segment—International Insurance and Investments Division.”

Investment Results

The following
tables set forth the income yield and investment income, excluding realized investment gains (losses), for each major investment category of our general account for the periods indicated.



(1)

Yields are based on quarterly average carrying values except for fixed maturities, equity securities and securities lending activity. Yields for fixed maturities are based on
amortized cost. Yields for equity securities are based on cost. Yields for securities lending activity are calculated net of corresponding liabilities and rebate expenses. Yields exclude investment income on assets other than those included in
invested assets of the Financial Services Businesses. Prior periods yields are presented on a basis consistent with the current period presentation.

(2)

Includes investment income of securities brokerage, securities trading, banking operations, real estate and relocation services, and asset management operations.

The net investment income yield on our general
account investments after investment expenses, excluding realized investment gains (losses), was 5.43% and 5.38% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The net investment income yield attributable to the Financial
Services Businesses was 5.06% for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 4.99% for the year ended December 31, 2006. See below for a discussion of the change in the Financial Services Businesses’ yields.

The net investment income yield attributable to the Closed Block Business was
6.41% for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 6.37% for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher income from investments in joint ventures and limited partnerships, driven by net appreciation of
underlying assets and gains from the sale of underlying assets partially offset by lower mortgage loan prepayment income.

The following tables set forth the income yield and investment income, excluding realized investment gains (losses), for each major investment category of
the Financial Services Business general account, excluding the Japanese operations’ portion of the general account which is presented separately below, for the periods indicated.



(1)

Yields are based on quarterly average carrying values except for fixed maturities, equity securities and securities lending activity. Yields for fixed maturities are based on
amortized cost. Yields for equity securities are based on cost. Yields for securities lending activity are calculated net of corresponding liabilities and rebate expenses. Yields exclude investment income on assets other than those included in
invested assets of the Financial Services Businesses. Prior periods yields are presented on a basis consistent with the current period presentation.

(2)

Includes investment income of securities brokerage, securities trading, banking operations, real estate and relocation services, and asset management operations.

The net investment income yield attributable to
the non-Japanese operations’ portion of the Financial Services Businesses portfolio was 6.04% for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 6.03% for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to an increase
in fixed maturity yields as a result of reinvestment of proceeds from sales and maturities of fixed maturities at higher available interest rates, which occurred primarily in the first half of 2006, as discussed above under “—Realized
Investment Gains”, and the impact of higher rates on floating rate investments.

The following tables set forth the income yield and investment income, excluding realized investment gains (losses), for each major investment category of our Japanese operations’ general account for the periods
indicated.

(1)

Yields are based on quarterly average carrying values except for fixed maturities, equity securities and securities lending activity. Yields for fixed maturities are based on
amortized cost. Yields for equity securities are based on cost. Yields for securities lending activity are calculated net of corresponding liabilities and rebate expenses. Yields exclude investment income on assets other than those included in
invested assets of the Financial Services Businesses. Prior periods yields are presented on a basis consistent with the current period presentation.

The net investment income yield attributable to the Japanese insurance operations’ portfolios was 2.83% for the year
ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2.64% for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in yield on the Japanese insurance portfolio is primarily attributable to an increase in unhedged U.S. dollar investments, the lengthening of the
duration of the investment portfolio, and an increase in credit exposure. The U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities that are not hedged to yen through third party derivative contracts provide a yield that is substantially higher than the yield on
comparable Japanese fixed maturities. The average value of U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities that are not hedged to yen through third party derivative contracts for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was approximately $7.6
billion and $6.3 billion, respectively, based on amortized cost. For additional information regarding U.S. dollar investments held in our Japanese insurance operations see, “—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by
Segment—International Insurance and Investments Division.”

Fixed Maturity Securities

Investment
Mix

Our fixed maturity securities portfolio consists of
publicly traded and privately placed debt securities across an array of industry categories. The fixed maturity securities relating to our international insurance operations are primarily comprised of foreign government securities.



We manage our public portfolio to a risk profile directed or overseen by the Asset Liability Management
and Risk Management groups and, in the case of our international insurance portfolios, to a profile that also reflects the local market environment. The investment objectives for fixed maturity securities are consistent with those described above.
The total return that we earn on the portfolio will be reflected both as investment income and also as realized gains or losses on investments.

We use our private placement and asset-backed portfolios to enhance the diversification and yield of our overall fixed maturity portfolio. Within our
domestic portfolios, we maintain a private fixed income portfolio that is larger than the industry average as a percentage of total fixed income holdings. Over the last several years, our investment staff has directly originated more than half of
our annual private placement originations. Our origination capability offers the opportunity to lead transactions and gives us the opportunity for better terms, including covenants and call protection, and to take advantage of innovative deal
structures.

Investments in fixed maturity securities
attributable to the Financial Services Businesses were $113.5 billion at amortized cost with an estimated fair value of $114.8 billion as of December 31, 2007 compared to $111.9 billion at amortized cost with an estimated fair value of $114.6
billion as of December 31, 2006. Investments in fixed maturity securities attributable to the Closed Block Business were $48.7 billion at amortized cost with an estimated fair value of $49.4 billion as of December 31, 2007 compared to
$49.5 billion at amortized cost with an estimated fair value of $50.8 billion as of December 31, 2006.

Fixed Maturity Securities by Contractual Maturity Date

The following tables set forth the breakdown of the amortized cost of our fixed maturity securities portfolio in total by contractual maturity as of
December 31, 2007.



Fixed Maturity Securities and Unrealized Gains and Losses by Industry Category

The following table sets forth the composition of the portion of our fixed
maturity securities portfolio by industry category attributable to the Financial Services Businesses as of the dates indicated and the associated gross unrealized gains and losses.

(1)

Investment data has been classified based on Lehman industry categorizations for domestic public holdings and similar classifications by industry for all other holdings.

(2)

Includes $36 million of gross unrealized gains and $41 million of gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2007, compared to $24 million of gross unrealized gains and $53
million of gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2006 on securities classified as held to maturity, which are not reflected in other comprehensive income.

(3)

Excluded from the above are available for sale residential mortgage-backed securities held outside the general account in other entities and operations with amortized cost of $603
million and fair value of $608 million, all of which have credit ratings of AAA.

(4)

Commercial Mortgage Backed securities were previously presented primarily within Corporate Securities – Finance.

(5)

The table above excludes fixed maturity securities classified as trading. See “—trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities” for additional information.

As a percentage of amortized cost, fixed
maturity investments attributable to the Financial Services Businesses as of December 31, 2007, consist primarily of 24% foreign government securities, 13% manufacturing sector, 12% asset-backed securities and 10% finance sector, compared to
22% foreign government securities, 14% asset-backed securities, 13% manufacturing sector and 11% finance sector as of December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2007, 96% of the residential mortgage-backed securities in the Financial Services
Businesses were publicly traded agency pass-through securities, which are supported by implicit or explicit government guarantees and have credit ratings of AA or AAA. Collateralized mortgage obligations, including approximately $61 million secured
by “ALT-A” mortgages, represented the remaining 4% of residential mortgage-backed securities (and less than 1% of total fixed maturities in the Financial Services Businesses), and all have credit ratings of A or above.

As of December 31, 2007, included within asset-backed securities
attributable to the Financial Services Businesses on an amortized cost basis is approximately $7.8 billion ($7.1 billion fair value) of securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, $1.8 billion ($1.9 billion fair value) of externally managed
investments in



the European market, $1.2 billion ($1.2 billion fair value) of securities collateralized by auto loans, $0.9 billion ($0.9 billion fair value) of securities
collateralized by credit card receivables, and $2.1 billion ($2.1 billion fair value) of other asset-backed securities.

The $1.8 billion of externally managed investments in European markets, included above in asset-backed securities of the Financial Services Businesses,
reflects our investment in medium term notes that are collateralized by portfolios of assets primarily consisting of European fixed income securities and derivatives, including corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. Our investment in these
notes further diversifies our credit risk. None of the underlying investments are securities collateralized by U.S. sub-prime mortgages, and 90% of the underlying investments are rated investment grade. The notes have a stated coupon and provide a
return based on the return of the underlying securities. The notes are accounted for as available for sale fixed maturity securities with embedded derivatives (total return swaps). Changes in the value of the notes are reported in Stockholders’
Equity under the heading “Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.” Changes in the market value of the embedded total return swaps are included in current period earnings in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” Adjusted
operating income includes cumulative losses and recoveries of such losses on the embedded derivatives in the period they occur. Cumulative net gains on the embedded derivatives are deferred and amortized into adjusted operating income over the
remaining life of the notes.

While there is no market standard
definition, we define sub-prime mortgages as residential mortgages that are originated to weaker quality obligors as indicated by weaker credit scores, as well as mortgages with higher loan to value ratios, or limited documentation. The slowing U.S.
housing market, rising interest rates, and relaxed underwriting standards for some originators of sub-prime mortgages have recently led to higher delinquency rates, particularly for those mortgages issued in 2006 and 2007. The following tables set
forth the amortized cost and fair value of our asset-backed securities attributable to the Financial Services Businesses as of December 31, 2007 by credit quality, and for asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, by year
of issuance (vintage).



(1)

Our enhanced short-term portfolio is used primarily to invest cash proceeds of securities lending and repurchase activities, and cash generated from certain trading and operating
activities. The investment policy statement of this portfolio requires that securities purchased for this portfolio have a remaining expected average life of 2 years or less when acquired.

(2)

Included within the $5.5 billion of asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages with AAA credit ratings are $1.6 billion of securities supported by guarantees from
monoline bond insurers, of which $1.4 billion are collateralized by second-lien exposures. See “—Fixed Maturity Securities Credit Quality” for additional information regarding guarantees from monoline bond insurers.

(3)

Includes collateralized debt obligations with amortized cost of $220 million and fair value of $214 million, with less than 2% secured by sub-prime mortgages.

(4)

Excluded from the table above, on an amortized cost basis, is $279 million ($281 million fair value) of available for sale asset-backed securities held outside the general account
in other entities and operations. Based on amortized cost, 73% have credit ratings of AAA, and the remaining 27% have BBB or below credit ratings. Included within these asset-backed securities are securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages
with amortized cost and fair value of $11 million, all of which have AAA credit ratings, with $10 million in the 2006 vintage and $1 million in the 2003 vintage. Also included are collateralized debt obligations with amortized cost of $79 million
and fair value of $81 million, with none secured by sub-prime mortgages. Also excluded from the table above are asset-backed securities classified as trading and carried at fair value. See “—trading account assets supporting insurance
liabilities” for information regarding $1.2 billion of such securities. An additional $37 million are classified as other trading, 40% of which have credit ratings of AAA and the remaining 60% have BBB or below credit ratings.

The tables above provide ratings as assigned by
nationally recognized rating agencies as of December 31, 2007. In making our investment decisions we assign internal ratings to our asset-backed securities based upon our dedicated asset-backed securities unit’s independent evaluation of
the underlying collateral and securitization structure, including any guarantees from monoline bond insurers. See “—Fixed Maturity Securities Credit Quality” for additional information regarding guarantees from monoline bond insurers.



While delinquency rates on commercial mortgages have been stable in recent years, we recognized several
market factors that influenced our investment decisions on commercial mortgage-backed securities issued in 2006 and 2007, including less stringent loan underwriting, higher levels of leverage, and rapid real estate price appreciation. The following
tables set forth the amortized cost and fair value of our commercial mortgage backed securities attributable to the Financial Services Businesses as of December 31, 2007 by credit quality and by year of issuance (vintage).

(1)

Excluded from the table above are available for sale commercial mortgage-backed securities held outside the general account in other entities and operations with amortized cost and
fair value of $10 million, 50% of which have credit ratings of AAA and the remaining 50% of which have credit ratings of BB. Also excluded from the table above are commercial mortgage-backed securities classified as trading and carried at fair
value. See “—trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities” for information regarding $2.6 billion of such securities. An additional $794 million are classified as other trading, of which 89% have AAA credit ratings, 3% have
AA credit ratings, 6% have A credit ratings, and the remaining 2% have BBB or below credit ratings.

The gross unrealized losses related to our fixed maturity portfolio attributable to the Financial Services Businesses were $2.0 billion as of
December 31, 2007, compared to $0.7 billion as of December 31, 2006. The gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2007 were concentrated primarily in asset-backed securities and the finance and manufacturing sectors of our corporate
securities. The gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2006 were concentrated primarily in the manufacturing, utilities, services, and foreign government sectors. Gross unrealized losses related to our asset-backed securities collateralized
by sub-prime mortgages attributable to the Financial Services Businesses were $0.7 billion as of December 31, 2007. For additional information regarding sales and other-than-temporary impairments of asset-backed securities collateralized by
sub-prime mortgages see “—Realized Investment Gains” above.



The following table sets forth the composition of the portion of our fixed maturity securities portfolio
by industry category attributable to the Closed Block Business as of the dates indicated and the associated gross unrealized gains and losses.

(1)

Investment data has been classified based on Lehman industry categorizations for domestic public holdings and similar classifications by industry for all other holdings.

(2)

Commercial Mortgage Backed securities were previously presented within Corporate Securities—Finance.

As a percentage of amortized cost, fixed maturity investments attributable to the Closed Block Business as of
December 31, 2007 consist primarily of 17% asset-backed securities, 17% manufacturing sector, 11% utilities sector, 11% residential mortgage-backed securities, 9% services sector and 9% commercial mortgage backed securities compared to 17%
asset-backed securities, 17% manufacturing sector, 12% utilities sector, 10% services sector, 10% finance sector and 7% residential mortgage-backed securities, as of December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2007, 86% of the residential
mortgage-backed securities in the Closed Block Business were publicly traded agency pass-through securities, which are supported by implicit or explicit government guarantees and have credit ratings of AA or AAA. Collateralized mortgage obligations,
including approximately $137 million secured by "ALT-A" mortgages, represented the remaining 14% of residential mortgage-backed securities (and less than 2% of total fixed maturities in the Closed Block Business), and all have credit ratings of A or
above.

As of December 31, 2007, included within
asset-backed securities attributable to the Closed Block Business on an amortized cost basis is approximately $6.3 billion ($5.9 billion fair value) of securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, $0.5 billion ($0.5 billion fair value) of
securities collateralized by credit card receivables, $0.4 billion ($0.4 billion fair value) of securities collateralized by auto loans, $0.3 billion ($0.3 billion fair value) of externally managed investments in the European market, $0.2 billion
($0.2 billion fair value) of securities collateralized by education loans, and $0.4 billion ($0.3 billion fair value) of other asset-backed securities.

The $0.3 billion of externally managed investments in European markets, included in asset-backed securities of the Closed Block Business, reflects our
investment in medium term notes that are collateralized by portfolios of assets primarily consisting of European fixed income securities and derivatives, including corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. Our investment in these notes further
diversifies our credit risk. None of the underlying investments are securities collateralized by U.S. sub-prime mortgages, and 90% of the underlying investments are rated investment grade. The notes have a stated coupon and provide a return based on
the return of the underlying securities. The notes are accounted for as available for sale fixed maturity securities with embedded derivatives (total return swaps). Changes in the value of the notes are reported in Stockholders’ Equity under
the heading “Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.” Changes in the market value of the embedded total return swaps are included in current period earnings in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.”



See above for a description of asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages. The
following tables set forth the amortized cost and fair value of our asset-backed securities attributable to the Closed Block Business as of December 31, 2007 by credit quality, and for asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime
mortgages, by year of issuance (vintage).

securitization structure, including any guarantees from monoline bond insurers. See “—Fixed Maturity Securities Credit Quality” for additional information regarding guarantees from monoline bond insurers.

While delinquency rates on commercial mortgages have been stable in recent
years, we recognized several market factors that influenced our investment decisions on commercial mortgage-backed securities issued in 2006 and 2007, including less stringent loan underwriting, higher levels of leverage, and rapid real estate price
appreciation. The following tables set forth the amortized cost and fair value of our commercial mortgage backed securities attributable to the Closed Block Business as of December 31, 2007 by credit quality and by year of issuance (vintage).

The gross unrealized
losses related to our fixed maturity portfolio attributable to the Closed Block Business were $0.9 billion as of December 31, 2007 compared to $0.4 billion as of December 31, 2006. The gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2007
were concentrated primarily in asset-backed securities and the manufacturing, and services sectors of our corporate securities. The gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2006 were concentrated primarily in the manufacturing, utilities, and
services sectors. Gross unrealized losses related to our asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages attributable to the Closed Block Business were $0.4 billion as of December 31, 2007. For additional information regarding
sales and other-than-temporary impairments of asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages see “—Realized Investment Gains” above.

Fixed Maturity Securities Credit Quality

The Securities Valuation Office, or SVO, of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, evaluates the
investments of insurers for regulatory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity



securities to one of six categories called “NAIC Designations.” NAIC designations of “1” or “2” include fixed maturities
considered investment grade, which include securities rated Baa3 or higher by Moody’s or BBB- or higher by Standard & Poor’s. NAIC Designations of “3” through “6” are referred to as below investment grade,
which include securities rated Ba1 or lower by Moody’s and BB+ or lower by Standard & Poor’s. As a result of time lags between the funding of investments, the finalization of legal documents and the completion of the SVO filing
process, the fixed maturity portfolio generally includes securities that have not yet been rated by the SVO as of each balance sheet date. Pending receipt of SVO ratings, the categorization of these securities by NAIC designation is based on the
expected ratings indicated by internal analysis.

Investments
of our international insurance companies are not subject to NAIC guidelines. Investments of our Japanese insurance operations are regulated locally by the Financial Services Agency, an agency of the Japanese government. The Financial Services Agency
has its own investment quality criteria and risk control standards. Our Japanese insurance companies comply with the Financial Services Agency’s credit quality review and risk monitoring guidelines. The credit quality ratings of the non-U.S.
dollar denominated investments of our Japanese insurance companies are based on ratings assigned by Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, or rating equivalents based on ratings assigned by Japanese credit ratings agencies.

Certain of the Company’s fixed maturity investments are supported by
guarantees from monoline bond insurers. As of December 31, 2007, on an amortized cost basis, $2.7 billion ($2.6 billion fair value), or 2%, of general account available for sale fixed maturity investments attributable to the Financial Services
Businesses were supported by guarantees from monoline bond insurers. All of these investments had AAA credit ratings as of December 31, 2007, reflecting the credit quality of the monoline bond insurers. Management estimates, taking into account
the structure and credit quality of the underlying investments and giving no effect to the support of these securities by guarantees from monoline bond insurers, that 73% of the $2.7 billion total (based upon amortized cost) would have investment
grade credit ratings. Based on amortized cost, $1.6 billion of the $2.7 billion of securities supported by bond insurance were asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, $0.6 billion were other asset-backed securities and $0.5
billion were municipal bonds, which are included within the U.S. Government line of the fixed maturity securities composition table above. Management estimates that 63% of the asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, 79% of the
other asset-backed securities, and virtually all of the municipal bonds would have investment grade credit ratings giving no effect to the support of these securities by guarantees from monoline bond insurers. As of December 31, 2007, the bond
insurance is provided by five insurance companies, with no company representing more than 29% of the overall amortized cost of the securities supported by bond insurance attributable to the Financial Services Businesses.

As of December 31, 2007, on an amortized cost basis, $1.4 billion ($1.3
billion fair value), or 3%, of fixed maturity investments attributable to the Closed Block Business were supported by guarantees from monoline bond insurers. All of these investments had AAA credit ratings as of December 31, 2007, reflecting
the credit quality of the monoline bond insurer. Management estimates, taking into account the structure and credit quality of the underlying investments and giving no effect to the support of these securities by guarantees from monoline bond
insurers, that 81% of the $1.4 billion total (based upon amortized cost) would have investment grade credit ratings. Based on amortized cost, $1.1 billion of the $1.4 billion of securities supported by bond insurance were asset-backed securities
collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, $0.2 billion were other asset-backed securities, and $0.1 billion were municipal bonds, which are included within the U.S. Government line of the fixed maturity securities composition table above. Management
estimates that 78% of the asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, 85% of the other asset-backed securities, and all of the municipal bonds would have investment grade credit ratings giving no effect to the support of these
securities by guarantees from monoline bond insurers. As of December 31, 2007, the bond insurance is provided by five insurance companies, with no company representing more than 35% of the overall amortized cost of the securities supported by
bond insurance attributable to the Closed Block Business.

The
amortized cost of our public and private below investment grade fixed maturities attributable to the Financial Services Businesses totaled $7.5 billion, or 7%, of the total fixed maturities as of December 31, 2007 and $7.1 billion, or 6%, of
the total fixed maturities as of December 31, 2006. Below investment grade fixed maturities represented 12% and 11% of the gross unrealized losses attributable to the Financial Services Businesses as of December 31, 2007 and
December 31, 2006, respectively.



The amortized cost of our public and private below investment grade fixed maturities attributable to the
Closed Block Business totaled $5.7 billion, or 12%, of the total fixed maturities as of December 31, 2007 and $6.2 billion, or 13%, of the total fixed maturities as of December 31, 2006. Below investment grade fixed maturities represented
18% of the gross unrealized losses attributable to the Closed Block Business as of December 31, 2007, compared to 16% of gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2006.

with amortized cost of $1,386 million (fair value, $1,421 million) that have been categorized based on expected NAIC designations pending receipt of SVO ratings.



Credit Derivative Exposure to Public Fixed Maturities

In addition to the credit exposure from public fixed maturities noted above,
we sell credit derivatives to enhance the return on our investment portfolio by creating credit exposure similar to an investment in public fixed maturity cash instruments.

In a credit derivative we sell credit protection on an identified name, or a basket of names in a first to default
structure, and in return receive a quarterly premium. With single name credit default derivatives, this premium or credit spread generally corresponds to the difference between the yield on the referenced name’s public fixed maturity cash
instruments and swap rates, at the time the agreement is executed. With first-to-default baskets, because of the additional credit risk inherent in a basket of named credits, the premium generally corresponds to a high proportion of the sum of the
credit spreads of the names in the basket. If there is an event of default by the referenced name or one of the referenced names in a basket, as defined by the agreement, then we are obligated to pay the counterparty the referenced amount of the
contract and receive in return the referenced defaulted security or similar security. Subsequent defaults on the remaining names within such instruments require no further payment to counterparties.

The majority of referenced names in the credit derivatives where we have sold
credit protection, as well as all the counterparties to these agreements, are investment grade credit quality and our credit derivatives generally have maturities of five years or less. As of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, we had
$1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, in outstanding notional amounts of credit derivative contracts where we have sold credit protection. The Financial Services Businesses had $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion of outstanding notional amounts as
of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. The Closed Block Business had $328 million and $378 million of outstanding notional amounts, as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. Credit derivative
contracts are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value, including the premium received, recorded in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” The premium received for the credit derivatives we sell attributable to the Financial
Services Businesses was $12 million for both the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, and is included in adjusted operating income as an adjustment to “Realized investment gains (losses), net” over the life of the derivative.

The following table sets forth our exposure where we have sold
credit protection through credit derivatives in the Financial Services Businesses by NAIC rating of the underlying credits as of the dates indicated.

(1)

First-to-default credit swap baskets, which may include credits of varying qualities, are grouped above based on the lowest credit in the basket. However, such basket swaps may
entail greater credit risk than the rating level of the lowest credit.



The following table sets forth our exposure where we have sold credit protection through credit
derivatives in the Closed Block Business portfolios by NAIC rating of the underlying credits as of the dates indicated.

(1)

First-to-default credit swap baskets, which may include credits of varying qualities, are grouped above based on the lowest credit in the basket. However, such basket swaps may
entail greater credit risk than the rating level of the lowest credit.

In addition to selling credit protection, in limited instances we have purchased credit protection using credit derivatives in order to hedge specific credit exposures in our investment portfolio. As of
December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively, the Financial Services Businesses had $214 million and $35 million of outstanding notional amounts, reported at fair value as a $1 million asset and a $1 million liability. As of
December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively, the Closed Block Business had $205 million and $122 million of outstanding notional amounts, reported at fair value as an asset of $5 million and $0 million. The premium paid for the
credit derivatives we purchase attributable to the Financial Services Businesses was $1 million and $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and is included in adjusted operating income as an adjustment to
“Realized investment gains (losses), net” over the life of the derivative.

Unrealized Losses from Fixed Maturity Securities

The following table sets forth the amortized cost and gross unrealized losses of fixed maturity securities attributable to the Financial Services Businesses where the estimated fair value had declined and remained
below amortized cost by 20% or more for the following timeframes:

The gross unrealized
losses were primarily concentrated in the asset-backed securities sector as of December 31, 2007 and were primarily concentrated in the services sector as of December 31, 2006. We have not recognized the gross unrealized losses shown in
the table above as other-than-temporary impairments. See “—Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of Fixed Maturity Securities” for a discussion of the factors we consider in making these determinations.



The following table sets forth the amortized cost and gross unrealized losses of fixed maturity
securities attributable to the Closed Block Business where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost by 20% or more for the following timeframes:

The gross unrealized
losses were primarily concentrated in the asset-backed securities sector as of December 31, 2007 while the gross unrealized losses were primarily concentrated in the manufacturing sector as of December 31, 2006. We have not recognized the
gross unrealized losses shown in the table above as other-than-temporary impairments. See “—Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of Fixed Maturity Securities” for a discussion of the factors we consider in making these determinations.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of Fixed Maturity
Securities

We maintain separate monitoring processes for
public and private fixed maturities and create watch lists to highlight securities that require special scrutiny and management. Our public fixed maturity asset managers formally review all public fixed maturity holdings on a quarterly basis and
more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings downgrades, unexpected price variances, and/or industry specific concerns.

For private placements our credit and portfolio management processes help ensure prudent controls over valuation and management. We have
separate pricing and authorization processes to establish “checks and balances” for new investments. We apply consistent standards of credit analysis and due diligence for all transactions, whether they originate through our own in-house
origination staff or through agents. Our regional offices closely monitor the portfolios in their regions. We set all valuation standards centrally, and we assess the fair value of all investments quarterly.

Fixed maturity securities classified as held to maturity are those securities
where we have the intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity. These securities are reflected at amortized cost in our consolidated statements of financial position. Other fixed maturity securities are considered available for sale,
and, as a result, we record unrealized gains and losses to the extent that amortized cost is different from estimated fair value. All held to maturity securities and all available for sale securities with unrealized losses are subject to our review
to identify other-than-temporary impairments in value. In evaluating whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, we consider several factors including, but not limited to, the following:

•

the extent (generally if greater than 20%) and the duration (generally if greater than six months) of the decline;

•

the reasons for the decline in value (credit event, currency or interest rate related);

•

our ability and intent to hold our investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value; and

•

the financial condition of and near-term prospects of the issuer.

In addition, for our impairment review of asset-backed fixed maturity securities with a credit rating below AA, we forecast the prospective
future cash flows of the security and determine if the present value of those cash flows, discounted using the effective yield of the most recent interest accrual rate, has decreased from the previous reporting period. When a decrease from the prior
reporting period has occurred and the security’s market value is less than its carrying value, an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized by writing the security down to fair value.



When we determine that there is an other-than-temporary impairment, we record a writedown to estimated
fair value, which reduces the cost basis. The new cost basis of an impaired security is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value. In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment, the impaired
security is accounted for as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of the impairment. Accordingly, the discount (or reduced premium) based on the new cost basis is accreted into net investment income, and included in adjusted operating
income in future periods based upon the amount and timing of the expected future cash flows of the security, if the recoverable value of the investment based on those cash flows is greater than the carrying value of the investment after the
impairment. Estimated fair values for fixed maturities, other than private placement securities, are generally based on quoted market prices or prices obtained from independent pricing services. For private fixed maturities, fair value is determined
typically by using a discounted cash flow model, which relies upon the average of spread surveys collected from private market intermediaries who are active in both primary and secondary transactions and takes into account, among other factors, the
credit quality of the issuer and the reduced liquidity associated with private placements. In determining the fair value of certain securities, the discounted cash flow model may also use unobservable inputs, which reflect our own assumptions about
the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset. Impairments on fixed maturity securities are included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net” and are excluded from adjusted operating income.

Other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities attributable to
the Financial Services Businesses were $121 million and $23 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Included in the other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturities attributable to the Financial Services
Businesses in 2007 were $65 million of other-than-temporary impairments on asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, primarily recorded in the second half of 2007. Other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities
attributable to the Closed Block Business were $48 million and $31 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Included in the other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturities attributable to the Closed Block
Business in 2007 were $15 million of other-than-temporary impairments on asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, primarily recorded in the second half of 2007. For a further discussion of impairments, see “—Realized
Investment Gains” above.

Trading account assets supporting
insurance liabilities

Certain products included in
the retirement business we acquired from CIGNA, as well as certain products included in the International Insurance segment, are experience-rated, meaning that the investment results associated with these products will ultimately accrue to
contractholders. The investments supporting these experience-rated products, excluding commercial loans, are classified as trading. These trading investments are reflected on the balance sheet as “Trading account assets supporting insurance
liabilities, at fair value.” Realized and unrealized gains and losses for these investments are reported in “Asset management fees and other income.” Investment income for these investments is reported in “Net investment
income.” The following table sets forth the composition of this portfolio as of the dates indicated.

(1)

Commercial Mortgage Backed securities were previously presented within Corporate Securities.



As of December 31, 2007, as a percentage of amortized cost, 74% of the portfolio was comprised of
publicly traded securities, compared to 76% of the portfolio as of December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2007, 92% of the fixed maturity portfolio was classified as investment grade compared to 97% as of December 31, 2006. As of
December 31, 2007, 77% of the residential mortgage-backed securities were publicly traded agency pass-through securities, which are supported by implicit or explicit government guarantees and have credit ratings of AA or AAA. Collateralized
mortgage obligations including approximately $144 million secured by "ALT-A" mortgages, represented the remaining 23% of residential mortgage backed securities, which virtually all have credit ratings of A or better. As of December 31, 2007,
94% of commercial mortgage-backed securities have AAA credit ratings, 2% have AA credit ratings, 3% have A credit ratings, and the remaining 1% have BBB or BB credit ratings. As of December 31, 2007, included within asset-backed securities is
approximately $0.6 billion of securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages, including approximately 76% with AAA credit ratings, 19% with AA credit ratings, 3% with A credit ratings, and the remaining 2% with BBB credit ratings. For a discussion
of changes in the fair value of our trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities see “—Trading Account Assets Supporting Insurance Liabilities,” below.

Commercial Loans

Investment Mix

We originate domestic commercial mortgages using dedicated investment staff and a network of independent companies through our various regional offices
across the country. All loans are underwritten consistently to our standards using a proprietary quality rating system that has been developed from our experience in real estate and mortgage lending. Our loan portfolio strategy emphasizes
diversification by property type and geographic location.

Consumer loans are loans extended by Gibraltar Life to individuals for financing purchases of consumer goods and services and are guaranteed by third party guarantor companies.

Ongoing surveillance of the portfolio is performed and loans are placed on watch list status based on a predefined set of
criteria. We place loans on early warning status in cases where we detect that the physical condition of the property, the financial situation of the borrower or tenant or other market factors could lead to a loss of principal or interest. We
classify loans as closely monitored when there is a collateral deficiency or other credit events that will lead to a potential loss of principal or interest. Loans not in good standing are those loans where there is a high probability of loss of
principal, such as when the loan is in the process of foreclosure or the borrower is in bankruptcy. In our domestic operations, our workout and special servicing professionals manage the loans on the watch list. In our international portfolios, we
monitor delinquency in consumer loans on a pool basis and evaluate any servicing relationship and guarantees the same way we do for commercial loans.

As of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 respectively, we held approximately 12% and 11% of our general account investments in commercial
loans. This percentage is net of a $0.1 billion allowance for losses as of both December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. The increase in our general account investments in commercial loans as of December 31, 2007 reflects higher
origination activity in 2007. Unfavorable credit market conditions during the second half of 2007 led to decreased activity by securitization lenders in the commercial loan market, and therefore greater opportunities for increased originations by
portfolio lenders such as our general account. The average loan-to-value ratio on 2007 general account originations was below 65%,



and the average debt service coverage ratio on these originations was above 1.8 times, both consistent with originations over the last several years. As of
December 31, 2007, our general account investments in commercial loans had an average debt service coverage ratio of 1.9 times, and an average loan-to-value ratio of 53%, which is lower than our origination loan to value ratio due to principal
payments on the loan balances and appreciation of the underlying collateral value.

Our loan portfolio strategy emphasizes diversification by property type and geographic location. The following tables set forth the breakdown of the gross carrying values of our commercial loan portfolio by geographic
region and property type as of the dates indicated.



Commercial Loans by Contractual Maturity Date

The following tables set forth the breakdown of our commercial loan
portfolio by contractual maturity as of December 31, 2007.

Commercial Loan
Quality

We establish valuation allowances for loans that
are determined to be non-performing as a result of our loan review process. We define a non-performing loan as a loan for which it is probable that amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected. Valuation
allowances for a non-performing loan are recorded based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or based on the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. We
record subsequent adjustments to our valuation allowances when appropriate.

The following tables set forth the gross carrying value for commercial loans by loan classification as of the dates indicated:

The following table
sets forth the change in valuation allowances for our commercial loan portfolio as of the dates indicated:



Equity Securities

Investment Mix

The equity securities attributable to the Financial Services Businesses consist principally of investments in common and preferred stock of publicly
traded companies. The following table sets forth the composition of our equity securities portfolio attributable to the Financial Services Businesses and the associated gross unrealized gains and losses as of the dates indicated:

Public equity
securities include common stock mutual fund shares representing our interest in the underlying assets of certain of our separate account investments. These mutual funds invest primarily in high yield bond funds. The cost, gross unrealized gains,
gross unrealized losses, and fair value of these shares as of December 31, 2007 were $1,447 million, $27 million, $45 million, and $1,429 million, respectively. The cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses, and fair value of these
shares as of December 31, 2006 were $1,291 million, $46 million, $13 million, and $1,324 million, respectively.

The equity securities attributable to the Closed Block Business consist principally of investments in common and preferred stock of publicly traded
companies. The following table sets forth the composition of our equity securities portfolio attributable to the Closed Block Business and the associated gross unrealized gains and losses as of the dates indicated:

Unrealized Losses
from Equity Securities

The following table sets forth the
cost and gross unrealized losses of our equity securities attributable to the Financial Services Businesses where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost by 20% or more for the following timeframes:



The gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2007 were primarily concentrated in the manufacturing
and other sectors compared to December 31, 2006 where the gross unrealized losses were primarily concentrated in the services, retail and wholesale and other sectors. We have not recognized the gross unrealized losses shown in the table above
as other-than-temporary impairments. See “—Impairments of Equity Securities” for a discussion of the factors we consider in making these determinations.

The following table sets forth the cost and gross unrealized losses of our equity securities attributable to the Closed Block Business
where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost by 20% or more for the following timeframes:

The gross unrealized
losses as of December 31, 2007 were primarily concentrated in the finance and services sectors compared to December 31, 2006 where the gross unrealized losses were primarily concentrated in the utilities and transportation sectors. We have
not recognized the gross unrealized losses shown in the table above as other-than-temporary impairments. See “—Impairments of Equity Securities” for a discussion of the factors we consider in making these determinations.

Impairments of Equity Securities

For those equity securities classified as available for sale we record
unrealized gains and losses to the extent cost is different from estimated fair value. All securities with unrealized losses are subject to our review to identify other-than-temporary impairments in value. In evaluating whether a decline in value is
other-than-temporary, we consider several factors including, but not limited to, the following:

•

the extent (generally if greater than 20%) and the duration (generally if greater than six months) of the decline;

•

the reasons for the decline in value (credit event, currency or market fluctuation);

•

our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value; and

•

the financial condition of and near-term prospects of the issuer.

When we determine that there is an other-than-temporary impairment, we record a writedown to estimated fair value, which reduces the cost
basis. The new cost basis of an impaired security is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value. Estimated fair values for publicly traded equity securities are based on quoted market prices or prices obtained from independent
pricing services. Estimated fair values for privately traded equity securities are determined using valuation and discounted cash flow models that require a substantial level of judgment. In determining the fair value of certain privately traded
equity securities the discounted cash flow model may also use unobservable inputs, which reflect our own assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset. Impairments on equity securities are included in “Realized
investment gains (losses), net” and are excluded from adjusted operating income.

Impairments of equity securities attributable to the Financial Services Businesses were $43 million and $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Impairments of equity securities
attributable to the Closed Block Business were $32 million and $17 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. For a further discussion of impairments, see “—Realized Investment Gains” above.



Other Long-Term Investments

“Other long-term investments” are comprised as follows:

Trading Account
Assets Supporting Insurance Liabilities

“Trading
account assets supporting insurance liabilities, at fair value” include assets that support certain products included in the Retirement and International Insurance segments, which are experience rated, meaning that the investment results
associated with these products will ultimately accrue to contractholders. Realized and unrealized gains and losses for these investments are reported in “Asset management fees and other income.” Investment income for these investments is
reported in “Net investment income.”

Results for the
years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 include the recognition of investment losses of zero million, investment gains of $35 million and investment losses of $33 million, respectively, on “Trading account assets supporting insurance
liabilities, at fair value.” These gains and losses primarily represent interest-rate related mark-to-market adjustments on fixed maturity securities. Consistent with our treatment of “Realized investment gains (losses), net,” these
gains and losses, which will ultimately accrue to the contractholders, are excluded from adjusted operating income. In addition, results for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 include decreases of $13 million, decreases of $11
million and increases of $44 million, respectively, in contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes in the pool of investments that support these experience-rated contracts. These liability changes are reflected in “Interest credited
to policyholders’ account balances” and are also excluded from adjusted operating income. As prescribed by U.S. GAAP, changes in the fair value of commercial loans held in our general account, other than when associated with impairments,
are not recognized in income in the current period, while the impact of these changes in commercial loan value are reflected as a change in the liability to contractholders in the current period. Included in the amounts above related to the change
in the liability to contractholders is an increase related to commercial loans of $40 million, an increase related to commercial loans of $14 million and a decrease related to commercial loans of $12 million, respectively, for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Divested Businesses

Our income from continuing operations includes results
from several businesses that have been or will be sold or exited that do not qualify for “discontinued operations” accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP. The results of these divested businesses are reflected in our Corporate and Other
operations, but excluded from adjusted operating income. A summary of the results of these divested business that have been excluded from adjusted operating income is as follows for the periods indicated:



In the second quarter of 2007, we exited the equity sales, trading and research operations of the
Prudential Equity Group, and the results of these operations are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning Prudential Equity Group. We
retained certain securities relating to trading exchange memberships of these former operations. These securities were received in 2006 in connection with the commencement of public trading of stock exchange shares. The changes in the fair value of
these shares are reflected within divested businesses for all periods presented.

In 2003, we sold our property and casualty insurance companies that operated nationally in 48 states outside of New Jersey, and the District of Columbia, to Liberty Mutual Group, and our New Jersey property and
casualty insurance companies to Palisades Group. Results of these property and casualty insurance operations are reflected as a divested business for all periods presented. We have retained liabilities for pre-closing litigation and obligations
under reinsurance contracts provided in connection with potential adverse loss development on the business sold to Liberty Mutual Group.

In 2000, we announced a restructuring of Prudential Securities’ capital markets activities in which we exited the lead-managed equity underwriting
business for corporate issuers and the institutional fixed income business. Results of these operations are reflected as a divested business for all periods presented. As of December 31, 2007 we had remaining assets amounting to $116 million
related to Prudential Securities’ institutional fixed income activities.

During 1996 and 1997, we sold substantially all of our residential first mortgage banking and related operations of Prudential Home Mortgage Company, Inc. and its affiliates. Results of these operations are reflected
as a divested business for all periods presented. We remain liable with respect to certain claims concerning these operations prior to sale. We believe that we have adequately reserved in all material respects for the remaining liabilities.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

Prudential Financial

The principal sources of funds available to Prudential Financial, the parent holding company and registrant, to meet its obligations, including the
payment of shareholder dividends, debt service, operating expenses, capital contributions and obligations to subsidiaries are dividends, returns of capital, interest income from its subsidiaries, and cash and short-term investments. These sources of
funds are complemented by Prudential Financial’s access to the capital markets and bank facilities. We believe that cash flows from these sources are sufficient to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of Prudential Financial, including
reasonably foreseeable contingencies. As of December 31, 2007, Prudential Financial had cash and short-term investments of approximately $4.704 billion, an increase of $3.600 billion from December 31, 2006. Prudential Financial’s
principal sources and uses of cash and short-term investments for the year ended December 31, 2007 were as follows:

(1)

Includes dividends and/or returns of capital of $1.214 billion from Prudential Insurance, $682 million from international insurance and investments subsidiaries, $572 million from
securities subsidiaries, $268 million from asset management subsidiaries, $192 million from American Skandia, $176 million from other insurance subsidiaries, $80 million from an investment subsidiary conducting spread-lending activities, and $28
million from other businesses.

(2)

Proceeds from the issuance of retail medium-term notes are used primarily to purchase funding agreements from Prudential Insurance. See “—Financing Activities” for a
discussion of our retail note program.

(3)

See “—Financing Activities.”

(4)

Includes a loan repayment from an investment subsidiary of $3.500 billion that was originally funded with the proceeds from the convertible senior notes issued in 2005 and 2006.
Offsetting these repayments are loans of $2.361 billion to our asset management subsidiaries and a $250 million loan to a domestic insurance subsidiary used to finance certain regulatory reserves required to be held in connection with the
reinsurance of certain term life policies.

(5)

Includes capital contributions of $170 million to international insurance and investments subsidiaries, $100 million to American Skandia, $85 from other insurance subsidiaries, $50
million to asset management subsidiaries, and $10 million from other businesses.

Sources of Capital

Prudential Financial is a holding company whose principal asset is its investments in subsidiaries. Prudential Financial’s capitalization and use of
financial leverage are consistent with its ratings targets. We also monitor Prudential Financial’s ability to cover its fixed cash obligations, such as interest expense, to ensure it is at a level



consistent with its ratings targets. Our long-term senior debt rating targets for Prudential Financial are “A” for Standard & Poor’s
Rating Services, or S&P, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., or Moody’s, and Fitch Ratings Ltd., or Fitch, and “a” for A.M. Best Company, or A.M. Best. We seek to capitalize all of our subsidiaries and businesses in accordance
with their ratings targets. Our financial strength rating targets for our domestic life insurance companies are “AA/Aa/AA” for S&P, Moody’s and Fitch, respectively, and “A+” for A.M. Best. For our current ratings
information see “Business—Ratings.”

The primary
components of capitalization for the Financial Services Businesses consist of the equity we attribute to the Financial Services Businesses (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income related to unrealized gains and losses on investments and
pension and postretirement benefits) and outstanding capital debt of the Financial Services Businesses, as discussed below under “—Financing Activities.” Based on these components, the capital position of the Financial Services
Businesses as of December 31, 2007 was as follows:

(1)

Our capital debt to total capital ratio was 17.8% as of December 31, 2007.

As shown in the table above, as of December 31, 2007, the Financial Services Businesses had approximately $26.8 billion
in capital, all of which was available to support the aggregate capital requirements of its three divisions and its Corporate and Other operations. Based on our assessments of these businesses and operations, we believe that this level of capital
exceeds the amount required to support current business risks by over $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2007. Although a significant portion of these resources are in our regulated subsidiaries, and their availability may be subject to prior
regulatory notice, approval or non-disapproval, we believe these resources give us substantial financial flexibility.

We believe that migrating toward a capital structure comprised of 70% attributed equity, 20% capital debt and 10% hybrid equity securities is consistent
with our ratings objectives for Prudential Financial, and would support the issuance of approximately $4.5 billion of additional capital debt and hybrid equity securities. This capital structure assumes that the hybrid equity securities we issue
achieve 75% equity credit, with the remaining 25% treated as capital debt, and that market conditions exist which make hybrid equity securities a cost effective source of capital.

The Risk Based Capital, or RBC, ratio is the primary measure by which we evaluate the capital adequacy of Prudential
Insurance, which includes businesses in both the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. We manage Prudential Insurance’s RBC ratio to a level consistent with our ratings targets. RBC is determined by statutory formulas
that consider risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets, insurance-related risks associated with Prudential Insurance’s products, interest rate risks and general business risks. The RBC ratio calculations are intended to
assist insurance regulators in measuring the adequacy of Prudential Insurance’s statutory capitalization.

In April 2007, we transferred $1 billion of assets within the qualified pension plan under Section 420 of the Internal Revenue Code from assets
supporting pension benefits to assets supporting retiree medical benefits. The transfer resulted in a reduction to the prepaid benefit for the qualified pension plan and an offsetting decrease in the accrued benefit liability for the postretirement
plan with no net effect on stockholders’ equity on the Company’s consolidated financial position. The net effect of this transfer added approximately $600 million to Prudential Insurance's statutory capital and increased Prudential
Insurance's RBC ratio.

In the second quarter of 2007,
Prudential Insurance declared an ordinary dividend of $97 million and an additional extraordinary dividend of $1.2 billion to Prudential Holdings, LLC. Of this total, $1.0 billion was paid to Prudential Holdings during the second quarter of 2007 and
in turn distributed to Prudential Financial. The remaining $297 million was paid to Prudential Holdings in the third quarter of 2007, and in turn $214 million



was distributed to Prudential Financial. In June 2007, American Skandia Life Assurance Corporation paid an ordinary dividend of $112 million to American
Skandia, which American Skandia subsequently paid as a dividend to Prudential Financial.

Uses of Capital

Share Repurchases.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, we repurchased 32.0 million shares of our Common Stock at a total cost of $3.0 billion.

In November 2007, Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors authorized
the Company to repurchase up to $3.5 billion of its outstanding Common Stock in calendar year 2008. The timing and amount of any repurchases under this authorization will be determined by management based upon market conditions and other
considerations, and the repurchases may be effected in the open market, through derivative, accelerated repurchase and other negotiated transactions and through prearranged trading plans complying with Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Exchange Act. The 2008
stock repurchase program supersedes all previous repurchase programs.

Rabbi Trust.

In July 2007, we established an irrevocable trust, commonly referred to as a “rabbi trust,” for the purpose of holding assets of the Company to be used to satisfy its obligations with
respect to certain non-qualified retirement plans. Assets held in a rabbi trust are available to the general creditors of the Company in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy. We may from time to time at our discretion make contributions to the
trust to fund accrued benefits payable to participants in one or more of the plans, and, in the case of a change in control of the Company, as defined in the trust agreement, we will be required to make contributions to the plans to fund the accrued
benefits, vested and unvested, payable on a pretax basis to participants in the plans. We made a discretionary payment to the trust fund in July 2007 in the amount of $95 million.

Restrictions on Dividends and Returns of Capital from Subsidiaries

Our insurance and various other companies are subject to regulatory
limitations on the payment of dividends and other transfers of funds to affiliates. With respect to Prudential Insurance, New Jersey insurance law provides that, except in the case of extraordinary dividends or distributions, all dividends or
distributions paid by Prudential Insurance may be declared or paid only from unassigned surplus, as determined pursuant to statutory accounting principles, less unrealized investment gains and losses and revaluation of assets. As of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, Prudential Insurance’s unassigned surplus was $5.021 billion and $2.825 billion, respectively. Prudential Insurance recorded applicable adjustments for unrealized investment gains of $1.582 billion and $1.239
billion, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Prudential Insurance must also notify the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance of its intent to pay a dividend or distribution. If the dividend or distribution, together with
other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceed a specified statutory limit it is considered an extraordinary dividend or distribution and Prudential Insurance must obtain the prior non-disapproval of the Department.
The current statutory limitation applicable to New Jersey life insurers generally is the greater of 10% of the prior calendar year’s statutory surplus, $6.981 billion as of December 31, 2007, or the prior calendar year’s statutory net
gain from operations excluding realized investment gains and losses, $1.024 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. In addition to these regulatory limitations, the terms of the IHC debt contain restrictions potentially limiting dividends
by Prudential Insurance applicable to the Financial Services Businesses in the event the Closed Block Business is in financial distress and under certain other circumstances.

The laws regulating dividends of the other states and foreign jurisdictions where our other insurance companies are
domiciled are similar, but not identical, to New Jersey’s. Pursuant to Gibraltar Life’s reorganization, in addition to regulatory restrictions, there are certain restrictions on Gibraltar Life’s ability to pay dividends to Prudential
Financial. We anticipate that it will be several years before these restrictions will allow Gibraltar Life to pay such dividends. There are also regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by The Prudential Life Insurance Company, Ltd., or
Prudential of Japan, which began paying dividends in 2006. During 2007, Prudential of Japan paid a dividend of $101 million to Prudential International Insurance Holdings, Ltd., which subsequently distributed the proceeds to Prudential Financial.
The ability of our asset management subsidiaries, and the majority of our other operating subsidiaries, to pay dividends is largely unrestricted.



Alternative Sources of Liquidity

Prudential Financial, the parent holding company, maintains an intercompany liquidity account that is designed to maximize
the use of cash by facilitating the lending and borrowing of funds between the parent holding company and its affiliates on a daily basis. Depending on the overall availability of cash, the parent holding company invests excess cash on a short-term
basis or borrows funds in the capital markets. Additional longer term liquidity is available through inter-affiliate borrowing arrangements. It also has access to bank facilities. See “—Lines of Credit and Other Credit Facilities.”

Liquidity of Subsidiaries

Domestic Insurance Subsidiaries

General Liquidity

Liquidity refers to a company’s ability to generate sufficient cash
flows to meet the needs of its operations. We manage the liquidity of our domestic insurance operations to ensure stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of cash flows to meet all of our obligations. Liquidity is provided by a variety of
sources, as described more fully below, including portfolios of liquid assets. The investment portfolios of our domestic operations are integral to the overall liquidity of those operations. We segment our investment portfolios and employ an
asset/liability management approach specific to the requirements of our product lines. This enhances the discipline applied in managing the liquidity, as well as the interest rate and credit risk profiles, of each portfolio in a manner consistent
with the unique characteristics of the product liabilities. We use a projection process for cash flows from operations to ensure sufficient liquidity to meet projected cash outflows, including claims.

Liquidity is measured against internally developed benchmarks that take into
account the characteristics of the asset portfolio. The results are affected substantially by the overall asset type and quality of our investments.

Cash Flow

The principal sources of liquidity for Prudential Insurance and our other domestic insurance subsidiaries are premiums and annuity considerations,
investment and fee income and investment maturities and sales associated with our insurance and annuity operations. The principal uses of that liquidity include benefits, claims, dividends paid to policyholders, and payments to policyholders and
contractholders in connection with surrenders, withdrawals and net policy loan activity. Other uses of liquidity include commissions, general and administrative expenses, purchases of investments, and payments in connection with financing
activities.

We believe that the cash flows from our insurance
and annuity operations are adequate to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of these operations, including under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios. The continued adequacy of this liquidity will depend upon factors such as future
securities market conditions, changes in interest rate levels and policyholder perceptions of our financial strength, each of which could lead to reduced cash inflows or increased cash outflows. In addition, market volatility can impact the level of
capital required to support our businesses, particularly in our annuity business.

Our domestic insurance operations’ cash flows from investment activities result from repayments of principal, proceeds from maturities and sales of invested assets and investment income, net of amounts
reinvested. The primary liquidity risks with respect to these cash flows are the risk of default by debtors or bond insurers, our counterparties’ willingness to extend repurchase and/or securities lending arrangements and market volatility. As
of December 31, 2007 and 2006, our domestic insurance entities had lendable assets of $76 billion and $78 billion, respectively. Of this amount, $16 billion and $18 billion, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, was on loan, the
remainder of which, depending on market conditions, are available to be financed through repurchase agreements or securities lending arrangements. We closely manage these risks through our credit risk management process and regular monitoring of our
liquidity position.

In managing the liquidity of our domestic
insurance operations, we also consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions when selecting assets to support these



contractual obligations. We use surrender charges and other contract provisions to mitigate the extent, timing and profitability impact of withdrawals of
funds by customers from annuity contracts and deposit liabilities. The following table sets forth withdrawal characteristics of our general account annuity reserves and deposit liabilities (based on statutory liability values) as of the dates
indicated.

Individual life
insurance policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than our annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may incur surrender charges and be subject to a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy. Annuity
benefits under group annuity contracts are generally not subject to early withdrawal.

Gross account withdrawals for our domestic insurance operations’ products amounted to approximately $19.4 billion and $21.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Because these
withdrawals were consistent with our assumptions in asset/liability management, the associated cash outflows did not have a material adverse impact on our overall liquidity.

Liquid Assets

Liquid assets include cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, fixed maturities that are not designated as held to maturity and public equity
securities. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, our domestic insurance operations had liquid assets of $137.0 billion and $140.9 billion, respectively. The portion of liquid assets comprised of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments
was $7.1 billion and $8.4 billion as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, $112.5 billion, or 90%, of the fixed maturity investments that are not designated as held to maturity within our domestic insurance
company general account portfolios were rated investment grade. The remaining $13.0 billion, or 10%, of these fixed maturity investments were rated non-investment grade. We consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets (for example,
type of asset and credit quality) in calculating internal liquidity measures in order to evaluate the adequacy of our domestic insurance operations’ liquidity under a variety of stress scenarios. We believe that the liquidity profile of our
assets is sufficient to satisfy current liquidity requirements, including under foreseeable stress scenarios.

Given the size and liquidity profile of our investment portfolios, we believe that claim experience varying from our projections does not constitute a
significant liquidity risk. Our asset/liability management process takes into account the expected maturity of investments and expected claim payments as well as the specific nature and risk profile of the liabilities. Historically, there has been
no significant variation between the expected maturities of our investments and the payment of claims.

Our domestic insurance companies’ liquidity is managed through access to substantial investment portfolios as well as a variety of instruments
available for funding and/or managing short-term cash flow mismatches, including from time to time those arising from claim levels in excess of projections. To the extent we need to pay claims in excess of projections, we may borrow temporarily or
sell investments sooner than anticipated to pay these claims, which may result in realized investment gains or losses or increased borrowing costs affecting results of operations. For a further discussion of realized investment gains or losses, see
“—Realized Investment



Gains and General Account Investments—Realized Investment Gains.” We believe that borrowing temporarily or selling investments earlier than
anticipated will not have a material impact on the liquidity of our domestic insurance companies. Payment of claims and sale of investments earlier than anticipated would have an impact on the reported level of cash flow from operating and investing
activities, respectively, in our financial statements.

Prudential Funding, LLC

Prudential Funding,
LLC, or Prudential Funding, a wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Insurance, serves as an additional source of financing to meet the working capital needs of Prudential Insurance and its subsidiaries. Prudential Funding also lends to other
subsidiaries of Prudential Financial up to limits established with the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance. To the extent that other subsidiaries of Prudential Financial have financing needs in excess of these limits, these needs are met
through financing from Prudential Financial directly or from third parties. Prudential Funding operates under a support agreement with Prudential Insurance whereby Prudential Insurance has agreed to maintain Prudential Funding’s positive
tangible net worth at all times. Prudential Funding borrows funds primarily through the direct issuance of commercial paper. The impact of Prudential Funding’s financing capacity on liquidity is considered in the internal liquidity measures of
the domestic insurance operations.

As of December 31,
2007, Prudential Financial, Prudential Insurance and Prudential Funding had unsecured committed lines of credit totaling $5.0 billion. There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities as of December 31, 2007. For a further discussion
of lines of credit, see “—Lines of Credit and Other Credit Facilities.”

International Insurance Subsidiaries

In our international insurance operations, liquidity is provided through ongoing operations as well as portfolios of liquid assets. In managing the liquidity and the interest and credit risk profiles of our international insurance
portfolios, we employ a discipline similar to the discipline employed for domestic insurance subsidiaries. We monitor liquidity through the use of internal liquidity measures, taking into account the liquidity of the asset portfolios.

As with our domestic operations, in managing the liquidity of these
operations, we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions in selecting assets to support these contractual obligations. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, our international insurance
subsidiaries had total general account insurance related liabilities (other than dividends payable to policyholders) of $54.4 billion and $49.1 billion, respectively. Of those amounts, $29.5 billion and $27.8 billion, respectively, were associated
with Gibraltar Life. Concurrent with our acquisition of Gibraltar Life in April 2001, substantially all of its insurance liabilities were restructured under a plan of reorganization to include special surrender penalties on existing policies. These
charges mitigate the extent, timing, and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers and apply to $21.1 billion and $21.2 billion of Gibraltar Life’s insurance related reserves as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The following table sets forth the schedule (for each fiscal
year ending March 31) of special surrender charges on Gibraltar Life policies that are in force:




6%


%


%

Policies issued by
Gibraltar Life post-acquisition are not subject to the above restructured policy surrender charge schedule. Policies issued post-acquisition are generally subject to discretionary withdrawal at contract value, less applicable surrender charges,
which currently start at 5% or more.

A special dividend to
certain Gibraltar Life policyholders was payable in 2005 and will again be payable in 2009. The special dividend is based on 70% of the net increase in the fair value of certain real estate and loans,



net of transaction costs and taxes, included in the Gibraltar Life reorganization plan. As of December 31, 2007, a liability of $421 million related to
the special dividend is included in “Policyholders’ dividends.” The special dividend will take the form of either additional policy values or cash. Gibraltar Life’s investment portfolio is structured to provide adequate liquidity
for the special dividend.

Prudential of Japan had $19.2
billion and $16.8 billion of general account insurance related liabilities, other than dividends to policyholders, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Prudential of Japan did not have a material amount of general account annuity
reserves or deposit liabilities subject to discretionary withdrawal as of December 31, 2007 or 2006. Additionally, we believe that the individual life insurance policies sold by Prudential of Japan do not have significant withdrawal risk
because policyholders may incur surrender charges and must undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, our international insurance subsidiaries had cash and short-term investments of approximately $1.1 billion, and
fixed maturity investments, other than those designated as held to maturity, with fair values of $42.1 billion and $37.0 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, $40.9 billion, or 97%, of the fixed maturity investments that are not
designated as held to maturity within our international insurance subsidiaries were rated investment grade. The remaining $1.2 billion, or 3%, of these fixed maturity investments were rated non-investment grade. Of those amounts, $22.9 billion of
the investment grade fixed maturity investments and $0.7 billion of the non-investment grade fixed maturity investments were associated with Gibraltar Life. We consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets (for example, type of
asset and credit quality) in calculating internal liquidity measures to evaluate the adequacy of our international insurance operations’ liquidity under stress scenarios. We believe that ongoing operations and the liquidity profile of our
international insurance assets provide sufficient liquidity under reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios.

We employ various hedging strategies to manage potential exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements as discussed in “—Results of
Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—International Insurance and Investments Division.” Cash settlements from this hedging activity result in cash flows to or from Prudential Financial and is dependent on changes in
foreign currency exchange rates and the notional amount of the exposures hedged.

Asset Management Subsidiaries

Our
asset management businesses, which include real estate, public and private fixed income and public equity asset management, as well as commercial mortgage origination, servicing and securitization, proprietary investing and retail investment
products, such as mutual funds and other retail services, are largely unregulated from the standpoint of dividends and distributions. Our asset management subsidiaries through which we conduct these businesses generally do not have restrictions on
the amount of distributions they can make, and they provide a stable source of significant cash flow to Prudential Financial.

The principal sources of liquidity for our asset management subsidiaries include asset management fees, revenues from proprietary investments and
commercial mortgage operations, and available borrowing lines from internal sources including Prudential Funding and Prudential Financial, as well as from third parties. The principal uses of liquidity include the financing associated with our
proprietary investments and commercial mortgage operations, including retained mortgage-backed securities, general and administrative expenses, and distribution of dividends and returns of capital to Prudential Financial.

The primary liquidity risks for our asset management subsidiaries include the
potential impacts of adverse market conditions and poor investment management performance on the profitability of the businesses. Our asset management subsidiaries continue to maintain sufficiently liquid balance sheets. As of December 31, 2007
and 2006, our asset management subsidiaries had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.153 billion and $949 million, respectively. We believe the cash flows from our asset management businesses are adequate to satisfy the current
liquidity requirements of their operations, as well as requirements that could arise under foreseeable stress scenarios, which are monitored through the use of internal measures.



Prudential Securities Group

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, Prudential Securities Group’s assets totaled $8.1 billion and $7.4 billion, respectively.
Prudential Securities Group owns our investment in Wachovia Securities, which we account for under the equity method, as well as other wholly owned businesses. On October 1, 2007, Wachovia completed the acquisition of A.G. Edwards, Inc., or
A.G. Edwards, for $6.8 billion and on January 1, 2008 combined the retail securities brokerage business of A.G. Edwards with Wachovia Securities. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning this
acquisition and its effect on our investment in Wachovia Securities. Distributions from our investment in Wachovia Securities to Prudential Securities Group totaled $366 million and $277 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. The other wholly owned businesses in Prudential Securities Group continue to maintain sufficiently liquid balance sheets, consisting mostly of cash and cash equivalents, segregated client assets, and short-term receivables from
clients, broker-dealers, and exchanges. As registered broker-dealers and members of various self-regulatory organizations, our U.S. registered broker-dealer subsidiaries and Wachovia Securities are subject to the SEC’s Uniform Net Capital Rule,
as well as the net capital requirements of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the various securities and commodities exchanges of which they are members. Compliance with these capital requirements could limit the ability of these
operations to pay dividends.

On June 6, 2007, we
announced our decision to exit the equity sales, trading, and research operations of the Prudential Equity Group, or PEG, the results of which were historically included in the Financial Advisory Segment. As discussed in Note 3 of the Consolidated
Financial Statements, PEG’s operations were substantially wound down by June 30, 2007 and are reflected in discontinued operations for all periods presented. PEG had sufficient capital and liquidity to cover the costs associated with the
divestiture.

Financing Activities

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, total short- and long-term debt of
the Company on a consolidated basis was $29.8 billion and $24.0 billion, respectively, which includes $16.7 billion and $11.6 billion, respectively, related to the parent company, Prudential Financial.

Prudential Financial is authorized to borrow funds from various sources to
meet its capital needs, as well as the capital needs of its subsidiaries. The following table sets forth the outstanding short- and long-term debt of Prudential Financial, other than debt to consolidated subsidiaries, as of the dates indicated:

Prudential
Financial’s short-term debt includes commercial paper borrowings that are primarily used to fund the working capital needs of Prudential Financial’s subsidiaries and Prudential Financial. As of December 31, 2007, Prudential
Financial’s commercial paper borrowings had increased, compared to December 31, 2006, primarily due to working capital needs in the Asset Management and International Investments segments. Borrowings under this program were $1.293 billion
and $282 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In November 2007, Prudential Financial increased the issuance capacity of its Commercial Paper program from $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion. The weighted average interest rate on the
commercial paper borrowings under this program was 5.33% and 5.00% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.



During the latter half of 2007, the credit markets, and specifically the commercial paper market, were
adversely impacted by concerns over the sub-prime mortgage exposure of certain financial institutions and asset-backed commercial paper programs. As a result, the financing cost of Prudential Financial commercial paper increased moderately versus
its historical cost basis relative to the target federal funds rate as investors demanded a premium for “top-tier split” rated commercial paper; that is, commercial paper rated A-1 by Standard & Poor’s, P-2 by Moody’s
and F1 by Fitch.

While the cost of financing Prudential
Financial commercial paper increased during the year, relative to our historical cost basis versus the target federal funds rate, we experienced no material change in investor demand for our commercial paper, which remains sufficient to meet our
financing needs. As discussed further below, in December 2007, Prudential Financial issued $3 billion of convertible debt and $1.5 billion of Medium-Term Notes, a portion of the proceeds of which were used to reduce Prudential Financial’s
commercial paper borrowings. We continue to monitor market conditions and believe we have sufficient flexibility to reduce our borrowings under the Prudential Financial commercial paper program, if needed, through our alternative sources of
liquidity, as discussed under “—Alternative Sources of Liquidity,” liquidation of assets, drawing on our available lines of credit or pursuing other options as appropriate.

In March 2006, Prudential Financial filed an updated shelf registration statement with the SEC, superseding its previous
shelf registration statement, that permits the issuance of public debt, equity and hybrid securities. The updated shelf registration statement was established under the SEC rules adopted in 2005 that allow for automatic effectiveness upon filing,
pay-as-you-go fees and the ability to add securities by filing automatically effective amendments for companies qualifying as “Well-Known Seasoned Issuers.” As a result, this new shelf registration statement has no stated issuance
capacity.

In March 2006, Prudential Financial filed a
prospectus supplement for a new Medium-Term Notes, Series D program under the shelf registration statement, which superseded its Medium-Term Notes, Series C program. As of December 31, 2007, the Company was authorized to issue up to $5 billion
of notes under the Series D program and approximately $0.5 billion remained available under the program. In January 2008, authorized issuance capacity of the Series D program was increased by $5 billion to $10 billion. During 2007, Prudential
Financial issued $2.295 billion of medium term notes under the Series D program with $295 million of these notes maturing in one to three years, $250 million maturing in five years, $1.0 billion maturing in ten years, and $750 million maturing in 30
years. The net proceeds from the sale of these notes were used to fund operating needs of our subsidiaries and for general corporate purposes, including with respect to some of these issuances, a loan to a domestic insurance subsidiary used to
finance certain regulatory reserves required to be held in connection with the intercompany reinsurance of certain term life policies. A portion of the offering proceeds used to fund the operating needs of subsidiaries were also used to reduce
Prudential Financial’s commercial paper borrowings and to extend the duration of our borrowings to better match the duration of the subsidiaries’ related assets. In addition, in September 2007, Prudential Financial issued ¥9 billion of
20-year medium-term notes to an international insurance subsidiary under the Series D program. The net proceeds from the yen denominated notes, as well as the related future interest and principal payments, were hedged to U.S. dollars using
derivative instruments. The net proceeds from the yen denominated notes were used for general corporate purposes and their carrying value as of December 31, 2007 was $81 million. The weighted average interest rates on Prudential
Financial’s medium-term and senior notes, including the effect of interest rate hedging activity, were 5.40% and 5.48% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, excluding the effect of debt issued to consolidated
subsidiaries. In January 2008, Prudential Financial issued $600 million of 5-year medium term notes under the Series D program. The net proceeds from the sale of these notes were used to fund operating needs of our subsidiaries and for general
corporate purposes.

In March 2006, Prudential Financial filed a prospectus supplement under the shelf registration statement for its retail medium-term notes, including the InterNotes

®

program, which superseded the 2005 retail medium-term notes program. The Company is authorized to issue up to $2.5 billion of notes under the new program. As of December 31, 2007, approximately $0.7 billion remained available under the
program. This retail medium-term notes program serves as a funding source for a spread product of our Retirement segment that is economically similar to funding agreement-backed medium-term notes issued to institutional investors, except that the
retail notes are senior obligations of Prudential Financial and are purchased by retail investors. The weighted average interest rates on Prudential Financial’s retail medium-term notes were 5.61% and 5.49% for the years ended December 31,
2007 and 2006, respectively, excluding the effect of debt issued to consolidated subsidiaries.



In January, April, July and October 2007, Prudential Financial filed prospectus supplements to register
under the shelf registration statement resales of the floating rate convertible senior notes that were issued in a private placement in November 2005 ($2.0 billion) and the shares of restricted Prudential Financial Common Stock issued to certain
holders of the convertible senior notes upon conversion. On April 13, 2007, Prudential Financial announced its intention to call all such outstanding floating rate convertible senior notes for redemption on May 21, 2007. Prior to the
redemption, substantially all holders elected to convert their senior notes as provided under their terms. The senior notes required net settlement in shares; therefore, upon conversion, the holders received cash equal to the par amount of the
senior notes surrendered for conversion plus accrued interest and shares of Prudential Financial Common Stock for the portion of the settlement amount in excess of the par amount. The settlement amount in excess of the par amount was based upon the
excess of the closing market price of Prudential Financial Common Stock for a 10-day period defined under the terms of the senior notes, or $100.80 per share, over the initial conversion price of $90 per share. Accordingly, at conversion Prudential
Financial issued 2,367,887 shares of Common Stock from treasury. The conversion had no impact on our results of operations and resulted in a net increase to shareholders’ equity of $44 million, reflecting the tax benefit associated with the
conversion of the senior notes. The payment of principal and accrued interest was funded primarily through the liquidation of the investment grade fixed income investment portfolio purchased with the proceeds from the original issuance of these
notes. Prudential Financial is obligated to file once per quarter a prospectus supplement to register resales of restricted Prudential Financial Common Stock issued to certain holders of these convertible senior notes.

In April, July, August and October 2007, and January 2008, Prudential
Financial filed prospectus supplements to register under the shelf registration statement resales of the floating rate convertible senior notes that were issued in a private placement in December 2006 ($2.0 billion). These convertible senior notes
are convertible by the holders at any time after issuance into cash and shares of Prudential Financial’s Common Stock. The conversion price, $104.21 per share, is subject to adjustment upon certain corporate events. The conversion feature
requires net settlement in shares; therefore, upon conversion, a holder would receive cash equal to the par amount of the convertible notes surrendered for conversion and shares of Prudential Financial Common Stock only for the portion of the
settlement amount in excess of the par amount, if any. The interest rate on these convertible senior notes is a floating rate equal to 3-month LIBOR minus 2.4%, to be reset quarterly. These convertible senior notes are redeemable by Prudential
Financial, at par plus accrued interest, any time on or after December 13, 2007. Holders of the notes may also require Prudential Financial to repurchase the notes, at par plus accrued interest, on contractually specified dates, of which the
first such date was December 12, 2007. On December 12, 2007, $117 million of senior notes were repurchased by Prudential Financial at the request of the holders. The next date on which holders of the notes may require Prudential Financial
to repurchase the notes is December 12, 2008. A majority of the proceeds from the original issuance of these notes were initially invested in an investment grade fixed income portfolio, while the remainder of the proceeds were used for general
corporate purposes. Prior to the first date that holders of the notes could require us to repurchase the notes, December 12, 2007, we liquidated the investment portfolio. The remaining proceeds are invested in short-term instruments and may be
used to fund operations in lieu of other short-term borrowings in future periods. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning these convertible senior notes. Prudential Financial is obligated to file
once per quarter a prospectus supplement to register resales of these convertible senior notes and shares of Prudential Financial Common Stock, if any, issued to holders of these convertible senior notes.

In December 2007, Prudential Financial issued $3.0 billion of floating rate
convertible senior notes in a private placement. These convertible senior notes are convertible by the holders at any time after issuance into cash and shares of Prudential Financial’s Common Stock. The conversion price, $132.39 per share, is
subject to adjustment upon certain corporate events. The conversion feature requires net settlement in shares; therefore, upon conversion, a holder would receive cash equal to the par amount of the convertible notes surrendered for conversion and
shares of Prudential Financial Common Stock only for the portion of the settlement amount in excess of the par amount, if any. Prudential Financial used the majority of the offering proceeds to fund operating needs of our subsidiaries, purchase
short-term investment grade fixed income investments, and general corporate purposes, as well as to repurchase shares of its common stock under the 2007 share repurchase authorization. A portion of the offering proceeds used to fund the operating
needs of subsidiaries were used to reduce Prudential Financial’s commercial paper borrowings and to extend the duration of our borrowings to better match the duration of the subsidiaries’ related assets. These convertible senior notes are
redeemable by Prudential Financial, at par plus accrued interest, on or after June 16, 2009. Holders of the notes may also require Prudential



Financial to repurchase the notes, at par plus accrued interest, on contractually specified dates, of which the first such date is June 15, 2009. The
interest rate on these convertible senior notes is a floating rate equal to 3-month LIBOR minus 1.63%, to be reset quarterly. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning these convertible senior notes.
Prudential Financial is obligated to file once per quarter a prospectus supplement under the shelf registration statement to register resales of these convertible senior notes and shares of Prudential Financial Common Stock, if any, issued to
holders of these convertible senior notes.

In September 2006,
Prudential Financial updated its European medium-term notes program under the shelf registration statement. The Company is authorized to issue up to $1.5 billion of notes under the program. As of December 31, 2007, there was no debt outstanding
under this program.

Current capital markets activities for the
Company on a consolidated basis principally consist of unsecured short-term and long-term debt borrowings issued by Prudential Funding and Prudential Financial, unsecured third party bank borrowings, and asset-based or secured financing. The secured
financing arrangements include transactions such as securities lending and repurchase agreements, which we generally use to finance liquid securities in our short-term spread portfolios, primarily within Prudential Insurance. These short-term spread
portfolios hold asset-backed securities, a portion of which are collateralized by sub-prime mortgages. See “Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments—General Account Investments—Fixed Maturity Securities” for a
further discussion of our asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime holdings. We continue to have significant unused secured financing capacity; however, the availability of this financing to roll-over existing financing and to access our
unused capacity is contingent on market conditions and may not be available to us on terms that are cost effective.

The following table sets forth total consolidated borrowings of the Company as of the dates indicated:

(1)

As of December 31, 2006, included $250 million of fixed rate surplus notes that matured in July 2007.

(2)

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, included $1.600 billion and $600 million, respectively, of surplus notes issued by subsidiaries of Prudential Insurance to fund regulatory
reserves.

(3)

As of both December 31, 2007 and 2006, $1.750 billion of limited and non-recourse debt outstanding was attributable to the Closed Block Business.

(4)

Does not include $8.5 billion and $6.5 billion of medium-term notes of consolidated trust entities secured by funding agreements purchased with the proceeds of such notes as of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These notes are included in “Policyholders’ account balances.” For additional information see “—Funding Agreement Notes Issuance Program.”

Total general debt obligations increased by $5.456 billion from
December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007, reflecting a $2.559 billion net increase in long-term debt and a $2.897 billion net increase in short-term debt. The net increase in long-term debt was primarily driven by the net issuance of
medium-term notes, retail medium-term notes, and surplus notes, partially offset by the reclassification of long-term debt to short-term debt, during



2007. The net increase in short-term debt was primarily due to higher outstanding commercial paper supporting our operating businesses, floating rate
convertible senior notes issued in December 2007, and the reclassification of long-term debt to short-term debt, partially offset by the repayment of the floating rate convertible senior notes issued in November 2005.

Prudential Funding’s commercial paper and master note borrowings were
$7.3 billion as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. The weighted average interest rates on the commercial paper borrowings and master notes were 5.10% and 4.97% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Prudential Financial
has issued a subordinated guarantee covering Prudential Funding’s domestic commercial paper program.

During the latter half of 2007, the financing cost of Prudential Funding’s commercial paper was relatively unchanged versus its historical cost basis
relative to the target federal funds rate. Prudential Funding’s commercial paper is rated A-1+, P-1, F1+ by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch, respectively.

The total principal amount of debt outstanding under Prudential Funding’s domestic medium-term note programs was $772
million, as of both December 31, 2007 and 2006, of which $600 million was reflected in the general obligation short-term debt as of December 31, 2007. The weighted average interest rates on Prudential Funding’s long-term debt,
including the effect of interest rate hedging activity, were 6.19%, and 5.87% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Prudential Insurance had outstanding fixed rate surplus notes totaling $444 million and $693 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively,
of which $250 million, which matured in July 2007, was reflected in the general obligation short-term debt as of December 31, 2006. These debt securities, which are included as surplus of Prudential Insurance on a statutory accounting basis,
are subordinated to other Prudential Insurance borrowings and to policyholder obligations and are subject to regulatory approvals for principal and interest payments.

During 2006, a subsidiary of Prudential Insurance entered into a surplus note purchase agreement with an unaffiliated
financial institution that provides for the issuance of up to $3 billion of ten-year floating rate surplus notes for the purpose of financing certain regulatory reserves required to be held by subsidiary life insurers in connection with the
intercompany reinsurance of certain term life insurance policies. Surplus notes issued under this facility are subordinated to policyholder obligations and are subject to regulatory approvals for principal and interest payments. Concurrent with
entering into the agreement, the subsidiary issued $600 million of notes under this facility. In both the third and fourth quarter of 2007, the subsidiary issued an additional $250 million of surplus notes, resulting in a total of $1.1 billion of
notes currently outstanding under this facility. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

During the fourth quarter of 2007, a subsidiary of Prudential Insurance issued $500 million of 45-year floating rate surplus notes to an unaffiliated
financial institution for the purpose of financing certain regulatory reserves required to be held by subsidiary life insurers in connection with the intercompany reinsurance of certain universal life insurance policies. Surplus notes issued under
this facility are subordinated to policyholder obligations and are subject to regulatory approvals for principal and interest payments. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Our total borrowings consist of capital debt, investment related debt,
securities business related debt and debt related to specified other businesses. Capital debt is borrowing that is used or will be used to meet the capital requirements of Prudential Financial as well as borrowings invested in equity or debt
securities of direct or indirect subsidiaries of Prudential Financial and subsidiary borrowings utilized for capital requirements. Investment related borrowings consist of debt issued to finance specific investment assets or portfolios of investment
assets, including institutional spread lending investment portfolios, real estate and real estate related investments held in consolidated joint ventures, as well as institutional and insurance company portfolio cash flow timing differences.
Securities business related debt consists of debt issued to finance primarily the liquidity of our broker-dealers and our capital markets and other securities business related operations. Debt related to specified other businesses consists of
borrowings associated with our individual annuity business, real estate franchises and relocation services. Borrowings under which either the holder is entitled to collect only against the assets pledged to the debt as collateral, or has only very
limited rights to collect against other assets, have been



classified as limited and non-recourse debt. Consolidated borrowings as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 included $1.750 billion of limited and
non-recourse debt attributable to the Closed Block Business.

The following table summarizes our borrowings, categorized by use of proceeds, as of the dates indicated:

Funding Agreement
Notes Issuance Program

In 2003, Prudential Insurance
established a Funding Agreement Notes Issuance Program pursuant to which a Delaware statutory trust issues medium-term notes (which are included in our statements of financial position in “Policyholders’ account balances” and not
included in the foregoing table) secured by funding agreements issued to the trust by Prudential Insurance and included in our Retirement segment. The funding agreements provide cash flow sufficient for the debt service on the related medium-term
notes. The medium-term notes are sold in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of such notes totaled approximately $8.5
billion and $6.5 billion, respectively, out of a total authorized amount of up to $15 billion. The notes have fixed or floating interest rates and original maturities ranging from two to seven years.

Lines of Credit and Other Credit Facilities

As of December 31, 2007, Prudential Financial, Prudential Insurance and
Prudential Funding had unsecured committed lines of credit totaling $5.0 billion. In December 2007, Prudential Financial and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a new $500 million 364-day credit agreement, which includes eight financial
institutions. In May 2007, Prudential Financial and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a new $2.0 billion 5-year credit facility, which includes 23 financial institutions, replacing a $1.5 billion facility that would have expired in September
2010. An additional $2.5 billion is also available under a facility that expires in December 2012, which includes 21 financial institutions. Borrowings under the outstanding facilities will mature no later than the respective expiration dates of the
facilities. We use these facilities primarily as back-up liquidity lines for our commercial paper programs, and there were no outstanding borrowings under any of these facilities as of December 31, 2007.

Our ability to borrow under these facilities is conditioned on the continued
satisfaction of customary conditions, including maintenance at all times by Prudential Insurance of total adjusted capital of at least $5.5 billion based on statutory accounting principles prescribed under New Jersey law. Prudential Insurance’s
total adjusted capital as of December 31, 2007 was $11.0 billion and continues to be above the $5.5 billion threshold. The ability of Prudential Financial to borrow under these facilities is also conditioned on its maintenance of consolidated
net worth of at least $12.5 billion, calculated in accordance with GAAP. Prudential Financial’s net worth on a consolidated basis totaled $23.5 billion and $22.9 billion as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We also use
uncommitted lines of credit from banks and other financial institutions.



Contractual Obligations

The table below summarizes the future estimated cash payments related to certain contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007. The estimated
payments reflected in this table are based on management’s estimates and assumptions about these obligations. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the actual cash outflows in future periods will vary, possibly
materially, from those reflected in the table. In addition, we do not believe that our cash flow requirements can be adequately assessed based solely upon an analysis of these obligations, as the table below does not contemplate all aspects of our
cash inflows, such as the level of cash flow generated by certain of our investments, nor all aspects of our cash outflows.

(1)

The estimated payments due by period for long-term debt reflects the contractual maturities of principal, as disclosed in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well
as estimated future interest payments. The payment of principal and estimated future interest for short-term debt are reflected in estimated payments due in less than one year. The estimate for future interest payments includes the effect of
derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning our short-term and long-term debt.

(2)

The estimated payments due by period for operating leases reflect the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases, as disclosed in Note 21 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. We have no significant capital lease obligations.

(3)

We have commitments to purchase or fund investments, some of which are contingent upon events or circumstances not under our control, including those at the discretion of our
counterparties. The timing of the fulfillment of certain of these commitments cannot be estimated, therefore the settlement of these obligations are reflected in estimated payments due in less than one year. Commitments to purchase or fund
investments include $7.435 billion that we anticipate will be funded from the assets of our separate accounts.

(4)

Loan commitments of our commercial mortgage operations, which are legally binding commitments to extend credit to a counterparty, have been reflected in the contractual obligations
table above principally based on the expiration date of the commitment; however, it is possible these loan commitments could be funded prior to their expiration. In certain circumstances the counterparty may also extend the date of the expiration in
exchange for a fee.

(5)

The estimated payments due by period for insurance liabilities reflect future estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and others for future policy benefits,
policyholders’ account balances, policyholder’s dividends, reinsurance payables and separate account liabilities. These future estimated cash outflows are based on mortality, morbidity, lapse and other assumptions comparable with our
experience, consider future premium receipts on current polices in force, and assume market growth and interest crediting consistent with assumptions used in amortizing deferred acquisition costs and value of business acquired. These cash outflows
are undiscounted with respect to interest and, as a result, the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of $1.095 trillion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of $396 billion included in the Consolidated Financial
Statements as of December 31, 2007. Separate account liabilities are legally insulated from general account obligations, and it is generally expected these liabilities will be fully funded by separate account assets and their related cash
flows. We have made significant assumptions to determine the future estimated cash outflows related to the underlying policies and contracts. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, actual cash outflows will differ, possibly materially,
from these estimates.

(6)

The estimated payments due by period for other liabilities includes securities sold under agreements to repurchase, cash collateral for loaned securities, liabilities recorded under
FASB Interpretation No. 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, and other miscellaneous liabilities.

We also enter into agreements to purchase goods and services in the normal
course of business; however, these purchase obligations are not material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position as of December 31, 2007.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Guarantees and Other Contingencies

In the course of our business, we provide certain guarantees and indemnities to third parties pursuant to which we may be contingently required to make
payments now or in the future.

A number of guarantees provided
by us relate to real estate investments, in which the investor has borrowed funds, and we have guaranteed their obligation to their lender. In some cases, the investor is an affiliate, and in other cases the unaffiliated investor purchases the real
estate investment from us. We provide these guarantees to assist the investors in obtaining financing for the transaction on more beneficial terms. The vast majority of these guarantees relate to real estate investments held by our separate accounts
and our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees was $2.538 billion as of December 31, 2007. Any payments that may become required of us under these guarantees would either first be reduced by proceeds received by the creditor on a
sale of the underlying collateral, or would provide us with rights to obtain the underlying collateral. These guarantees generally expire at various times over the next ten years. As of December 31, 2007, no amounts were accrued as a result of
our assessment that it is unlikely payments will be required.

We write credit derivatives under which we are obligated to pay the counterparty the referenced amount of the contract and receive in return the defaulted security or similar security. Our maximum amount at risk under these credit
derivatives, assuming the value of the underlying securities become worthless, is $1.618 billion at December 31, 2007. These credit derivatives generally have maturities of ten years or less.

Certain contracts underwritten by the Retirement segment include guarantees
related to financial assets owned by the guaranteed party. These contracts are accounted for as derivatives, at fair value, in accordance with SFAS No. 133. As of December 31, 2007, such contracts in force carried a total guaranteed value
of $4.428 billion.

We arrange for credit enhancements of
certain debt instruments that provide financing for commercial real estate assets, including certain tax-exempt bond financings. The credit enhancements provide assurances to the debt holders as to the timely payment of amounts due under the debt
instruments. As of December 31, 2007, such enhancement arrangements total $154 million, with remaining contractual maturities of up to 15 years. Our obligation to reimburse required payments is secured by mortgages on the related real estate,
which properties are valued at $190 million as of December 31, 2007. We receive certain ongoing fees for providing these enhancement arrangements and anticipate the extinguishment of our obligation under these enhancements prior to maturity
through the aggregation and transfer of our positions to a substitute enhancement provider. As of December 31, 2007, we have accrued liabilities of $2 million representing unearned fees on these arrangements.

In connection with our commercial mortgage operation, we provide commercial
mortgage origination, underwriting and servicing for certain government sponsored entities, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We have agreed to indemnify certain of these government sponsored entities for a portion of the credit risk associated
with the mortgages we service through these relationships. Our percentage share of losses incurred generally varies from 2% to 20% of the unpaid principal balance, based on the program and the severity of the loss. The unpaid principal balance of
mortgages subject to these arrangements as of December 31, 2007 were $5,576 million, all of which are collateralized by first liens on the underlying commercial properties. As of December 31, 2007, we have established a liability of $11
million related to these indemnifications.

In connection with
certain acquisitions, we agreed to pay additional consideration in future periods, based upon the attainment by the acquired entity of defined operating objectives. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we do not accrue contingent consideration obligations
prior to the attainment of the objectives. As of December 31, 2007, maximum potential future consideration pursuant to such arrangements, to be resolved over the following two years, is $61 million. Any such payments would result in increases
in intangible assets, including goodwill.

We are also subject
to other financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements. We have provided indemnities and guarantees related to acquisitions, dispositions, investments and other transactions that are triggered by, among other things, breaches of representations,
warranties or covenants provided by us. These



obligations are typically subject to various time limitations, defined by the contract or by operation of law, such as statutes of limitation. In some cases,
the maximum potential obligation is subject to contractual limitations, while in other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable. Since certain of these obligations are not subject to limitations, it is not possible to determine the
maximum potential amount due under these guarantees. As of December 31, 2007, we have accrued liabilities of $7 million associated with all other financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements, which does not include retained liabilities
associated with sold businesses.

Other Contingent Commitments

In connection with our commercial mortgage operations, we
originate commercial mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2007, we had outstanding commercial mortgage loan commitments with borrowers of $2.937 billion. In certain of these transactions, we prearrange that we will sell the loan to an
investor after we fund the loan. As of December 31, 2007, $574 million of our commitments to originate commercial mortgage loans are subject to such arrangements.

We also have other commitments, some of which are contingent upon events or circumstances not under our control, including those at the
discretion of our counterparties. These other commitments amounted to $10.782 billion as of December 31, 2007. Reflected in these other commitments are $10.638 billion of commitments to purchase or fund investments, including $7.435
billion that we anticipate will be funded from the assets of our separate accounts.

Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do
not have retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities, or variable interests in unconsolidated entities or other similar transactions, arrangements or relationships that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk
support, that we believe are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or our access to or requirements for
capital resources. In addition, we do not have relationships with any unconsolidated entities that are contractually limited to narrow activities that facilitate our transfer of or access to associated assets.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs

We capitalize costs that vary with and are related primarily to the
acquisition of new and renewal insurance and annuities contracts. The costs include commissions, costs to issue and underwrite the policies and certain variable field office expenses. The capitalized amounts are known as deferred policy acquisition
costs, or DAC. Our total DAC, including the impact of the unrealized investment gains and losses, amounted to $12.3 billion and $10.9 billion as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, 42% of our total DAC
related to our International Insurance segment, 31% related to our Individual Life segment, 16% related to our Individual Annuities segment, and 8% related to our Closed Block Business.

If we were to experience a significant decrease in asset values or increase in lapse or surrender rates on policies for
which we amortize DAC based on gross margins or gross profits, such as participating and variable life insurance, we would expect acceleration of the amortization of DAC for the effected blocks of policies. Additionally, for all policies on which we
have outstanding DAC, we would be required to evaluate whether this experience called into question our ability to recover all or a portion of the DAC, and we would be required to accelerate the amortization for some or all of the DAC if we
concluded that we could not recover it. An accelerated amortization of DAC would negatively effect our reported earnings under generally accepted accounting principles.



ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Risk Management, Market Risk and Derivative Instruments

Risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes
intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns on the underlying assets or liabilities. We consider risk management an integral part of managing our core businesses.

Market risk is the risk of change in the value of financial instruments as a
result of absolute or relative changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates or equity or commodity prices. To varying degrees, the investment and trading activities supporting all of our products and services generate exposure to
market risk. The market risk incurred and our strategies for managing this risk varies by product.

With respect to non-variable life insurance products, fixed rate annuities, the fixed rate options in our variable life insurance and annuity products,
and other finance businesses, we incur market risk primarily in the form of interest rate risk. We manage this risk through asset/liability management strategies that seek to closely approximate the interest rate sensitivity, but not necessarily the
exact cash flow characteristics, of the assets with the estimated interest rate sensitivity of the product liabilities. Our overall objective in these strategies is to limit the net change in value of assets and liabilities arising from interest
rate movements. While it is more difficult to measure the interest sensitivity of our insurance liabilities than that of the related assets, to the extent that we can measure such sensitivities we believe that interest rate movements will generate
asset value changes that substantially offset changes in the value of the liabilities relating to the underlying products.

For variable annuities and variable life insurance products, excluding the fixed rate options in these products, mutual funds and most separate accounts,
our main exposure to the market is the risk that asset based fees decrease as a result of declines in assets under management due to changes in investment prices. We also run the risk that asset management fees calculated by reference to performance
could be lower. The risk of decreased asset based and asset management fees could also impact our estimates of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs. While a decrease in our estimates of total
gross profits would accelerate amortization and decrease net income in a given period, it would not affect our cash flow or liquidity position.

For variable annuity and variable life insurance products with minimum guaranteed death benefits and variable annuity products with living benefits such
as guaranteed minimum income, withdrawal, and accumulation benefits, we also face the risk that declines in the value of underlying investments as a result of changes in investment prices may increase our net exposure to such benefits under these
contracts. As part of our risk management strategy, we utilize interest rate and equity based derivatives as well as an automatic rebalancing element to hedge the benefit features of our variable annuity contracts, with the exception of our
guaranteed minimum income benefits and guaranteed minimum death benefits, which include risks we have deemed suitable to retain. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our use of interest rate and equity based
derivatives. See Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the guaranteed minimum death benefits associated with our variable life and variable annuity contracts, and the guaranteed minimum income, withdrawal,
and accumulation benefits associated with the variable annuity contracts we issue.

For a discussion of asset based fees associated with our variable life products and our variable annuity contracts, our estimates of total gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and
other costs, and the impact of our guaranteed minimum death and other benefits on the results of our Individual Life and Individual Annuities segments, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—Insurance Division—Individual Life” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results
of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—Insurance Division—Individual Annuities.”



We manage our exposure to equity price risk relating to our general account investments primarily by
seeking to match the risk profile of equity investments against risk-adjusted equity market benchmarks. We measure benchmark risk levels in terms of price volatility in relation to the market in general.

The sources of our exposure to market risk can be divided into two
categories, “other than trading” activities conducted primarily in our insurance and annuity operations, and “trading” activities conducted primarily in our derivatives trading operations. As part of our management of both
“other than trading” and “trading” market risks, we use a variety of risk management tools and techniques. These include sensitivity and Value-at-Risk, or VaR, measures, position and other limits based on type of risk, and
various hedging methods.

Other Than Trading Activities

We hold the majority of our assets for “other
than trading” activities in our segments that offer insurance and annuities products. We incorporate asset/liability management techniques and other risk management policies and limits into the process of investing our assets. We use
derivatives for hedging and other purposes in the asset/liability management process.

Insurance and Annuities Products Asset/Liability Management

We seek to maintain interest rate and equity exposures within established ranges, which we periodically adjust based on market conditions and the design
of related products sold to customers. Our risk managers establish investment risk limits for exposures to any issuer, geographic region, type of security or industry sector and oversee efforts to manage risk within policy constraints set by
management and approved by the Investment Committee of the Board of Directors.

We use duration and convexity analyses to measure price sensitivity to interest rate changes. Duration measures the relative sensitivity of the fair value of a financial instrument to changes in interest rates.
Convexity measures the rate of change of duration with respect to changes in interest rates. We seek to manage our interest rate exposure by legal entity by matching the relative sensitivity of asset and liability values to interest rate changes, or
controlling “duration mismatch” of assets and liabilities. We have target duration mismatch constraints for each entity. In certain markets, primarily outside the U.S., capital market limitations that hinder our ability to closely
approximate the duration of some of our liabilities are considered in setting the constraint limits. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the difference between the pre-tax duration of assets and the target duration of liabilities in our duration
managed portfolios was within our constraint limits. We consider risk-based capital implications in our asset/liability management strategies.

We also perform portfolio stress testing as part of our U.S. regulatory cash flow testing for major product lines that are subject to risk from changes in
interest rates. In this testing, we evaluate the impact of altering our interest-sensitive assumptions under various moderately adverse interest rate environments. These interest-sensitive assumptions relate to the timing and amount of redemptions
and prepayments of fixed-income securities and lapses and surrenders of insurance products and the potential impact of any guaranteed minimum interest rates. We evaluate any shortfalls that this cash flow testing reveals to determine if we need to
increase statutory reserves or adjust portfolio management strategies.

Market Risk Related to Interest Rates

Our
“other than trading” assets that subject us to interest rate risk include primarily fixed maturity securities, commercial loans and policy loans. In the aggregate, the carrying value of these assets represented 76% of our consolidated
assets, other than assets that we held in separate accounts, as of December 31, 2007 and 77% as of December 31, 2006.

With respect to “other than trading” liabilities, we are exposed to interest rate risk through policyholder account balances relating to
interest-sensitive life insurance, annuity and other investment-type contracts, collectively referred to as investment contracts, and through outstanding short-term and long-term debt.

We assess interest rate sensitivity for “other than trading” financial assets, financial liabilities and
derivatives using hypothetical test scenarios that assume either upward or downward 100 basis point parallel



shifts in the yield curve from prevailing interest rates. The following tables set forth the net estimated potential loss in fair value from a hypothetical
100 basis point upward shift as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, because this scenario results in the greatest net exposure to interest rate risk of the hypothetical scenarios tested at those dates. While the test scenario is for illustrative
purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future interest rates or the performance of fixed-income markets, it is a near-term, reasonably possible hypothetical change that illustrates the potential impact of such events. These
test scenarios do not measure the changes in value that could result from non-parallel shifts in the yield curve, which we would expect to produce different changes in discount rates for different maturities. As a result, the actual loss in fair
value from a 100 basis point change in interest rates could be different from that indicated by these calculations.

(1)

The hypothetical change in fair value related to our mortgage bank-loan inventory reflects only the gross fair value change on the mortgage loan assets, and excludes any offsetting
impact of derivatives and other instruments purchased to hedge such changes in fair value.



The tables above do not include approximately $129 billion of insurance reserve and deposit liabilities
as of December 31, 2007 and $123 billion as of December 31, 2006. We believe that the interest rate sensitivities of these insurance liabilities offset, in large measure, the interest rate risk of the financial assets set forth in these
tables.

Our net estimated potential loss in fair value as of
December 31, 2007 increased $293 million from December 31, 2006, primarily reflecting an increase in the level of investments in 2007.

The estimated changes in fair values of our financial assets shown above relate primarily to assets invested to support our insurance liabilities, but do
not include separate account assets associated with products for which investment risk is borne primarily by the separate account contractholders rather than by us.

Market Risk Related to Equity Prices

We actively manage investment equity price risk against benchmarks in respective markets. We benchmark our return on equity holdings
against a blend of market indices, mainly the S&P 500 and Russell 2000, and we target price sensitivities that approximate those of the benchmark indices. We estimate our investment equity price risk from a hypothetical 10% decline in equity
benchmark market levels and measure this risk in terms of the decline in fair market value of equity securities we hold. Using this methodology, our estimated investment equity price risk as of December 31, 2007 was $958 million, representing a
hypothetical decline in fair market value of equity securities we held at that date from $9.580 billion to $8.622 billion. Our estimated investment equity price risk using this methodology as of December 31, 2006 was $916 million, representing
a hypothetical decline in fair market value of equity securities we held at that date from $9.160 billion to $8.244 billion. In calculating these amounts, we exclude separate account equity securities related to products for which the investment
risk is borne primarily by the separate account contractholder rather than by us.

In addition to equity securities, as indicated above, we hold equity-based derivatives primarily to hedge the equity price risk embedded in the living benefit features in some of our variable annuity products. As of
December 31, 2007, our equity-based derivatives had notional values of $4.6 billion, and were reported at fair value as a $617 million asset, and the living benefit features accounted for as derivatives were reported at fair value as a $168
million liability. As of December 31, 2006, our equity-based derivatives had notional values of $2.9 billion, and were reported at fair value as a $230 million asset, and the living benefits features accounted for as derivatives were reported
at fair value as a $38 million asset. Our estimated equity price risk associated with the equity-based derivatives, net of the related living benefit features, was less than $10 million as of both December 31, 2007 and 2006, estimated based on
a hypothetical 10% decline in equity benchmark market levels.

While these scenarios are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect our expectations regarding future performance of equity markets or of our equity portfolio, they represent near term reasonably possible hypothetical changes that
illustrate the potential impact of such events. These scenarios consider only the direct impact on fair value of declines in equity benchmark market levels and not changes in asset based fees recognized as revenue, changes in our estimates of total
gross profits used as a basis for amortizing deferred policy acquisition and other costs, or changes in any other assumptions such as mortality, utilization or persistency rates in our variable annuity contracts that could also impact the fair value
of our living benefit features.

Market Risk Related to
Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

We are exposed to foreign
currency exchange rate risk in our domestic general account investment portfolios, other proprietary investment portfolios and through our operations in foreign countries.

Our exposure to foreign currency risk within the domestic general account investment portfolios supporting our U.S. insurance operations
and other domestic proprietary investment portfolios arises primarily from investments that are denominated in foreign currencies. We generally hedge substantially all domestic general account foreign currency-denominated fixed-income investments
and other domestic proprietary foreign currency investments into U.S. dollars in order to mitigate the risk that the cash flows or fair value of these investments fluctuates as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We generally do
not hedge all of the foreign currency risk of our investments in equity securities of unaffiliated foreign entities.



Our operations in foreign countries create the following three additional sources of foreign currency
risk:

•

First, we reflect the operating results of our foreign operations in our financial statements based on the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. We
hedge some of these foreign currency operating results as part of our overall risk management strategy. We generally hedge our anticipated exposure to adjusted operating income fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates
relating to our International operations primarily in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Europe.

•

Second, we translate our equity investment in foreign operations into U.S. dollars using the foreign currency exchange rate at the financial statement period-end
date. To mitigate potential losses due to fluctuations in these exchange rates, for our equity investments in our International operations other than in Japan and Taiwan, we generally hedge a significant portion of this exposure through the use of
foreign currency forward contracts. For our equity investments in our Japanese and Taiwanese operations we generally hedge this exposure by holding U.S. dollar denominated securities in the investment portfolios of these operations.

•

Third, our international insurance operations may hold investments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of those operations on an unhedged
basis in addition to the aforementioned equity hedges resulting from foreign subsidiaries’ investing in U.S. dollar denominated investments. Most significantly, our Japanese operations hold U.S. dollar denominated investments in their
investment portfolios in excess of our equity investment in such operations. For a discussion of our Japanese operations’ U.S. dollar denominated investment holdings, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations—Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments—General Account Investments—Portfolio Composition,” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—International Insurance and Investments Division.”

We manage our investment foreign currency exchange rate risks, described above, within specified limits. Foreign currency
exchange risks for our domestic general account investment portfolio and the unhedged portion of our equity investment in foreign subsidiaries are managed using VaR-based analysis. This statistical technique estimates, at a specified confidence
level, the potential pre-tax loss in portfolio market value that could occur over an assumed time horizon due to adverse market movements.

The estimated VaR as of December 31, 2007 for foreign currency exchange risks in our domestic general account portfolio and the unhedged portion of equity
investment in foreign subsidiaries, measured at a 95% confidence level and using a one-month time horizon, was $46 million, representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of these foreign currency assets from $1.798 billion to $1.752
billion. The estimated VaR as of December 31, 2006 for foreign currency exchange risks in our domestic general account portfolio and the unhedged portion of equity investment in foreign subsidiaries, measured at a 95% confidence level and using a
one-month time horizon, was $34 million, representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of these foreign currency assets from $1.468 billion to $1.434 billion. The average VaR for foreign currency exchange risks in our domestic general
account portfolio and the unhedged portion of equity investment in foreign subsidiaries, measured monthly at a 95% confidence level over a one month time horizon, was $35 million during 2007 and $39 million during 2006. These calculations use
historical price volatilities and correlation data at a 95% confidence level. We discuss limitations of VaR models below.

The estimated VaR for instruments used to hedge our anticipated exposure to adjusted operating income fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign
currency exchange rates relating to our International operations, measured at a 95% confidence level and using a one-month time horizon, was $73 million as of December 31, 2007 and $71 million as of December 31, 2006.

Derivatives

Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest
rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial indices, or the prices of securities or commodities. Derivative financial instruments may be exchange-traded or contracted in the over-the-counter market and include swaps, futures, options and
forward contracts. We are also a party to financial instruments that may contain derivative instruments that are embedded



in the financial instruments. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our derivative activities as of December 31, 2007 and
2006. Under insurance statutes, our insurance companies may use derivative financial instruments to hedge actual or anticipated changes in their assets or liabilities, to replicate cash market instruments or for certain income-generating activities.
These statutes generally prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. We use derivative financial instruments primarily to seek to reduce market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, as well as equity
prices, and to alter interest rate or foreign currency exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities. In addition, we use derivative financial instruments to mitigate risk associated with some of our benefit features of our
variable annuity contracts.

Trading Activities

We engage in trading activities primarily in connection with our derivatives
trading operations. We maintain trading positions in various foreign exchange instruments and commodities, primarily to facilitate transactions for our clients. Market risk affects the values of our trading positions through fluctuations in absolute
or relative interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, securities and commodity prices. We seek to use short security positions and forwards, futures, options and other derivatives to limit exposure to interest rate and other market risks. We
also trade derivative financial instruments that allow our clients to manage exposure to interest rate, currency and other market risks. Our derivative transactions involve both exchange-listed and over-the-counter contracts and are generally
short-term in duration. We act both as a broker, buying and selling exchange-listed contracts for our customers, and as a dealer, by entering into futures and security transactions as a principal. As a broker, we assume counterparty and credit risks
that we seek to mitigate by using margin or other credit enhancements and by establishing trading limits and credit lines. As a dealer, we are subject to market risk as well as counterparty and credit risk. We manage the market risk associated with
trading activities through hedging activities and formal policies, risk and position limits, counterparty and credit limits, daily position monitoring, and other forms of risk management.

In the second quarter of 2007, the Company announced its decision to exit the equity sales, trading and research operations
of the Prudential Equity Group. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Value-at-Risk

VaR is one of the tools we use to monitor and manage our exposure to the market risk of our trading activities. We calculate a VaR that encompasses our
trading activities using a 95% confidence level. The VaR method incorporates the risk factors to which the market value of our trading activities is exposed, which consist of interest rates, including credit spreads, foreign currency exchange rates,
and commodity prices, estimates of volatilities from historical data, the sensitivity of our trading activities to changes in those market factors and the correlations of those factors. The total VaR for our trading activities, which considers our
combined exposure to interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, and commodities price risk, expressed in terms of adverse changes to fair value at a 95% confidence level over a one-day time horizon, was $1 million as of December 31,
2007 and $1 million as of December 31, 2006. The largest component of this total VaR as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 was related to commodities price risk. The total average daily VaR for our trading activities considering our exposure to interest
rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, and commodities price risk, expressed in terms of adverse changes to fair value with a 95% confidence level over a one-day time horizon, was $1 million during 2007 and $1 million during 2006. The
largest component of both periods’ total average daily VaR was related to commodities price risk.

Limitations of VaR Models

Although VaR models are a recognized tool for risk management, they have inherent limitations, including reliance on historical data that may not be indicative of future market conditions or trading patterns.
Accordingly, VaR models should not be viewed as a predictor of future results. We may incur losses that could be materially in excess of the amounts indicated by the models on a particular trading day or over a period of time, and there have been
instances when results have fallen outside the values generated by our VaR models. A VaR model does not estimate the greatest possible loss. The results of these models and analysis thereof are subject to the judgment of our risk management
personnel.



ITEM 8.    FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INDEX



Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of Prudential Financial, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness, as of December 31, 2007, of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, based on the framework
established

in Internal Control—Integrated Framework

Issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our assessment under that framework, management concluded that the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007.

Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

The
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report accompanying the
Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company included in this Annual Report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007.

February 27, 2008



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Prudential Financial, Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Prudential Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under Item 15.2 present fairly, in all material respects, the information set
forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based
on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial
statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, listed in the accompanying index. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our
integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control
over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. The accompanying supplemental combining financial information is presented for the purposes of additional analysis of the consolidated financial statements rather than to present the financial
position and results of operations of the individual components. Such supplemental information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the consolidated financial statements and, in our opinion, is fairly stated in all
material respects in relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

As described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for deferred acquisition costs in connection with modifications or
exchanges of insurance contracts, and for income tax-related cash flows generated by a leveraged lease transaction on January 1, 2007 and for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on December 31, 2006.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.    BUSINESS

Prudential
Financial, Inc. (“Prudential Financial”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Prudential” or the “Company”) provide a wide range of insurance, investment management, and other financial products and services to both
individual and institutional customers throughout the United States and in many other countries. Principal products and services provided include life insurance, annuities, mutual funds, pension and retirement-related services and administration,
and investment management. In addition, the Company provides retail securities brokerage services indirectly through a minority ownership in a joint venture. The Company has organized its principal operations into the Financial Services Businesses
and the Closed Block Business. The Financial Services Businesses operate through three operating divisions: Insurance, Investment, and International Insurance and Investments. The Company’s real estate and relocation services business as well
as businesses that are not sufficiently material to warrant separate disclosure and businesses to be divested are included in Corporate and Other operations within the Financial Services Businesses. The Closed Block Business, which includes the
Closed Block (see Note 10), is managed separately from the Financial Services Businesses. The Closed Block Business was established on the date of demutualization and includes the Company’s in force participating insurance and annuity products
and assets that are used for the payment of benefits and policyholders’ dividends on these products, as well as other assets and equity that support these products and related liabilities. In connection with the demutualization, the Company
ceased offering these participating products.

Demutualization

On December 18, 2001 (the “date of
demutualization”), The Prudential Insurance Company of America (“Prudential Insurance”) converted from a mutual life insurance company to a stock life insurance company and became an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential
Financial. At the time of demutualization Prudential Financial issued two classes of common stock, both of which remain outstanding. The Common Stock, which is publicly traded, reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses, and the
Class B Stock, which was issued through a private placement, reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business.

2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Prudential Financial, entities over which the Company exercises control, including
majority-owned subsidiaries and minority-owned entities such as limited partnerships in which the Company is the general partner, and variable interest entities in which the Company is considered the primary beneficiary. See Note 4 for more
information on the Company’s consolidated variable interest entities. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).
Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

The Company’s Gibraltar Life Insurance Company, Ltd. (“Gibraltar Life”) operations use a November 30 fiscal year end for purposes of inclusion in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, the
Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2007, and 2006, include Gibraltar Life’s assets and liabilities as of November 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
include Gibraltar Life’s results of operations for the twelve months ended November 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(continued)

The most significant estimates include those used in determining deferred policy acquisition costs,
goodwill, valuation of business acquired, valuation of investments including derivatives, future policy benefits including guarantees, pension and other postretirement benefits, provision for income taxes, reserves for contingent liabilities and
reserves for losses in connection with unresolved legal matters.

Share-Based Payments

The Company
adopted SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment” on January 1, 2006, using the modified prospective application transition method prescribed by this standard. This standard requires that the cost resulting from all share-based
payments be recognized in the financial statements and requires all entities to apply the fair value based measurement method in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees except for equity instruments held by employee share
ownership plans. As described more fully below, the Company had previously adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” as amended, prospectively for all new stock options
granted to employees on or after January 1, 2003. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), there were no unvested stock options issued prior to January 1, 2003, and, therefore, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) had no impact to the
Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations with respect to the unvested employee options. For a discussion of the prospective recognition of compensation cost under the non-substantive vesting period approach, see
“Share-Based Compensation Awards with Non-substantive Vesting Conditions” below.

Excess Tax Benefits

Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company was required to determine the portion of additional paid-in capital that was generated from the realization of excess tax benefits prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) available to
offset deferred tax assets that may need to be written off in future periods had the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 beginning in 2001. The Company has elected to calculate this “pool” of
additional paid-in capital using the short-cut method as permitted by Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Staff Position (“FSP”) FAS123(R)-3, “Transition Election to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based
Payment Awards.” Under the short-cut method, this “pool” of additional paid-in capital was calculated as the sum of all net increases of additional paid-in capital recognized in the Company’s financial statements related to tax
benefits from share-based payment transactions subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 123 but prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) less the cumulative incremental pre-tax compensation costs that would have been recognized if SFAS
No. 123 had been used to account for share-based payment transactions, tax effected at the statutory tax rate as of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). Subsequent to the date of adoption, the Company’s policy is to account for this
additional paid-in capital as a single “pool” available to all share-based compensation awards.

In accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), the Company does not recognize excess tax benefits in additional paid-in capital until the benefits result in a
reduction in taxes payable. The Company has elected the “tax-law ordering methodology” and has adopted a convention that considers excess tax benefits to be the last portion of a net operating loss carryforward to be utilized.

Share-Based Compensation Awards with Non-substantive Vesting Conditions

The Company issues employee share-based compensation
awards, under a plan authorized by the Board of Directors, that are subject to specific vesting conditions; generally the awards vest ratably over a three-year period, “the nominal vesting period,” or at the date the employee retires (as
defined by the plan), if earlier. For awards granted prior to January 1, 2006 that specify an employee vests in the award upon retirement, the Company accounts for those awards using the nominal vesting period approach. Under this approach, the



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(continued)

Company records compensation expense over the nominal vesting period. If the employee retires before the end of the nominal vesting period, any remaining
unrecognized compensation cost is recognized at the date of retirement.

Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company revised its approach to the recognition of compensation costs for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees and awards that vest when an employee becomes retirement-eligible to
apply the non-substantive vesting period approach to all new share-based compensation awards granted after January 1, 2006. Under this approach, all compensation cost is recognized on the date of grant for awards issued to retirement-eligible
employees, or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved, if that is expected to occur during the nominal vesting period.

If the Company had accounted for all share-based compensation awards granted after January 1, 2003 under the
non-substantive vesting period approach, net income of the Financial Services Businesses for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 would have been increased by $9 million and $12 million, or $0.02 and $0.02 per share of Common Stock,
respectively, on both a basic and diluted basis. Net income of the Financial Services Businesses for the year ended December 31, 2005 would have been decreased by $10 million, or $0.02 per share of Common Stock, on both a basic and diluted
basis.

Previous Adoption of Fair Value Recognition
Provisions

As noted above, effective January 1,
2003, the Company changed its accounting for employee stock options to adopt the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended, prospectively for all new stock options granted to employees on or after January 1, 2003. Prior
to January 1, 2003, the Company accounted for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations. Under
this method, the Company did not recognize any stock-based compensation expense for employee stock options as all options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying Common Stock on the date of grant. If the Company had
accounted for all employee stock options granted prior to January 1, 2003 under the fair value-based measurement method of SFAS No. 123, net income and earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 would have been
unchanged, since, as of January 1, 2006, there were no unvested employee stock options issued prior to January 1, 2003. Net income and earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2005, would have been as follows:



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(continued)

The fair value of each option issued prior to January 1, 2003 for purposes of the pro forma
information presented above was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For options issued on or after January 1, 2003, the fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using a binomial
option-pricing model.

The Company accounts for non-employee
stock options using the fair value method in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 96-18 “Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with
Selling, Goods or Services” and related interpretations in accounting for its non-employee stock options.

Earnings Per Share

As discussed in Note 1, the Company has outstanding two separate classes of common stock. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing available income attributable to each of the two groups of common shareholders by the respective
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share includes the effect of all dilutive potential common shares that were outstanding during the period.

As discussed under “Excess Tax Benefits” above, the Company adopted
SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective application transition method and has elected to calculate the “pool” of excess tax benefits in additional paid-in capital using the short-cut method. The Company has further elected to
reflect in assumed proceeds, under the application of the treasury stock method, the entire amount of excess tax benefits that would be recognized in additional paid-in capital upon exercise or release of the award.

Investments

Fixed maturities are comprised of bonds, notes and redeemable preferred stock. Fixed maturities classified as
“available for sale” are carried at fair value. Fixed maturities that the Company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as “held to maturity.” The amortized cost
of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Interest income, as well as the related amortization of premium and accretion of discount is included in “Net investment income.” The
amortized cost of fixed maturities is written down to fair value when a decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary. See the discussion below on realized investment gains and losses for a description of the accounting for impairments.
Unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities classified as “available for sale,” net of tax and the effect on deferred policy acquisition costs, valuation of business acquired, future policy benefits and policyholders’ dividends
that would result from the realization of unrealized gains and losses, are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).”

“Trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities, at fair value” includes invested assets that support certain products included in the
Retirement segment, as well as certain products included in the International Insurance segment, which are experience rated, meaning that the investment results associated with these products will ultimately accrue to contractholders. Realized and
unrealized gains and losses for these investments are reported in “Asset management fees and other income.” Interest and dividend income from these investments is reported in “Net investment income.”

“Other trading account assets, at fair value” consist primarily of
investments and certain derivatives used by the Company either in its capacity as a broker-dealer or for asset and liability management activities. These instruments are carried at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on other
trading account assets are reported in “Asset management fees and other income.” Interest and dividend income from these investments is reported in “Net investment income.”



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(continued)

Equity securities are comprised of common stock and non-redeemable preferred stock and are carried at
fair value. The associated unrealized gains and losses, net of tax and the effect on deferred policy acquisition costs, valuation of business acquired, future policy benefits and policyholders’ dividends that would result from the realization
of unrealized gains and losses, are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” The cost of equity securities is written down to fair value when a decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary. See the
discussion below on realized investment gains and losses for a description of the accounting for impairments. Dividend income from these investments is reported in “Net investment income.”

Commercial loans originated and held for investment within the Company’s
insurance operations are carried at unpaid principal balances, net of an allowance for losses. Commercial loans originated and held for sale within the Company’s commercial mortgage operations are reported at the lower of cost or fair market
value, while other mortgage loan investments are carried at amortized cost, net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and expenses. Commercial loans acquired, including those related to the acquisition of a business, are recorded at fair
value when purchased, reflecting any premiums or discounts to unpaid principal balances. Interest income, as well as prepayment fees and the amortization of the related premiums or discounts, is included in “Net investment income.” The
allowance for losses includes a loan specific reserve for non-performing loans and a portfolio reserve for probable incurred but not specifically identified losses. Non-performing loans include those loans for which it is probable that amounts due
according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not all be collected. These loans are measured at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or at the fair value of the
collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Interest received on non-performing loans, including loans that were previously modified in a troubled debt restructuring, is either applied against the principal or reported as net investment income,
based on the Company’s assessment as to the collectibility of the principal. The Company discontinues accruing interest on non-performing loans after the loans are 90 days delinquent as to principal or interest, or earlier when the Company has
doubts about collectibility. When a loan is deemed non-performing, any accrued but uncollectible interest is charged to interest income in the period the loan is deemed non-performing. Generally, a loan is restored to accrual status only after all
delinquent interest and principal are brought current and, in the case of loans where the payment of interest has been interrupted for a substantial period, a regular payment performance has been established. The portfolio reserve for incurred but
not specifically identified losses considers the Company’s past loan loss experience, the current credit composition of the portfolio, historical credit migration, property type diversification, default and loss severity statistics and other
relevant factors. The gains and losses from the sale of loans, which are recognized when the Company relinquishes control over the loans, as well as changes in the allowance for loan losses, are reported in “Realized investment gains (losses),
net.”

Policy loans are carried at unpaid principal
balances.

Securities repurchase and resale agreements and
securities loaned transactions are used to earn spread income, to borrow funds, or to facilitate trading activity. Securities repurchase and resale agreements are generally short-term in nature, and therefore, the carrying amounts of these
instruments approximate fair value. Securities repurchase and resale agreements are collateralized by cash, U.S. government and government agency securities. Securities loaned are collateralized principally by cash and U.S. government securities.
For securities repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions used to earn spread income, the cash received is typically invested in cash equivalents, short-term investments or fixed maturities.

Securities repurchase and resale agreements that satisfy certain criteria are
treated as collateralized financing arrangements. These agreements are carried at the amounts at which the securities will be subsequently resold or reacquired, as specified in the respective agreements. For securities purchased under agreements to
resell, the Company’s policy is to take possession or control of the securities and to value the securities daily. Securities to be resold are the same, or substantially the same, as the securities received. For securities sold under agreements
to repurchase, the market value of the securities to be repurchased is monitored, and additional collateral is

(continued)

obtained where appropriate, to protect against credit exposure. Securities to be repurchased are the same, or substantially the same, as those sold. Income
and expenses related to these transactions executed within the insurance companies and broker-dealer subsidiaries used to earn spread income are reported as “Net investment income;” however, for transactions used to borrow funds, the
associated borrowing cost is reported as interest expense (included in “General and administrative expenses”). Income and expenses related to these transactions executed within the Company’s commercial mortgage and derivative dealer
operations are reported in “Asset management fees and other income.”

Securities loaned transactions are treated as financing arrangements and are recorded at the amount of cash received. The Company obtains collateral in an amount equal to 102% and 105% of the fair value of the
domestic and foreign securities, respectively. The Company monitors the market value of the securities loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained as necessary. Substantially all of the Company’s securities loaned transactions
are with large brokerage firms. Income and expenses associated with securities loaned transactions used to earn spread income are reported as “Net investment income;” however, for securities loaned transactions used for funding purposes
the associated rebate is reported as interest expense (included in “General and administrative expenses”).

Other long-term investments consist of the Company’s investments in joint ventures and limited partnerships, other than operating joint ventures, as
well as wholly-owned investment real estate and other investments. Joint venture and partnership interests are generally accounted for using the equity method of accounting. In certain instances in which the Company’s partnership interest is so
minor (generally less than 3%) that it exercises virtually no influence over operating and financial policies, the Company applies the cost method of accounting. The Company’s income from investments in joint ventures and partnerships accounted
for using the equity method or the cost method, other than the Company’s investment in operating joint ventures, is included in “Net investment income.” The Company consolidates joint ventures and limited partnerships in certain other
instances where it is deemed to exercise control, or is considered the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. Certain of these consolidated joint ventures and limited partnerships relate to investment structures in which the
Company’s asset management business invests with other co-investors in an investment fund referred to as a feeder fund. In these structures, the invested capital of several feeder funds is pooled together and used to purchase ownership
interests in another fund, referred to as a master fund. The master fund utilizes this invested capital, and in certain cases other debt financing, to purchase various classes of assets on behalf of its investors. Specialized industry accounting for
investment companies calls for the feeder fund to reflect its investment in the master fund as a single net asset equal to its proportionate share of the net assets of the master fund, regardless of its level of interest in the master fund. In cases
where the Company consolidates the feeder fund, it retains the feeder fund’s net asset presentation and reports the consolidated feeder fund’s proportionate share of the net assets of the master fund in “Other long-term
investments,” with any unaffiliated investors’ minority interest in the feeder fund reported in “Other liabilities.” The Company’s net income from consolidated joint ventures and limited partnerships, including these
consolidated feeder funds, is included in the respective revenue and expense line items depending on the activity of the consolidated entity.

The Company’s wholly-owned investment real estate consists of real estate which the Company has the intent to hold for the production of income as
well as real estate held for sale. Real estate which the Company has the intent to hold for the production of income is carried at depreciated cost less any writedowns to fair value for impairment losses and is reviewed for impairment whenever
events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Real estate held for sale is carried at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value less estimated selling costs and is not further depreciated once classified as such.
An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value of the investment real estate exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows (excluding interest charges) from the investment. At that time, the carrying value of the investment real
estate is written down to fair value. Decreases in the carrying value of investment real estate held for the production of income due to other-than-temporary impairments are recorded in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.”

(continued)

Depreciation on real estate held for the production of income is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the properties, and is
included in “Net investment income.” In the period a real estate investment is deemed held for sale and meets all of the discontinued operation criteria, the Company reports all related net investment income and any resulting investment
gains and losses as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Short-term investments consist of highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity of greater than three months and less than twelve months when purchased, other than those debt instruments meeting this definition that are included in
“Trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities, at fair value.” These investments are generally carried at fair value.

Realized investment gains (losses) are computed using the specific identification method with the exception of some of the Company’s International
portfolios, where the average cost method is used. Realized investment gains and losses are generated from numerous sources, including the sale of fixed maturity securities, equity securities, investments in joint ventures and limited partnerships
and other types of investments, as well as adjustments to the cost basis of investments for other than temporary impairments. Realized investment gains and losses are also generated from prepayment premiums received on private fixed maturity
securities, recoveries of principal on previously impaired securities, provisions for losses on commercial loans, fair value changes on commercial mortgage operations’ loans, gains on commercial loans in connection with securitization
transactions, fair value changes on embedded derivatives and derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, except those derivatives used in the Company’s capacity as a broker or dealer.

Adjustments to the costs of fixed maturities and equity securities for
other-than-temporary impairments are also included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” In evaluating whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, the Company considers several factors including, but not limited to the
following: (1) the extent (generally if greater than 20%) and the duration (generally if greater than six months) of the decline; (2) the reasons for the decline in value (credit event, currency or interest rate); (3) the
Company’s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value; and (4) the financial condition of and near-term prospects of the issuer. In addition, for its impairment review of asset-backed
fixed maturity securities with a credit rating below AA, the Company forecasts the prospective future cash flows of the security and determines if the present value of those cash flows, discounted using the effective yield of the most recent
interest accrual rate, has decreased from the previous reporting period. When a decrease from the prior reporting period has occurred and the security’s market value is less than its carrying value, the carrying value of the security is reduced
to its fair value, with a corresponding charge to earnings. The new cost basis of an impaired security is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value. In periods subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment,
the impaired security is accounted for as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of the impairment. Accordingly, the discount (or reduced premium) based on the new cost basis is accreted into net investment income in future periods based
upon the amount and timing of expected future cash flows of the security, if the recoverable value of the investment based upon those cash flows is greater than the carrying value of the investment after the impairment.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks,
money market instruments and other debt instruments with maturities of three months or less when purchased, other than cash equivalents that are included in “Trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities, at fair value.”

Reinsurance Recoverables and Payables

Reinsurance recoverables and payables primarily include receivables and
corresponding payables associated with the reinsurance arrangements used to effect the Company’s acquisition of the retirement businesses of



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(continued)

CIGNA. The remaining amounts relate to other reinsurance arrangements entered into by the Company. For each of its reinsurance contracts, the Company
determines if the contract provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The Company reviews all contractual features, particularly those that may limit the amount
of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims. See Note 11 for additional information about the Company’s reinsurance arrangements.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs

Costs that vary with and that are related primarily to the production of new
insurance and annuity business are deferred to the extent such costs are deemed recoverable from future profits. Such costs include commissions, costs of policy issuance and underwriting, and variable field office expenses. Deferred policy
acquisition costs (“DAC”) are subject to recoverability testing at the end of each accounting period. DAC, for applicable products, is adjusted for the impact of unrealized gains or losses on investments as if these gains or losses had
been realized, with corresponding credits or charges included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” DAC amortization is reflected in “General and administrative expenses.”

For traditional participating life insurance included in the Closed Block,
DAC is amortized over the expected life of the contracts (up to 45 years) in proportion to gross margins based on historical and anticipated future experience, which is evaluated regularly. The average rate per annum of assumed future investment
yield used in estimating expected gross margins was 7.90% at December 31, 2007 and gradually increases to 8.06% for periods after December 31, 2031, consistent with the assumptions used in funding the Closed Block. The effect of changes in
estimated gross margins on unamortized deferred acquisition costs is reflected in “General and administrative expenses” in the period such estimated gross margins are revised. Policy acquisition costs related to interest-sensitive and
variable life products and fixed and variable deferred annuity products are deferred and amortized over the expected life of the contracts (periods ranging from 25 to 99 years) in proportion to gross profits arising principally from investment
results, mortality and expense margins, and surrender charges based on historical and anticipated future experience, which is updated periodically. The effect of changes to estimated gross profits on unamortized deferred acquisition costs is
reflected in “General and administrative expenses” in the period such estimated gross profits are revised. DAC related to non-participating traditional individual life insurance is amortized in proportion to gross premiums.

For group annuity defined contribution contracts and group corporate- and
trust-owned life insurance contracts, acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the expected life of the contracts in proportion to gross profits. For group and individual long-term care contracts, acquisition expenses are deferred and
amortized in proportion to gross premiums. For single premium immediate annuities with life contingencies, and single premium group annuities and single premium structured settlements with life contingencies, all acquisition costs are charged to
expense immediately because generally all premiums are received at the inception of the contract. For funding agreement notes contracts, single premium structured settlement contracts without life contingencies, and single premium immediate
annuities without life contingencies, acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the expected life of the contracts using the interest method. For other group life and disability insurance contracts and guaranteed investment contracts,
acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.

For some products,
policyholders can elect to modify product benefits, features, rights or coverages by exchanging a contract for a new contract or by amendment, endorsement, or rider to a contract, or by the election of a feature or coverage within a contract. These
transactions are known as internal replacements. If policyholders surrender traditional life insurance policies in exchange for life insurance policies that do not have fixed and guaranteed terms, the Company immediately charges to expense the
remaining unamortized DAC on the surrendered policies. For other internal replacement transactions, except those that involve the addition of a nonintegrated contract feature that does not change the existing base contract, the unamortized DAC is



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(continued)

immediately charged to expense if the terms of the new policies are not substantially similar to those of the former policies. If the new terms are
substantially similar to those of the earlier policies, the DAC is retained with respect to the new policies and amortized over the expected life of the new policies. The Company adopted Statement of Position (“SOP”) 05-1 “Accounting
by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition Costs in Connection with Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance Contracts” on January 1, 2007. SOP 05-1 provided more definitive guidance regarding internal replacements and clarification
on what constitutes substantial changes to a contract. See “New Accounting Pronouncements” for additional information.

Separate Account Assets and Liabilities

Separate account assets are reported at fair value and represent segregated funds that are invested for certain policyholders, pension funds and other
customers. The assets primarily consist of equity securities, fixed maturities, real estate related investments, real estate mortgage loans, short-term investments and derivative instruments. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are
generally not subject to claims that arise out of any other business of the Company. Investment risks associated with market value changes are borne by the customers, except to the extent of minimum guarantees made by the Company with respect to
certain accounts. Separate account liabilities primarily represent the contractholder’s account balance in separate account assets. See Note 9 for additional information regarding separate account arrangements with contractual guarantees. The
investment income and realized investment gains or losses from separate account assets accrue to the policyholders and are not included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Mortality, policy administration and surrender charges assessed
against the accounts are included in “Policy charges and fee income.” Asset management fees charged to the accounts are included in “Asset management fees and other income.”

Other Assets and Other Liabilities

Other assets consist primarily of prepaid benefit costs, certain restricted
assets, broker-dealer related receivables, trade receivables, valuation of business acquired, goodwill and other intangible assets, the Company’s investments in operating joint ventures, which include the Company’s investment in Wachovia
Securities Financial Holdings, LLC (“Wachovia Securities”) and its indirect investment in China Pacific Insurance (Group) Co., Ltd. (“China Pacific Group”), property and equipment, receivables resulting from sales of securities
that had not yet settled at the balance sheet date, and relocation real estate assets and receivables. Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is determined using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets, which generally range from 3 to 40 years. Other liabilities consist primarily of trade payables, broker-dealer related payables and employee benefit liabilities.

As a result of certain acquisitions and the application of purchase
accounting, the Company reports a financial asset representing the valuation of business acquired (“VOBA”). VOBA represents the present value of future profits embedded in the acquired business. The Company has established a VOBA asset
primarily for its acquired traditional life, deferred annuity, defined contribution and defined benefit businesses. VOBA is determined by estimating the net present value of future cash flows from the contracts in force at the date of acquisition.
For acquired traditional insurance contracts, future positive cash flows generally include net valuation premiums while future negative cash flows include policyholders’ benefits and certain maintenance expenses. For acquired annuity contracts,
future positive cash flows generally include fees and other charges assessed to the contracts as long as they remain in force as well as fees collected upon surrender, if applicable, while future negative cash flows include costs to administer
contracts and benefit payments. In addition, future cash flows with respect to acquired annuity business include the impact of future cash flows expected from the guaranteed minimum death and living benefit provisions. For acquired defined
contribution and defined benefits businesses, contract balances are projected using assumptions for add-on deposits, participant withdrawals,



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(continued)

contract surrenders, and investment returns. Gross profits are then determined based on investment spreads and the excess of fees and other charges over the
costs to administer the contracts. VOBA is further explicitly adjusted to reflect the cost associated with the capital invested in the business. The Company amortizes VOBA over the effective life of the acquired contracts in “General and
administrative expenses.” For acquired traditional insurance contracts, VOBA is amortized in proportion to gross premiums or in proportion to the face amount of insurance in force, as applicable. For acquired annuity contracts, VOBA is
amortized in proportion to gross profits arising from the contracts and anticipated future experience, which is evaluated regularly. For acquired defined contribution and defined benefit businesses, the majority of VOBA is amortized in proportion to
gross profits arising principally from investment spreads and fees in excess of actual expense based upon historical and estimated future experience, which is updated periodically. The remainder of this VOBA is amortized based on gross revenues,
fees, or the change in policyholders’ account balances, as applicable. The effect of changes in gross profits on unamortized VOBA is reflected in the period such estimates of expected future profits are revised.

As a result of certain acquisitions, the Company recognizes an asset for
goodwill representing the excess of cost over the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually as of December 31 and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change
that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. See Note 7 for additional information regarding goodwill.

The Company offers various types of sales inducements. The Company defers sales inducements and amortizes them over the anticipated life of the policy
using the same methodology and assumptions used to amortize deferred policy acquisition costs. The Company amortizes deferred sales inducements in “Interest credited to policyholders’ account balances.” See Note 9 for additional
information regarding sales inducements.

Future Policy Benefits

The Company’s liability for future policy benefits is
primarily comprised of the present value of estimated future payments to or on behalf of policyholders, where the timing and amount of payment depends on policyholder mortality or morbidity, less the present value of future net premiums. For
individual traditional participating life insurance products, the mortality and interest rate assumptions applied are those used to calculate the policies’ guaranteed cash surrender values. For life insurance, other than individual traditional
participating life insurance, and annuity and disability products, expected mortality and morbidity is generally based on the Company’s historical experience or standard industry tables including a provision for the risk of adverse deviation.
Interest rate assumptions are based on factors such as market conditions and expected investment returns. Although mortality and morbidity and interest rate assumptions are “locked-in” upon the issuance of new insurance or annuity business
with fixed and guaranteed terms, significant changes in experience or assumptions may require the Company to provide for expected future losses on a product by establishing premium deficiency reserves. Premium deficiency reserves, if required, are
determined based on assumptions at the time the premium deficiency reserve is established and do not include a provision for the risk of adverse deviation.

The Company’s liability for future policy benefits also includes a liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. The Company does not
establish claim liabilities until a loss has occurred. However, unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses includes estimates of claims that the Company believes have been incurred but have not yet been reported as of the balance sheet date. The
Company’s liability for future policy benefits also includes net liabilities for guarantee benefits related to certain nontraditional long-duration life and annuity contracts, which are discussed more fully in Note 9, and certain unearned
revenues.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(continued)

Policyholders’ Account Balances

The Company’s liability for policyholders’ account balances represents the contract value that has accrued to the
benefit of the policyholder as of the balance sheet date. This liability is generally equal to the accumulated account deposits, plus interest credited, less policyholder withdrawals and other charges assessed against the account balance. These
policyholders’ account balances also include provision for benefits under non-life contingent payout annuities and certain unearned revenues.

Policyholders’ Dividends

The Company’s liability for policyholders’ dividends includes its dividends payable to policyholders and its policyholder dividend obligation
associated with the participating policies included in the Closed Block. The dividends payable for participating policies included in the Closed Block are determined at the end of each year for the following year by the Board of Directors of
Prudential Insurance based on its statutory results, capital position, ratings, and the emerging experience of the Closed Block. The policyholder dividend obligation represents net unrealized investment gains that have arisen subsequent to the
establishment of the Closed Block and the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings, to be paid to Closed Block policyholders unless otherwise offset by future experience. The dividends payable for policies other
than the participating policies included in the Closed Block include special dividends to certain policyholders of Gibraltar Life, a Japanese insurance company acquired in April 2001, and dividends payable in accordance with certain group insurance
policies. The special dividends payable to the policyholders of Gibraltar Life are based on 70% of the net increase in the fair value of certain real estate and loans included in Gibraltar Life’s reorganization plan, net of transaction costs
and taxes. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, this dividend liability was $421 million and $324 million, respectively.

Contingent Liabilities

Amounts related to contingent liabilities are accrued if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount is reasonably estimable.
Management evaluates whether there are incremental legal or other costs directly associated with the ultimate resolution of the matter that are reasonably estimable and, if so, they are included in the accrual.

Insurance Revenue and Expense Recognition

Premiums from individual life and health insurance products, other than
interest-sensitive life contracts, are recognized when due. When premiums are due over a significantly shorter period than the period over which benefits are provided, any gross premium in excess of the net premium (i.e., the portion of the gross
premium required to provide for all expected future benefits and expenses) is deferred and recognized into revenue in a constant relationship to insurance in force. Benefits are recorded as an expense when they are incurred. A liability for future
policy benefits is recorded when premiums are recognized using the net level premium method.

Premiums from non-participating group annuities with life contingencies, single premium structured settlements with life contingencies and single premium immediate annuities with life contingencies are recognized when
due. When premiums are due over a significantly shorter period than the period over which benefits are provided, any gross premium in excess of the net premium is deferred and recognized into revenue in a constant relationship to the amount of
expected future benefit payments. Benefits are recorded as an expense when they are incurred. A liability for future policy benefits is recorded when premiums are recognized using the net level premium method.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

(continued)

Certain individual annuity contracts provide the holder a guarantee that the benefit received upon
death or annuitization will be no less than a minimum prescribed amount. These benefits are accounted for as insurance contracts and are discussed in further detail in Note 9. The Company also provides contracts with certain living benefits which
are considered embedded derivatives. These contracts are discussed in further detail in Note 9.

Amounts received as payment for interest-sensitive group and individual life contracts, deferred fixed annuities, structured settlements and other
contracts without life contingencies, and participating group annuities are reported as deposits to “Policyholders’ account balances.” Revenues from these contracts are reflected in “Policy charges and fee income” consisting
primarily of fees assessed during the period against the policyholders’ account balances for mortality charges, policy administration charges and surrender charges. In addition to fees, the Company earns investment income from the investment of
policyholders’ deposits in the Company’s general account portfolio. Fees assessed that represent compensation to the Company for services to be provided in future periods and certain other fees are deferred and amortized into revenue over
the life of the related contracts in proportion to gross profits. Benefits and expenses for these products include claims in excess of related account balances, expenses of contract administration, interest credited to policyholders’ account
balances and amortization of DAC.

For group life, other than
interest-sensitive group life contracts, and disability insurance, premiums are recognized over the period to which the premiums relate in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided. Claim and claim adjustment expenses are recognized
when incurred.

Premiums, benefits and expenses are stated net
of reinsurance ceded to other companies, except for amounts associated with certain modified coinsurance contracts which are reflected in the Company’s financial statements based on the application of the deposit method of accounting. Estimated
reinsurance recoverables and the cost of reinsurance are recognized over the life of the reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the underlying policies.

Foreign Currency

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations and subsidiaries reported in currencies other than U.S. dollars are translated
at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period. Revenues, benefits and other expenses are translated at the average rate prevailing during the period. The effects of translating the statements of financial position of non-U.S. entities with
functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included, net of related hedge gains and losses and income taxes, in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are reported in
either “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” or current earnings in “Asset management fees and other income” depending on the nature of the related foreign currency denominated asset or liability.

Asset Management Fees and Other Income

Asset management fees and other income principally include asset management
fees and securities and commodities commission revenues, which are recognized in the period in which the services are performed. Realized and unrealized gains from investments classified as “trading” such as “Trading account assets
supporting insurance liabilities” and “Other trading account assets,” and from consolidated entities that follow specialized investment company fair value accounting are also included in “Asset management fees and other
income.” In certain asset management fee arrangements, the Company is entitled to receive performance based incentive fees when the return on assets under management exceeds certain benchmark returns or other performance targets. Performance
based incentive fee revenue is accrued quarterly based on measuring fund performance to date versus the performance benchmark stated in the investment management agreement.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial
indices or the values of securities or commodities. Derivative financial instruments generally used by the Company include swaps, futures, forwards and options and may be exchange-traded or contracted in the over-the-counter market. Derivative
positions are carried at fair value, generally by obtaining quoted market prices or through the use of valuation models. Values can be affected by changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices, values of securities or
commodities, credit spreads, market volatility, expected returns and liquidity. Values can also be affected by changes in estimates and assumptions, including those related to counterparty behavior, used in valuation models.

Derivatives are used in a non-dealer capacity in insurance, investment and
international businesses as well as treasury operations to manage the characteristics of the Company’s asset/liability mix, to manage the interest rate and currency characteristics of assets or liabilities and to mitigate the risk of a
diminution, upon translation to U.S. dollars, of expected non-U.S. earnings and net investments in foreign operations resulting from unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Additionally, derivatives may be used to seek to reduce exposure to
interest rate, foreign currency and equity risks associated with assets held or expected to be purchased or sold, and liabilities incurred or expected to be incurred.

Derivatives are also used in a derivative dealer or broker capacity in the Company’s securities operations to meet the
needs of clients by structuring transactions that allow clients to manage their exposure to interest rates, foreign exchange rates, indices or prices of securities and commodities and similarly in a dealer or broker capacity through the operation of
certain hedge portfolios. Realized and unrealized changes in fair value of derivatives used in these dealer related operations are included in “Asset management fees and other income” in the periods in which the changes occur. Cash flows
from such derivatives are reported in the operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Derivatives are recorded either as assets, within “Other trading account assets,” or “Other long-term investments,” or as liabilities,
within “Other liabilities,” in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, except for embedded derivatives which are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position with the associated host contract. The Company nets
the fair value of all derivative financial instruments with counterparties for which a master netting arrangement has been executed pursuant to FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 39. As discussed in detail below and in Note 19, all
realized and unrealized changes in fair value of non-dealer related derivatives, with the exception of the effective portion of cash flow hedges and effective hedges of net investments in foreign operations, are recorded in current earnings. Cash
flows from these derivatives are reported in the operating or investing activities section in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

For non-dealer related derivatives the Company designates derivatives as either (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or
unrecognized firm commitment (“fair value” hedge); (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash flow” hedge); (3) a
foreign-currency fair value or cash flow hedge (“foreign currency” hedge); (4) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation; or (5) a derivative that does not qualify for hedge accounting.

To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative must be highly
effective in mitigating the designated risk of the hedged item. Effectiveness of the hedge is formally assessed at inception and throughout the life of the hedging relationship. Even if a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting treatment, there
may be an element of ineffectiveness of the hedge. Under such circumstances, the ineffective portion is recorded in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.”



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(continued)

When consummated, the Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and
hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as fair value, cash flow, or foreign currency, hedges to specific assets and
liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation are linked to the specific foreign operation.

When a derivative is designated as a fair value hedge and is determined to be
highly effective, changes in its fair value, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability (including losses or gains on firm commitments), are reported on a net basis in the income statement, generally in “Realized
investment gains (losses), net.” When swaps are used in hedge accounting relationships, periodic settlements are recorded in the same income statement line as the related settlements of the hedged items.

When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge and is determined to be
highly effective, changes in its fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows being hedged (

e.g

., when periodic settlements on a
variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings). At that time, the related portion of deferred gains or losses on the derivative instrument is reclassified and reported in the income statement line item associated with the hedged item.

When a derivative is designated as a foreign currency hedge
and is determined to be highly effective, changes in its fair value are recorded in either current period earnings or “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” depending on whether the hedge transaction is a fair value hedge
(

e.g

., a hedge of a recognized foreign currency asset or liability) or a cash flow hedge (

e.g

., a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction). When a derivative is used as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation,
its change in fair value, to the extent effective as a hedge, is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment account within “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).”

If it is determined that a derivative no longer qualifies as an effective
fair value or cash flow hedge or management removes the hedge designation, the derivative will continue to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value, with changes in fair value recognized currently in “Realized investment gains
(losses), net.” The asset or liability under a fair value hedge will no longer be adjusted for changes in fair value and the existing basis adjustment is amortized to the income statement line associated with the asset or liability. The
component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” related to discontinued cash flow hedges is amortized to the income statement line associated with the hedged cash flows consistent with the earnings impact of the original
hedged cash flows.

When hedge accounting is discontinued
because the hedged item no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment, or because it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the specified time period, the derivative will continue to be carried on the balance
sheet at its fair value, with changes in fair value recognized currently in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” Any asset or liability that was recorded pursuant to recognition of the firm commitment is removed from the balance
sheet and recognized currently in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” Gains and losses that were in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” pursuant to the hedge of a forecasted transaction are recognized
immediately in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.”

If a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting, all changes in its fair value, including net receipts and payments, are included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net” without considering changes in the fair value of
the economically associated assets or liabilities.

The Company
is a party to financial instruments that may contain derivative instruments that are “embedded” in the financial instruments. At inception, the Company assesses whether the economic



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(continued)

characteristics of the embedded derivative are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the remaining component of the financial
instrument (

i.e

., the host contract) and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative instrument. When it is determined that (1) the embedded derivative possesses
economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract, and (2) a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is
separated from the host contract, carried at fair value, and changes in its fair value are included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.”

Income Taxes

The Company and its eligible domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return that includes both life insurance companies and non-life
insurance companies. Subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. are taxed, and income tax expense is recorded, based on applicable foreign statutes. See Note 17 for a discussion of certain non-U.S. jurisdictions for which the Company assumes
repatriation of earnings to the U.S.

Deferred income taxes are
recognized, based on enacted rates, when assets and liabilities have different values for financial statement and tax reporting purposes. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce a deferred tax asset to the amount expected to be realized.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, “Business
Combinations.” This statement, which addresses the accounting for business acquisitions, is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008, with early adoption prohibited, and generally applies to business acquisitions
completed after December 31, 2008. Among other things, the new standard requires that all acquisition-related costs be expensed as incurred, and that all restructuring costs related to acquired operations be expensed as incurred. This new
standard also addresses the current and subsequent accounting for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies acquired or assumed and, for acquisitions both prior and subsequent to December 31, 2008, requires the acquirer to recognize
changes in the amount of its deferred tax benefits that are recognizable because of a business combination either in income from continuing operations in the period of the combination or directly in contributed capital, depending on the
circumstances. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 141R on the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements.” SFAS No. 160 will change the accounting for minority interests, which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified by the parent company as a component of equity. This statement is effective for fiscal
years beginning on or after December 15, 2008, with early adoption prohibited. Upon adoption, SFAS No. 160 requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests and prospective
adoption for all other requirements. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 160 on the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations.

In November 2007, the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
(“SAB”) No. 109, “Written Loan Commitments Recorded at Fair Value Through Earnings.” SAB 109 revises and rescinds portions of SAB 105, “Application of Accounting Principles to Loan Commitments.” Specifically, SAB
109 states that the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan should be included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings. SAB 109 is effective for
all written loan commitments recorded at fair value that are entered into, or substantially modified, in fiscal quarters beginning after December 15, 2007. The Company will adopt SAB 109 effective January 1, 2008 for its loan commitments
that are recorded at fair value through earnings. The Company’s adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In April 2007, the FASB issued FSP FIN 39-1, “Amendment of FASB Interpretation
No. 39.” FSP FIN 39-1 modifies FIN No. 39, “Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts,” and permits companies to offset cash collateral receivables or payables with net derivative positions under certain
circumstances. This FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and is required to be applied retrospectively to financial statements for all periods presented. The Company’s adoption of this guidance is not
expected to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.” This statement
provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value, with the associated changes in fair value reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company will adopt this guidance effective
January 1, 2008. The Company expects to elect the fair value option for certain commercial loans held for investment and for commercial loans originated on or after January 1, 2008 that are held for sale, both of which are within the
Company’s commercial mortgage operations. Electing the fair value option for these loans will allow the changes in fair values of the loans and the related derivative instruments used to economically hedge interest rate risk to offset in
current earnings without needing to meet the requirements for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS 133. The Company’s adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position
or results of operations.

In September 2006, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans” an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). This statement requires an employer on a prospective basis to
recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes
occur through other comprehensive income. The Company adopted this requirement, along with the required disclosures, on December 31, 2006. See Note 16 for the effects of this adoption as well as the related required disclosures.

SFAS No. 158 also requires an employer on a prospective basis to measure
the funded status of its plans as of its fiscal year-end. This requirement is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The Company will adopt this guidance on December 31, 2008 and anticipates that the impact of changing
from a September 30 measurement date to a December 31 measurement date will not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” This statement defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement does not change which assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, but the application of this statement could change
current practices in determining fair value. The Company will adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2008. The Company’s adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

In September 2006, the
staff of the SEC issued SAB No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements.” The interpretations in SAB 108 express the staff’s views regarding
the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements. Specifically, the SEC staff believes that registrants must quantify the impact on current period financial statements of correcting all misstatements, including both those occurring in
the current period and the effect of reversing those that have accumulated from prior periods. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. Since the Company’s method for quantifying financial statement
misstatements already considered those occurring in the current period and the effect of reversing those that have accumulated from prior periods, the adoption of SAB 108 had no effect to the financial position or results of operations of the
Company.

2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(continued)

In July 2006, the FASB issued FSP SFAS 13-2, “Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the
Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction,” an amendment of FASB Statement No. 13. FSP SFAS 13-2 indicates that a change or projected change in the timing of cash flows relating to income
taxes generated by a leveraged lease would require a recalculation of cumulative and prospective income recognition associated with the transaction. FSP SFAS 13-2 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company
adopted FSP SFAS 13-2 on January 1, 2007 and the adoption resulted in a net after-tax reduction to retained earnings of $84 million, as of January 1, 2007.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” an Interpretation of
FASB Statement No. 109. See Note 17 for details regarding the adoption of this pronouncement.

In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, “Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets.” This statement requires that servicing assets
or liabilities be initially measured at fair value, with subsequent changes in value reported based on either a fair value or amortized cost approach for each class of servicing assets or liabilities. Under previous guidance, such servicing assets
or liabilities were initially measured at historical cost and the amortized cost method was required for subsequent reporting. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2007, and elected to continue reporting subsequent changes in
value using the amortized cost approach. Adoption of this guidance had no material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Instruments.” This statement eliminates an
exception from the requirement to bifurcate an embedded derivative feature from beneficial interests in securitized financial assets. The Company has used this exception for investments the Company has made in securitized financial assets in the
normal course of operations, and thus has not previously had to consider whether such investments contain an embedded derivative. The new requirement to identify embedded derivatives in beneficial interests will be applied on a prospective basis
only to beneficial interests acquired, issued, or subject to certain remeasurement conditions after the adoption of the guidance. This statement also provides an election, on an instrument by instrument basis, to measure at fair value an entire
hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation, rather than measuring only the embedded derivative on a fair value basis. If the fair value election is chosen, changes in unrealized gains and losses are
reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2007. The Company’s adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

In November 2005, the FASB
issued FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments.” This FSP provides impairment models for determining whether to record impairment losses associated with
investments in certain equity and debt securities, primarily by referencing existing accounting guidance. It also requires income to be accrued on a level-yield basis following an impairment of debt securities, where reasonable estimates of the
timing and amount of future cash flows can be made. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2006, and it did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In September 2005, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee
(“AcSEC”) of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued SOP 05-1, “Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition Costs in Connection With Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance Contracts.” SOP
05-1 provides guidance on accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs, including deferred policy acquisition costs, valuation of business acquired and deferred sales inducements, on internal replacements of insurance and
investment contracts other than those specifically described in SFAS No. 97. SOP 05-1 defines an internal replacement as a modification in product benefits, features, rights, or coverages that occurs by the exchange of a contract for a new
contract, or by amendment, endorsement, or rider to a contract, or by the election of a feature



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

(continued)

or coverage within a contract, and was effective for internal replacements occurring in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company
adopted SOP 05-1 on January 1, 2007, which resulted in a net after-tax reduction to retained earnings of $20 million.

In June 2005, the EITF of the FASB reached a consensus on Issue No. 04-5, “Investor’s Accounting for an Investment in a Limited Partnership
When the Investor Is the Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights.” This Issue first presumes that general partners in a limited partnership control that partnership and should therefore consolidate that partnership,
and then provides that the general partners may overcome the presumption of control if the limited partners have: (1) the substantive ability to dissolve or liquidate the limited partnership, or otherwise to remove the general partners without
cause or (2) the ability to participate effectively in significant decisions that would be expected to be made in the ordinary course of the limited partnership’s business. This guidance became effective for new or amended arrangements
after June 29, 2005, and became effective January 1, 2006 for all arrangements existing as of June 29, 2005 that remain unmodified. The Company’s adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In
June 2005, the FASB issued Statement No. 133 Implementation Issue No. B39, “Embedded Derivatives: Application of Paragraph 13(b) to Call Options That are Exercisable Only by the Debtor.” Implementation Issue No. B39 indicates that
debt instruments where the right to accelerate the settlement of debt can be exercised only by the debtor do not meet the criteria of Paragraph 13(b) of Statement No. 133, and therefore should not individually lead to such options being
considered embedded derivatives. Such options must still be evaluated under paragraph 13(a) of Statement No. 133. This implementation guidance was effective for the first fiscal quarter beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company’s
adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2006 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations as the guidance is consistent with the Company’s existing accounting policy.

Reclassifications

3.    ACQUISITIONS AND
DISPOSITIONS

Acquisition of a portion of Union Bank of
California’s Retirement Business

On
December 31, 2007, the Company acquired a portion of the Union Bank of California, N.A’s retirement business for $103 million of cash consideration. In recording the transaction, the entire purchase price was allocated to other
intangibles, which are reflected in “Other assets.”

Sale of
Oppenheim Joint Ventures

On July 12, 2007, the
Company sold its 50% interest in its operating joint ventures Oppenheim Pramerica Fonds Trust GmbH and Oppenheim Pramerica Asset Management S.a.r.l., which the Company accounted for under the equity method, to its partner Oppenheim S.C.A. for $121
million. These businesses establish, package and distribute mutual fund products to German and other European retail investors. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of $37 million and related taxes of $22 million for the year ended
December 31, 2007.

Acquisition of The Allstate Corporation’s
Variable Annuity Business

On June 1, 2006 (the
“date of acquisition”), the Company acquired the variable annuity business of The Allstate Corporation (“Allstate”) through a reinsurance transaction for $635 million of total consideration,



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

3.    ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

(continued)

consisting primarily of a $628 million ceding commission. The reinsurance arrangements with Allstate include a coinsurance arrangement associated with the
general account liabilities assumed and a modified coinsurance arrangement associated with the separate account liabilities assumed. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial
Statements as of the date of acquisition. The Company’s results of operations include the results of the acquired variable annuity business beginning from the date of acquisition. The assets acquired included primarily cash of $1.4 billion that
was subsequently used to purchase investments; VOBA of $648 million that represents the present value of future profits embedded in the acquired contracts; and $97 million of goodwill. The liabilities assumed included primarily a liability for
variable annuity contractholders’ account balances of $1.5 billion associated with the coinsurance agreement. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed also included a reinsurance receivable from Allstate and a reinsurance payable to
Allstate, each in the amount of $14.8 billion. The reinsurance payable, which represents the Company’s obligation under the modified coinsurance arrangement, is netted with the reinsurance receivable in the Company’s Consolidated Statement
of Financial Position. Pro forma information for this acquisition is omitted as the impact is not material.

Acquisition of CIGNA Corporation’s Retirement Business

On April 1, 2004, the Company acquired the retirement business of CIGNA for cash consideration of $2.1 billion. Concurrent with the acquisition, the
Company entered into reinsurance arrangements with CIGNA to effect the transfer of the business included in the transaction.

The Company has assumed the liabilities and received the related assets associated with the coinsurance-with-assumption arrangement related to the
acquired general account defined contribution and defined benefit plan contracts and the modified-coinsurance-with-assumption arrangement related to the majority of the acquired separate account contracts. The Company has substantially completed the
process of requesting customers to agree to substitute CIGNA with a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company in these contracts.

CIGNA will retain the assets and liabilities associated with the modified-coinsurance-without-assumption arrangement related to the remaining acquired
separate account contracts, but has ceded the net profits or losses and the associated net cash flows to the Company for the remaining lives of the contracts. The reinsurance recoverable and reinsurance payable associated with this arrangement are
discussed in more detail in Note 11.

In addition, as an
element of the acquisition, the Company had the right, beginning two years after the acquisition, to commute the modified-coinsurance-with-assumption arrangement related to the acquired defined benefit guaranteed-cost contracts in exchange for cash
consideration from CIGNA. Effective April 1, 2006, the Company reached an agreement with CIGNA to convert the modified-coinsurance-with-assumption arrangement to an indemnity coinsurance arrangement, effectively retaining the economics of the
defined benefit guaranteed-cost contracts for the life of the block of business. Upon conversion, the Company extinguished its reinsurance recoverable and reinsurance payable with CIGNA related to the modified-coinsurance-with-assumption
arrangement. Concurrently, the Company assumed $1.7 billion of liabilities from CIGNA under the indemnity coinsurance arrangement and received the related assets.

Acquisition of Hyundai Investment and Securities Co., Ltd.

In 2004, the Company acquired an 80 percent interest in Hyundai Investment and Securities Co., Ltd., a Korean asset
management firm, from an agency of the Korean government, for $301 million in cash, including $210 million used to repay debt assumed. Subsequent to the acquisition, the company was renamed Prudential Investment & Securities Co., Ltd. On
January 25, 2008, the Company acquired the remaining 20 percent for $90 million.

The commercial loans are geographically dispersed throughout the United States, Canada and Asia with
the largest concentrations in California (22%) and New York (7%) at December 31, 2007.

Activity in the allowance for losses for all commercial loans, for the years ended December 31, is as follows:

Non-performing
commercial loans identified in management’s specific review of probable loan losses and the related allowance for losses at December 31, are as follows:

Non-performing
commercial loans with no allowance for losses are loans in which the fair value of the collateral or the net present value of the loans’ expected future cash flows equals or exceeds the recorded investment. The average recorded investment in
non-performing loans before allowance for losses was $26 million, $48 million, and $210 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Net investment income recognized on these loans totaled $1 million, $3 million and $4 million for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The
Company’s loans held for sale are primarily commercial mortgage loans to be sold in securitization transactions. The net carrying value of commercial loans held for sale by the Company as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $848 million (net
of a valuation allowance of zero million) and $341 million (net of a valuation allowance of zero million), respectively. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, all of the Company’s commercial loans held for sale were collateralized, with
collateral primarily consisting of office buildings, retail stores, apartment complexes and industrial buildings. In certain transactions, the Company prearranges that it will sell the loan to an investor. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, $306
million and $93 million, respectively, of loans held for sale are subject to such arrangements.

Commercial mortgage loans in securitization transactions accounted for by the Company as sales totaled $3,589 million, $2,704 million and $2,437 million,
for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company generally retains the servicing responsibilities related to its commercial loan securitizations. As of December 31, 2007, the Company also held commercial
mortgage-backed securities representing a $191 million retained beneficial interest in the mortgage loans the Company transferred to certain securitization vehicles in 2007. These commercial mortgage-backed securities are classified as “Other
trading account assets.” The Company recognized net pre-tax losses of $57 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, and net pre-tax gains of $36 million and $36 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively,

Other Long-term Investments

“Other long-term investments” are comprised as follows at December 31:

In certain investment
structures, the Company’s asset management business invests with other co-investors in an investment fund referred to as a feeder fund. In these structures, the invested capital of several feeder funds is pooled together and used to purchase
ownership interests in another fund, referred to as a master fund. The master fund utilizes this invested capital, and in certain cases other debt financing, to purchase various classes of assets on behalf of its investors. Specialized industry
accounting for investment companies calls for the feeder fund to reflect its investment in the master fund as a single net asset equal to its proportionate share of the net assets of the master fund, regardless of its level of interest in the master
fund. In cases where the Company consolidates the feeder fund, it retains the feeder fund’s net asset presentation and reports the consolidated feeder fund’s proportionate share of the net assets of the master fund in “Other long-term
investments,” with any unaffiliated investors’ minority interest in the feeder fund reported in “Other liabilities.” As of December 31, 2007 and 2006 respectively, the consolidated feeder funds’ investments in these
master funds, reflected on this net asset basis, totaled $839 million and $225 million. The minority interest in the consolidated feeder funds was $59 million and $0 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and the master funds
had gross assets of $11.0 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively, and gross liabilities of $10.0 billion and $8.2 billion, respectively, which are not included on the Company’s balance sheet.

gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2007 and 2006 are composed of $2,476 million and $891 million related to investment grade securities and $391 million and $127 million related to below investment grade securities, respectively. At
December 31, 2007, $426 million of the gross unrealized losses represented declines in value of greater than 20%, all of which had been in that position for less than six months, as compared to $7 million at December 31, 2006 that
represented declines in value of greater than 20%, substantially all of which had been in that position for less than six months. At December 31, 2007, the $710 million of gross unrealized losses of twelve months or more were concentrated in
asset backed securities, and in the manufacturing and utilities sectors. At December 31, 2006, the $656 million of gross unrealized losses of twelve months or more were concentrated in the manufacturing, utilities and services sectors. In

concluded that an adjustment for other-than-temporary impairments for these securities was not warranted at December 31, 2007 or 2006.

Variable Interest Entities

In the normal course of its activities, the Company enters into relationships with various special purpose entities and other entities that are deemed to
be variable interest entities (“VIEs”), in accordance with FIN No. 46(R), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.” A VIE is an entity that either (1) has equity investors that lack certain essential
characteristics of a controlling financial interest (including the ability to control the entity, the obligation to absorb the entity’s expected losses and the right to receive the entity’s expected residual returns) or (2) lacks
sufficient equity to finance its own activities without financial support provided by other entities, which in turn would be expected to absorb at least some of the expected losses of the VIE. If the Company determines that it stands to absorb a
majority of the VIE’s expected losses or to receive a majority of the VIE’s expected residual returns, the Company would be deemed to be the VIE’s “primary beneficiary” and would be required to consolidate the VIE.

Consolidated Variable Interest Entities

The Company is the primary beneficiary of certain VIEs in which the Company
has invested, as part of its investment activities, but over which the Company does not exercise control. The table below reflects the carrying amount and balance sheet caption in which the assets of these consolidated VIEs are reported. The
liabilities of consolidated VIEs are included in “Other liabilities” and are also reflected in the table below. These liabilities primarily comprise obligations under debt instruments issued by the VIEs, that are non-recourse to the
Company. The creditors of each consolidated VIE have recourse only to the assets of that VIE.

In addition, the
Company has created a trust that is a VIE, to facilitate Prudential Insurance’s Funding Agreement Notes Issuance Program (“FANIP”). The trust issues medium-term notes secured by funding agreements issued to the trust by Prudential
Insurance with the proceeds of such notes. The Company is the primary beneficiary of the trust, which is therefore consolidated. The funding agreements represent an intercompany transaction that is eliminated upon consolidation. However, in
recognition of the security interest in such funding agreements, the trust’s medium-term note liability of $8,535 million and $6,537 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, is classified on the Consolidated Statements of
Financial Position within “Policyholders’ account balances.” See Note 8 for more information on FANIP.

Significant Variable Interests in Unconsolidated Variable Interest Entities

The Company is the collateral manager for certain asset backed investment
vehicles (commonly referred to as collateralized debt obligations, or “CDOs”), for which the Company earns fee income. Additionally, the Company may invest in debt or equity securities issued by these CDOs. CDOs raise capital by issuing
debt and equity securities, and use the proceeds to purchase investments, typically interest-bearing financial instruments. The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two CDOs it manages at December 31, 2007 and one CDO it
managed at December 31, 2006, which are consolidated and reflected in the table above. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss resulting from its relationship with unconsolidated CDOs it manages is limited to its investment in the CDOs,
which was $143 million and $122 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These investments are reflected in “Fixed maturities, available for sale.”

In addition, in the normal course of its activities, the Company will invest in structured investments, some of which are
VIEs. These structured investments typically invest in fixed income investments and are managed by third parties. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss on these structured investments, both VIEs and non-VIEs, is limited to the amount of its
investment.

Included among these structured investments are
asset-backed securities issued by VIEs that manage investments in the European market. In addition to a stated coupon, each investment provides a return based on

the VIE’s portfolio of assets and related investment activity. The Company accounts for these investments as available for sale fixed maturities
containing embedded derivatives that are bifurcated and marked to market through “Realized investment gains (losses), net,” based upon the change in value of the underlying portfolio. The Company’s variable interest in each of these
VIEs represents less than 50% of the only class of variable interests issued by the VIE. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss from these interests was $1,933 million and $2,131 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which
includes the fair value of the embedded derivatives.

Securities Pledged,
Restricted Assets and Special Deposits

The Company
pledges as collateral investment securities it owns to unaffiliated parties through certain transactions, including securities lending, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and futures contracts. At December 31, the carrying value of
investments pledged to third parties as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position included the following:

In the normal course
of its business activities, the Company accepts collateral that can be sold or repledged. The primary sources of this collateral are securities in customer accounts and securities purchased under agreements to resell. The fair value of this
collateral was approximately $704 million and $650 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, of which $704 million in 2007 and $408 million in 2006 had either been sold or repledged.

Assets of $197 million and $271 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively, were on deposit with governmental authorities or trustees. Additionally, assets carried at $692 million and $697 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, were held in voluntary trusts established primarily to fund
guaranteed dividends to certain policyholders and to fund certain employee benefits. Letter stock or other securities restricted as to sale amounted to $154 million and $0 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Restricted cash and
securities of $3,097 million and $2,752 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, were included in “Other assets.” The restricted cash and securities primarily represent funds deposited by clients and funds accruing to
clients as a result of trades or contracts.

6.    INVESTMENTS IN OPERATING JOINT VENTURES

The Company has made investments in certain joint ventures that are strategic in nature and made other than for the sole purpose of generating investment income. These investments are accounted for under the equity
method of accounting and are included in “Other assets” in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The earnings from these investments are included on an after-tax basis in “Equity in earnings of operating
joint ventures, net of taxes” in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Investments in operating joint ventures include the Company’s investment in Wachovia Securities, as well as investments in other operating joint
ventures as part of its international insurance and international investment businesses. The summarized financial information for the Company’s operating joint ventures has been included in the summarized combined financial information for all
significant equity method investments shown in Note 4.

Investment in
Wachovia Securities

On July 1, 2003, the Company
combined its retail securities brokerage and clearing operations with those of Wachovia Corporation (“Wachovia”) and formed Wachovia Securities, a joint venture now headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri. As of December 31, 2007,
the Company had a 38% ownership interest in the joint venture with Wachovia owning the remaining 62%. The transaction included certain assets and liabilities of the Company’s securities brokerage operations; however, the Company retained
certain assets and liabilities related to the contributed businesses, including liabilities for certain litigation and regulatory matters. The Company and Wachovia have each agreed to indemnify the other for certain losses, including losses
resulting from litigation and regulatory matters relating to certain events arising from the operations of their respective contributed businesses prior to March 31, 2004.

On October 1, 2007, Wachovia completed the acquisition of A.G. Edwards, Inc. (“A.G. Edwards”) for $6.8
billion and on January 1, 2008 combined the retail securities brokerage business of A.G. Edwards with Wachovia Securities.

On July 6, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the election by the Company of the “lookback” option under the terms of the
agreements relating to the joint venture. The “lookback” option permits the Company to delay for approximately two years following the combination of the A.G. Edwards business with Wachovia Securities the Company’s decision to make or
not to make payments to avoid or limit dilution of its ownership interest in the joint venture. During this “lookback” period, the Company’s share in the earnings of the joint venture and one-time costs associated with the combination
of the A.G. Edwards business with Wachovia Securities will be based on the Company’s diluted ownership level, which is in the process of being determined. Any payment at the end of the “lookback” period to restore all or part of the
Company’s ownership interest in the joint venture would be based on the appraised or agreed value of the existing joint venture and the A.G. Edwards business. In such event, the Company would also need to make a true-up payment of one-time
costs associated with the combination to reflect the incremental increase in its ownership interest in the joint venture. Alternatively, the Company may at the end of the “lookback” period “put” its joint venture interests to
Wachovia based on the appraised value of the joint venture, excluding the A.G. Edwards business, as of the date of the combination of the A.G. Edwards business with Wachovia Securities.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

6.    INVESTMENTS IN OPERATING JOINT VENTURES

(continued)

The Company will adjust the carrying value of its ownership interest in the joint venture effective
as of January 1, 2008, the date of the combination of the A.G. Edwards business with Wachovia Securities, to reflect the addition of that business and the initial dilution of its ownership level and to record the initial value of the above
described rights under the “lookback” option. The Company expects that the value to be recognized for the foregoing items will be credited net of tax directly to “Additional paid-in capital.”

The Company also retains its separate right to “put” its joint
venture interests to Wachovia at any time after July 1, 2008 based on the appraised value of the joint venture, including the A.G. Edwards business, determined as if it were a public company and including a control premium such as would apply
in the case of a sale of 100% of its common equity. However, if in connection with the “lookback” option the Company elects at the end of the “lookback” period to make payments to avoid or limit dilution, the Company may not
exercise this “put” option prior to the first anniversary of the end of the “lookback” period. The agreement between Prudential Financial and Wachovia also gives the Company put rights, and Wachovia call rights, in certain other
specified circumstances, at prices determined in accordance with the agreement.

The Company’s investment in Wachovia Securities was $1.220 billion and $1.217 billion as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company recognized pre-tax equity earnings from Wachovia Securities
of $370 million, $294 million and $192 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The income tax expense associated with these earnings was $146 million, $117 million and $76 million for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Dividends received from the investment in Wachovia Securities were $366 million, $277 million and $154 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

In connection with the combination of the Company’s retail securities
brokerage and clearing operations with those of Wachovia, the Company entered into various agreements with Wachovia and Wachovia Securities, including one associated with certain money market mutual fund balances of brokerage clients of Wachovia
Securities. These balances were essentially eliminated as of September 30, 2004 due to the replacement of those funds with other investment alternatives for those brokerage clients. The resulting reduction in asset management fees has been
offset by payments from Wachovia under an agreement dated as of July 30, 2004 implementing arrangements with respect to money market mutual funds in connection with the combination. The agreement extends for ten years after termination of the
joint venture with Wachovia. The revenue from Wachovia under this agreement was $51 million in 2007, $51 million in 2006 and $54 million in 2005.

Investments in other operating joint ventures

The Company has made investments in other operating joint ventures as part of its international insurance and international investments businesses. The
Company’s combined investment in these other operating joint ventures was $1,040 million and $437 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, including $633 million and $45 million, respectively, related to an indirect
investment in China Pacific Group, a Chinese insurance operation. The indirect investment in China Pacific Group as of December 31, 2007 includes unrealized market value increases, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income,
related to China Pacific Group’s initial public offering on the Shanghai Exchange in 2007. The Company recognized combined after-tax equity earnings from these joint ventures of $22 million, $31 million and $26 million for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Dividends received from these investments combined were $31 million, $29 million and $17 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

intangibles is expected to be approximately $42 million in 2008, $46 million in 2009, $41 million in 2010, $37 million in 2011 and $33 million in 2012.

8.    POLICYHOLDERS’ LIABILITIES

Future Policy Benefits

Future policy benefits at December 31, are as follows:

Life insurance
liabilities include reserves for death and endowment policy benefits, terminal dividends and certain health benefits. Individual and group annuities and supplementary contracts liabilities include reserves for life contingent immediate annuities and
life contingent group annuities. Other contract liabilities include unearned revenue and certain other reserves for group and individual life and health products.

Future policy benefits for individual participating traditional life insurance are based on the net level premium method,
calculated using the guaranteed mortality and nonforfeiture interest rates which range from 2.5% to 7.5%. Participating insurance represented 17% and 20% of domestic individual life insurance in force at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively, and 87%, 89% and 90% of domestic individual life insurance premiums for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Future policy benefits for individual non-participating traditional life insurance policies, group and individual long-term care policies and individual
health insurance policies are generally equal to the aggregate of (1) the present value of future benefit payments and related expenses, less the present value of future net premiums, and (2) any premium deficiency reserves. Assumptions as
to mortality, morbidity and persistency are based on the Company’s experience, and in certain instances, industry experience, when the basis of the reserve is established. Interest rates used in the determination of the present values range
from 1.4% to 9.5%; less than 2% of the reserves are based on an interest rate in excess of 8%.

Future policy benefits for individual and group annuities and supplementary contracts are generally equal to the aggregate of (1) the present value of expected future payments, and (2) any premium deficiency
reserves. Assumptions as to mortality are based on the Company’s experience, and in certain instances, industry experience, when the basis of the reserve is established. The interest rates used in the determination of the present values range
from 1.1% to 14.8%; less than 2% of the reserves are based on an interest rate in excess of 8%.

Future policy benefits for other contract liabilities are generally equal to the present value of expected future payments based on the Company’s
experience, except for example, certain group insurance coverages for which future policy benefits are equal to gross unearned premium reserves. The interest rates used in the determination of the present values range from 2.5% to 6.6%.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

8.    POLICYHOLDERS’ LIABILITIES

(continued)

Premium deficiency reserves are established, if necessary, when the liability for future policy
benefits plus the present value of expected future gross premiums are determined to be insufficient to provide for expected future policy benefits and expenses and to recover any unamortized policy acquisition costs. Premium deficiency reserves have
been recorded for the group single premium annuity business, which consists of limited-payment, long-duration traditional and non-participating annuities; structured settlements and single premium immediate annuities with life contingencies; and for
certain individual health policies. Liabilities of $2,464 million and $2,658 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, are included in “Future policy benefits” with respect to these deficiencies, of which $1,160 million
and $1,259 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, relate to net unrealized gains on securities classified as available for sale.

The Company’s liability for future policy benefits is also inclusive of liabilities for guarantee benefits related to certain nontraditional
long-duration life and annuity contracts, which are discussed more fully in Note 9.

Unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses primarily reflect the Company’s estimate of future disability claim payments and expenses as well as estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance
sheet dates related to group disability products. Unpaid claim liabilities are discounted using interest rates ranging from 0% to 6%.

Policyholders’ Account Balances

Policyholders’ account balances at December 31, are as follows:

Policyholders’
account balances represent an accumulation of account deposits plus credited interest less withdrawals, expenses and mortality charges, if applicable. These policyholders’ account balances also include provisions for benefits under non-life
contingent payout annuities. Included in “Funding agreements” at December 31, 2007 and 2006, are $8,535 million and $6,537 million, respectively, of medium-term notes liabilities of consolidated variable interest entities secured by
funding agreements purchased from the Company with the proceeds of such notes. The interest rates associated with such notes range from 3.9% to 5.7%. Interest crediting rates range from 0% to 11.8% for interest-sensitive life contracts and from 0%
to 13.4% for contracts other than interest-sensitive life. Less than 2% of policyholders’ account balances have interest crediting rates in excess of 8%.

9.    CERTAIN NONTRADITIONAL LONG-DURATION CONTRACTS

The Company issues traditional variable annuity contracts through its separate accounts for which investment income and
investment gains and losses accrue directly to, and investment risk is borne by, the contractholder. The Company also issues variable annuity contracts with general and separate account options where the Company contractually guarantees to the
contractholder a return of no less than (1) total deposits made to the contract less any partial withdrawals (“return of net deposits”), (2) total deposits made to the contract less any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return
(“minimum return”), or (3) the highest contract value on a



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

9.    CERTAIN NONTRADITIONAL LONG-DURATION CONTRACTS

(continued)

specified date minus any withdrawals (“contract value”). These guarantees include benefits that are payable in the event of death, annuitization or
at specified dates during the accumulation period and withdrawal and income benefits payable during specified periods.

The Company also issues annuity contracts with market value adjusted investment options (“MVAs”), which provide for a return of principal plus a
fixed rate of return if held to maturity, or, alternatively, a “market adjusted value” if surrendered prior to maturity or if funds are reallocated to other investment options. The market value adjustment may result in a gain or loss to
the Company, depending on crediting rates or an indexed rate at surrender, as applicable.

In addition, the Company issues variable life, variable universal life and universal life contracts where the Company contractually guarantees to the contractholder a death benefit even when there is insufficient
value to cover monthly mortality and expense charges, whereas otherwise the contract would typically lapse (“no lapse guarantee”). Variable life and variable universal life contracts are offered with general and separate account options.

The assets supporting the variable portion of both traditional
variable annuities and certain variable contracts with guarantees are carried at fair value and reported as “Separate account assets” with an equivalent amount reported as “Separate account liabilities.” Amounts assessed against
the contractholders for mortality, administration, and other services are included within revenue in “Policy charges and fee income” and changes in liabilities for minimum guarantees are generally included in “Policyholders’
benefits.” In 2007 and 2006, there were no gains or losses on transfers of assets from the general account to a separate account.

For those guarantees of benefits that are payable in the event of death, the net amount at risk is generally defined as the current guaranteed minimum
death benefit in excess of the current account balance at the balance sheet date. For guarantees of benefits that are payable at annuitization or withdrawal, the net amount at risk is generally defined as the present value of the minimum guaranteed
annuity payments available to the contractholder determined in accordance with the terms of the contract in excess of the current account balance. For guarantees of accumulation balances, the net amount at risk is generally defined as the guaranteed
minimum accumulation balance minus the current account balance. The Company’s contracts with guarantees may offer more than one type of guarantee in each contract; therefore, the amounts listed may not be mutually exclusive. As of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had the following guarantees associated with these contracts, by product and guarantee type:

(1)

Includes income and withdrawal benefits as described herein.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

9.    CERTAIN NONTRADITIONAL LONG-DURATION CONTRACTS

(continued)

Account balances of
variable annuity contracts with guarantees were invested in separate account investment options as follows:

In addition to the
amounts invested in separate account investment options above, $3,823 million at December 31, 2007 and $4,312 million at December 31, 2006 of account balances of variable annuity contracts with guarantees, inclusive of contracts with MVA
features, were invested in general account investment options.

Liabilities For Guarantee Benefits

The
table below summarizes the changes in general account liabilities for guarantees on variable contracts. The liabilities for guaranteed minimum death benefits (“GMDB”) and guaranteed minimum income benefits (“GMIB”) are included
in “Future policy benefits” and the related changes in the liabilities are included in “Policyholders’ benefits.” Guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (“GMAB”), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits
(“GMWB”), and guaranteed minimum income and withdrawal benefits (“GMIWB”) features are considered to be bifurcated embedded derivatives under SFAS No. 133. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives, along with any fees
received or payments made relating to the derivative, are recorded in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” The liabilities for GMAB, GMWB and GMIWB are included in “Future policy benefits.” The Company maintains a portfolio
of derivative investments that serve as an economic hedge of the risks of these products, for which the changes in fair value are also recorded in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” This portfolio of derivatives investments does
not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

9.    CERTAIN NONTRADITIONAL LONG-DURATION CONTRACTS

(continued)

(1)

Incurred guarantee benefits include the portion of assessments established as additions to reserves as well as changes in estimates affecting the reserves. Also includes changes in
the fair value of features considered to be derivatives.

The GMDB liability is determined each period end by estimating the accumulated value of a portion of the total assessments to date less the accumulated value of the death benefits in excess of the account balance. The GMIB liability is
determined each period by estimating the accumulated value of a portion of the total assessments to date less the accumulated value of the projected income benefits in excess of the account balance. The portion of assessments used is chosen such
that, at issue (or, in the case of acquired contracts, at the acquisition date), the present value of expected death benefits or expected income benefits in excess of the projected account balance and the portion of the present value of total
expected assessments over the lifetime of the contracts are equal. The Company regularly evaluates the estimates used and adjusts the GMDB and GMIB liability balances, with an associated charge or credit to earnings, if actual experience or other
evidence suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised.

The GMAB features provide the contractholder with a guaranteed return of initial account value or an enhanced value if applicable. The most significant of the Company’s GMAB features are the guaranteed return option (“GRO”)
features, which includes an automatic investment rebalancing element that reduces the Company’s exposure to these guarantees as the rebalancing element moves investments from variable to fixed investment options when markets experience
significant or prolonged declines. If the markets subsequently recover, the rebalancing element will move investments from fixed to variable investment options. The GMAB liability is calculated as the present value of future expected payments to
customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature.

The GMWB features provide the contractholder with a guaranteed remaining balance if the account value is reduced to zero through a combination of market
declines and withdrawals. The guaranteed remaining balance is generally equal to the protected value under the contract, which is initially established as the greater of the account value or cumulative deposits when withdrawals commence, less
cumulative withdrawals. The contractholder also has the option, after a specified time period, to reset the guaranteed remaining balance to the then-current account value, if greater. The GMWB liability is calculated as the present value of future
expected payments to customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature.

The GMIWB features predominantly present a benefit that provides a contractholder two optional methods to receive guaranteed minimum payments over time, a
“withdrawal” option or an “income” option. The



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

9.    CERTAIN NONTRADITIONAL LONG-DURATION CONTRACTS

(continued)

withdrawal option guarantees that, upon the election of such benefit, a contract holder can withdraw an amount each year until the cumulative withdrawals
reach a total guaranteed balance. The guaranteed remaining balance is generally equal to the protected value under the contract, which is initially established as the greater of: (1) the account value on the date of first withdrawal;
(2) cumulative deposits when withdrawals commence, less cumulative withdrawals plus a minimum return; or (3) the highest contract value on a specified date minus any withdrawals. The income option guarantees that a contract holder can,
upon the election of this benefit, withdraw a lesser amount each year for the annuitant’s life based on the total guaranteed balance. The withdrawal or income benefit can be elected by the contract holder upon issuance of an appropriate
deferred variable annuity contract or at any time following contract issue prior to annuitization. Certain GMIWB features include an automatic investment rebalancing element that reduces the Company’s exposure to these guarantees as the
rebalancing element moves investments from variable to fixed investment options when markets experience significant or prolonged declines. If the markets subsequently recover, the rebalancing element will move investments from fixed to variable
investment options. The GMIWB liability is calculated as the present value of future expected payments to customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature.

Sales Inducements

The Company defers sales inducements and amortizes them over the anticipated
life of the policy using the same methodology and assumptions used to amortize deferred policy acquisition costs. These deferred sales inducements are included in “Other assets.” The Company offers various types of sales inducements. These
inducements include: (1) a bonus whereby the policyholder’s initial account balance is increased by an amount equal to a specified percentage of the customer’s initial deposit, (2) additional credits after a certain number of
years a contract is held and (3) enhanced interest crediting rates that are higher than the normal general account interest rate credited in certain product lines. Changes in deferred sales inducements are as follows:

10.    CLOSED
BLOCK

On the date of demutualization, Prudential
Insurance established a Closed Block for certain individual life insurance policies and annuities issued by Prudential Insurance in the U.S. The recorded assets and liabilities were allocated to the Closed Block at their historical carrying amounts.
The Closed Block forms the principal component of the Closed Block Business. For a discussion of the Closed Block Business see Note 20.

The policies included in the Closed Block are specified individual life insurance policies and individual annuity contracts that were in force on the
effective date of the Plan of Reorganization and for which Prudential



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

10.    CLOSED BLOCK

(continued)

Insurance is currently paying or expects to pay experience-based policy dividends. Assets have been allocated to the Closed Block in an amount that has been
determined to produce cash flows which, together with revenues from policies included in the Closed Block, are expected to be sufficient to support obligations and liabilities relating to these policies, including provision for payment of benefits,
certain expenses, and taxes and to provide for continuation of the policyholder dividend scales in effect in 2000, assuming experience underlying such scales continues. To the extent that, over time, cash flows from the assets allocated to the
Closed Block and claims and other experience related to the Closed Block are, in the aggregate, more or less favorable than what was assumed when the Closed Block was established, total dividends paid to Closed Block policyholders in the future may
be greater than or less than the total dividends that would have been paid to these policyholders if the policyholder dividend scales in effect in 2000 had been continued. Any cash flows in excess of amounts assumed will be available for
distribution over time to Closed Block policyholders and will not be available to stockholders. If the Closed Block has insufficient funds to make guaranteed policy benefit payments, such payments will be made from assets outside of the Closed
Block. The Closed Block will continue in effect as long as any policy in the Closed Block remains in force unless, with the consent of the New Jersey insurance regulator, it is terminated earlier.

The excess of Closed Block Liabilities over Closed Block Assets at the date
of the demutualization (adjusted to eliminate the impact of related amounts in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)”) represented the estimated maximum future earnings at that date from the Closed Block expected to result from
operations attributed to the Closed Block after income taxes. In establishing the Closed Block, the Company developed an actuarial calculation of the timing of such maximum future earnings. If actual cumulative earnings of the Closed Block from
inception through the end of any given period are greater than the expected cumulative earnings, only the expected earnings will be recognized in income. Any excess of actual cumulative earnings over expected cumulative earnings will represent
undistributed accumulated earnings attributable to policyholders, which are recorded as a policyholder dividend obligation. The policyholder dividend obligation represents amounts to be paid to Closed Block policyholders as an additional
policyholder dividend unless otherwise offset by future Closed Block performance that is less favorable than originally expected. If the actual cumulative earnings of the Closed Block from its inception through the end of any given period are less
than the expected cumulative earnings of the Closed Block, the Company will recognize only the actual earnings in income. However, the Company may reduce policyholder dividend scales in the future, which would be intended to increase future actual
earnings until the actual cumulative earnings equaled the expected cumulative earnings. The Company recognized a policyholder dividend obligation of $732 million and $483 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, to Closed Block
policyholders for the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected cumulative earnings. Additionally, net unrealized investment gains that have arisen subsequent to the establishment of the Closed Block were reflected as a policyholder
dividend obligation of $1.047 billion and $1.865 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, to be paid to Closed Block policyholders unless otherwise offset by future experience, with an offsetting amount reported in “Accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss).” See the table below for changes in the components of the policyholder dividend obligation for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.

On December 11, 2007, Prudential Insurance’s Board of Directors acted to increase the dividends payable in 2008 on
Closed Block policies. This increase reflects improved mortality as well as recent investment gains. These actions resulted in an $89 million increase in the liability for policyholder dividends recognized in the year ended December 31, 2007.

Company participates in reinsurance in order to provide additional capacity for future growth, to limit the maximum net loss potential arising from large risks and in acquiring or disposing of businesses. On June 1, 2006, the Company acquired
the variable annuity business of Allstate through a reinsurance transaction. The reinsurance arrangements with Allstate include a coinsurance arrangement and a modified coinsurance arrangement which are more fully described in Note 3. The
acquisition of the retirement business of CIGNA on April 1, 2004, required the Company, through a wholly owned subsidiary, to enter into certain reinsurance arrangements with CIGNA to effect the transfer of the retirement business included in
the transaction. These reinsurance arrangements are more fully described in Note 3. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company sold its property and casualty insurance companies that operated nationally in 48 states outside of New Jersey, and
the District of Columbia, to Liberty Mutual. In connection with that sale, the Company reinsured Liberty Mutual for certain losses which will be settled based upon loss experience through December 31, 2008 and are more fully described in Note
21.

Life and disability reinsurance is accomplished through
various plans of reinsurance, primarily yearly renewable term, per person excess and coinsurance. In addition, the Company has reinsured with unaffiliated third parties, 73% of the Closed Block through various modified coinsurance arrangements. The
Company accounts for these modified coinsurance arrangements under the deposit method of accounting. Reinsurance ceded arrangements do not discharge the Company as the primary insurer. Ceded balances would represent a liability of the Company in the
event the reinsurers were unable to meet their obligations to the Company under the terms of the reinsurance agreements. Reinsurance premiums, commissions, expense reimbursements, benefits and reserves related to reinsured long-duration contracts
are accounted for over the life of the underlying

reinsured contracts using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the underlying contracts. The cost of reinsurance related to short-duration
contracts is accounted for over the reinsurance contract period. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers, for both short-and long-duration reinsurance arrangements, are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liabilities and policy benefits
associated with the reinsured policies.

The tables presented
below exclude amounts pertaining to the Company’s discontinued operations.

Reinsurance amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, were as follows:

Reinsurance
recoverables at December 31, are as follows:

(1)

Primarily represents reinsurance recoverables established under the reinsurance arrangements associated with the acquisition of the retirement business of CIGNA. The Company has
recorded related reinsurance payables of $1,377 million and $1,282 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Excluding the reinsurance recoverable associated with the acquisition of the retirement business of CIGNA, three major reinsurance companies account for
approximately 53% of the reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2007. The Company periodically reviews the financial condition of its reinsurers and amounts recoverable therefrom in order to minimize its exposure to loss from reinsurer
insolvencies, recording an allowance when necessary for uncollectible reinsurance.

12.    SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT

Short-term Debt

Short-term debt at
December 31, is as follows:



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

12.    SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT

(continued)

The weighted average interest rate on outstanding short-term debt, excluding the current portion of
long-term debt and convertible debt, was approximately 4.6% and 5.3% at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

At December 31, 2007, the Company had $5,075 million in committed lines of credit from numerous financial institutions, substantially all of which
were unused. These lines of credit generally have terms ranging from one to five years. The Company also has access to uncommitted lines of credit from banks and other financial institutions.

The Company issues commercial paper primarily to manage operating cash flows
and existing commitments, to meet working capital needs and to take advantage of current investment opportunities. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, a portion of commercial paper borrowings were supported by $5,000 million and $4,000 million of
the Company’s existing lines of credit, respectively. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the weighted average maturity of commercial paper outstanding was 28 and 18 days, respectively.

On November 16, 2005, Prudential Financial issued in a private placement
$2.0 billion of floating rate convertible senior notes, that were convertible by the holders at any time after issuance into cash and shares of Prudential Financial’s Common Stock. On April 13, 2007, Prudential Financial announced its
intention to call all such outstanding floating rate convertible senior notes for redemption on May 21, 2007. Prior to the redemption by the Company, substantially all holders elected to convert their senior notes as provided under their terms.
The senior notes required net settlement in shares; therefore, upon conversion, the holders received cash equal to the par amount of the senior notes surrendered for conversion plus accrued interest and shares of Prudential Financial Common Stock
for the portion of the settlement amount in excess of the par amount. The settlement amount in excess of the par amount was based upon the excess of the closing market price of Prudential Financial Common Stock for a 10-day period defined under the
terms of the senior notes, or $100.80 per share, over the initial conversion price of $90 per share. Accordingly, at conversion the Company issued 2,367,887 shares of Common Stock from treasury. The conversion had no impact on the Company’s
results of operations and resulted in a net increase to shareholders’ equity of $44 million, reflecting the tax benefit associated with the conversion of the senior notes. The interest rate on these notes was a floating rate equal to 3-month
LIBOR minus 2.76%, reset quarterly, and ranged from 2.60% to 2.61% in 2007 and from 1.57% to 2.65% in 2006.

On December 7, 2006, Prudential Financial issued in a private placement $2.0 billion of floating rate convertible senior notes that are convertible
by the holders at any time after issuance into cash and shares of Prudential Financial’s Common Stock. The conversion price, $104.21 per share, is subject to adjustment upon certain corporate events. The conversion feature requires net
settlement in shares; therefore, upon conversion, a holder would receive cash equal to the par amount of the convertible notes surrendered for conversion and shares of Prudential Financial Common Stock only for the portion of the settlement amount
in excess of the par amount, if any. The interest rate on these notes is a floating rate equal to 3-month LIBOR minus 2.40%, reset quarterly, and ranged from 2.73% to 3.30% in 2007 and was 2.95% in 2006. These notes are redeemable by Prudential
Financial, at par plus accrued interest, on or after December 13, 2007. Holders of the notes may also require Prudential Financial to repurchase the notes, at par plus accrued interest, on contractually specified dates, of which the first such
date was December 12, 2007. On December 12, 2007, $117 million of senior notes were repurchased by Prudential Financial at the request of the holders. The next date on which holders of the notes may require Prudential Financial to
repurchase the notes is December 12, 2008.

On
December 12, 2007, Prudential Financial issued in a private placement $3.0 billion of floating rate convertible senior notes that are convertible by the holders at any time after issuance into cash and shares of Prudential Financial’s
Common Stock. The conversion price, $132.39 per share, is subject to adjustment upon certain corporate events. The conversion feature requires net settlement in shares; therefore, upon conversion, a holder would receive cash equal to the par amount
of the convertible notes surrendered for conversion and shares of Prudential Financial Common Stock only for the portion of the settlement amount in excess of the par amount,

(continued)

if any. The interest rate on these notes is a floating rate equal to 3-month LIBOR minus 1.63%, reset quarterly, and was 3.52% in 2007. These notes are
redeemable by Prudential Financial, at par plus accrued interest, on or after June 16, 2009. Holders of the notes may also require Prudential Financial to repurchase the notes, at par plus accrued interest, on contractually specified dates, of
which the first such date is June 15, 2009.

Prudential
Financial has agreed to file quarterly prospectus supplements to register with the SEC under the Company’s shelf registration statement resales of the convertible senior notes and the shares of restricted Prudential Financial Common Stock
issued to certain holders of the convertible senior notes upon conversion. In the event the Company is unable to complete or maintain the effectiveness of this registration, the Company could be required to pay liquidated damages of 0.25% applied to
the par amount of the notes for each interest period such default continues under the registration rights agreements entered into with the holders of the notes. The Company has no liability accrued as of December 31, 2007 related to these
agreements, as it believes the likelihood of default under the registration rights agreements are remote.

Long-term Debt

Long-term debt at December 31, is as follows:

(1)

Annual scheduled repayments of principal for the Series A and Series C notes begin in 2013. Annual scheduled repayments of principal for the Series B notes begin in 2018.

(2)

The interest rate on the Series A notes is a floating rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.875% per year. The interest rate ranged from 5.8% to 6.5% in 2007 and 5.4% to 6.3% in 2006.

(3)

The interest rate on the floating rate Surplus notes ranged from 5.4% to 5.9% in 2007 and was 5.6% in 2006.

(4)

The interest rates on the other floating rate notes are based on LIBOR and the U.S. Consumer Price Index. Interest rates ranged from 2.7% to 7.5% in 2007 and 2.7% to 6.7% in 2006.

(5)

Assets under set-off arrangements represent a reduction in the amount of fixed rate notes included in long-term debt, relating to an arrangement where valid rights of set-off exist
and it is the intent of both parties to settle on a net basis under legally enforceable arrangements.

Several long-term debt agreements have restrictive covenants related to the total amount of debt, net tangible assets and other matters. At
December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

12.    SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT

(continued)

The fixed rate surplus notes issued by Prudential Insurance are subordinated to other Prudential
Insurance borrowings and policyholder obligations, and the payment of interest and principal may only be made with the prior approval of the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance of the State of New Jersey (the “Commissioner”). The
Commissioner could prohibit the payment of the interest and principal on the surplus notes if certain statutory capital requirements are not met. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company met these statutory capital requirements. At
December 31, 2007 and 2006, $444 million and $693 million, respectively, of fixed rate surplus notes were outstanding, of which $250 million is reflected as short-term debt at December 31, 2006.

During 2006, a subsidiary of Prudential Insurance entered into a surplus note
purchase agreement that provides for the issuance of up to $3 billion of ten-year floating rate surplus notes. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, $1,100 million and $600 million, respectively, were outstanding under this agreement. Concurrent
with the issuance of each surplus note, Prudential Financial enters into arrangements with the buyer, which are accounted for as derivative instruments, that may result in payments by, or to, Prudential Financial over the term of the surplus notes,
to the extent there are significant changes in the value of the surplus notes. Surplus notes issued under this facility are subordinated to policyholder obligations, and the payment of interest and principal on them may only be made by the issuer
with the prior approval of the Arizona Department of Insurance. The derivative instruments discussed above also provide that in the event approval is not obtained to make interest or principal payments, the holder of the surplus notes may have the
right to sell the surplus notes to Prudential Financial. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, these derivative instruments had no material value.

During 2007, a subsidiary of Prudential Insurance issued $500 million of 45-year floating rate surplus notes. Surplus notes issued under this facility are
subordinated to policyholder obligations, and the payment of interest and principal on them may only be made by the issuer with the prior approval of the Arizona Department of Insurance. Concurrent with the issuance of these surplus notes,
Prudential Financial entered into a credit derivative with an affiliate of one of the purchasers that will require Prudential Financial to make certain payments in the event of deterioration in the credit quality of the surplus notes. As of
December 31, 2007, the credit derivative had no material value.

In order to modify exposure to interest rate and currency exchange rate movements, the Company utilizes derivative instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt issues. The impact of these derivative
instruments are not reflected in the rates presented in the tables above. For those derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment, interest expense was decreased by $26 million and $4 million for the years ended
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. See Note 19 for additional information on the Company’s use of derivative instruments.

Interest expense for short-term and long-term debt was $1,429 million, $1,161 million and $775 million, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively. This includes interest expense of $204 million, $150 million and $75 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, reported in “Net investment income.”

Included in “Policyholders’ account balances” are additional
debt obligations of the Company. See Note 8 for further discussion.

Prudential Holdings, LLC Notes

On the
date of demutualization, Prudential Holdings, LLC (“PHLLC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial, issued $1.75 billion in senior secured notes (the “IHC debt”). PHLLC owns the capital stock of Prudential Insurance
and does not have any operating businesses of its own. The IHC debt represents senior secured obligations of PHLLC with limited recourse; neither Prudential Financial, Prudential Insurance nor any other affiliate of PHLLC is an obligor or guarantor
on the IHC debt. The IHC debt is collateralized by



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

12.    SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT

(continued)

13.8% of the outstanding common stock of Prudential Insurance and other items specified in the indenture, primarily the “Debt Service Coverage
Account” (the “DSCA”) discussed below.

PHLLC’s ability to meet its obligations under the IHC debt is dependent principally upon sufficient available funds being generated by the Closed Block Business and the ability of Prudential Insurance, the sole direct subsidiary of
PHLLC, to dividend such funds to PHLLC. The payment of scheduled principal and interest on the Series A notes and the Series B notes is insured by a financial guarantee insurance policy. The payment of principal and interest on the Series C notes is
not insured. The IHC debt is redeemable prior to its stated maturity at the option of PHLLC and, in the event of certain circumstances, the IHC debt bond insurer can require PHLLC to redeem the IHC debt.

Net proceeds from the IHC debt amounted to $1,727 million. The majority of
the net proceeds, or $1,218 million, was distributed to Prudential Financial through a dividend on the date of demutualization for use in the Financial Services Businesses. In addition, $72 million was used to purchase a guaranteed investment
contract to fund a portion of the financial guarantee insurance premium related to the IHC debt. The remainder of the net proceeds were deposited to a restricted account within PHLLC. This restricted account, referred to as the DSCA, constitutes
additional collateral for the IHC debt and as of December 31, 2007 had a balance of $1,006 million.

Summarized consolidated financial data for Prudential Holdings, LLC is presented below.

Prudential Financial
is a holding company and is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. The rights of Prudential Financial to participate in any distribution of assets of any subsidiary, including upon its liquidation or reorganization, are subject
to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary, except to the extent that Prudential Financial may itself be a creditor of that subsidiary and its claims are recognized. PHLLC and its subsidiaries have entered into covenants and arrangements
with third parties in connection with the issuance of the IHC debt which are intended to confirm their separate, “bankruptcy-remote” status, by assuring that the assets of PHLLC and its subsidiaries are not available to creditors of
Prudential Financial or its other subsidiaries,

(continued)

except and to the extent that Prudential Financial and its other subsidiaries are, as shareholders or creditors of PHLLC and its subsidiaries, or would be,
entitled to those assets.

At December 31, 2007, the
Company was in compliance with all IHC debt covenants.

13.    STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

The Company has outstanding two classes of common stock: the Common Stock and the Class B Stock. The changes in the number of shares issued, held in treasury and outstanding are as follows for the periods indicated:

(1)

Represents net shares issued from treasury pursuant to the Company’s stock-based compensation program as discussed in Note 15.

(2)

Represents shares issued in conjunction with the conversion of the November 2005 convertible senior notes, as discussed in Note 12.

Common Stock and Class B Stock

On the date of demutualization, Prudential Financial completed an initial
public offering of its Common Stock at an initial public offering price of $27.50 per share. The shares of Common Stock issued were in addition to shares of Common Stock the Company distributed to policyholders as part of the demutualization. The
Common Stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “PRU.” Also on the date of demutualization, Prudential Financial completed the sale, through a private placement, of 2.0 million shares of Class B Stock at a price
of $87.50 per share. The Class B Stock is a separate class of common stock which is not publicly traded. The Common Stock reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Class B Stock reflects the performance of the Closed
Block Business.

Holders of Common Stock have no interest in a
separate legal entity representing the Financial Services Businesses and holders of the Class B Stock have no interest in a separate legal entity representing the Closed Block Business and holders of each class of common stock are subject to all of
the risks associated with an investment in the Company.

In the
event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, holders of Common Stock and holders of Class B Stock would be entitled to receive a proportionate share of the net assets of the Company that remain after paying all liabilities and
the liquidation preferences of any preferred stock.

Common Stock Held in Treasury

Common Stock held in treasury is accounted for at average cost. Gains resulting from the reissuance of “Common Stock
held in treasury” are credited to “Additional paid-in capital.” Losses resulting from the reissuance of “Common Stock held in treasury” are charged first to “Additional paid-in capital” to the extent the Company
has previously recorded gains on treasury share transactions, then to “Retained earnings.”

In November 2004, Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of its outstanding Common Stock
in calendar year 2005. In June 2005, Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors authorized an increase in the annual rate of share repurchases from $1.5 billion to $2.1 billion for calendar year 2005. During 2005, the Company acquired
32.4 million shares of its outstanding Common Stock at a total cost of $2.1 billion.

In November 2005, Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $2.5 billion of its outstanding Common Stock in calendar year 2006. During 2006, the Company acquired
32.4 million shares of its outstanding Common Stock at a total cost of $2.5 billion.

In November 2006, Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $3.0 billion of its outstanding Common Stock in calendar year 2007. During 2007, the Company acquired
32.0 million shares of its outstanding Common Stock at a total cost of $3.0 billion.

In November 2007, Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $3.5 billion of its outstanding Common Stock in calendar year 2008. The timing and amount of any repurchases
under this authorization will be determined by management based upon market conditions and other considerations, and the repurchases may be effected in the open market, through derivative, accelerated repurchase and other negotiated transactions and
through prearranged trading plans complying with Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Exchange Act. The 2008 stock repurchase program supersedes all previous repurchase programs.

Stock Conversion Rights of the Class B Stock

Prudential Financial may, at its option, at any time, exchange all outstanding shares of Class B Stock into such number of shares of Common
Stock as have an aggregate average market value equal to 120% of the appraised fair market value of the outstanding shares of Class B Stock.

Holders of Class B Stock will be permitted to convert their shares of Class B Stock into such number of shares of Common Stock as have an aggregate
average market value equal to 100% of the appraised fair market value of the outstanding shares of Class B Stock (1) in the holder’s sole discretion, in the year 2016 or at any time thereafter, and (2) at any time in the event that
(a) the Class B Stock will no longer be treated as equity of Prudential Financial for federal income tax purposes or (b) the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance amends, alters, changes or modifies the regulation of the Closed
Block, the Closed Block Business, the Class B Stock or the IHC debt in a manner that materially adversely affects the “CB Distributable Cash Flow”; provided, however, that in no event may a holder of Class B Stock convert shares of Class B
Stock to the extent such holder immediately upon such conversion, together with its affiliates, would be the beneficial owner (as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of in excess of 9.9% of the total outstanding voting power of
Prudential Financial’s voting securities. In the event a holder of shares of Class B Stock requests to convert shares pursuant to clause (2)(a) in the preceding sentence, Prudential Financial may elect, instead of effecting such
conversion, to increase the Target Dividend Amount to $12.6875 per share per annum retroactively from the time of issuance of the Class B Stock.

Dividends

The principal sources of funds available to Prudential Financial, the parent holding company, to meet its obligations, including the payment of
shareholder dividends, debt service, operating expenses, capital contributions and obligations to subsidiaries are dividends, returns of capital, interest income from its subsidiaries and cash and short-term investments. The regulated insurance and
various other subsidiaries are subject to regulatory limitations on their payment of dividends and other transfers of funds to Prudential Financial. Pursuant to Gibraltar Life’s reorganization, in addition to regulatory restrictions, there are
certain restrictions that preclude Gibraltar Life from paying dividends to Prudential Financial in the near term.

New Jersey insurance law provides that dividends or distributions may be declared or paid by Prudential Insurance without prior regulatory approval only
from unassigned surplus, as determined pursuant to statutory accounting principles, less unrealized investment gains and losses and revaluation of assets. Unassigned surplus of Prudential Insurance was $5,021 million at December 31, 2007. There
were applicable adjustments for unrealized gains of $1,582 million at December 31, 2007. In addition, Prudential Insurance must obtain non-disapproval from the New Jersey insurance regulator before paying a dividend or distribution if the
dividend or distribution, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, would exceed the greater of 10% of Prudential Insurance’s surplus as of the preceding December 31 ($6,981 million as of
December 31, 2007) or its statutory net gain from operations for the twelve month period ending on the preceding December 31, excluding realized investment gains and losses ($1,024 million for the year ended December 31, 2007).

The laws regulating dividends of Prudential Financial’s
other insurance subsidiaries domiciled in other states are similar, but not identical, to New Jersey’s. The laws of foreign countries may also limit the ability of the Company’s insurance and other subsidiaries organized in those countries
to pay dividends to Prudential Financial.

The declaration and
payment of dividends on the Common Stock depends primarily upon the financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors relating to the Financial Services Businesses. Furthermore, dividends on the Common
Stock are limited to both the amount that is legally available for payment under New Jersey corporate law if the Financial Services Businesses were treated as a separate corporation thereunder and the amount that is legally available for payment
under New Jersey corporate law on a consolidated basis after taking into account dividends on the Class B Stock.

The declaration and payment of dividends on the Class B Stock depends upon the financial performance of the Closed Block Business and, as the Closed Block
matures, the holders of the Class B Stock will receive the surplus of the Closed Block Business no longer required to support the Closed Block for regulatory purposes. Dividends on the Class B Stock are payable in an aggregate amount per year at
least equal to the lesser of (1) a Target Dividend Amount of $19.25 million or (2) the CB Distributable Cash Flow for such year, which is a measure of the net cash flows of the Closed Block Business. Notwithstanding this formula, as with
any common stock, Prudential Financial retains the flexibility to suspend dividends on the Class B Stock; however, if CB Distributable Cash Flow exists and Prudential Financial chooses not to pay dividends on the Class B Stock in an aggregate amount
at least equal to the lesser of the CB Distributable Cash Flow or the Target Dividend Amount for any period, then cash dividends cannot be paid on the Common Stock with respect to such period.

Preferred Stock

Prudential Financial adopted a shareholder rights plan (the “rights plan”) under which each outstanding share of
Common Stock is coupled with a shareholder right. The rights plan is not applicable to any Class B Stock. Each right initially entitles the holder to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of a series of Prudential



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

13.    STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

(continued)

Financial preferred stock upon payment of the exercise price. At the time of the demutualization, the Board of Directors of Prudential Financial determined
that the initial exercise price per right is $110, subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in the rights plan. There was no preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Comprehensive Income

The components of comprehensive income for the years ended December 31,
are as follows:

(1)

Includes cash flow hedges. See Note 19 for information on cash flow hedges.

The balance of and changes in each component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” for the years ended December 31, are as
follows (net of taxes):

Includes cash flow hedges. See Note 19 for information on cash flow hedges.

See Note 16 for additional information on the adoption of SFAS No. 158.

Statutory Net Income and Surplus

Prudential Financial’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries are required to prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting
practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the state



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

13.    STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

(continued)

of domicile. Statutory accounting practices primarily differ from U.S. GAAP by charging policy acquisition costs to expense as incurred, establishing future
policy benefit liabilities using different actuarial assumptions as well as valuing investments and certain assets and accounting for deferred taxes on a different basis. Statutory net income of Prudential Insurance amounted to $1,274 million, $444
million and $2,170 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Statutory capital and surplus of Prudential Insurance amounted to $6,981 million and $5,973 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

14.    EARNINGS PER SHARE

The Company has outstanding two separate classes of common stock. The Common
Stock reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Class B Stock reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business. Accordingly, earnings per share is calculated separately for each of these two classes of common stock.

Net income for the Financial Services Businesses and the
Closed Block Business is determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes general and administrative expenses charged to each of the respective businesses based on the Company’s methodology for the allocation of such expenses. Cash flows
between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business related to administrative expenses are determined by a policy servicing fee arrangement that is based upon insurance and policies in force and statutory cash premiums. To the
extent reported administrative expenses vary from these cash flow amounts, the differences are recorded, on an after tax basis, as direct equity adjustments to the equity balances of the businesses.

The direct equity adjustments modify the earnings available to each of the
classes of common stock for earnings per share purposes.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

(continued)

Common Stock

A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted per share computations is as follows:

For the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, 1.6 million, 2.1 million and 1.8 million options, respectively, weighted for the portion of the period they were outstanding, with a weighted average exercise price of $91.60, $76.11 and $56.02
per share, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options, based on application of the treasury stock method, were antidilutive.

The Company’s convertible senior notes provide for the Company to issue shares of its Common Stock as a component of
the conversion of the notes. The $2.0 billion November 2005 issuance was called for redemption in May 2007, and prior to redemption by the Company substantially all holders elected to convert their senior notes as provided for under their terms,
which resulted in the issuance of 2,367,887 shares of Common Stock from treasury. Those notes were dilutive to earnings per share in 2007 by 0.2 million shares, weighted for the period prior to the conversion date, as the average market price
of the Common Stock was above $90.00, the initial conversion price. The $2.0 billion December 2006 issuance will be dilutive to earnings per share if the average market price of the Common Stock for a particular period is above the initial
conversion price of $104.21. The $3.0 billion December 2007 issuance will be dilutive to earnings per share if the average market price of the Common Stock for a particular period is above the initial conversion price of $132.39. See Note 12 for
additional information regarding the convertible senior notes.

Class B Stock

Income from continuing operations per share of Class B Stock was $68.50, $108.00 and $119.50 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

The income from continuing operations
attributable to the Closed Block Business available to holders of Class B Stock after direct equity adjustment for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 amounted to $137 million, $216 million and $239 million, respectively. The
direct equity adjustment resulted in a decrease in the income from continuing operations attributable to the Closed Block Business applicable to holders of Class B Stock for earnings per share purposes of $53 million, $68 million and $82 million for
the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the weighted average number of shares of Class B Stock used in the calculation of basic earnings per share amounted to

Omnibus Incentive Plan

In March 2003,
the Company’s Board of Directors adopted the Prudential Financial, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (as subsequently amended and restated, the “Omnibus Plan”). Upon adoption of the Omnibus Plan, the Prudential Financial, Inc. Stock Option
Plan previously adopted by the Company on January 9, 2001 (the “Option Plan”) was merged into the Omnibus Plan. The nature of stock based awards provided under the Omnibus Plan are stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted
stock shares, restricted stock units, and equity-based performance awards (“performance shares”). Dividend equivalents are provided on restricted stock shares, restricted stock units and performance shares. Generally, the requisite service
period is the vesting period.

As of December 31, 2007,
44,081,293 authorized shares remain available for grant under the Omnibus Plan including previously authorized but unissued shares under the Option Plan.

Compensation Costs

Compensation cost for employee stock options is based on the fair values estimated on the grant date, while compensation cost for non-employee stock
options is re-estimated at each period-end through the vesting date, using the approach and assumptions described below. Compensation cost for restricted stock shares, restricted stock units and performance shares granted to employees is measured by
the share price of the underlying Common Stock at the date of grant. Compensation cost for restricted stock shares and restricted stock units granted to non-employees is measured by the share price as of the balance sheet date for unvested shares
and the share price at the vesting date for vested shares.

The
fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant for stock options issued to employees and the balance sheet date or vesting date for stock options issued to non-employees. The weighted average assumptions used in a binomial
option valuation model are as follows:



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

(continued)

Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from traded options on the Company’s
Common Stock, historical volatility of the Company’s Common Stock and other factors. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted is
derived from the output of the valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in
effect at the time of grant.

The following chart summarizes
the compensation cost recognized and the related income tax benefit for stock options, restricted stock shares, restricted stock units, and performance share awards for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005:

Compensation costs for
all stock based compensation plans capitalized in deferred acquisition costs for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 amounted to $2 million and $3 million, respectively. Total compensation costs capitalized in deferred acquisition costs
for the year ended December 31, 2005 was de minimis.

Stock Options

Each stock option granted has
an exercise price no less than the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant and has a maximum term of 10 years. Generally, one third of the option grant vests in each of the first three years. Participants are
employees and non-employees (i.e., statutory agents who perform services for the Company and participating subsidiaries).

The weighted average
grant date fair value of employee stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $20.55, $17.85, and $12.94, respectively.

The total intrinsic value (

i.e.,

market price of the stock less the option exercise price) of employee stock options
exercised during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $224 million, $201 million and $156 million, respectively.

The weighted average fair value of non-employee options not vested at the balance sheet date, and non-employee options vesting during the years ended

Restricted Stock
Shares, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Share Awards

A restricted stock share represents a grant of Common Stock to employee and non-employee participants that is subject to certain transfer restrictions and forfeiture provisions for a specified period of time. A restricted stock unit is an
unfunded, unsecured right to receive a share of Common Stock at the end of a specified period of time, which is also subject to forfeiture and transfer restrictions. Generally, the restrictions on restricted stock shares and restricted stock units
will lapse on the third anniversary of the date of grant. Restricted stock shares subject to the transfer restrictions and forfeiture provisions are considered nonvested shares and are not reflected as outstanding shares until the restrictions
expire. Performance share awards are awards of units denominated in Common Stock. The number of units is determined over the performance period, and may be adjusted based on the satisfaction of certain performance goals. Performance share awards are
payable in Common Stock.

A summary of the Company’s
employee restricted stock shares, restricted stock units and performance shares is as follows:

A summary of the Company’s non-employee restricted stock shares and restricted stock units is as follows:

The fair value of
non-employee share awards released for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $1 million and $1 million, respectively. There were no non-employee awards released during the year ended December 31, 2005.

Unrecognized Compensation Cost

Unrecognized compensation cost for employee stock options as of
December 31, 2007 was $28 million with a weighted average recognition period of 1.63 years. Unrecognized compensation cost for employee restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, and performance share awards as of December 31, 2007

The tax benefit realized upon vesting of restricted stock shares, restricted stock units, and
performance shares for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $61 million, $52 million and $4 million, respectively.

Stock Purchase Plan

At the Annual Meeting of the Shareholders of the Company held on June 7, 2005, the shareholders approved the Prudential Financial, Inc. Employee
Stock Purchase Plan. The plan is a qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan under Section 423 of the Code. Under the plan, eligible participants may purchase shares based upon quarterly offering periods at an amount equal to the lesser of
(1) 85% of the closing market price of the Common Stock on the first day of the quarterly offering period, or (2) 85% of the closing market price of the Common Stock on the last day of the quarterly offering period. Participant
contributions will be limited to the lower of 10% of eligible earnings or $25,000. Share purchases under the plan began in 2007, and therefore, no shares of common stock were issued under the plan and no compensation cost was recorded in 2006 or
2005. Participants are employees and non-employees (i.e., statutory agents who perform services for the Company and participating subsidiaries).

Compensation cost for employees is recognized for each three-month period and is based on the grant date fair value of the discount received under the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan. This fair value is estimated using the 15% discount off of the grant date share price, plus the value of three month call and put options on shares at the grant date share price, less the value of forgone interest.
Compensation costs recognized for employees under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $9 million. The weighted average grant date fair value for employee shares recognized in compensation
cost for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $17.67.

Compensation cost for non-employees is recognized for each three-month period and is based on the fair value of shares at the purchase date less the price the participant pays for the shares. Compensation costs recognized for non-employees
under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $2 million. The weighted average fair value for non-employee shares recognized in compensation cost for the year ended December 31, 2007 was
$16.74.

Tax benefits are only recorded in the event of a
disqualifying disposition under SFAS No. 123R. For the year ended December 31, 2007, tax benefits realized upon disqualifying dispositions for both employees and non-employees were de minimis.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, 477,400 shares were purchased
under the plan related to the first three quarterly offering periods. Shares related to the October 1 to December 31, 2007 offering period will be purchased in January 2008. As of December 31, 2007, 25,889,835 authorized shares remain
available for future issuance under the plan.

Settlement of Awards

The Company’s policy is to issue shares from
Common Stock held in treasury upon exercise of employee and non-employee stock options, the release of restricted stock shares, restricted stock units, and performance shares, as well as for purchases under the stock purchase plan.

As of December 31, 2007, the Company has not settled any equity
instruments granted under share-based payment arrangements in cash.

Deferred Compensation Program

Prior to the contribution of the Company’s retail securities brokerage and clearing operations into the joint venture
with Wachovia on July 1, 2003, the Company maintained a deferred compensation program for Financial Advisors and certain other employees (the “participants”) of the contributed operations, under which participants elected to defer a
portion of their compensation. In 2002, participants were permitted to elect to redeem all or a portion of their existing nonvested account balances and invest the proceeds in Prudential Financial Common Stock. As of July 1, 2003, deferred
compensation expense of $14 million, which is being amortized over the vesting period of three to eight years, was included in the net assets of the Company’s retail securities brokerage and clearing operations contributed to the joint venture
with that of Wachovia. The results of operations of the joint venture, of which the Company owned a 38% interest as of December 31, 2007, include the amortization of the deferred compensation expense. As of December 31, 2007, there were
57,767 nonvested shares in participants’ accounts. Nonvested balances are forfeited if the participant is terminated for cause or voluntarily terminates prior to the vesting date. The Company continues to repurchase forfeited shares from the
joint venture, which are reflected as Common Stock held in treasury as of the date of forfeiture.

16.    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

The Company has funded and non-funded contributory and non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, which cover substantially all of its employees. For some employees, benefits are based on final average earnings
and length of service, while benefits for other employees are based on an account balance that takes into consideration age, service and earnings during their career.

The Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for its retired employees, their beneficiaries and
covered dependents (“other postretirement benefits”). The health care plan is contributory; the life insurance plan is non-contributory. Substantially all of the Company’s U.S. employees may become eligible to receive other
postretirement benefits if they retire after age 55 with at least 10 years of service or under certain circumstances after age 50 with at least 20 years of continuous service. The Company has elected to amortize its transition obligation for
other postretirement benefits over 20 years.

As discussed
in Note 2, in September 2006 the FASB issued SFAS No. 158. This statement requires an employer on a prospective basis to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as an asset or
liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. The Company adopted this requirement, along with the required disclosures, on
December 31, 2006. See below for the effects of the adoption as well as the related disclosure requirements.

On April 30, 2007, the Company transferred $1 billion of assets within the qualified pension plan under Section 420 of the Internal Revenue Code
from assets supporting pension benefits to assets supporting retiree medical benefits. The transfer resulted in a reduction to the prepaid benefit cost for the qualified pension plan and an offsetting decrease in the accrued benefit liability for
the postretirement plan with no net effect on stockholders’ equity on the Company’s consolidated financial position. The transfer had no impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, but will reduce the future cash
contributions required to be made to the postretirement plan.

In addition to the plan assets above, the Company in 2007 established an irrevocable trust, commonly
referred to as a “rabbi trust,” for the purpose of holding assets of the Company to be used to satisfy its obligations with respect to certain non-qualified retirement plans ($686 million benefit obligation at December 31, 2007).
Assets held in the rabbi trust are available to the general creditors of the Company in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy. The Company may from time to time in its discretion make contributions to the trust to fund accrued benefits payable to
participants in one or more of the plans, and, in the case of a change in control of the Company, as defined in the trust agreement, the Company will be required to make contributions to the plans to fund the accrued benefits, vested and unvested,
payable on a pretax basis to participants in the plans. The Company made a discretionary payment of $95 million to the trust during 2007. As of December 31, 2007, the assets in these trusts had a carrying value of $90 million and are included
in “Equity securities.”

The Company also maintains a
separate rabbi trust established at the time of the combination of its retail securities brokerage and clearing operations with those of Wachovia for the purpose of holding assets of the Company to be used to satisfy its obligations with respect to
certain non-qualified retirement plans ($77 million and $87 million benefit obligation at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively), as well as certain cash-based deferred compensation arrangements. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
assets in the trust had a carrying value of $139 million and $151 million, respectively, and are included in “Other long-term investments.”

Pension benefits for foreign plans comprised 11% and 10% of the ending benefit obligation for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Foreign pension plans comprised
2% and 2% of the ending fair value of plan assets for 2007 and 2006, respectively. There are no material foreign postretirement plans.

The projected benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets for the pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were
$1,627 million and $220 million, respectively, at September 30, 2007 and $1,563 and $205 million, respectively, at September 30, 2006.

The accumulated benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets for the pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were
$1,311 million and $17 million, respectively, at September 30, 2007 and $1,249 million and $7 million, respectively, at September 30, 2006.

In 2007 and 2006, the pension plan purchased annuity contracts from Prudential Insurance for $2 million and $4 million, respectively. The approximate
future annual benefit payment payable by Prudential Insurance for all annuity contracts was $26 million and $24 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The benefit obligation for pension benefits increased by $4 million in 2007 related to plan amendments, as a result of the
immediate vesting of plan participants due to the Section 420 transfer discussed above and benefits for prior service associated with foreign plans. The benefit obligation for pension benefits increased by $83 million in 2006 related to plan
amendments, due primarily to a cost of living adjustment for retirees as well as the impact of changes as a result of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The benefit obligation for other postretirement benefits decreased by $69 million in 2007
related to plan amendments, due primarily to changes in the prescription drug plan design. The benefit obligation for other postretirement benefits increased by $61 million in 2006 related to plan amendments, primarily a result of the impact of
implementing a Retiree Medical Savings Account, which provides an account at retirement that may be used toward the cost of coverage for medical and dental benefits.

Statement of Financial Position at December 31, 2006 was as follows:

Net periodic (benefit)
cost included in “General and administrative expenses” in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, includes the following components:

Certain employees were
provided special termination benefits under non-qualified plans in the form of unreduced early retirement benefits as a result of their involuntary termination.

The amounts recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income” as of the end of the period, which have not yet been recognized as a
component of net periodic (benefit) cost, and the related changes in these items during the period that are recognized in “Other Comprehensive Income” are as follows:



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

(continued)

The amounts included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income” expected to be recognized
as components of net periodic (benefit) cost in 2008 are as follows:

The assumptions as of
September 30, used by the Company to calculate the domestic benefit obligations as of that date and to determine the benefit cost in the year are as follows:

The domestic discount
rate used to value the pension and postretirement benefit obligations is based upon rates commensurate with current yields on high quality corporate bonds. The first step in determining the discount rate is the compilation of approximately 550 to
600 Aa-rated bonds across the full range of maturities. Since yields can vary widely at each maturity point, the Company generally avoids using the highest and lowest yielding bonds at the maturity points, so as to avoid relying on bonds that might
be mispriced or misrated. This refinement process generally results in having a distribution from the 10th to 90th percentile. A spot yield curve is developed from this data that is then used to determine the present value of the expected
disbursements associated with the pension and postretirement obligations, respectively. This results in the present value for each respective benefit obligation. A single discount rate is calculated that results in the same present value. The rate
is then rounded to the nearest 25 basis points.

The pension
and postretirement expected long-term rates of return on plan assets for 2007 were determined based upon an approach that considered an expectation of the allocation of plan assets during the measurement period of 2007. Expected returns are
estimated by asset class as noted in the discussion of investment policies and strategies below. The expected returns by asset class contemplate the risk free interest rate environment as of the measurement date and then add a risk premium. The risk
premium is a range of percentages and is based upon historical information and other factors such as expected reinvestment returns and asset manager performance.

The Company applied the same approach to the determination of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in 2008.
The expected long-term rate of return for 2008 is 7.75% and 8.00%, respectively, for the pension and postretirement plans.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

(continued)

The Company, with respect to pension benefits, uses market related value to determine the components
of net periodic benefit cost. Market related value is a measure of asset value that reflects the difference between actual and expected return on assets over a five-year period.

The assumptions for foreign pension plans are based on local markets. There are no material foreign postretirement plans.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect
on the amounts reported for the health care plan. A one-percentage point increase and decrease in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

Pension and
postretirement plan asset allocation as of September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, are as follows:

The Company, for its
domestic pension and postretirement plans, has developed guidelines for asset allocations. As of the September 30, 2007 measurement date the range of target percentages are as follows:

Management reviews its investment strategy on an annual basis.

The investment goal of the domestic pension plan assets is to generate an
above benchmark return on a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds and other investments, while meeting the cash requirements for a pension obligation that includes a traditional formula principally representing payments to annuitants and a cash
balance formula that allows lump sum payments and annuity payments. The pension plan risk management practices include guidelines for asset concentration, credit rating and liquidity. The pension plan does not invest in leveraged derivatives.
Derivatives such as futures contracts are used to reduce transaction costs and change asset concentration.

The investment goal of the domestic postretirement plan assets is to generate an above benchmark return on a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and
other investments, while meeting the cash requirements for the postretirement obligations that includes a medical benefit including prescription drugs, a dental benefit and a life benefit. Stocks are used to provide expected growth in assets. Bonds
provide liquidity and income. Short-term investments provide liquidity and allow for defensive asset mixes. The postretirement plans risk management practices include guidelines for asset concentration, credit rating, liquidity, and tax efficiency.
The postretirement plan does not invest in leveraged derivatives. Derivatives such as futures contracts are used to reduce transaction costs and change asset concentration.

There were no investments in Prudential Financial Common Stock as of September 30, 2007 or 2006 for either the pension
or postretirement plans. Pension plan assets of $7,185 million and $8,162 million are included in the Company’s separate account assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The expected benefit payments for the Company’s pension and
postretirement plans, as well as the expected Medicare Part D subsidy receipts related to the Company’s postretirement plan, for the years indicated are as follows:

The Company
anticipates that it will make cash contributions in 2008 of approximately $100 million to the pension plans and approximately $10 million to the postretirement plans.

Postemployment Benefits

The Company accrues postemployment benefits primarily for health and life benefits provided to former or inactive employees who are not retirees. The net
accumulated liability for these benefits at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $47 million and $44 million, respectively, and is included in “Other liabilities.”

PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

17.    INCOME TAXES

(continued)

Deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, resulted from the items listed in the
following table:

Management believes
that based on its historical pattern of taxable income, the Company will produce sufficient income in the future to realize its deferred tax assets after valuation allowance. A valuation allowance has been recorded primarily related to tax benefits
associated with foreign operations and state and local deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, includes $150 million and $168 million recorded in connection with Prudential Securities Group
Inc. state deferred tax assets and $215 million and $249 million recorded in connection with the acquisition of Hyundai Investment and Securities Co., Ltd. and its subsidiary. Adjustments to the valuation allowance will be made if there is a change
in management’s assessment of the amount of the deferred tax asset that is realizable.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, the Company had federal net operating and capital loss carryforwards of $725 million and $996 million, which expire between 2010 and 2023. At December 31, 2007
and 2006, respectively, the Company had state operating and capital loss carryforwards for tax purposes approximating $2,038 million and $1,986 million, which expire between 2008 and 2028. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, the
Company had foreign operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes approximating $835 million and $991 million, $804 million of which expires between 2008 and 2014 and $31 million of which have an unlimited carryforward.

The Company does not provide U.S. income taxes on unremitted foreign earnings
of its non-U.S. operations, other than its Japanese operations and certain German, Taiwan and United Kingdom investment management subsidiaries. During 2005, the Company determined that historical earnings of its Canadian operations were no longer
considered permanently reinvested and will be available for repatriation to the U.S. The U.S. income tax expense of $69 million associated with the repatriation of the Canadian operations’ earnings was recognized in 2005. During 2006, the
Company determined that the earnings from its Taiwan investment management subsidiary would be repatriated to the U.S. Accordingly, earnings from its Taiwan investment management subsidiary were no longer considered permanently reinvested. A U.S.
income tax benefit of $18 million associated with the assumed repatriation of those earnings was recognized in 2006. During 2007, the Company sold its investment in its German operating joint ventures Oppenheim Pramerica Fonds Trust GmbH and
Oppenheim Pramerica Asset Management S.a.r.l. Accordingly, the earnings were no longer considered reinvested and the Company recognized an income tax expense of $9 million related to those earnings. In addition, in 2007, the Company determined that
the earnings



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

17.    INCOME TAXES

(continued)

from certain of its United Kingdom investment management subsidiaries would be repatriated to the U.S. Accordingly, earnings from those United Kingdom
investment management subsidiaries were no longer considered permanently reinvested. A U.S. income tax benefit of $23 million associated with the assumed repatriation of those earnings was recognized in discontinued operations in 2007. The Company
had undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, where it assumes permanent reinvestment, of $1,516 million at December 2007, $1,252 million at December 31, 2006 and $1,018 at December 31, 2005, for which deferred taxes have not been
provided. Determining the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were remitted is not practicable.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act ("the AJCA") was signed into law. The AJCA includes a deduction of 85% of certain foreign
earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the AJCA. During 2005, the Company evaluated the effects of the repatriation provision and repatriated earnings of approximately $160 million from foreign operations under the AJCA, for which the Company
recorded income tax expense of $9 million.

On January 1,
2007, the Company adopted FIN No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. This interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure,
present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. Adoption of FIN No. 48 resulted in a decrease to the Company’s income tax liability and an increase to
retained earnings of $61 million as of January 1, 2007.

The Company’s unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption of FIN No. 48 and as of December 31, 2007 are as follows:

The Company classifies
all interest and penalties related to tax uncertainties as income tax expense. In 2007, the Company recognized $33 million in the consolidated statement of operations and recognized $59 million in liabilities in the consolidated statement of
financial position for tax-related interest and penalties.

The
Company's liability for income taxes includes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties which relate to tax years still subject to review by the Internal Revenue Service (“Service”) or other taxing jurisdictions.
Audit periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed. Generally, for tax years which produce net operating losses, capital losses or tax credit carryforwards (“tax attributes”), the statute of limitations does
not close, to the extent of these tax attributes, until the tax year in which they are fully utilized. The completion of review or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the liability
for income taxes. Any such adjustment could be material to the Company’s results of operations for any given quarterly or annual period based, in part, upon the results of operations for the given period. The Company does not anticipate any
significant changes to its total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.

federal income tax returns for the 1997 to 2001 periods. As a result of certain favorable resolutions, the Company’s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 included an income tax benefit of $720 million,
reflecting a reduction in the Company’s liability for income taxes. The statute of limitations has closed for these tax years; however, there were tax attributes which were utilized in subsequent tax years for which the statute of limitations
remains open.

In December 2006, the Service completed all
fieldwork with regards to its examination of the consolidated federal income tax returns for tax years 2002-2003. The final report was submitted to the Joint Committee on Taxation for their review in April 2007. In July 2007, the Joint Committee
returned the report to the Service for additional review of an industry issue regarding the methodology for calculating the dividends received deduction related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts. Within the table above, reconciling
the Company’s effective tax rate to the expected amount determined using the federal statutory rate of 35%, the dividends received deduction is the primary component of the non-taxable investment income in recent years. The Company is
responding to the Service’s request for additional information. In August 2007, the Service issued Revenue Ruling 2007-54. Revenue Ruling 2007-54 included among other items, guidance on the methodology to be followed in calculating the
dividends received deduction related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts. In September 2007, the Service released Revenue Ruling 2007-61. Revenue Ruling 2007-61 suspended Revenue Ruling 2007-54 and informed taxpayers that the U.S.
Treasury Department and the Service intend to address through new regulations the issues considered in Revenue Ruling 2007-54, including the methodology to be followed in determining the dividends received deduction related to variable life
insurance and annuity contracts. These activities had no impact on the Company’s 2007 results. The statute of limitations for the 2002-2003 tax years expires in 2009.

The Company’s affiliates in Japan file separate tax returns and are subject to audits by the local taxing authority. For tax years
after April 1, 2004 the general statute of limitations is 5 years from when the return is filed. For tax years prior to April 1, 2004 the general statute of limitations is 3 years from when the return is filed. The Tokyo Regional Taxation
Bureau is currently conducting a routine tax audit of the tax returns of Gibraltar Life Insurance Company, Ltd. for the three years ended March 31, 2005, 2006 and 2007.

The Company’s affiliates in Korea file separate tax returns and are subject to audits by the local taxing authority.
The general statute of limitations is five years from when the return is filed. A local district office in the Korean tax authority is currently conducting a routine tax audit of the local taxes of Prudential Life Insurance Company of Korea, Ltd.

In January 2007, the Service began an examination of tax years
2004 through 2006. For tax year 2007, the Company participated in the Service’s new Compliance Assurance Program (the “CAP”). Under CAP, the Service assigns an examination team to review completed transactions contemporaneously during
the 2007 tax year in order to reach agreement with the Company on how they should be reported in the tax return. If disagreements arise, accelerated resolutions programs are available to resolve the disagreements in a timely manner before the tax
return is filed. It is management’s expectation this new program will significantly shorten the time period between the Company’s filing of its federal income tax return and the Service’s completion of its examination of the return.

18.    FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The fair values presented below have been determined by
using available market information and by applying valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is applied in interpreting data to develop the estimates of fair value. These fair values may not be realized in a current market exchange. The use of
different market

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(continued)

assumptions and/or estimation methodologies could have a material effect on the fair values. The methods and assumptions discussed below were used in
calculating the fair values of the instruments. See Note 19 for a discussion of derivative instruments.

Fixed Maturities

The fair values of public fixed maturity securities are based on quoted market prices or estimates from independent pricing services. However, for investments in private placement fixed maturity securities, this information is not
available. For these private fixed maturities, the fair value is determined typically by using a discounted cash flow model, which relies upon the average of spread surveys collected from private market intermediaries who are active in both primary
and secondary transactions and takes into account, among other things, the credit quality of the issuer and the reduced liquidity associated with private placements. In determining the fair value of certain fixed maturity securities, the discounted
cash flow model may also use unobservable inputs, which reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the security. Historically, changes in estimated future cash flows or the assessment of an
issuer’s credit quality have been the more significant factors in determining fair values.

Commercial Loans

The fair value of commercial loans, other than those held by the Company’s commercial mortgage operations, is primarily based upon the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the appropriate U.S. Treasury rate or
Japanese Government Bond rate for yen based loans, adjusted for the current market spread for similar quality loans.

The fair value of commercial loans held by the Company’s commercial mortgage operations is based upon various factors, including the terms of the
loans, the intended exit strategy for the loans based upon either a securitization pricing model or commitments from investors, prevailing interest rates, and credit risk.

Policy Loans

The fair value of U.S. insurance policy loans is calculated using a discounted cash flow model based upon current U.S. Treasury rates and historical loan
repayment patterns, while Japanese insurance policy loans use the risk-free proxy based on the Yen LIBOR. For group corporate- and trust-owned life insurance contracts and group universal life contracts, the fair value of the policy loans is the
amount due as of the reporting date.

Investment Contracts

For guaranteed investment contracts, payout annuities
and other similar contracts without life contingencies, fair values are derived using discounted projected cash flows based on interest rates being offered for similar contracts with maturities consistent with those of the contracts being valued.
For individual deferred annuities and other deposit liabilities, carrying value approximates fair value. Investment contracts are reflected within “Policyholders’ account balances.”

Debt

The fair value of short-term and long-term debt is derived by using discount rates based on the borrowing rates currently
available to the Company for debt and financial instruments with similar terms and remaining maturities.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

18.    FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

(continued)

Bank Customer Liabilities

The carrying amount for certain deposits (interest and non-interest demand, savings and money market accounts) approximates
or equals their fair values. Fair values for fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates being offered on certificates at the reporting dates to a schedule of aggregated
expected monthly maturities.

The carrying amount approximates
or equals fair value for the following instruments: fixed maturities classified as available for sale, trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities, other trading account assets, equity securities, securities purchased under agreements to
resell, short-term investments, cash and cash equivalents, accrued investment income, restricted cash and securities, separate account assets and liabilities, broker-dealer related receivables and payables, securities sold under agreements to
repurchase, and cash collateral for loaned securities. The following table discloses the Company’s financial instruments where the carrying amounts and fair values differ at December 31,

19.    DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

Types
of Derivative Instruments and Derivative Strategies used in a non-dealer or broker capacity

Interest rate swaps are used by the Company to manage interest rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities (including duration
mismatches) and to hedge against changes in the value of assets it anticipates acquiring and other anticipated transactions and commitments. Swaps may be attributed to specific assets or liabilities or may be used on a portfolio basis. Under
interest rate swaps, the Company agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. Generally, no
cash is exchanged at the outset of the contract and no principal payments are made by either party. These transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that provide for a single net payment to be made by one counterparty at each due
date.

Exchange-traded futures and options are used by the
Company to reduce risks from changes in interest rates, to alter mismatches between the duration of assets in a portfolio and the duration of liabilities supported by those assets, and to hedge against changes in the value of securities it owns or
anticipates acquiring or selling. In exchange-traded futures transactions, the Company agrees to purchase or sell a specified number of contracts, the values of which are determined by the values of underlying referenced investments, and to post
variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal to the difference in the daily market values of those contracts. The Company enters into exchange-traded futures and options with regulated futures commission’s merchants who are members of a
trading exchange.

Currency derivatives, including
exchange-traded currency futures and options, currency forwards and currency swaps, are used by the Company to reduce risks from changes in currency exchange rates with respect



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

19.    DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

(continued)

to investments denominated in foreign currencies that the Company either holds or intends to acquire or sell. The Company also uses currency forwards to
hedge the currency risk associated with net investments in foreign operations and anticipated earnings of its foreign operations.

Under currency forwards, the Company agrees with other parties to deliver a specified amount of an identified currency at a specified future date.
Typically, the price is agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for such a contract is made at the specified future date. As noted above, the Company uses currency forwards to mitigate the risk that unfavorable changes in currency
exchange rates will reduce U.S. dollar equivalent earnings generated by certain of its non-U.S. businesses, primarily its international insurance and investment operations. The Company executes forward sales of the hedged currency in exchange for
U.S. dollars at a specified exchange rate. The maturities of these forwards correspond with the future periods in which the non-U.S. earnings are expected to be generated. These earnings hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting.

Under currency swaps, the Company agrees with other parties to exchange, at
specified intervals, the difference between one currency and another at an exchange rate and calculated by reference to an agreed principal amount. Generally, the principal amount of each currency is exchanged at the beginning and termination of the
currency swap by each party. These transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that provide for a single net payment to be made by one counterparty for payments made in the same currency at each due date.

Credit derivatives are used by the Company to enhance the return on the
Company’s investment portfolio by creating credit exposure similar to an investment in public fixed maturity cash instruments. With credit derivatives the Company can sell credit protection on an identified name, or a basket of names in a first
to default structure, and in return receive a quarterly premium. With single name credit default derivatives, this premium or credit spread generally corresponds to the difference between the yield on the referenced name’s public fixed maturity
cash instruments and swap rates, at the time the agreement is executed. With first to default baskets, the premium generally corresponds to a high proportion of the sum of the credit spreads of the names in the basket. If there is an event of
default by the referenced name or one of the referenced names in a basket, as defined by the agreement, then the Company is obligated to pay the counterparty the referenced amount of the contract and receive in return the referenced defaulted
security or similar security. See Note 21 for a discussion of guarantees related to these credit derivatives. In addition to selling credit protection, in limited instances the Company has purchased credit protection using credit derivatives in
order to hedge specific credit exposures in the Company’s investment portfolio.

Forward contracts are used by the Company to manage risks relating to interest rates. The Company also uses “to be announced” (“TBA”) forward contracts to gain exposure to the investment risk and
return of mortgage-backed securities. TBA transactions can help the Company to achieve better diversification and to enhance the return on its investment portfolio. TBAs provide a more liquid and cost effective method of achieving these goals than
purchasing or selling individual mortgage-backed pools. Typically, the price is agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for such a contract is made at a specified future date.

In its mortgage operations, the Company enters into commitments to fund commercial mortgage loans at specified interest
rates and other applicable terms within specified periods of time. These commitments are legally binding agreements to extend credit to a counterparty. Loan commitments for loans that will be held for sale are recognized as derivatives and recorded
at fair value. The determination of the fair value of loan commitments accounted for as derivatives considers various factors including, among others, terms of the related loan, the intended exit strategy for the loans based upon either a
securitization valuation models or investor purchase commitments, prevailing interest rates, and origination income or expense. Loan commitments that relate to the origination of mortgage loans that will be held for investment are not accounted for
as derivatives and accordingly are not recognized in the Company’s financial statements. See Note 21 for a further discussion of these loan commitments.

As further described in Note 9, the Company sells variable annuity products, which contain embedded
derivatives. These embedded derivatives are marked to market through “Realized investment gains (losses), net” based on the change in value of the underlying contractual guarantees, which are determined using valuation models. The Company
maintains a portfolio of derivative instruments that is intended to economically hedge the risks related to the above products’ features. The derivatives may include, but are not limited to equity options, total return swaps, interest rate swap
options, caps, floors, and other instruments. In addition, some variable annuity products feature an automatic rebalancing element to minimize risks inherent in our guarantees.

The Company invests in fixed maturities that, in addition to a stated coupon, provide a return based upon the results of an
underlying portfolio of fixed income investments and related investment activity. The Company accounts for these investments as available for sale fixed maturities containing embedded derivatives. Such embedded derivatives are marked to market
through “Realized investment gains (losses), net,” based upon the change in value of the underlying portfolio.

The table below provides a summary of the notional amount and fair value of derivatives contracts, excluding embedded derivatives, by the primary
underlying. Many derivative instruments contain multiple underlyings.

Cash Flow, Fair Value and Net
Investment Hedges

The primary derivative instruments
used by the Company in its fair value, cash flow, and net investment hedge accounting relationships are interest rate swaps, currency swaps and currency forwards. As noted above, these instruments are only designated for hedge accounting in
instances where the appropriate criteria are met. The Company does not use futures, options, credit, equity or embedded derivatives in any of its fair value, cash flow or net investment hedge accounting relationships.

The table below provides a summary of notional amount and fair value,
excluding embedded derivatives, by type of hedge designation:

The following table provides the financial statement classification and impact of derivatives used in
qualifying and non-qualifying hedge relationships, excluding embedded derivatives and the offset of the hedged item in an effective hedge relationship:

Interest rate component of currency derivatives

The ineffective portion of derivatives accounted for using hedge accounting in the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was not material to
the results of operations of the Company. In addition, there were no material amounts reclassified into earnings relating to discontinued cash flow hedge accounting because the forecasted transaction did not occur by the anticipated date or within
the additional time period permitted by SFAS No. 133.

Presented below is a roll forward of current period cash flow hedges in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” before taxes:



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

19.    DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

(continued)

It is anticipated that a pre-tax loss of approximately $17 million will be reclassified from
“Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” to earnings during the year ended December 31, 2008, offset by amounts pertaining to the hedged items. As of December 31, 2007, the Company does not have any cash flow hedges of
forecasted transactions other than those related to the variability of the payment or receipt of interest or foreign currency amounts on existing financial instruments. The maximum length of time for which these variable cash flows are hedged is 16
years. Income amounts deferred in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” as a result of cash flow hedges are included in “Net unrealized investment gains (losses)” in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’
Equity.

For effective net investment hedges, the amounts,
before applicable taxes, recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment account within “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” were gains of $2 million in 2007, losses of $78 million in 2006 and gains of $34 million in
2005.

For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
2005, there were no derivative reclassifications to earnings due to hedged firm commitments no longer deemed probable or due to hedged forecasted transactions that had not occurred by the end of the originally specified time period.

Credit Risk

The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties that is related to the
financial derivative transactions. The Company manages credit risk by entering into derivative transactions with major commercial and investment banks and other creditworthy counterparties, and by obtaining collateral where appropriate and by
limiting its single party credit exposures.

The credit
exposure of the Company’s over-the-counter (OTC) derivative transactions is represented by the contracts with a positive fair value (market value) at the reporting date. To reduce credit exposures, the Company seeks to (i) enter into OTC
derivative transactions pursuant to master agreements that provide for a netting of payments and receipts with a single counterparty (ii) enter into agreements that allow the use of credit support annexes (CSAs), which are bilateral
rating-sensitive agreements that require collateral postings at established threshold levels. Likewise, the Company effects exchange-traded futures and options transactions through regulated exchanges and these transactions are settled on a daily
basis, thereby reducing credit risk exposure in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to such financial instruments.

20.    SEGMENT INFORMATION

Segments

The Company has organized its principal operations into the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. Within the Financial Services
Businesses, the Company operates through three divisions, which together encompass eight reportable segments. The Company’s real estate and relocation services business as well as businesses that are not sufficiently material to warrant
separate disclosure and businesses to be divested are included in Corporate and Other operations within the Financial Services Businesses. Collectively, the businesses that comprise the three operating divisions and Corporate and Other are referred
to as the Financial Services Businesses.

Insurance
Division.

The Insurance division consists of the Individual Life, Individual Annuities and Group Insurance segments. The Individual Life segment manufactures and distributes individual variable life, term life, universal
life and non-participating whole life insurance, primarily to the U.S. mass market and mass affluent market. The Individual Annuities segment manufactures and distributes variable and fixed annuity



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

20.    SEGMENT INFORMATION

(continued)

products, primarily to the U.S. mass affluent market. The Group Insurance segment manufactures and distributes a full range of group life, long-term and
short-term group disability, long-term care and corporate-owned and trust-owned life insurance in the U.S. primarily to institutional clients for use in connection with employee and membership benefit plans.

Investment Division.

The Investment division
consists of the Asset Management, Financial Advisory and Retirement segments. The Asset Management segment provides a broad array of investment management and advisory services by means of institutional portfolio management, mutual funds, asset
securitization activity and other structured products, and proprietary investments. These products and services are provided to the public and private marketplace, as well as to other segments of the Company. The Financial Advisory segment consists
of the Company’s investment in Wachovia Securities. The Retirement segment manufactures and distributes products and provides administrative services for qualified and non-qualified retirement plans and offers guaranteed investment contracts,
funding agreements, institutional and retail notes, structured settlement annuities and group annuities.

International Insurance and Investments Division.

The International Insurance and Investments division consists of the
International Insurance and International Investments segments. The International Insurance segment manufactures and distributes individual life insurance products to the mass affluent and affluent markets in Japan, Korea and other foreign countries
through its Life Planner operations. In addition, similar products are offered to the broad middle income market across Japan through Life Advisors, the proprietary distribution channel of the Company’s Gibraltar Life operation. The
International Investments segment offers proprietary and non-proprietary asset management, investment advice and services to retail and institutional clients in selected international markets.

Corporate and Other.

Corporate and Other
includes corporate operations, after allocations to business segments, and real estate and relocation services, as well as divested businesses. Corporate operations consist primarily of (1) corporate-level income and expenses, after allocations
to any business segments, including income and expense from the Company’s qualified pension and other employee benefit plans and investment returns on capital that is not deployed in any business segments; (2) returns from investments not
allocated to any business segments, including debt-financed investment portfolios, as well as tax credit investments and other tax enhanced investments financed by the Company’s business segments; and (3) businesses that have been placed
in wind-down status but have not been divested, such as certain individual life insurance polices assumed under reinsurance and individual health insurance, as well as the impact of transactions with other segments and consolidating adjustments. The
divested businesses consist primarily of property and casualty insurance businesses, Prudential Securities capital markets business and exchange shares previously held by the Company’s discontinued Prudential Equity Group.

Closed Block Business.

The Closed Block
Business, which is managed separately from the Financial Services Businesses, was established on the date of demutualization. It includes the Closed Block (as discussed in Note 10); assets held outside the Closed Block necessary to meet insurance
regulatory capital requirements related to products included within the Closed Block; deferred policy acquisition costs related to the Closed Block policies; the principal amount of the IHC debt (as discussed in Note 12) and certain related assets
and liabilities.

Segment Accounting
Policies.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2. Results for each segment include earnings on attributed equity established at a level which management considers necessary to
support each segment’s risks. Operating expenses specifically identifiable to a particular segment are allocated to that segment as incurred. Operating expenses not identifiable to a specific segment that are incurred in connection with the
generation of segment revenues are generally allocated based upon the segment’s historical percentage of general and administrative expenses.

20.    SEGMENT INFORMATION

Adjusted Operating Income

In managing the Financial Services Businesses, the Company analyzes the operating performance of each segment using
“adjusted operating income.” Adjusted operating income does not equate to “income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures” or “net income” as determined in
accordance with U.S. GAAP but is the measure of segment profit or loss used by the Company to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources, and, consistent with SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information,” is the measure of segment performance presented below.

Adjusted operating income is calculated by adjusting each segment’s “income from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of operating joint ventures” for the following items,
which are described in greater detail below:

•

realized investment gains (losses), net, and related charges and adjustments;

•

net investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities due to asset
value changes;

•

the contribution to income/loss of divested businesses that have been or will be sold or exited but that did not qualify for “discontinued operations”
accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP; and

•

equity in earnings of operating joint ventures.

These items are important to an understanding of overall results of operations. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute for income determined in
accordance with U.S. GAAP, and the Company’s definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies. However, the Company believes that the presentation of adjusted operating income as measured for management
purposes enhances the understanding of results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability factors of the Financial Services Businesses.

Realized investment gains (losses), net, and related charges and
adjustments.

Adjusted operating income excludes realized investment gains (losses), net, except as indicated below. A significant element of realized investment gains and losses are impairments and credit-related and
interest rate-related gains and losses. Impairments and losses from sales of credit-impaired securities, the timing of which depends largely on market credit cycles, can vary considerably across periods. The timing of other sales that would result
in gains or losses, such as interest rate-related gains or losses, is largely subject to the Company’s discretion and influenced by market opportunities, as well as the Company’s tax profile. Trends in the underlying profitability of the
Company’s businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of these transactions.

Charges that relate to realized investment gains (losses), net, are also excluded from adjusted operating income. The related charges are associated with:
policyholder dividends; amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, VOBA, unearned revenue reserves and deferred sales inducements; interest credited to policyholders’ account balances; reserves for future policy benefits; payments
associated with the market value adjustment features related to certain of the annuity products the Company sells; and minority interest in consolidated operating subsidiaries. The related charges associated with policyholder dividends include a
percentage of the net increase in the fair value of specified assets included in Gibraltar Life’s reorganization plan that is required to be paid as a special dividend to Gibraltar Life policyholders. Deferred policy acquisition costs, VOBA,
unearned revenue reserves and deferred sales inducements for certain products are amortized based on estimated gross profits, which include net realized investment gains and losses on the underlying invested assets. The related charge for these
items represent the portion of this amortization associated with net realized investment gains and losses. The related charges for interest credited to policyholders’ account balances relate to certain group life policies that pass back certain
realized investment gains and losses to the policyholder. The



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

20.    SEGMENT INFORMATION

(continued)

reserves for certain policies are adjusted when cash flows related to these policies are affected by net realized investment gains and losses, and the
related charge for reserves for future policy benefits represents that adjustment. Certain of the Company’s annuity products contain a market value adjustment feature that requires us to pay to the contractholder or entitles us to receive from
the contractholder, upon surrender, a market value adjustment based on the crediting rates on the contract surrendered compared to crediting rates on newly issued contracts or based on an index rate at the time of purchase compared to an index rate
at time of surrender, as applicable. These payments mitigate the net realized investment gains or losses incurred upon the disposition of the underlying invested assets. The related charge represents the payments or receipts associated with these
market value adjustment features. Minority interest expense is recorded for the earnings of consolidated subsidiaries owed to minority investors. The related charge for minority interest in consolidated operating subsidiaries represents the portion
of these earnings associated with net realized investment gains and losses.

Adjustments to “Realized investment gains (losses), net,” for purposes of calculating adjusted operating income, include the following:

Gains and losses pertaining to derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, other than
derivatives used in the Company’s capacity as a broker or dealer, are included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” This includes mark-to-market adjustments of open contracts as well as periodic settlements. As discussed
further below, adjusted operating income includes a portion of realized gains and losses pertaining to certain derivative contracts.

Adjusted operating income of the International Insurance segment and International Investments segment, excluding the global commodities group, reflect
the impact of an intercompany arrangement with Corporate and Other operations pursuant to which the segments’ non-U.S. dollar denominated earnings in all countries for a particular year, including its interim reporting periods, are translated
at fixed currency exchange rates. The fixed rates are determined in connection with a currency hedging program designed to mitigate the risk that unfavorable rate changes will reduce the segments’ U.S. dollar equivalent earnings. Pursuant to
this program, the Company’s Corporate and Other operations execute forward currency contracts with third parties to sell the hedged currency in exchange for U.S. dollars at a specified exchange rate. The maturities of these contracts correspond
with the future periods in which the identified non-U.S. dollar denominated earnings are expected to be generated. These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP and, as noted above, all resulting profits or losses from such
contracts are included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” When the contracts are terminated in the same period that the expected earnings emerge, the resulting positive or negative cash flow effect is included in adjusted
operating income (gains of $78 million, gains of $42 million and losses of $55 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively). As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the fair value of open contracts used for this
purpose was a net asset of $12 million and $105 million, respectively.

The Company uses interest rate and currency swaps and other derivatives to manage interest and currency exchange rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities, including duration mismatches. For the derivative
contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, mark-to-market adjustments of open contracts as well as periodic settlements are included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” However, the periodic swap settlements,
as well as other derivative related yield adjustments, are included in adjusted operating income to reflect the after-hedge yield of the underlying instruments. Adjusted operating income includes gains of $76 million, $58 million and $54 million for
the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, due to periodic settlements and yield adjustments of such contracts.

Certain products the Company sells are accounted for as freestanding derivatives or contain embedded derivatives. Changes in the fair value of these
derivatives, along with any fees received or payments made relating to the derivative, are recorded in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” These “Realized investment



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

20.    SEGMENT INFORMATION

(continued)

gains (losses), net” are included in adjusted operating income in the period in which the gain or loss is recorded. In addition, the changes in fair
value of any associated derivative portfolio that is part of an economic hedging program related to the risk of these products (but which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP) are also included in adjusted operating income
in the period in which the gains or losses on the derivative portfolio are recorded. Adjusted operating income includes gains of $46 million, $15 million and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, related
to these products and any associated derivative portfolio.

The
Company invests in fixed maturities that, in addition to a stated coupon, provide a return based upon the results of an underlying portfolio of fixed income investments and related investment activity. The Company accounts for these investments as
available for sale fixed maturities containing embedded derivatives that are marked to market through “Realized investment gains (losses), net,” based upon the change in value of the underlying portfolio. Adjusted operating income includes
cumulative realized investment losses, and recoveries of such losses, on the embedded derivative in the period they occur. Cumulative realized investment gains above the original fair value of the embedded derivative are deferred and amortized into
adjusted operating income over the remaining life of the investment. Adjusted operating income includes losses of $148 million, $9 million and $11 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, related to these
embedded derivatives.

Adjustments are also made for the
purposes of calculating adjusted operating income for the following items:

Within the Company’s Asset Management segment, its commercial mortgage operations originate loans for sale, including through securitization transactions. The “Realized investment gains (losses), net”
associated with these loans, including related derivative results and retained mortgage servicing rights, are a principal source of earnings for this business and are included in adjusted operating income. Also within the Company's Asset Management
segment, its proprietary investing business makes investments for sale or syndication to other investors or for placement or co-investment in the Company’s managed funds and structured products. The “Realized investment gains (losses),
net” associated with the sale of these proprietary investments are a principal source of earnings for this business and are included in adjusted operating income. In addition, “Realized investment gains (losses), net” from derivatives
used to hedge certain foreign currency-denominated proprietary investments are included in adjusted operating income. Net realized investment losses of $22 million, and gains of $109 million and $108 million related to these businesses were included
in adjusted operating income for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The Company’s Japanese insurance operations invest in “dual currency” fixed maturities and loans, which pay interest in U.S. dollars, while
the principal is payable in Japanese yen. For fixed maturities that are categorized as held to maturity, and loans where the Company’s intent is to hold them to maturity, the change in value related to foreign currency fluctuations associated
with the U.S. dollar interest payments is recorded in “Asset management fees and other income.” Since these investments will be held until maturity, the foreign exchange impact will ultimately be realized as net investment income as
earned. Therefore the change in value related to foreign currency fluctuations recorded within “Asset management fees and other income” is excluded from adjusted operating income and is reflected as an adjustment to “Realized
investment gains (losses), net.” These adjustments were a net loss of $22 million, a net loss of $7 million, and a net gain of $19 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

In addition, the Company has certain other assets and liabilities for which,
under GAAP, the change in value due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period is recorded in “Asset management fees and other income.” To the extent the foreign currency exposure on these assets and liabilities is
economically hedged, the change in value included in “Asset management fees and other income” is excluded from adjusted operating

income and is reflected as an adjustment to “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” These adjustments were a net gain of $134 million, a net
gain of $2 million, and a net loss of $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

As part of the acquisition of CIGNA’s retirement business, the Company entered into reinsurance agreements with CIGNA, including a
modified-coinsurance-with-assumption arrangement that applied to the defined benefit guaranteed-cost contracts acquired. The net results of these contracts were recorded in “Asset management fees and other income” as a result of the
reinsurance arrangement, and such net results included realized investment gains and losses. These realized investment gains and losses were excluded from adjusted operating income as an adjustment to “Realized investment gains (losses),
net.” There were no adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 as a result of the change in reinsurance arrangement during 2006 with CIGNA as discussed in Note 3. Net realized investment gains of $13 million were excluded
for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Investment gains
and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities and changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes.

Certain products included in the Retirement and International
Insurance segments, are experience-rated in that investment results associated with these products will ultimately accrue to contractholders. The investments supporting these experience-rated products, excluding commercial loans, are classified as
trading. These trading investments are reflected on the statements of financial position as “Trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities, at fair value.” Realized and unrealized gains and losses for these investments are
reported in “Asset management fees and other income.” Investment income for these investments is reported in “Net investment income.” Commercial loans that support these experience-rated products are carried at unpaid principal,
net of unamortized discounts and an allowance for losses, and are reflected on the statements of financial position as “Commercial loans.”

Adjusted operating income excludes net investment gains and losses on trading account assets supporting insurance liabilities. This is consistent with the
exclusion of realized investment gains and losses with respect to other investments supporting insurance liabilities managed on a consistent basis, as discussed above. In addition, to be consistent with the historical treatment of charges related to
realized investment gains and losses on available for sale securities, adjusted operating income also excludes the change in contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes in the pool of investments (including commercial loans) supporting
these experience-rated contracts, which are reflected in “Interest credited to policyholders’ account balances.” The result of this approach is that adjusted operating income for these products includes only net fee revenue and
interest spread the Company earns on these experience-rated contracts, and excludes changes in fair value of the pool of investments, both realized and unrealized, that accrue to the contractholders.

Divested businesses.

The contribution to
income/loss of divested businesses that have been or will be sold or exited, but that did not qualify for “discontinued operations” accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP, are excluded from adjusted operating income as the results of
divested businesses are not relevant to understanding the Company’s ongoing operating results.

Equity in earnings of operating joint ventures

.    Equity in earnings of operating joint ventures, on a pre-tax basis, are
included in adjusted operating income as these results are a principal source of earnings. These earnings are reflected on a GAAP basis on an after-tax basis as a separate line on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Commitments and Guarantees

The Company occupies leased office space in many locations under various long-term leases and has entered into numerous leases covering the long-term use
of computers and other equipment. Rental expense, net of sub-lease income, incurred for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $179 million, $175 million and $192 million, respectively.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

21.    COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND LITIGATION AND
REGULATORY MATTERS

(continued)

The following table presents, at December 31, 2007, the Company’s contractual maturities on
long-term debt, as more fully described in Note 12, and future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases along with associated sub-lease income:

Occasionally, for
business reasons, the Company may exit certain non-cancelable operating leases prior to their expiration. In these instances, the Company’s policy is to accrue, at the time it ceases to use the property being leased, the future rental expense
and any sub-lease income, and to release this reserve over the remaining commitment period. Of the $754 million in total non-cancelable operating leases and $151 million in total sub-lease income, $152 million and $134 million, respectively, has
been accrued at December 31, 2007.

In connection with the
Company’s commercial mortgage operations, it originates commercial mortgage loans. At December 31, 2007, the Company had outstanding commercial mortgage loan commitments with borrowers of $2,937 million. In certain of these transactions,
the Company prearranges that it will sell the loan to an investor after the Company funds the loan. As of December 31, 2007, $574 million of the Company’s commitments to originate commercial mortgage loans are subject to such arrangements.

The Company also has other commitments, some of which are
contingent upon events or circumstances not under the Company’s control, including those at the discretion of the Company’s counterparties. These other commitments amounted to $10,782 million at December 31, 2007. Reflected in these
other commitments are $10,638 million of commitments to purchase or fund investments, including $7,435 million that the Company anticipates will be funded from the assets of its separate accounts.

In the course of the Company’s business, it provides certain guarantees
and indemnities to third parties pursuant to which it may be contingently required to make payments now or in the future.

A number of guarantees provided by the Company relate to real estate investments, in which the investor has borrowed funds, and the Company has guaranteed
their obligation to their lender. In some cases, the investor is an affiliate, and in other cases the unaffiliated investor purchases the real estate investment from the Company. The Company provides these guarantees to assist the investors in
obtaining financing for the transaction on more beneficial terms. The vast majority of these guarantees relate to real estate investments held by the Company’s separate accounts and the Company’s maximum potential exposure under these
guarantees was $2,538 million at December 31, 2007. Any payments that may become required of the Company under these guarantees would either first be reduced by proceeds received by the creditor on a sale of the underlying collateral, or would
provide the Company with rights to obtain the underlying collateral. These guarantees generally expire at various times over the next ten years. At December 31, 2007, no amounts were accrued as a result of the Company’s assessment that it
is unlikely payments will be required.

As discussed in Note
19, the Company writes credit derivatives under which the Company is obligated to pay the counterparty the referenced amount of the contract and receive in return the defaulted security or similar



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

21.    COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND LITIGATION AND
REGULATORY MATTERS

(continued)

security. The Company’s maximum amount at risk under these credit derivatives, assuming the value of the underlying securities become worthless, is
$1,618 million at December 31, 2007. These credit derivatives generally have maturities of ten years or less.

Certain contracts underwritten by the Retirement segment include guarantees related to financial assets owned by the guaranteed party. These contracts are
accounted for as derivatives, at fair value, in accordance with SFAS No. 133. At December 31, 2007, such contracts in force carried a total guaranteed value of $4,428 million.

The Company arranges for credit enhancements of certain debt instruments that provide financing for commercial real estate
assets, including certain tax-exempt bond financings. The credit enhancements provide assurances to the debt holders as to the timely payment of amounts due under the debt instruments. At December 31, 2007, such enhancement arrangements total
$154 million, with remaining contractual maturities of up to 15 years. The Company's obligations to reimburse required payments are secured by mortgages on the related real estate, which properties are valued at $190 million at December 31,
2007. The Company receives certain ongoing fees for providing these enhancement arrangements and anticipates the extinguishment of its obligation under these enhancements prior to maturity through the aggregation and transfer of its positions to a
substitute enhancement provider. At December 31, 2007, the Company has accrued liabilities of $2 million representing unearned fees on these arrangements.

In connection with its commercial mortgage operation, the Company provides commercial mortgage origination, underwriting and servicing for certain
government sponsored entities, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Company has agreed to indemnify certain of these government sponsored entities for a portion of the credit risk associated with the mortgages it services through these
relationships. The Company’s percentage share of losses incurred generally varies from 2% to 20% of the unpaid principal balance, based on the program and the severity of the loss. The unpaid principal balance of mortgages subject to these
arrangements as of December 31, 2007 were $5,576 million, all of which are collateralized by first liens on the underlying commercial properties. As of December 31, 2007, the Company has established a liability of $11 million related to
these indemnifications.

In connection with certain
acquisitions, the Company has agreed to pay additional consideration in future periods, based upon the attainment by the acquired entity of defined operating objectives. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company does not accrue contingent
consideration obligations prior to the attainment of the objectives. At December 31, 2007, maximum potential future consideration pursuant to such arrangements, to be resolved over the following two years, is $61 million. Any such payments
would result in increases in intangible assets, including goodwill.

The Company is also subject to other financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements. The Company has provided indemnities and guarantees related to acquisitions, dispositions, investments and other transactions that are triggered by, among
other things, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by the Company. These obligations are typically subject to various time limitations, defined by the contract or by operation of law, such as statutes of limitation. In some
cases, the maximum potential obligation is subject to contractual limitations, while in other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable. Since certain of these obligations are not subject to limitations, it is not possible to determine
the maximum potential amount due under these guarantees. At December 31, 2007, the Company has accrued liabilities of $7 million associated with all other financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements, which does not include retained
liabilities associated with sold businesses.

Contingent Liabilities

In 2003, the Company sold its property and casualty
insurance companies that operated nationally in 48 states outside of New Jersey, and the District of Columbia, to Liberty Mutual. In connection with that sale, the



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

21.    COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND LITIGATION AND
REGULATORY MATTERS

(continued)

Company reinsured Liberty Mutual for certain losses including any adverse loss development on losses occurring prior to the sale that arise from insurance
contracts generated through certain “discontinued” distribution channels or due to certain loss events and stop-loss protection on losses occurring after the sale and arising from those same distribution channels of up to $95 million, in
excess of related premiums and other adjustments. The reinsurance covering the losses associated with the discontinued distribution channels will be settled based upon loss experience through December 31, 2008, with a provision that profits on
the insurance business from these channels will be shared, with Liberty Mutual receiving up to $20 million of the first $50 million.

On an ongoing basis, the Company’s internal supervisory and control functions review the quality of sales, marketing and other customer interface
procedures and practices and may recommend modifications or enhancements. From time to time, this review process results in the discovery of product administration, servicing or other errors, including errors relating to the timing or amount of
payments or contract values due to customers. In certain cases, if appropriate, the Company may offer customers remediation and may incur charges, including the cost of such remediation, administrative costs and regulatory fines.

It is possible that the results of operations or the cash flow of the Company
in a particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected as a result of payments in connection with the matters discussed above or other matters depending, in part, upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period.
Management believes, however, that ultimate payments in connection with these matters, after consideration of applicable reserves and rights to indemnification, should not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position.

Litigation and Regulatory Matters

The Company is subject to legal and regulatory
actions in the ordinary course of its businesses. Pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings relating to aspects of the Company’s businesses and operations that are specific to it and proceedings that are typical of the businesses
in which it operates, including in both cases businesses that have either been divested or placed in wind-down status. Some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants. In certain of these matters, the
plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. The outcome of a litigation or regulatory matter, and the amount or range of potential loss at any particular time, is often inherently uncertain.

Insurance and Annuities

From November 2002 to March 2005, eleven separate complaints were filed
against the Company and the law firm of Leeds Morelli & Brown in New Jersey state court. The cases were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in New Jersey Superior Court, Essex County and captioned

Lederman v. Prudential Financial,
Inc., et al

. The complaints allege that an alternative dispute resolution agreement entered into among Prudential Insurance, over 350 claimants who are current and former Prudential Insurance employees, and Leeds Morelli & Brown
(the law firm representing the claimants) was illegal and that Prudential Insurance conspired with Leeds Morelli & Brown to commit fraud, malpractice, breach of contract, and violate racketeering laws by advancing legal fees to the law firm
with the purpose of limiting Prudential’s liability to the claimants. In 2004, the Superior Court sealed these lawsuits and compelled them to arbitration. In May 2006, the Appellate Division reversed the trial court’s decisions, held that
the cases were improperly sealed, and should be heard in court rather than arbitrated. In November 2006, plaintiffs filed a motion seeking to permit over 200 individuals to join the cases as additional plaintiffs, to authorize a joint trial on
liability issues for all plaintiffs, and to add a claim under the New Jersey discrimination law. In March 2007, the court granted plaintiffs’ motion to amend the complaint to add over 200 additional plaintiffs and a claim under the New Jersey
discrimination law but denied

(continued)

without prejudice plaintiffs’ motion for a joint trial on liability issues. In June 2007, PFI and PICA moved to dismiss the complaint. In November 2007,
the court granted the motion, in part, and dismissed the commercial bribery and conspiracy to commit malpractice claims and denied the motion with respect to other claims. In January 2008, plaintiffs filed a demand pursuant to New Jersey law stating
that they were seeking damages in the amount of $6.5 billion.

The Company, along with a number of other insurance companies, received formal requests for information from the State of New York Attorney General’s Office (“NYAG”), the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”),
the Connecticut Attorney General’s Office, the Massachusetts Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Labor, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of California, the District Attorney of the County of San Diego, and
various state insurance departments relating to payments to insurance intermediaries and certain other practices that may be viewed as anti-competitive. The Company may receive additional requests from these and other regulators and governmental
authorities concerning these and related subjects. The Company is cooperating with these inquiries and has had discussions with certain authorities in an effort to resolve the inquiries into this matter. In December 2006, Prudential Insurance
reached a resolution of the NYAG investigation. Under the terms of the settlement, Prudential Insurance paid a $2.5 million penalty and established a $16.5 million fund for policyholders, adopted business reforms and agreed, among other things, to
continue to cooperate with the NYAG in any litigation, ongoing investigations or other proceedings. Prudential Insurance also settled the litigation brought by the California Department of Insurance and agreed to business reforms and disclosures as
to group insurance contracts insuring customers or residents in California and to pay certain costs of investigation. These matters are also the subject of litigation brought by private plaintiffs, including purported class actions that have been
consolidated in the multidistrict litigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey,

In re Employee Benefit Insurance Brokerage Antitrust Litigation

. In August and September 2007, the court dismissed the anti-trust
and RICO claims. In January 2008, the court dismissed the ERISA claims with prejudice but has not yet resolved the state law claims. The regulatory settlement may adversely affect the existing litigation or cause additional litigation and result in
adverse publicity and other potentially adverse impacts to the Company’s business.

In April 2005, the Company voluntarily commenced a review of the accounting for its reinsurance arrangements to confirm that it complied with applicable accounting rules. This review included an inventory and
examination of current and past arrangements, including those relating to the Company’s wind down and divested businesses and discontinued operations. Subsequent to commencing this voluntary review, the Company received a formal request from
the Connecticut Attorney General for information regarding its participation in reinsurance transactions generally and a formal request from the SEC for information regarding certain reinsurance contracts entered into with a single counterparty
since 1997 as well as specific contracts entered into with that counterparty in the years 1997 through 2002 relating to the Company’s property and casualty insurance operations that were sold in 2003. These investigations are ongoing and not
yet complete and it is possible that the Company may receive additional requests from regulators relating to reinsurance arrangements. The Company intends to cooperate with all such requests.

The Company’s subsidiary, American Skandia Life Assurance Corporation,
has commenced a remediation program to correct errors in the administration of approximately 11,000 annuity contracts issued by that company. The owners of these contracts did not receive notification that the contracts were approaching or past
their designated annuitization date or default annuitization date (both dates referred to as the “contractual annuity date”) and the contracts were not annuitized at their contractual annuity dates. Some of these contracts also were
affected by data integrity errors resulting in incorrect contractual annuity dates. The lack of notice and data integrity errors, as reflected on the annuities administrative system, all occurred before the acquisition of the American Skandia
entities by the Company. The remediation and administrative costs of the remediation program are subject to the indemnification provisions of the acquisition agreement pursuant to which the Company purchased the American Skandia entities in May 2003
from Skandia.

Securities

Prudential Securities has been named as a defendant in a number of industry-wide purported class actions in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York relating to its former securities underwriting business. Plaintiffs in one consolidated proceeding, captioned

In re: Initial Public Offering Securities Litigation

, allege, among other things, that
the underwriters engaged in a scheme involving tying agreements, undisclosed compensation arrangements and research analyst conflicts to manipulate and inflate the prices of shares sold in initial public offerings in violation of the federal
securities laws. Certain issuers of these securities and their current and former officers and directors have also been named as defendants. In October 2004, the district court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in six
“focus cases.” In December 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated that decision and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. In August 2000, Prudential Securities was named as a
defendant, along with other underwriters, in a purported class action, captioned

CHS Electronics Inc. v. Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. et al

., which alleges on behalf of issuers of securities in initial public offerings that the defendants
conspired to fix at 7% the discount that underwriting syndicates receive from issuers in violation of federal antitrust laws. Plaintiffs moved for class certification in September 2004 and for partial summary judgment in November 2005. The summary
judgment motion has been deferred pending disposition of the class certification motion. In April 2006, the district court denied class certification. In September 2007, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the district court’s decision
denying class certification and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. In a related action, captioned

Gillet v. Goldman Sachs et al.

, plaintiffs allege substantially the same antitrust claims on behalf of investors,
though only injunctive relief is currently being sought.

Other Matters

Mutual Fund Market
Timing Practices

In August 2006, Prudential Equity
Group, LLC (“PEG”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, reached a resolution of the previously disclosed regulatory and criminal investigations into deceptive market related activities involving PEG’s former Prudential
Securities operations. The settlements relate to conduct that generally occurred between 1999 and 2003 involving certain former Prudential Securities brokers in Boston and certain other branch offices in the U.S., their supervisors, and other
members of the Prudential Securities control structure with responsibilities that related to the market timing activities, including certain former members of Prudential Securities senior management. The Prudential Securities operations were
contributed to a joint venture with Wachovia Corporation in July 2003, but PEG retained liability for the market timing related activities. In connection with the resolution of the investigations, PEG entered into separate settlements with each of
the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts (“USAO”), the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Securities Division, SEC, the National Association of Securities Dealers, the New York Stock Exchange, the New
Jersey Bureau of Securities and the New York Attorney Generals Office. These settlements resolve the investigations by the above named authorities into these matters as to all Prudential entities without further regulatory proceedings or filing of
charges so long as the terms of the settlement are followed and provided, in the case of the settlement agreement reached with the USAO, that the USAO has reserved the right to prosecute PEG if there is a material breach by PEG of that agreement
during its five year term and in certain other specified events. Under the terms of the settlements, PEG paid $270 million into a Fair Fund administered by the SEC to compensate those harmed by the market timing activities. In addition, $330 million
was paid in fines and penalties. Pursuant to the settlements, PEG retained, at PEG’s ongoing cost and expense, the services of an Independent Distribution Consultant acceptable to certain of the authorities to develop a proposed distribution
plan for the distribution of Fair Fund amounts according to a methodology developed in consultation with and acceptable to certain of the authorities. In addition, as part of the settlements, PEG has agreed, among other



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

21.    COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND LITIGATION AND
REGULATORY MATTERS

(continued)

things, to continue to cooperate with the above named authorities in any litigation, ongoing investigations or other proceedings relating to or arising from
their investigations into these matters. In connection with the settlements, the Company has agreed with the USAO, among other things, to cooperate with the USAO and to maintain and periodically report on the effectiveness of its compliance
procedures. The settlement documents include findings and admissions that may adversely affect existing litigation or cause additional litigation and result in adverse publicity and other potentially adverse impacts to the Company’s businesses.

In addition to the regulatory proceedings described above that
were settled in 2006, in October 2004, the Company and Prudential Securities were named as defendants in several class actions brought on behalf of purchasers and holders of shares in a number of mutual fund complexes. The actions are consolidated
as part of a multi-district proceeding,

In re: Mutual Fund Investment Litigation,

pending in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. The complaints allege that the purchasers and holders were harmed by dilution of the
funds’ values and excessive fees, caused by market timing and late trading, and seek unspecified damages. In August 2005, the Company was dismissed from several of the actions, without prejudice to repleading the state claims, but remains a
defendant in other actions in the consolidated proceeding. In July 2006, in one of the consolidated mutual fund actions,

Saunders v. Putnam American Government Income Fund, et al.,

the United States District Court for the District of Maryland
granted plaintiffs leave to refile their federal securities law claims against Prudential Securities. In August 2006, the second amended complaint was filed alleging federal securities law claims on behalf of a purported nationwide class of mutual
fund investors seeking compensatory and punitive damages in unspecified amounts. Discovery is ongoing. Motions to dismiss the other actions are pending.

Commencing in 2003, the Company received formal requests for information from the SEC and NYAG relating to market timing in variable annuities by certain
American Skandia entities. In connection with these investigations, with the approval of Skandia Insurance Company Ltd. (publ) (“Skandia”), an offer was made by American Skandia to the authorities investigating its companies, the SEC and
NYAG, to settle these matters by paying restitution and a civil penalty of $95 million in the aggregate. While not assured, the Company believes these discussions are likely to lead to settlements with these authorities. Any regulatory settlement
involving an American Skandia entity would be subject to the indemnification provisions of the acquisition agreement pursuant to which the Company purchased the American Skandia entities in May 2003 from Skandia. If achieved, settlement of the
matters relating to American Skandia also could involve continuing monitoring, changes to and/or supervision of business practices, findings that may adversely affect existing or cause additional litigation, adverse publicity and other adverse
impacts to the Company’s businesses.

Other

In August 1999, a Prudential Insurance employee and several
Prudential Insurance retirees filed an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida,

Dupree, et al., v. Prudential Insurance, et al.

, against Prudential Insurance and its Board of Directors in connection
with a group annuity contract entered into in 1989 between the Prudential Retirement Plan and Prudential Insurance. The suit alleged that the annuitization of certain retirement benefits violated ERISA and that, in the event of demutualization,
Prudential Insurance would retain shares distributed under the annuity contract in violation of ERISA’s fiduciary duty requirements. In July 2001, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint dropping three counts, and the Company filed an answer
denying the essential allegations of the complaint. The amended complaint seeks injunctive and monetary relief, including the return of what are claimed to be excess investment and advisory fees paid by the Retirement Plan to Prudential. In March
2002, the court dismissed certain of the claims against the individual defendants. A non-jury trial was concluded in January 2005. In August 2007, the court issued its decision and order dismissing the case. In September 2007, plaintiffs filed a
notice of appeal with the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. In December 2007, the appeal was withdrawn.

In October 2007, Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity Co. (“PRIAC”) filed an action
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,

Prudential Retirement Insurance & Annuity Co. v. State Street Global Advisors,

in PRIAC’s fiduciary capacity and on behalf of certain defined benefit and
defined contribution plan clients of PRIAC, against an unaffiliated asset manager, State Street Global Advisors (“SSgA”) and SSgA’s affiliate, State Street Bank and Trust Company (“State Street”). This action seeks, among
other relief, restitution of certain losses attributable to certain investment funds sold by SSgA as to which PRIAC believes SSgA employed investment strategies and practices that were misrepresented by SSgA and failed to exercise the standard of
care of a prudent investment manager. PRIAC also intends to vigorously pursue any other available remedies against SSgA and State Street in respect of this matter. Given the unusual circumstances surrounding the management of these SSgA funds and in
order to protect the interests of the affected plans and their participants while PRIAC pursues these remedies, PRIAC implemented a process under which affected plan clients that authorized PRIAC to proceed on their behalf have received payments
from funds provided by PRIAC for the losses referred to above. The Company’s consolidated financial statements, and the results of the Retirement segment included in the Company’s Investment Division, for the year ended December 31,
2007 include a pre-tax charge of $82 million, reflecting these payments to plan clients and certain related costs.

In September and October 2005, five purported class action lawsuits were filed against the Company, PSI and PEG claiming that stockbrokers were improperly
classified as exempt employees under state and federal wage and hour laws, were improperly denied overtime pay and that improper deductions were made from the stockbrokers’ wages. Two of the stockbrokers’ complaints,

Janowsky v.
Wachovia Securities, LLC and Prudential Securities Incorporated

and

Goldstein v. Prudential Financial, Inc.

, were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The

Goldstein

complaint purports to
have been filed on behalf of a nationwide class. The

Janowsky

complaint alleges a class of New York brokers. Motions to dismiss and compel arbitration were filed in the

Janowsky

and

Goldstein

matters, which have been
consolidated for pre-trial purposes. The three stockbrokers complaints filed in California Superior Court,

Dewane v. Prudential Equity Group, Prudential Securities Incorporated, and Wachovia Securities LLC; DiLustro v. Prudential Securities
Incorporated, Prudential Equity Group Inc. and Wachovia Securities; and Carayanis v. Prudential Equity Group LLC and Prudential Securities Inc.

, purport to have been brought on behalf of classes of California brokers. The

Carayanis

complaint was subsequently withdrawn without prejudice in May 2006. In June 2006, a purported New York state class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York,

Panesenko v. Wachovia
Securities, et al

., alleging that the Company failed to pay overtime to stockbrokers in violation of state and federal law and that improper deductions were made from the stockbrokers’ wages in violation of state law. In September 2006,
Prudential Securities was sued in

Badain v. Wachovia Securities, et al.,

a purported nationwide class action filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York. The complaint alleges that Prudential Securities
failed to pay overtime to stockbrokers in violation of state and federal law and that improper deductions were made from the stockbrokers’ wages in violation of state law. In October 2006, a purported class action lawsuit,

Bouder v.
Prudential Financial, Inc. and Prudential Insurance Company of America

, was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, claiming that the Company failed to pay overtime to insurance agents who were registered
representatives in violation of federal and state law, and that improper deductions were made from these agents’ wages in violation of state law. In December 2006, these cases were transferred to the United States District Court for the Central
District of California by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation for coordinated or consolidated pre-trial proceedings. The complaints seek back overtime pay and statutory damages, recovery of improper deductions, interest, and
attorneys’ fees. In December 2007 plaintiffs moved to certify the class. The motion is pending.

21.    COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND LITIGATION AND
REGULATORY MATTERS

(continued)

Summary

The Company’s litigation and regulatory matters are subject to many uncertainties, and given its complexity and scope, their outcome
cannot be predicted. It is possible that results of operations or cash flow of the Company in a particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of pending litigation and regulatory matters
depending, in part, upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period. In light of the unpredictability of the Company’s litigation and regulatory matters, it is also possible that in certain cases an ultimate unfavorable resolution
of one or more pending litigation or regulatory matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. Management believes, however, that, based on information currently known to it, the ultimate outcome of all
pending litigation and regulatory matters, after consideration of applicable reserves and rights to indemnification, is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position.

Notes to Supplemental Combining Financial Information

1.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The supplemental combining financial information presents the consolidated financial position and results of operations for Prudential Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries (together, the “Company”), separately reporting the
Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. The Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business are both fully integrated operations of the Company and are not separate legal entities. The supplemental combining
financial information presents the results of the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business as if they were separate reporting entities and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company has outstanding two classes of common stock. The Common Stock
reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Class B Stock reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business.

The Closed Block Business was established on the date of demutualization and includes the assets and liabilities of the Closed Block (see Note 10 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Closed Block). It also includes assets held outside the Closed Block necessary to meet insurance regulatory capital requirements related to products included within the Closed Block;
deferred policy acquisition costs related to the Closed Block policies; the principal amount of the IHC debt (as discussed below and in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and related unamortized debt issuance costs, as well as an
interest rate swap related to the IHC debt; and certain other related assets and liabilities. The Financial Services Businesses consist of the Insurance, Investment, and International Insurance and Investments divisions and Corporate and Other
operations.

2.    ALLOCATION OF RESULTS

This supplemental combining financial information reflects the assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses directly attributable to the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, as well as allocations deemed reasonable by management in order to fairly present the financial position and results of
operations of the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business on a stand alone basis. While management considers the allocations utilized to be reasonable, management has the discretion to make operational and financial decisions
that may affect the allocation methods and resulting assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of each business. In addition, management has limited discretion over accounting policies and the appropriate allocation of earnings between the two
businesses. The Company is subject to agreements which provide that, in most instances, the Company may not change the allocation methodology or accounting policies for the allocation of earnings between the Financial Services Businesses and Closed
Block Business without the prior consent of the Class B Stock holders or IHC debt bond insurer.

The Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business participate in the Company’s commingled internal short-term cash management facility,
pursuant to which they invest cash from securities lending and repurchase activities as well as certain trading and operating activities. The net funds invested in the facility are generally held in investments that are short term, including
mortgage- and asset-backed securities. As of December 31, 2007, the balance held in this facility was approximately $16.9 billion. A proportionate interest in each security held in the portfolio is allocated to the Financial Services Businesses
and the Closed Block Business based upon their proportional cash contributions to the facility as of the balance sheet date. Participation in the facility by the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business is dependent on cash flows
arising from the activities noted above, which in turn can change the allocation of the facility's assets between the two Businesses. A proportionate share of any realized investment gain or loss is recorded by each Business based upon their
respective ownership percentages in the facility as of the date of the realized gain or loss. Beginning in the quarter ended September 30, 2007, management determined to seek to implement changes in the facility in order to permit each Business
to hold discrete ownership of its investments in the facility without affecting or being affected by the level of participation in the facility by the other Business. Pending the implementation of these changes, the facility is being managed so that
the proportionate interests of the Financial



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Supplemental Combining Financial Information


.

ALLOCATION OF RESULTS

(continued)

Services Businesses and Closed Block Business in the entire facility are maintained at approximately the same proportions held as of June 30, 2007
(approximately 49% and 51%, respectively).

General corporate
overhead not directly attributable to a specific business that has been incurred in connection with the generation of the businesses’ revenues is generally allocated between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business based
on the general and administrative expenses of each business as a percentage of the total general and administrative expenses for all businesses.

PHLLC has outstanding IHC debt, of which net proceeds of $1.66 billion were allocated to the Financial Services Businesses concurrent with the
demutualization on December 18, 2001. The IHC debt is serviced by the cash flows of the Closed Block Business, and the results of the Closed Block Business reflect interest expense associated with the IHC debt.

Income taxes are allocated between the Financial Services Businesses and the
Closed Block Business as if they were separate companies based on the taxable income or losses and other tax characterizations of each business. If a business generates benefits, such as net operating losses, it is entitled to record such tax
benefits to the extent they are expected to be utilized on a consolidated basis.

Holders of Common Stock have no interest in a separate legal entity representing the Financial Services Businesses; holders of the Class B Stock have no interest in a separate legal entity representing the Closed
Block Business; and holders of each class of common stock are subject to all of the risks associated with an investment in the Company.

In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, holders of Common Stock and holders of Class B Stock would be entitled to receive
a proportionate share of the net assets of the Company that remain after paying all liabilities and the liquidation preferences of any preferred stock.

The results of the Financial Services Businesses are subject to certain risks pertaining to the Closed Block. These include any expenses and liabilities
from litigation affecting the Closed Block policies as well as the consequences of certain potential adverse tax determinations. In connection with the sale of the Class B Stock and IHC debt, the cost of indemnifying the investors with respect to
certain matters will be borne by the Financial Services Businesses.

ITEM 11.    EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

Certain of the information called for by this item is hereby incorporated herein by reference to the relevant portions of the Proxy Statement. Additional information called for by this Item is contained under Item 12
below of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



ITEM 12.    SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

The following table provides information as of December 31, 2007, regarding securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans. All
outstanding awards relate to our Common Stock. For additional information about our equity compensation plans see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

(1)

All shares of Common Stock subject to awards under the Prudential Financial, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Omnibus Plan”) may be issued in the form of stock options,
restricted stock and units, and performance shares (as well as stock appreciation rights, long-term incentive payments and other awards provided for under the Omnibus Plan). The Omnibus Plan does not, by its terms, allocate any number of shares to a
particular type of award.

(2)

These performance shares are the target amount awarded, reduced for cancellations and releases to date. The actual number of shares the Compensation Committee will award at the end
of each performance period will range between 50% and 150% of the target for awards granted in 2005 and 2006, and between 0% and 150% of the target for awards granted in 2007, this target based upon a measure of the reported performance of the
Company’s Financial Services Businesses relative to stated goals.

(3)

A maximum of 500,000 shares may be issued under the Prudential Financial Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, all of which have been registered on Form S-8.
Participants in the Plan may receive shares of Common Stock as distributions under the plan upon their termination of service on the Board. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, 13,382, 6,576 and 13,168 shares of Common Stock, respectively, were distributed to
former participants of the Plan upon their retirement from the Board, leaving a balance of 411,824

s

hares of Common Stock available for future distribution. The Company will register additional shares on Form S-8 in the future, if necessary.

(4)

At the Annual Meeting of the Shareholders of the Company held on June 7, 2005, the shareholders approved the Prudential Financial, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (PSPP). The
plan is a qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan under Section 423 of the Code, pursuant to which up to 26,367,235 shares of Common Stock may be issued, all of which have been registered on Form S-8. Under the plan employees may purchase shares
based upon quarterly offering periods at an amount equal to the lesser of (1) 85% of the closing market price of the Common Stock on the first day of the quarterly offering period, or (2) 85% of the closing market price of the Common Stock
on the last day of the quarterly offering period. Share purchases under the plan began in 2007. In 2007 there were 477,400 shares of Common Stock purchased under the plan, leaving 25,889,835 shares of Common Stock available for future distribution.
Shares purchased in 2007 do not include 136,162 shares related to the October 1 to December 31, 2007 offering period, which were purchased in January 2008.

(5)

The equity compensation plan referred to is the 2002 Prudential Financial Stock Purchase Program for Eligible Employees of Prudential Securities Incorporated
Participating in Various Prudential Securities Incorporated Programs, adopted by the Prudential Securities Board of Directors in April 2002 (the “2002 MasterShare Conversion Program”), and for which 12,775,000 shares of restricted Common
Stock were registered on Form S-8 by the Company in May 2002. The 2002 MasterShare Conversion Program provided participants in various



compensation programs sponsored by Prudential Securities the opportunity to exchange restricted property held under such programs for shares of Prudential
Financial restricted Common Stock. Upon the consummation of the Prudential Securities/Wachovia transaction, the 2002 MasterShare Conversion Program was suspended, and the majority of the unissued shares were deregistered under a Post-Effective
Amendment to Form S-8 effective March 28, 2003. In 2003, Prudential Financial also registered additional shares of Common Stock for a new program to be effective in 2003. However, as a result of the transaction, no share exchanges were
permitted, and the entire amount of shares registered under the 2003 program (6,000,000 shares) was also deregistered through a Post-Effective Amendment to Form S-8 on March 28, 2003.

by reference to the relevant portions of the Proxy Statement.

1.    ORGANIZATION AND PRESENTATION

Prudential Financial, Inc. (“Prudential Financial”) was incorporated on December 28, 1999 as a wholly owned subsidiary of The Prudential
Insurance Company of America. On December 18, 2001, The Prudential Insurance Company of America converted from a mutual life insurance company to a stock life insurance company and became an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential
Financial.

The condensed financial statements of Prudential
Financial reflect its wholly owned subsidiaries using the equity method of accounting.

Certain amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

2.    DEBT AND UNDISTRIBUTED DEMUTUALIZATION CONSIDERATION

Debt

A summary of Prudential Financial’s short-and long-term debt is as follows:

(1)

For information on the terms of these notes see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2)

The interest rates on these floating rate notes are based on either LIBOR or the U.S. Consumer Price Index. The interest rates ranged from 2.70% to 5.55% in 2007 and 2.70% to 6.72%
in 2006.

Short-term Debt

The weighted average interest rate on outstanding commercial paper was
approximately 5.32% at both December 31, 2007 and 2006.

The interest rate on the $3.0 billion of convertible senior notes issued in 2007 is a floating rate equal to 3-month LIBOR minus 1.63%, to be reset quarterly and was 3.52% in 2007. The interest rate on the $2.0 billion of convertible senior
notes issued in 2006 is a floating rate equal to 3-month LIBOR minus 2.40%, to be reset quarterly and ranged from 2.73% to 3.30% in 2007 and was 2.95% in 2006. The interest rate on the $2.0 billion of convertible senior notes issued in 2005 is a
floating rate equal to 3-month LIBOR minus 2.76%, to be reset quarterly and ranged from 2.60% to 2.61% in 2007 and 1.57% to 2.65% in 2006. See Convertible Debt Maturities below for additional information on the convertible senior notes.



Long-term Debt (including the Current Portion of Long-term Debt)

In order to modify exposure to interest rate movements, Prudential Financial
utilizes derivative instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt issues. The impact of these derivative instruments are not reflected in the rates presented in the table above. For those derivatives that qualify
for hedge accounting treatment, interest expense was not materially increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 and was increased by $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Convertible Debt Maturities

Prudential Financial’s short-term debt reflected in the
table above includes $2.0 billion of floating rate convertible senior notes issued in 2005 with a maturity date of November 15, 2035, $2.0 billion of floating rate convertible senior notes issued in 2006 with a maturity date of
December 12, 2036 and $3.0 billion of floating rate convertible senior notes issued in 2007 with a maturity date of December 15, 2037.

On April 13, 2007, Prudential Financial announced its intention to call all the outstanding floating rate convertible senior notes issued in 2005 for
redemption on May 21, 2007. Prior to the redemption by the Company, substantially all holders elected to convert their senior notes as provided under their terms. The senior notes required net settlement in shares; therefore, upon conversion,
the holders received cash equal to the par amount of the senior notes surrendered for conversion plus accrued interest and shares of Prudential Financial Common Stock for the portion of the settlement amount in excess of the par amount. The
settlement amount in excess of the par amount was based upon the excess of the closing market price of Prudential Financial Common Stock for a 10-day period defined under the terms of the senior notes, or $100.80 per share, over the initial
conversion price of $90 per share. Accordingly, at conversion the Company issued 2,367,887 shares of Common Stock from treasury. The conversion had no impact on the Company’s results of operations and resulted in a net increase to
shareholders’ equity of $44 million, reflecting the tax benefit associated with the conversion of the senior notes.

The notes issued in 2006 and 2007 are convertible by the holders at any time after issuance into cash and shares of Prudential Financial’s Common
Stock. The conversion prices, $132.39 per share for the 2007 issuance and $104.21 per share for the 2006 issuance, are subject to adjustment upon certain corporate events. The conversion features require net settlement in shares; therefore, upon
conversion, a holder would receive cash equal to the par amount of the convertible notes surrendered for conversion and shares of Prudential Financial Common Stock only for the portion of the settlement amount in excess of the par amount, if any. In
addition, these notes are redeemable by Prudential Financial, at par plus accrued interest, on or after December 13, 2007 for the 2006 issuance and on or after June 16, 2009 for the 2007 issuance. Holders of the notes may also require
Prudential Financial to repurchase the notes, at par plus accrued interest, on contractually specified dates. For the 2006 issuance, the first contractually specified date was December 12, 2007. On December 12, 2007, $117 million of the
2006 senior notes were repurchased by Prudential Financial at the request of the holders. The next date on which holders of the notes may require Prudential Financial to repurchase the notes is December 12, 2008. For the 2007 issuance, the
first contractually specified date is June 15, 2009. For additional information on these convertible notes, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Undistributed Demutualization Consideration

“Other liabilities” include liabilities of $36 million and $95 million as of December 31, 2007, and 2006,
respectively, for undistributed demutualization consideration payable to eligible policyholders whom we have been or were unable to locate as of those dates. In 2007 and 2006, Prudential Financial paid $59 million and $108 million, respectively, in
demutualization consideration to eligible policyholders whom we have located since the time of demutualization and to governmental authorities in respect of other eligible policyholders whom we continue to be unable to locate. We remain obligated to
disburse $36 million of demutualization consideration to the governmental authorities if we are unable to establish contact with eligible policyholders within time periods prescribed by state unclaimed property laws. These laws generally require
remittance after periods ranging from three to seven years.

3.    DIVIDENDS AND RETURNS OF CAPITAL

Dividends and/or returns of capital received by Prudential Financial during the year ended December 31, 2007 amounted to $3.212 billion, including $1.233 billion from Prudential Holdings, LLC, $682 million
collectively from its international insurance and international investments holding companies, $572 million from Prudential Securities Group, Inc., $268 million from Prudential Asset Management Holding Company, $192 million from American Skandia,
and $265 million from other holding companies. Dividends and/or returns of capital received by Prudential Financial during the year ended December 31, 2006 amounted to $3.225 billion, including $2.116 billion from Prudential Holdings, LLC, $383
million collectively from its international insurance and international investments holding companies, $308 million from Prudential Asset Management Holding Company, $245 million from American Skandia, $143 million from Prudential Securities Group,
Inc. and $30 million from other holding companies. Dividends and/or returns of capital received by Prudential Financial during the year ended December 31, 2005 amounted to $2.393 billion, including $1.733 billion from Prudential Holdings, LLC,
$231 million from Prudential Asset Management Holding Company, $175 million from American Skandia and $75 million collectively from its international insurance and international investments holding companies.

4.    GUARANTEES

Prudential Financial has issued a subordinated guarantee covering a
subsidiary’s domestic commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2007, there was $7.1 billion outstanding under this commercial paper program.

Prudential Financial is also subject to other financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements, including those made in the normal course of businesses
guaranteeing the performance of, or representations made by, Prudential Financial subsidiaries. Prudential Financial has provided indemnities and guarantees related to acquisitions, dispositions, investments, debt issuances and other transactions,
including those provided as part of our on-going operations, that are triggered by, among other things, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by us or our subsidiaries. These obligations are typically subject to various time
limitations, defined by the contract or by operation of law, such as statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum potential obligation is subject to contractual limitations, while in other cases such limitations are not specified or
applicable. Since certain of these obligations are not subject to limitations, it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount due under these guarantees. At December 31, 2007, Prudential Financial has accrued liabilities of $3
million associated with all other financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements, which does not include retained liabilities associated with sold businesses.
