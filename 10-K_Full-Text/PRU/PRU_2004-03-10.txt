i


PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

Overview and Demutualization

Prudential
Financial, Inc. is one of the largest financial services institutions in the U.S. Through our subsidiaries and affiliates, we provide a wide range of insurance, investment management and other financial products and services to individual and
institutional customers in the U.S. and over 30 other countries through one of the largest distribution networks in the financial services industry. Our principal executive offices are located in Newark, New Jersey.

On the date of demutualization, Prudential Insurance converted from a mutual
life insurance company owned by its policyholders to a stock life insurance company and became an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial. On that date, eligible policyholders, as defined in the Plan of Reorganization, received
shares of Prudential Financial’s Common Stock or the right to receive cash or policy credits, which are increases in policy values or increases in other policy benefits, upon the extinguishment of all membership interests in Prudential
Insurance.

On the date of demutualization, Prudential
Financial completed an initial public offering of 126.5 million shares of its Common Stock at an initial public offering price of $27.50 per share, including 16.5 million shares issued as a result of the exercise of the over-allotment option granted
to underwriters in the initial public offering. Also on the date of demutualization, Prudential Financial completed the sale, through a private placement, of 2.0 million shares of Class B Stock, a separate class of common stock, at a price of $87.50
per share. The Common Stock reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Class B Stock reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business. Collectively, the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business are
referred to as the “Businesses.” See “—Segregation of the Businesses” below for a discussion of the Businesses. In addition, on the date of demutualization, Prudential Financial and Prudential Financial Capital Trust I, a
statutory business trust, co-issued 13.8 million 6.75% equity security units for gross proceeds of $690 million. Furthermore, Prudential Holdings, LLC (“PHLLC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial that owns the capital stock
of Prudential Insurance, issued $1.75 billion in senior secured notes (the “IHC debt”), a portion of which were insured by a bond insurer. See “—Segregation of the Businesses—Separation of the Financial Services Businesses
and the Closed Block Business” for further discussion of the IHC debt. Concurrent with the demutualization, various subsidiaries of Prudential Insurance were reorganized, becoming direct or indirect subsidiaries of Prudential Financial.

The Plan of Reorganization required us to establish and
operate a regulatory mechanism known as the “Closed Block.” The Closed Block is designed generally to provide for the reasonable expectations of holders of policies included in the Closed Block for future policy dividends after
demutualization by allocating assets that will be used for payment of benefits, including policyholder dividends, on these policies. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Closed Block.

The Plan of Reorganization provided that Prudential Insurance may, with the
prior consent of the New Jersey Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, enter into agreements to transfer to a third party all or any part of the risks under the Closed Block policies. As of December 31, 2003, we have begun to put in place the
reinsurance contracts necessary to transfer a portion of these risks.

Segregation of the Businesses

General

The businesses of Prudential Financial are separated into the Financial
Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. For a discussion of the operating results of the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.” The Financial Services Businesses is comprised of our Insurance division, Investment division, and International Insurance and Investments division as well as our Corporate and Other operations. See “—Financial Services
Businesses” below for a more detailed discussion of the divisions comprising the Financial Services Businesses. The Closed Block Business is comprised of the assets and related liabilities of the Closed Block and other assets and liabilities,
including the IHC debt. See “—Closed Block Business” below for a more detailed discussion of the Closed Block Business.



The following diagram reflects the allocation of Prudential Financial’s consolidated assets and
liabilities between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business:

There is no legal separation of the
two Businesses. The foregoing allocation of assets and liabilities did not and does not require Prudential Financial, Prudential Insurance, any of their subsidiaries, or the Closed Block to transfer any specific assets or liabilities to a new legal
entity. Financial results of the Closed Block Business, including debt service on the IHC debt, will affect Prudential Financial’s consolidated results of operations, financial position and borrowing costs. In addition, any net losses of the
Closed Block Business, and any dividends or distributions on, or repurchases of, the Class B Stock, will reduce the assets of Prudential Financial legally available for dividends on the Common Stock. Accordingly, you should read financial
information for the Financial Services Businesses together with the consolidated financial information of Prudential Financial.

The Common Stock reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Class B Stock reflects the performance of the Closed Block
Business. However, there can be no assurance that the market value of our Common Stock will reflect solely the performance of the Financial Services Businesses.

Separation of the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business

In order to separately reflect the financial performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business
since the date of demutualization, we have allocated all our assets and liabilities and earnings between the two Businesses, and we account for them as if they were separate legal entities. All assets and liabilities of Prudential Financial and its
subsidiaries not included in the Closed Block Business constitute the Financial Services Businesses. Assets and liabilities allocated to the Closed Block Business are those that we consider appropriate to operate that business. The Closed Block
Business consists principally of:

•

within Prudential Insurance, the Closed Block Assets, Surplus and Related Assets, deferred policy acquisition costs and other assets and, with respect to liabilities, the Closed
Block Liabilities;

•

within PHLLC, the principal amount of the IHC debt, the related unamortized debt issuance costs and hedging activities, and a guaranteed investment contract; and

•

within Prudential Financial, dividends received from PHLLC, and reinvestment thereof, and other liabilities of Prudential Financial, in each case as attributable to the Closed Block
Business.

The Closed Block Assets consist of (i)
those assets initially allocated to the Closed Block, (ii) cash flows from such assets, (iii) assets resulting from the reinvestment of such cash flows, (iv) cash flows from the Closed Block Policies, and (v) assets resulting from the investment of
cash flows from the Closed Block Policies. The Closed Block Assets include policy loans, accrued interest on any of the foregoing assets and due premiums on the Closed Block Policies. The Closed Block Assets do not include assets relating to a
closed block established for Canadian polices



because these amounts are insignificant. The Closed Block Liabilities are Closed Block Policies and other liabilities of the Closed Block associated with the
Closed Block Assets. The Closed Block Assets and Closed Block Liabilities are supported by additional assets outside the Closed Block that Prudential Insurance needs to hold to meet capital requirements related to the Closed Block Policies (the
“Surplus Assets”), as well as invested assets held outside the Closed Block that represent the difference between the Closed Block Assets and the sum of the Closed Block Liabilities and the interest maintenance reserve (the “Related
Assets” or, together with the Surplus Assets, the “Surplus and Related Assets”). The interest maintenance reserve, recorded only under statutory accounting principles, captures realized capital gains and losses resulting from changes
in the general level of interest rates. These gains and losses are to be amortized into investment income over the expected remaining life of the investments sold.

On the date of demutualization, the majority of the net proceeds from the issuances of the Class B Stock and the IHC debt
was allocated to our Financial Services Businesses. Also, on the date of demutualization, PHLLC distributed $1,218 million of the net proceeds of the IHC debt to Prudential Financial to use for general corporate purposes in the Financial Services
Businesses. PHLLC deposited $437 million of the net proceeds of the IHC debt in a debt service coverage account maintained in the Financial Services Businesses which, together with reinvested earnings thereon, constitutes a source of payment and
security for the IHC debt. The remainder of the net proceeds, or $72 million, was used to purchase a guaranteed investment contract to fund a portion of the bond insurance related to the IHC debt. To the extent we use the debt service coverage
account to service payments with respect to the IHC debt or to pay dividends to Prudential Financial for purposes of the Closed Block Business, a loan from the Financial Services Businesses to the Closed Block Business would be established. Such
inter-business loan would be repaid by the Closed Block Business to the Financial Services Businesses when earnings from the Closed Block Business replenish funds in the debt service coverage account to a specified level.

We believe that the proceeds from the issuances of the Class B Stock and IHC
debt allocated to the Financial Services Businesses reflected capital in excess of that necessary to support the Closed Block Business and that the Closed Block Business as established has sufficient assets and cash flows to service the IHC debt.
The investors in the Class B Stock and the bond insurer agreed to this allocation and usage of issuance proceeds. The Closed Block Business was financially leveraged through the issuance of the IHC debt, and dividends on the Class B Stock are
subject to prior servicing of the IHC debt. It is expected that any inter-business loan referred to above will be repaid in full out of the Surplus and Related Assets, but not the Closed Block Assets. Any such loan will be subordinate to the IHC
debt.

The Financial Services Businesses will bear any expenses
and liabilities from litigation affecting the Closed Block Policies and, as discussed below, the consequences of certain potential adverse tax determinations. In connection with the sale of the Class B Stock and IHC debt, we have agreed to indemnify
the investors therein with respect to certain matters, and such indemnification will be borne by the Financial Services Businesses.

Within the Closed Block Business, the assets and cash flows attributable to the Closed Block inure solely to the benefit of the Closed Block policyholders
through policyholder dividends after payment of benefits, expenses and taxes. The Surplus and Related Assets inure to the benefit of the holders of Class B Stock. The earnings on, and distribution of, the Surplus and Related Assets over time will be
the source or measure of payment of the interest and principal of the IHC debt and of dividends on the Class B Stock. The earnings of the Closed Block are reported as part of the Closed Block Business, although no cash flows or assets of the Closed
Block inure to the benefit of the holders of Common Stock or Class B Stock. The Closed Block Assets are not available to service interest and principal of the IHC debt or dividends on the Class B Stock.

Inter-Business Transfers and Allocation Policies

Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors has adopted certain policies
with respect to inter-business transfers and accounting and tax matters, including the allocation of earnings. Such policies are summarized below. In the future, the Board of Directors may modify, rescind or add to any of these policies. However,
the decision of the Board of Directors to modify, rescind or add to any of these policies is subject to the Board of Directors’ general fiduciary duties. In addition, we have agreed with the investors in the Class B Stock and the insurer of the
IHC debt that, in most instances, the Board of Directors may not change these policies without their consent.



Inter-Business Transactions and Transfers

The transactions permitted between the Financial Services Businesses and the
Closed Block Business, subject to any required regulatory approvals and the contractual limitations noted above, include the following:

•

The Closed Block Business may lend to the Financial Services Businesses, and the Financial Services Businesses may lend to the Closed Block Business, in either case on terms no less
favorable to the Closed Block Business than comparable internal loans and only for cash management purposes in the ordinary course of business and on market terms pursuant to our internal short-term cash management facility.

•

Other transactions between the Closed Block and businesses outside of the Closed Block, including the Financial Services Businesses, are permitted if, among other things, such
transactions benefit the Closed Block, are at fair market value and do not exceed, in any calendar year, a specified formulaic amount.

•

Capital contributions to Prudential Insurance may be for the benefit of either the Financial Services Businesses or the Closed Block Business and assets of the Financial Services
Businesses within Prudential Insurance may be transferred to the Closed Block Business within Prudential Insurance in the form of a loan which is subordinated to all existing obligations of the Closed Block Business on market terms.

•

An inter-business loan from the Financial Services Businesses to the Closed Block Business may be established to reflect usage of the net proceeds of the IHC debt initially
deposited in the debt service coverage account, and any reinvested earnings thereon, to pay debt service on the IHC debt or dividends to Prudential Financial for purposes of the Closed Block Business.

•

In addition to the foregoing, the Financial Services Businesses may lend to the Closed Block Business, on either a subordinated or non-subordinated basis, on market terms as may be
approved by Prudential Financial.

•

The Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business may engage in such other transactions on market terms as may be approved by Prudential Financial and, if applicable,
Prudential Insurance.

•

The Board of Directors has discretion to transfer assets of the Financial Services Businesses to the Closed Block, or use such assets for the benefit of Closed Block policyholders,
if it believes such transfer or usage is in the best interests of the Financial Services Businesses, and such transfer or usage may be made without requiring any repayment of the amounts transferred or used or the payment of any other consideration
from the Closed Block Business.

•

Cash payments for administrative purposes from the Closed Block Business to the Financial Services Businesses are based on formulas that initially approximated the actual expenses
incurred by the Financial Services Businesses to provide such services based on insurance and policies in force and statutory cash premiums. Administrative expenses recorded by the Closed Block Business, and the related income tax effect, are based
upon actual expenses incurred under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) utilizing the Company’s methodology for the allocation of such expenses. Any difference in the cash amount transferred and actual expenses incurred
as reported under GAAP will be recorded, on an after-tax basis at the applicable current rate, as direct adjustments to the respective equity balances of the Closed Block Business and the Financial Services Businesses, without the issuance of shares
of either Business to the other Business. This direct equity adjustment modifies earnings available to each class of common stock for earnings per share purposes. Internal investment expenses recorded and paid by the Closed Block Business, and the
related income tax effect, are based upon actual expenses incurred under GAAP and in accordance with internal arrangements governing record keeping, bank fees, accounting and reporting, asset allocation, investment policy and planning and analysis.

Accounting Policies

Accounting policies relating to the allocation of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses between the two Businesses include:

•

All our assets, liabilities, equity and earnings are allocated between the two Businesses and accounted for as if the Businesses were separate legal entities. Assets and liabilities
allocated to the Closed Block Business are those that we consider appropriate to operate that business. All remaining assets and liabilities of Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries constitute the Financial Services Businesses.

•

For financial reporting purposes, revenues; administrative, overhead and investment expenses; taxes other than federal income taxes; and certain commissions and
commission-related expenses associated with the Closed Block Business are allocated between the Closed Block Business and the Financial Services Businesses in



accordance with GAAP. Interest expense and routine maintenance and administrative costs generated by the IHC debt are considered directly attributable to the
Closed Block Business and are therefore allocated to the Closed Block Business except as indicated below.

•

Any transfers of funds between the Closed Block Business and the Financial Services Businesses will typically be accounted for as either reimbursement of expense, investment income,
return of principal or a subordinated loan, except as contemplated under “—Inter-Business Transactions and Transfers” above.

•

The Financial Services Businesses will bear any expenses and liabilities from litigation affecting the Closed Block Policies and the consequences of certain potential adverse tax
determinations noted below. In connection with the sale of the Class B Stock and IHC debt, we have agreed to indemnify the investors with respect to certain matters, and such indemnification will be borne by the Financial Services Businesses.

Tax Allocation and Tax Treatment

The Closed Block Business within each legal entity is
treated as if it were a consolidated subsidiary of Prudential Financial. Accordingly, if the Closed Block Business has taxable income, it recognizes its share of income tax as if it were a consolidated subsidiary of Prudential Financial. If the
Closed Block Business has losses or credits, it recognizes a current income tax benefit.

If the Closed Block Business within any legal entity has taxable income, it pays its share of income tax in cash to the Financial Services Businesses. If it has losses or credits, it receives its benefit in cash from
the Financial Services Businesses. If the losses or credits cannot be currently utilized in the consolidated federal income tax return of Prudential Financial for the year in which such losses or credits arise, the Closed Block Business will receive
the full benefit in cash, and the Financial Services Businesses will subsequently recover the payment for itself at the time the losses or credits are actually utilized in computing estimated payments or in the consolidated federal income tax return
of Prudential Financial. Certain tax costs and benefits are determined under the Plan of Reorganization with respect to the Closed Block using statutory accounting rules that may give rise to tax costs or tax benefits prior to the time that those
costs or benefits are actually realized for tax purposes. If at any time the Closed Block Business is allocated any such tax cost or a tax benefit under the Plan of Reorganization that is not realized at that same time under the relevant tax rules
but will be realized in the future, the Closed Block Business will pay such tax cost or receive such tax benefit at that time, but it shall be paid to or paid by the Financial Services Businesses. When such tax cost or tax benefit is subsequently
realized under the relevant tax rules, the tax cost or tax benefit shall be allocated to the Financial Services Businesses. The foregoing principles will be applied so as to prevent any item of income, deduction, gain, loss, credit, tax cost or tax
benefit being taken into account more than once by the Closed Block Business (including the Closed Block) or the Financial Services Businesses. For this purpose, items determined under the Plan of Reorganization with respect to any period prior to
the date of demutualization (“Pre-Closing Tax Attributes”) shall be taken into account with any such Pre-Closing Tax Attributes relating to the Closed Block being attributed to the Closed Block Business and all other Pre-Closing Tax
Attributes being attributed to the Financial Services Businesses. The Closed Block Business will also pay or receive its appropriate share of tax or interest resulting from adjustments attributable to the settlement of tax controversies or the
filing of amended tax returns to the extent such tax or interest relates to controversies or amended returns arising with respect to the Closed Block Business and attributable to tax periods after the date of demutualization, except to the extent
that such tax is directly attributable to the characterization of the IHC debt for tax purposes, in which case the tax shall be borne by the Financial Services Businesses. In particular (and without limitation of the foregoing) if a change of tax
law after the date of demutualization, including any change in the interpretation of any tax law, results in the recharacterization of all or part of the IHC debt for tax purposes or a significant reduction in the income tax benefit associated with
the interest expense on all or part of the IHC debt, the Financial Services Businesses will continue to pay the foregone income tax benefit to the Closed Block Business until the IHC debt has been repaid or PHLLC has been released from its
obligations to the bond insurer and under the IHC debt as if such recharacterization or reduction of actual benefit had not occurred.

Financial Services Businesses

The Financial Services Businesses is comprised of three divisions, containing eight segments, and our Corporate and Other operations. The Insurance
division is comprised of our Individual Life and Annuities segment and our Group Insurance segment. The Investment division is comprised of the Investment Management, Financial Advisory, Retirement and Other Asset Management segments. The
International Insurance and Investments division is comprised of the International Insurance and International Investments segments.

See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for revenues, income and loss, and total assets by segment of the Financial Services Businesses.



Insurance Division

The Insurance division conducts its business through the Individual Life and Annuities and Group Insurance segments.

Individual Life and Annuities

Our Individual Life and Annuities segment manufactures and distributes
individual variable life, term life, universal life and non-participating whole life insurance, and variable and fixed annuity products, primarily to the U.S. mass affluent market and mass market. In general, we consider households with investable
assets or income in excess of $100,000 as mass affluent. Our life products are distributed primarily through Prudential Agents and increasingly through third parties. Our annuity products are distributed through a diverse group of independent
financial planners, broker-dealers and banks as well as through Prudential Agents.

On May 1, 2003, we acquired Skandia U.S. Inc. (“Skandia U.S.”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Skandia Insurance Company Ltd. (“Skandia”), for a total purchase price of $1.184 billion. Beginning May
1, 2003, 100% of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the results of operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements. The annuity operations of Skandia U.S. are included as a component of our individual annuity
business discussed below. Our acquisition of Skandia U.S. included American Skandia, Inc. (“American Skandia”). American Skandia, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, is one of the largest distributors of variable annuities through
independent financial planners in the U. S. American Skandia also operates a mutual fund business, the results of which are included within the Investment Management segment. The acquisition significantly expanded and diversified our third party
distribution capabilities in the U.S. and broadened our array of product offerings.

Skandia has agreed to indemnify us for certain losses, including losses resulting from litigation or regulatory matters relating to events prior to closing the transaction and brought within four years, subject to an
aggregate cap of $1 billion. Under the terms of a License Agreement, we will have the right to use the “American Skandia” name in conjunction with our own name in the U.S. in the annuity business for five years and in the mutual fund
business for two years. Skandia has agreed not to compete with us in the U.S. in the annuity business for five years and in the mutual fund business for two years.

The integration of American Skandia is expected to continue through the first quarter of 2005. Currently, the distribution,
marketing and product development functions as well as many administrative, support, and control functions have been combined with Prudential’s existing annuities business. Key management from both organizations have been retained, and all
major decisions related to the integration have been communicated. In 2004, integration efforts will focus on consolidating systems platforms and operations functions. The integration of American Skandia is proceeding as planned.

Products

Variable Life Insurance

We offer a number of individual variable life insurance products that provide a return linked to an underlying investment portfolio designated by the
policyholder while providing the policyholder with the flexibility to change both the death benefit and premium payments. Each product provides for the deduction of charges and expenses from the customer’s investment account. We also offer
variable life products targeted to the estate planning and corporate-owned life insurance markets.

Term Life Insurance

We offer a variety of term life insurance products. Most term products include a conversion feature that allows the policyholder to convert the policy
into permanent life insurance coverage. We most recently repriced our term insurance portfolio in June 2003.

Universal Life Insurance

We offer universal life insurance products that feature a market rate fixed interest investment account and flexible premiums. In June 2003, we updated
our universal life insurance products and began to offer survivorship universal life, which covers two individuals on a single policy and provides for payment of a death benefit upon the death of the second insured individual.



Non-participating Whole Life Insurance

We offer a non-participating whole life insurance product with guaranteed
fixed level premiums and guaranteed cash values.

Variable
and Fixed Annuities

We offer variable annuities that
provide our customers with the opportunity to invest in proprietary and non-proprietary mutual funds and fixed-rate options. The investments made by customers in the proprietary and non-proprietary mutual funds represent separate accounts for which
the contractholder bears the investment risk. The investments made in the fixed rate options are credited with interest at rates determined by us, subject to certain minimums. Additionally, our variable annuities products offer certain minimum death
benefit and living benefit guarantee options. We also offer fixed annuities that provide a guarantee of principal and a guaranteed interest rate to be credited to the principal amount for a specified period of time.

Marketing and Distribution

Prudential Agents

Our Prudential Agents distribute variable, term, universal and
non-participating whole life insurance, variable and fixed annuities, and investment and protection products with proprietary and non-proprietary investment options as well as selected insurance products manufactured by others.

The following table sets forth the number of Prudential Agents, field
managers, home office and field staff and field offices as of the dates indicated:

Prudential Agents
historically have sold life insurance products primarily to customers in households with income ranging from about $20,000 to $80,000 per year. More recently, Prudential Agents have increasingly targeted mass affluent individuals as well as small
business owners.

The majority of Prudential Agents are
multi-line traditional agents. Other than certain training allowances or salary paid at the beginning of their employment, we pay Prudential Agents on a commission basis for the products they sell. In addition to commissions, Prudential Agents
receive the employee benefits that we provide to other Prudential employees generally, including medical and disability insurance, an employee savings program and qualified retirement plans.

Historically, the Individual Life and Annuities segment has been compensated
for property and casualty insurance products sold through its distribution network. Following the sale of the property and casualty insurance operations, Prudential Agents will have continued access to non-proprietary property and casualty products
under distribution agreements entered into with the purchasers of these businesses; therefore, the Individual Life and Annuities segment will continue to be compensated for sales of these products, although the extent of these revenues cannot be
predicted.

Third Party Distribution

Our individual life and annuity products are offered through a variety of
third party channels, including independent brokers, general agencies, producer groups, banks and broker-dealers. Our third party distribution capabilities in the U.S. were significantly expanded when we acquired American Skandia. We have
historically focused on serving the intermediaries who provide insurance solutions in support of estate and wealth transfer planning for affluent individuals and corporate-owned life insurance for businesses. However, we have expanded our target
market to include mass affluent individuals in addition to affluent individuals. The life insurance products offered are generally the same as those available through Prudential Agents. The annuity products offered via the third party channels
include both Prudential and American Skandia branded products. We do not currently sell American Skandia branded products through Prudential Agents. Our third party efforts are supported by a network of internal and external wholesalers.



Underwriting and Pricing

Life Insurance

Our life insurance underwriters follow detailed and uniform policies and procedures to assess and quantify the risk of our individual life insurance
products. We require the applicant to take a variety of underwriting tests, such as medical examinations, electrocardiograms, blood tests, urine tests, chest x-rays and consumer investigative reports, depending on the age of the applicant and the
amount of insurance requested. Our universal life insurance contracts and the fixed component of our variable life insurance contracts feature crediting rates, which are periodically reset. In resetting these rates, we consider the returns on our
portfolios supporting the interest-sensitive life insurance business, current interest rates, the competitive environment, and our profit objectives.

Annuities

We earn investment management fees based upon the average assets of the mutual funds in our variable annuity products and mortality and expense fees and
other fees for various insurance-related options and features based on average daily net asset value of the annuity separate accounts or the amount of guaranteed value. We price our fixed annuities as well as the fixed-rate options of our variable
annuities based on assumptions as to investment returns, expenses and persistency. Competition also influences our pricing. We seek to maintain a spread between the return on our general account invested assets and the interest we credit on our
fixed annuities. To encourage persistency, most of our variable and fixed annuities have withdrawal restrictions and declining surrender or withdrawal charges for a specified number of years.

Reserves

We establish reserve and policyholder fund liabilities to recognize our future benefit obligations for our in force life and
annuity policies. For variable and interest-sensitive life insurance and annuity contracts, we establish policyholders’ account balances that represent cumulative gross premium payments plus credited interest and/or fund performance, less
withdrawals, expenses and mortality charges.

Reinsurance

Since 2000, we have reinsured the majority of the
mortality risk we assume under our newly sold individual life insurance policies. The maximum amount of individual life insurance we may retain on any life is $30 million under an individual policy and $50 million under a second-to-die life policy.

Group Insurance

Our Group Insurance segment manufactures and distributes a full range of
group life, long-term and short-term group disability, long-term care, and corporate- and trust-owned life insurance in the U.S. to institutional clients primarily for use in connection with employee and membership benefits plans. Group Insurance
also sells accidental death and dismemberment and other ancillary coverages and provides plan administrative services in connection with its insurance coverages.

Products

Group Life Insurance

We offer group life insurance products including basic, supplemental or optional dependent term and universal life insurance. We also offer group variable
universal life insurance and supplemental and voluntary accidental death and dismemberment insurance. Many of our employee-pay coverages include a portability feature, allowing employees to retain their coverage when they change employers or retire.
We also offer a living benefits option that allows insureds that are diagnosed with a terminal illness to receive up to 50% of their life insurance benefit upon diagnosis, in advance of death, to use as needed.



Group Disability Insurance

We offer short- and long-term group disability insurance, which protects against loss of wages due to illness or injury.
Short-term disability generally provides coverage for three to six months, and long-term disability covers the period after short-term disability ends. We also offer absence management and integrated disability management services in conjunction
with a third party.

Other

We offer individual and group long-term care insurance and group corporate-
and trust-owned life insurance. Long-term care insurance protects the insured from the costs of care in the community, at an adult day care center, a nursing home or similar live-in care situation or at home by providing a home health or a personal
care aide. Group corporate- and trust-owned life insurance are group variable life insurance contracts typically used by large corporations to fund benefit plans for retired employees. These latter products also may be used as vehicles to deliver
deferred compensation or non-qualified benefits to active employees.

Marketing and Distribution

Group
Insurance has its own dedicated sales force that is organized around products and market segments and distributes primarily through employee benefits brokers and consultants. Group Insurance also distributes individual long-term care products
through Prudential Agents as well as third party brokers and agents.

Underwriting and Pricing

Group
Insurance’s product underwriting and pricing is centralized. We have developed standard rating systems for each product line based on our past experience and relevant industry experience. We are not obligated to accept any application for a
policy or group of policies from any distributor. We follow uniform underwriting practices and procedures. If the coverage amount exceeds certain prescribed age and amount limits, we may require a prospective insured to submit to medical
examinations.

We determine premiums on some of our policies on
a retrospective experience rated basis, in which case the policyholder bears some of the risk associated with claim experience fluctuations during the policy period. We base product pricing of group insurance products on the expected pay-out of
benefits that we calculate using assumptions for mortality, morbidity, interest, expenses and persistency, depending upon the specific product features.

Our other policies are not eligible to receive experience based refunds. The adequacy of our initial pricing of these policies determines their
profitability. Long-term disability, in particular, involves a commitment to insure disability that continues typically up until a person reaches normal retirement age and, accordingly, contains the risk that loss experience is affected by
circumstances we did not expect when we issued a policy and exceeds pricing assumptions. In addition, the trend towards multiple year rate guarantees for new policies, which are typically three years for life insurance and two years for disability
insurance, further increases the adverse consequences of mispricing coverage and lengthens the time it takes to reduce loss ratios.

We have refocused group life and disability on improved risk selection and reduced benefits ratios. We continuously make pricing adjustments, when
contractually permitted, which consider the emerging experience on our group insurance products. While there can be no assurance, we expect these actions, as well as pricing discipline in writing new business, will allow us to maintain or improve
our benefits ratios.

Reserves

We establish and carry as liabilities actuarially determined reserves that
we believe will meet our future obligations. We base these reserves on actuarially recognized methods using prescribed morbidity and mortality tables in general use in the U.S., which we modify to reflect our actual experience when appropriate.
Reserves also include claims reported but not yet paid, claims incurred but not reported and claims in the process of settlement.

Reinsurance

We reinsure portions of our disability insurance risks with third party reinsurers. Effective July 1, 2003, we terminated our catastrophic reinsurance
coverage on our group life and accidental death and dismemberment products, based on an evaluation of its cost effectiveness given its current pricing.



Investment Division

The Investment division conducts its business through the Investment Management, Financial Advisory, Retirement, and Other
Asset Management segments.

Investment Management

The Investment Management segment provides a broad array of investment
management and advisory services, mutual funds and other structured products. These products and services are marketed and provided to the public and private marketplace as well as the Insurance division, the International Insurance and Investments
division, and the Retirement segment.

Investment Management and Advisory
Services Operating Data

The following tables set
forth Investment Management and Advisory Services assets under management at fair market value by asset class and source as of the dates indicated.

(1)

Consists of individual mutual funds and both variable annuities and variable life insurance in our separate accounts. Fixed annuities and the fixed-rate option of both variable
annuities and variable life insurance are included in our general account.

(2)

Includes private fixed income assets of institutional customers of $6.3 billion as of December 31, 2003, $4.9 billion as of December 31, 2002, and $4.1 billion as of December 31,
2001, and private fixed income assets in our general account of $47.3 billion, $47.1 billion, and $45.1 billion, as of those dates, respectively. Included in these private fixed income assets are commercial and agricultural mortgages for
institutional customers of $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2003, $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2002 and $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2001 and commercial and agricultural mortgages for our general account of $17.2 billion, $17.5 billion and
$16.9 billion, as of those dates, respectively.

(3)

Reflects reclassification of amounts by client category as of January 1, 2002, based on internal management criteria, which reduced the amount attributed to retail customers by $3.3
billion and increased the amounts attributable to institutional customers and the general account by $2.8 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively.

Most of the retail customer assets reflected in the foregoing tables are invested in our mutual funds and our variable annuities and variable life
insurance products. These retail assets under management are gathered by the Insurance division, the International Insurance and Investments division and third party networks, including financial advisors associated with our joint venture with
Wachovia Corporation (“Wachovia”) discussed under “—Financial Advisory “ below.



In addition, we provide investment management services for our institutional customers through direct
sales. As described below, within this segment we utilize the same investment management capabilities to provide asset management and services for institutional customers and our retail customers’ assets. We also provide investment management
services for our general account as described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Realized Investments Gains and General Account Investments—General Account
Investments.”

Mutual Fund Operating Data

The following table sets forth our mutual fund products, including wrap-fee
and unit investment trust products, at fair market value as of the dates indicated. We no longer sponsor unit investment trusts and transferred sponsorship of existing trusts to a successor sponsor as of January 1, 2004.

(1)

Mutual funds includes those sold as retail investment products. Also includes balances from funds for which we act as sub-adviser of $3.2 billion, $2.4 billion and $1.5 billion as
of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

(2)

Wrap-fee product assets include $3.4 billion, $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion of proprietary assets as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Since the 1990s, there has been an industry trend for products such as mutual
funds to include investment alternatives that are managed by asset managers other than the product sponsor. Over the last several years, we have been building investment management choice into most of our mutual fund products. We are able to offer
customers investment alternatives in some of our products that may be advised by third parties with asset management styles that we may or may not offer.

Investment Management and Advisory Services Products and Services

Public Equity and Fixed Income Asset Management

Our public equity and fixed income organizations provide discretionary and non-discretionary asset management services to a wide range of clients. We
manage a broad array of publicly traded equity and debt asset classes using various investment styles. In 2000, substantially all of our active public equity asset management capabilities were consolidated into our wholly owned subsidiary, Jennison
Associates, LLC (“Jennison”). Jennison is a widely recognized manager of institutional assets and is a leading sub-advisor for mutual fund assets.

Real Estate Asset Management

Our real estate organization provides asset management services for single-client and commingled real estate portfolios and manufactures and manages a
variety of real estate investment vehicles, primarily for institutional clients. Our real estate investment vehicles range from fully diversified funds to specialized funds that invest in specific types of properties or specific geographic regions
or follow other specific investment strategies.

On December
31, 2002, we acquired TMW Immobilien AG and TMW Real Estate Group, LLC (together “TMW”), one of the largest independent investment managers for international real estate with $3.9 billion in net assets under management. TMW is
headquartered in Munich, Germany and Atlanta, GA, with offices throughout Europe, and has been integrated with the rest of our institutional real estate management activities.

Private Equity and Fixed Income Asset Management

Our private fixed income organization provides asset management services to our clients by investing predominantly in
private placement investment grade debt securities, as well as below investment grade debt securities, and mezzanine debt financing. These investment capabilities are utilized by our general account and institutional clients through direct advisory
accounts, separate accounts, or private fund structures. A majority of the private placement investments are directly originated by our investment staff.



At the end of 2001, we decided to exit our private equity asset management business through divestiture
and rationalization of the remaining activities into our private fixed income asset management business. The remaining assets we manage, primarily for our general account, include venture capital, leveraged buyouts, development capital, mezzanine
debt and certain special situations, but we do not intend to sponsor new funds other than for mezzanine debt.

Commercial Mortgage Origination and Servicing

Our commercial mortgage banking business provides mortgage origination and servicing, for our general account, institutional clients, and for government
sponsored entities such as Fannie Mae and FHA. Commercial mortgage loans for securitization transactions are included in the Other Asset Management segment, as described below under “—Other Asset Management—Commercial Mortgage
Securitization.”

Mutual Funds Products and Services

We manufacture, distribute and service investment
management products utilizing proprietary and non-proprietary asset management expertise in the U.S. retail market. Our products are designed to be sold by Prudential Agents and third party financial professionals. We offer a family of retail
investment products consisting of 87 mutual funds and four wrap-fee products as of December 31, 2003. These products cover a wide array of investment styles and objectives designed to attract and retain assets of individuals with varying objectives
and to accommodate investors’ changing financial needs. On May 1, 2003, we acquired Skandia U.S. which included a mutual fund business. The operations of the acquired mutual fund business have been combined with our existing mutual fund
business.

The following table sets forth the net sales
(redemptions) of our retail mutual funds, which include funds that we manage in third party products (“sub-advised funds”), by asset class for the periods indicated. Net sales (redemptions) are equal to gross sales minus redemptions. This
data excludes mutual funds sold through defined contribution plan products. Commencing in November 2003, our joint venture with Wachovia ceased offering several Prudential money market funds as investment options, which is the primary driver of the
decline in money market assets from December 31, 2002 to December 31, 2003, reflected in the table below.

(1)

Includes net sales from sub-advised funds of $144 million, $1,332 million and $1,187 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The following table sets forth our retail mutual fund assets, including
sub-advised funds, under management by asset class at fair market value as of the dates indicated.

Wrap-Fee Products

We offer several wrap-fee products that provide access to
mutual funds and separate account products with the payment of fees based on the market value of assets under management. Our wrap-fee products have higher minimum investment levels than our mutual funds and offer a choice of both proprietary and
non-proprietary investment management. We also provide private label wrap-fee products for other financial services firms. Net sales of our wrap-fee products were $0.9 billion in 2003, $0.4 billion in 2002 and $1.4 billion in 2001.



Marketing and Distribution

Investment Management and Advisory Services

We provide asset management services across a broad array of asset classes to certain segments of the Financial Services
Businesses. We obtain third party retail clients through our mutual fund business, discussed below. We generally distribute to third party institutional clients through our proprietary sales force.

Mutual Funds

We distribute our mutual fund products through Prudential Agents and through
third party financial intermediaries, including financial advisors associated with our joint venture with Wachovia discussed under “—Financial Advisory” below. Third party intermediary sales represents the fastest growing sales
channel on a net basis. Additionally, we work with third party product manufacturers and distributors to include our investment options in their products and platforms.

Our product offerings are positioned to help financial professionals provide investment advice that helps their clients grow
and protect their wealth. We provide these professionals with access to proprietary and non-proprietary investment alternatives along with tools and education to support their role as advisor. We call this strategy “advised choice” and
believe it helps meet the desire of advisors and their clients to have access to choice of products and asset managers within the context of the consultative process.

Financial Advisory

The Financial Advisory segment consists of our 38% investment in Wachovia Securities and our equity sales, trading and research operations.

Wachovia Securities

On July 1, 2003, we completed the previously announced agreement with
Wachovia to combine each company’s respective retail securities brokerage and clearing operations into a joint venture, Wachovia Securities Financial Holdings, LLC (“Wachovia Securities”), creating one of the nation’s largest
retail brokerage and clearing organizations. We have a 38% ownership interest in the joint venture, while Wachovia owns the remaining 62%. We account for our 38% ownership of the joint venture under the equity method of accounting and, beginning on
July 1, 2003, report earnings from the joint venture on the equity basis. Periods prior to July 1, 2003 reflect the results of our previously wholly owned securities brokerage and clearing operations on a fully consolidated basis.

Wachovia Securities provides full service securities brokerage
and financial advisory services to individuals and businesses. As of December 31, 2003, it had total client assets of $603.1 billion and approximately 11,500 registered representatives.

The segment results reflect transition costs, including transition costs incurred by the joint venture, in connection with
the combination as well as expenses relating to obligations retained in connection with the contributed businesses, primarily retained litigation and regulatory matters. We and Wachovia have each agreed to indemnify the other for certain losses,
including losses resulting from litigation or regulatory matters relating to events prior to March 31, 2004, arising from the operations of the respective contributed businesses.

At any time after July 1, 2005 and on or prior to July 1, 2008, we may, subject to certain limitations, put our interests in
the new organization to Wachovia for a price generally equal to our initial $1.0 billion equity contribution plus our share of transition costs, as adjusted to reflect additional investments made by us. At any time after July 1, 2008, we may,
subject to certain limitations, put our interests in the new organization to Wachovia for a price generally equal to our share of the then appraised value of the common equity of the organization, determined as if it were a public company and
including a control premium such as would apply in the case of a sale of 100% of its common equity. The agreement between Prudential Financial and Wachovia also gives us put rights, and Wachovia call rights, in certain other specified circumstances,
at prices determined in accordance with the agreement.



Equity Sales, Trading and Research Operations

We engage in equity securities sales and trading primarily for our
institutional clients, executing transactions on both an agency and a principal basis in listed and NASDAQ equities and equity options. We make a market in more than 900 NASDAQ securities.

Our research analysts produce reports and studies on the economy; the
domestic equity markets, industries and specific companies; investment and portfolio strategies; and regulatory, political, legislative and tax issues. We seek to focus our research coverage on companies of greatest interest to our clients, located
both in the U.S. and abroad.

Retirement

Our Retirement segment manufactures and distributes products and provides
administrative services for qualified and non-qualified retirement plans for companies of all sizes. We offer products across the defined contribution market including the 401(a), 401(k), 403(b), 457 and Taft-Hartley markets. We also offer products
in the non-qualified retirement market. Additionally, we offer guaranteed products such as guaranteed investment contracts (“GICs”), funding agreements and group annuities for defined contribution plans, defined benefit pension plans,
structured settlements and non-qualified entities.

On November
17, 2003, we announced that we had entered into a definitive Stock Purchase and Asset Transfer Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with CIGNA Corporation (“CIGNA”) and certain of its affiliates, pursuant to which we will
acquire CIGNA’s retirement business. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, we will purchase all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of CIGNA Life Insurance Company, a life insurance company domiciled in the State of Connecticut
(“CIGNA Life”), Global Portfolio Strategies, Inc., a registered investment adviser, and CIGNA Financial Services, Inc., a registered broker dealer. In addition, CIGNA’s thrift subsidiary, CIGNA Bank & Trust Company, F.S.B., will
merge into our thrift subsidiary, The Prudential Savings Bank, F.S.B. The total consideration payable in the transaction is a cash purchase price of $2.1 billion, subject to certain adjustments.

Significant portions of the acquisition are being effected through
reinsurance transactions between CIGNA Life and Connecticut General Life Insurance Company (“CGLIC”), a life insurance company domiciled in the State of Connecticut and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CIGNA and other affiliates of
CGLIC. As a result, CGLIC and its affiliates, on the one hand, and CIGNA Life, on the other hand, will each remain liable for the performance of insurance contracts issued by it and subject to such reinsurance transactions. Each has agreed to place
assets in amounts sufficient to support the reinsured general account insurance liabilities into trust accounts to secure their respective obligations under these arrangements. CGLIC and its affiliates will retain the underlying assets relating to
reinsured separate account contracts. Following the closing of the transaction, the parties will ask CGLIC’s customers to agree to novate the existing contracts so that CIGNA Life can assume direct responsibility to the customers for the
contracts issued by CGLIC and reduce the extent of the reinsurance arrangements.

Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, CIGNA will indemnify us for certain losses, including, subject to a basket of $25 million with a $12.5 million deductible and a cap of 75% of the purchase price, for losses
related to breaches by CIGNA of its representations and warranties contained in the Stock Purchase Agreement. We have agreed to indemnify CGLIC and CIGNA after the closing for any breach by CIGNA Life of its contractual obligations under the
reinsurance and other agreements.

The transaction is subject
to various closing conditions, including, among others, state insurance and other regulatory approvals. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2004.

The completion of this transaction will position us as one of the U.S.’s leading providers of retirement products and
services and will increase the Retirement segment’s assets to about $120 billion, based on account values as of the announcement of the transaction. The acquisition will add about $50 billion to our assets under management, and will double both
our defined contribution record keeping operation’s assets, to about $55 billion, and participant base, to about 2 million based on asset values and participant counts as of the announcement of the transaction. The transaction will also bring
additional defined benefit and defined contribution products and services to our total retirement capabilities.

Products and Services

Defined Contribution Products and Services

Our primary defined contribution product, PruArray, offers plan sponsors access to more than 700 mutual funds, approximately 45 of which are sponsored by
Prudential, with the balance sponsored by more than 30 other mutual fund



companies. PruArray also offers stable value investment options. We tailor PruArray to the various defined contribution product markets, as appropriate, and
to suit retirement plans of different sizes. We also offer defined contribution plan services including participant and plan reporting, plan testing, call center services, voice response and Internet capabilities, participant communication and
educational services and record keeping administration.

Guaranteed Investment Contracts and Funding Agreements

We offer general account GICs and funding agreements, through which customers deposit funds with us under contracts that typically provide for a specified rate of interest on the amount invested through the maturity of the contract. We are
obligated to pay principal and interest according to the contracts’ terms. This obligation is backed by our general account assets, and we bear all of the investment and asset/liability management risk on these contracts. As spread products,
general account GICs and funding agreements make a profit to the extent that the rate of return on the investments we make with the invested funds exceeds the promised interest rate and our expenses. We also offer credit-enhanced GICs, which have a
triple-A rating, the highest rating possible, as a result of a guarantee from a financial insurer. In addition, we offer separate account and synthetic GICs, through which we hold customers’ funds either in a separate account or in trust
outside of our general account for the benefit of the customer. We pass all of the investment results through to the customer, subject to a minimum interest rate, and we do not earn spread income. As fee-based products, separate account and
synthetic GICs are less capital intensive and produce lower levels of income than spread products. To the extent that Prudential’s asset management units are selected to manage client assets associated with fee-based products, those units also
earn investment management fees from those relationships. A limited amount of our in force GIC business may be redeemed at the option of the holder prior to the applicable termination dates.

Group Annuities

We offer group annuities primarily to defined benefit plans to provide fixed
lifetime benefits for a specified group of plan participants. These annuities are generally single premium annuities that provide for either immediate or deferred payments. We offer fixed payment annuities backed by our general account (spread
products) as well as separate account annuities (fee products) that permit a plan sponsor to realize the benefit of investment and actuarial results while receiving a general account guarantee of minimum benefits. We also offer fixed and variable
annuities, under group annuity contracts, to individuals taking lump sum distributions from defined contribution plans.

Structured Settlement Products

We offer structured settlement products backed by our general account (spread products), which are customized annuities used to provide ongoing periodic
payments to a claimant in malpractice or personal injury lawsuits instead of a lump sum settlement.

Marketing and Distribution

Defined contribution plans are sold through the financial advisors associated with our joint venture with Wachovia under a distribution agreement, as well as other third party financial advisors, brokers, consultants,
and, to a lesser extent, Prudential Agents. A high concentration of these plans have been in the core and small plan markets, with less than $50 million in plan assets. Our distribution network includes over 100 third party distributors including
brokers, regional broker-dealers and others. In addition, we have a small direct sales force to develop sales among plans with greater than $50 million in plan assets.

Prior to 2003, we primarily sold GICs and funding agreements. In 2003, we broadened our distribution and established our
Funding Agreement Notes Issuance Program through which we sell funding agreements associated with medium-term notes.

Underwriting and Pricing

We set our rates for guaranteed products using a proprietary pricing model that considers the investment environment and our risk, expense and
profitability assumptions. Upon sale of a product, we adjust the duration of our asset portfolio and lock in the prevailing interest rates. Business unit management continuously monitors cash flow experience and works closely with our Asset
Liability and Risk Management Group to review performance and ensure compliance with our investment policy.



Reserves

We establish reserves and policyholder fund liabilities to recognize our future benefit obligations for our products. Our liabilities for our general
account GICs and funding agreements represent cumulative contractholder account balances. Our liabilities for our Group Annuities and other accumulation products are established based on our own actuarial assumptions. We perform a cash flow analysis
in conjunction with determining our reserves for future policy benefits.

Other Asset Management

Our Other Asset
Management segment consists of our commercial mortgage securitization operations, our hedge portfolios and our proprietary investment and syndication activities.

Commercial Mortgage Securitization

We originate and purchase commercial mortgages that we in turn sell through securitization transactions. We also originate interim loans when we expect
the loan will lead to a securitization opportunity. As of December 31, 2003, our warehouse balance of mortgages pending securitization and interim loans totaled approximately $0.9 billion. In general, the assets we securitize are serviced by our
Investment Management segment.

Hedge Portfolios

We offer certain fixed income hedge strategies to clients of our Investment
Management segment, through a number of fund vehicles. We are currently marketing these funds to institutional investors domestically and internationally. Income on our proprietary capital investment in these funds is recognized in the Other Asset
Management segment.

Proprietary Investments and Syndications

We also make proprietary investments in public and
private debt and equity securities, including controlling interests, with the intention to sell or syndicate to investors, including our general account. After sale or syndication, these assets are generally managed by our Investment Management
segment.

Beginning on January 1, 2003, the Other Asset
Management segment includes a portfolio, with a fair value of approximately $360 million, of primarily real estate related investments previously included in Corporate and Other operations. The portfolio consists of certain of the Company’s
co-investment interests in funds, operating companies, and other investment vehicles managed by the Investment Management segment. The Other Asset Management segment will provide substantially all future co-investment in these vehicles.

International Insurance and Investments Division

The International Insurance and Investments division conducts its business
through the International Insurance and International Investments segments.

International Insurance

Our International
Insurance segment manufactures and distributes individual life insurance products to the affluent market in Japan, Korea and other foreign markets through Life Planners. In addition, as part of the operations of Gibraltar Life Insurance Company,
Ltd. (“Gibraltar Life”), we offer similar products to the broad middle income market across Japan through Life Advisors, a business we operate separately from our Life Planners. We commenced sales in foreign markets using the Life Planner
model, as follows: Japan, 1988; Taiwan, 1990; Italy, 1990; Korea, 1991; Brazil, 1998; Argentina, 1999; the Philippines, 1999; and Poland, 2000. We also have a representative office in China.

We run each country operation on a stand-alone basis with local management
and sales teams initially supported by senior International Insurance staff based in Asia and Newark, New Jersey. Each operation has its own marketing, underwriting and claims and investment management functions, with the exception of Japan, for
which a large portion of the investment portfolio is managed by our International Investments segment. Each operation invests predominantly in local currency securities, typically bonds issued by the local government or its agencies. In our larger
operations, we have more diversified portfolios.



The International Insurance segment includes the operations of Gibraltar Life from the acquisition date,
April 2001. Gibraltar Life, formerly Kyoei Life Insurance Company, Ltd., was acquired for a combination of cash and an extension of credit in the form of a subordinated loan in exchange for 100% of Gibraltar’s newly issued common stock.

Products

We currently offer various traditional whole life, term life and endowment
policies, which provide for payment on the earlier of death or maturity. In some of our operations we also offer certain health products with fixed benefits. We also offer variable life products in Japan and Korea and offer interest-sensitive life
products in Japan, Taiwan and Argentina. Generally, our international insurance products are non-participating and denominated in local currency, with the exception of products in Argentina, which are mostly U.S. dollar denominated, and a limited
number of policies in Japan and Korea that are also U.S. dollar denominated. For these dollar denominated products, both premiums and benefits are payable in U.S. dollars.

Marketing and Distribution

The following table sets forth the number of Life Planners and Life Advisors, as well as the number of field managers and agencies for the periods
indicated.

Life Planner Model

Our Life Planner model is significantly different from
the way traditional industry participants offer life insurance in Japan and in most of the other countries where we do business. It is different from the way we market through the Life Advisors of Gibraltar Life as well. We believe that our
selection standards, training, supervision and compensation package are key to the Life Planner model and have helped our International Insurance segment achieve higher rates of agent retention, agent productivity and policy persistency than our
local competitors. In general, we recruit Life Planners with:

•

university degrees, so that the Life Planner will have the same educational background and outlook as the target customer;

•

a minimum of two to three years of sales or sales management experience;

•

no life insurance sales experience; and

•

a pattern of job stability and success.

The Life Planner’s objective is to sell protection-oriented life insurance products on a needs basis to upper middle and upper income customers.

Life Advisors

Our Life Advisors are the proprietary distribution force for products
offered by Gibraltar Life. Their focus is to provide individual protection products to the broad middle income market in Japan, particularly through its



relationships with affinity groups. In July 2001, we introduced a new compensation plan designed to improve productivity and persistency that is similar to
compensation plans in our other International Insurance operations. Life Advisor compensation, which was based on a high fixed salary component in the past, has been changed to a variable compensation structure.

Underwriting and Pricing

Our International Insurance segment is subject to substantial local
regulation that is generally more restrictive for product offerings, pricing and structure than U.S. insurance regulation. Each International Insurance operation has its own underwriting department that employs variations of our domestic practices
in underwriting individual policy risks designed to assess and quantify risks. In setting underwriting limits, we also consider local industry standards to prevent adverse selection and to stay abreast of industry trends. In addition, we set
underwriting limits together with each operation’s reinsurers.

Pricing of individual life insurance products, particularly in Japan and Korea, is more regulated than in the U.S. In Japan, premiums are different for participating and non-participating products, but within each product type they are
generally similar for all companies. The mortality and morbidity rates and interest rates that we use to calculate premiums are restricted by regulation on the basis of product type. The interest rates do not always reflect the market rates we earn
on our investments, and, as a result, we experience negative spreads between the rate we guarantee and the rate we earn on investments. These spreads had a negative impact on the results of our Japanese insurance operations, other than Gibraltar
Life, over the past three years, and the profitability on our products in Japan from these operations results primarily from margins on mortality, morbidity and expense charges.

Reserves

We establish and carry as liabilities actuarially determined reserves, which we believe will meet our future obligations. We base fixed death benefit
reserves on appropriate assumptions for investment yield, persistency, mortality and morbidity rates, expenses and margins for adverse deviation. In Japan, Korea and Argentina, we set reserves for variable and interest-sensitive life products
according to premiums collected plus investment results credited less charges.

Reinsurance

International Insurance
reinsures portions of its insurance risks with both selected third party reinsurers and Prudential Insurance under reinsurance agreements primarily on a yearly renewable term basis. International Insurance also buys catastrophe reinsurance that
covers multiple deaths from a single occurrence in Japan, Taiwan and Brazil and has a coinsurance agreement with Prudential Insurance for U.S. dollar denominated business in Japan. The catastrophe reinsurance market has tightened considerably since
September 11, 2001, resulting in significant increases in premium and additional exclusions from coverage.

International Investments

Our International Investments segment offers private banking, offshore and onshore proprietary and non-proprietary asset management, investment advice and product choice services to high net worth and mass affluent retail clients and to
institutional clients in selected international markets. These services are marketed through our own and third-party distribution networks and encompass the businesses of private wealth management, global derivatives and international investments
that are described in more detail below.

In early 2004, we
acquired an 80 percent stake in Hyundai Investment and Securities Co., Ltd. (“HITC”) and its subsidiary, Hyundai Investment Trust Management Co., Ltd. (“HIMC”) for approximately $300 million pursuant to an agreement with the
Korean Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Korean Financial Supervisory Commission. Under the agreement, we may acquire the remaining 20 percent within three to six years after the closing. HIMC distributes its products primarily through HITC, as
well as third party distributors, and had approximately $12 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2003. As a result of this transaction, Prudential is expected to become the largest foreign-owned asset manager in Korea in terms of
assets under management, according to data as of December 31, 2003 released by the Korean Investment Trust Companies Association.



Our private wealth management business offers local and offshore financial advisory, private banking and
portfolio management services primarily for retail investors. This business leverages personalized relationship management, local expertise, investment discipline and a tailored range of products, including private banking, delivered through our
investment professionals in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, as well as in London, Geneva, Monaco and Amsterdam.

Our global derivatives operations provide advice, sales and trading on a global basis covering a wide variety of commodity, financial and foreign exchange
futures and forward contracts, including agricultural commodities, base and precious metals, major currencies, interest rate and stock indices. We conduct these operations through offices in the U.S., Europe and Asia, and are members of most major
futures exchanges. Our client base is primarily institutional. We conduct futures transactions on margin according to the regulations of the different futures exchanges.

Our international investments business includes manufacturing of proprietary products and distribution of both proprietary
and non-proprietary products, all tailored to meet client needs in targeted countries. In this business, we invest in asset management and distribution businesses in targeted countries around the world to expand our mass affluent customer base
outside the U.S. and to increase our global assets under management. Additionally, this business manages a large portion of the general account investment portfolio of our international insurance operations in Japan.

Corporate and Other Operations

Our Corporate and Other operations include corporate-level activities and
international ventures that we do not allocate to our business segments, as well as the Prudential Real Estate and Relocation Services operations and certain divested and wind-down businesses, except for our discontinued operations.

Corporate-Level Activities

Corporate-level activities consist primarily of corporate-level income and
expenses not allocated to any of our business segments, including costs for company-wide initiatives and income from our qualified pension plans, as well as investment returns on our capital that is not deployed in any of our segments.
Corporate-level activities also include returns from investments that we do not allocate to any of our business segments, including a debt-financed investment portfolio, which was substantially reduced in 2001 and the remainder liquidated in 2002,
and transactions with other segments. Corporate-level activities also include certain obligations relating to policyholders whom we had previously agreed to provide insurance for reduced or no premium in accordance with contractual settlements
related to prior life insurance sales practices remediation.

Residential
Real Estate Brokerage Franchise and Relocation Services

Prudential Real Estate and Relocation Services is our integrated real estate brokerage franchise and relocation services business. The real estate group markets franchises primarily to existing real estate companies. Our franchise
agreements grant the franchisee the right to use the Prudential name and real estate service marks in return for royalty payments on gross commissions generated by the franchisees. The franchises generally are independently owned and operated.

Our relocation group offers institutional clients a variety of
services in connection with the relocation of their employees. These services include coordination of appraisal, inspection and sale of relocating employees’ homes, equity advances to relocating employees, assistance in locating homes at the
relocating employee’s destination, household goods moving services, client cost-tracking and a variety of relocation policy and group move consulting services.

Wind-down Businesses

Individual Health

In 1992, we ceased writing individual disability income policies and a year later ceased writing hospital expense and major medical policies due to
declining sales and poor financial results. Most of our disability income policies are non-cancelable, which means that we can neither change the premium nor cancel the coverage. The 1997 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
guarantees renewal of all hospital and medical expense policies. Under



certain circumstances, we are permitted to change the premiums charged for individual health coverage if we can demonstrate that the premiums have not been
sufficient to pay claims and expenses. As of July 1, 1999, we reinsured all the disability income policies.

Canadian Operations

We have retained and continue to service several blocks of insurance not sold with our divested Canadian businesses described under “—Divested Businesses—Other” below. A significant portion of the retained business
constitutes paid-up individual life insurance.

Divested Businesses

The following operations are businesses that have been or
will be sold or exited that did not qualify for “discontinued operations” accounting treatment under GAAP. We include the results of these divested businesses in our income from continuing operations, but we exclude these results from our
adjusted operating income. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Consolidated Results of Operations” for an explanation of adjusted operating income.

Property and Casualty Insurance

In the fourth quarter of 2003, we sold our property and casualty insurance
companies that operate nationally in

48 states outside of New Jersey, and the District of Columbia, to Liberty Mutual Group (“Liberty Mutual”), as well as our New Jersey property and casualty insurance companies to Palisades Group.
These operations were previously reflected in the results of our former Property and Casualty Insurance segment, which was part of our Insurance division. Historically, the companies we sold manufactured and distributed personal lines property and
casualty insurance products, principally automobile and homeowners coverages, to the U.S. retail market.

We have reinsured Liberty Mutual for certain losses including: any further adverse loss development on the stop-loss reinsurance agreement with Everest Re
Group, Ltd. (“Everest”) discussed below; any adverse loss development on losses occurring prior to the sale that arise from insurance contracts generated through certain ‘discontinued’ distribution channels or due to certain loss
events including mold damage or the California wildfires of October 2003; stop-loss protection on losses occurring after the sale and arising from those same distribution channels of up to $95 million, in excess of related premiums and other
adjustments; and stop-loss protection on losses occurring prior to the sale and arising from most other business for up to 75% of the first $30 million of adverse loss development recorded through October 31, 2005. The reinsurance covering the
losses associated with the discontinued distribution channels will be settled based upon loss experience through December 31, 2008 with a provision that profits on the insurance business from these channels will be shared, with Liberty Mutual
receiving up to $20 million of the first $50 million. As of December 31, 2003, we have recorded a liability of $119 million representing our estimate of our obligations under these reinsurance contracts.

The Company has agreed not to compete with the buyers. In New Jersey, the
non-compete agreement is effective until the earlier of December 31, 2008, or the termination of our distribution agreement with Palisades Group. Outside of New Jersey, the non-compete agreement is effective until the later of December 31, 2006, or
the termination of our distribution agreement with Liberty Mutual.

Certain expenses incurred at the corporate level that previously were allocated to the Property and Casualty Insurance segment have been reclassified to Corporate and Other operations. These expenses, which we will seek to mitigate over
time, will continue to be absorbed by Corporate and Other operations in future periods.

Gibraltar Casualty

In September 2000,
we sold all of the stock of Gibraltar Casualty Company (“Gibraltar Casualty”), a commercial property and casualty insurer that we had placed in wind-down status in 1985, to Everest. As of the date of sale, Gibraltar Casualty’s largest
continuing exposures were potential liabilities for asbestos and environmental claims. Upon closing of the sale, a subsidiary of the Company entered into a stop-loss reinsurance agreement with Everest whereby the subsidiary reinsured Everest for up
to 80% of the first $200 million of any adverse loss development in excess of Gibraltar Casualty’s carried reserves as of the closing of the sale to Everest. This subsidiary was subsequently sold to Liberty Mutual, as part of the sale discussed
above. The $106 million of reserves at the closing date of the sale



to Liberty Mutual related to the reinsurance agreement with Everest remained the direct obligation of this subsidiary, and therefore those reserves are no
longer included on our balance sheet. We have reinsured Liberty Mutual with regard to any further adverse loss development on the stop-loss reinsurance agreement with Everest and have recorded a liability for the remaining $54 million of this
obligation as of December 31, 2003, which is included as part of our obligations under reinsurance contracts to Liberty Mutual disclosed above.

Prudential Securities Capital Markets

In the fourth quarter of 2000, we announced a restructuring of Prudential Securities’ activities to implement a fundamental shift in our business
strategy. We subsequently exited the lead-managed equity underwriting for corporate issuers and institutional fixed income businesses. As of December 31, 2003 we had remaining assets amounting to approximately $700 million related to this
business’s institutional fixed income activities.

Other

We previously marketed individual and group life
insurance, annuities and group health insurance in Canada through a Canadian branch of Prudential Insurance and through Prudential of America Life Insurance Company (“PALIC”), as well as property and casualty insurance through other
Canadian operations. In 1996, we sold substantially all of the Canadian branch’s operations and policies in force and all of our Canadian property and casualty operations. Also, in 2000, we sold our interest in PALIC. We have indemnified the
purchasers of both the Canadian branch and PALIC for certain liabilities with respect to claims related to sales practices or market conduct issues arising from operations prior to the sale, except for the sale of the property and casualty insurance
operations. While we believe that we have adequately reserved in all material respects for these contingent liabilities, we may be required to take additional charges that could be material to our results of operations in any particular quarterly or
annual period.

Prior to May 1996, we conducted substantial
residential first mortgage banking and related operations through The Prudential Home Mortgage Company, Inc. and its affiliates. During 1996 and 1997 we sold substantially all of the business operations, mortgage loan inventory and loan servicing
rights of this business. In 2002, we negotiated a release from future indemnification obligations with Wells Fargo, buyer of the largest portion of the portfolio, related to pre-sale activity. However, we remain liable with respect to certain claims
concerning these operations prior to sale. While we believe that we have adequately reserved in all material respects for the remaining liabilities, we may be required to take additional charges that could be material to our results of operations in
any particular quarterly or annual period.

In the fourth
quarter of 2002, we decided to divest of certain international securities operations. Certain branches of these operations, formerly reported as discontinued operations, are included in “divested businesses,” reflecting a change in the
timing of the divestiture process. Also, in the second quarter of 2003, we decided to exit certain Japanese asset management units.

Discontinued Operations

Discontinued operations reflects the results of the following business which qualified for “discontinued operations” accounting treatment under
GAAP:

•

We sold substantially all of the assets and liabilities of our group managed and indemnity healthcare business to Aetna Inc. (“Aetna”) in a transaction that closed on
August 6, 1999.

•

We discontinued our web-based business for the workplace distribution of voluntary benefits, which included an impairment of our investment in a vendor of the distribution platform,
in the third quarter of 2002.

•

We discontinued certain international securities operations in the fourth quarter of 2002.

•

We discontinued our retail broker-dealer operations in Tokyo in the fourth quarter of 2002 and subsequently sold these operations in the third quarter of 2003.

•

We discontinued our specialty automobile insurance business in the first quarter of 2003 and subsequently sold these operations in the third quarter of 2003.



•

We discontinued our existing consumer banking business in the third quarter of 2003, as we decided to exit this business.

•

We discontinued our work-place distribution property and casualty insurance operations in the fourth quarter of 2003. We subsequently sold these operations in the first quarter of
2004.

Closed Block Business

As a mutual insurance company, we issued most of our individual life
insurance products on a “participating” basis, whereby policyholders are eligible to receive policyholder dividends reflecting experience. These life insurance products were historically included in our former Traditional Participating
Products segment. In connection with the demutualization, we ceased offering domestic participating products. The liabilities for our individual in force participating products were segregated, together with assets that will be used exclusively for
the payment of benefits and policyholder dividends, expenses and taxes with respect to these products, in the Closed Block. We selected the amount and type of Closed Block Assets and Closed Block Liabilities included in the Closed Block so that the
Closed Block Assets initially had a lower book value than the Closed Block Liabilities. We expect that the Closed Block Assets will generate sufficient cash flow, together with anticipated revenues from the Closed Block Policies, over the life of
the Closed Block to fund payments of all policyholder benefits to be paid to, and the reasonable dividend expectations of, policyholders of the Closed Block Policies. We also segregated for accounting purposes the Surplus and Related Assets that we
need to hold outside the Closed Block to meet capital requirements related to the products included within the Closed Block. No policies sold after demutualization will be added to the Closed Block and its in force business is expected to ultimately
decline as we pay policyholder benefits in full. We expect the proportion of our business represented by the Closed Block to decline as we grow other businesses and as the in force business of the Closed Block declines. A minor portion of our former
Traditional Participating Products segment consisted of other traditional insurance products that are not included in the Closed Block. For a discussion of the Closed Block Business, see “—Segregation of the Businesses—Separation of
the Financial Services Business and the Closed Block Business.”

Prior to the date of demutualization, our Closed Block Policies were included in our former Traditional Participating Products segment. Upon the establishment of the Closed Block Business, we transferred $5.6 billion of net assets
previously associated with the former Traditional Participating Products segment, including the majority of the net proceeds of the Class B Stock and IHC debt issuances, to the Financial Services Businesses, representing capital in excess of the
amount we believe necessary to support the Closed Block Business. This capital was initially allocated to our Corporate and Other operations in our Financial Services Businesses as of the date of demutualization. Accordingly, results of the Closed
Block Business do not include returns on this capital, which were historically included in the results of the former Traditional Participating Products segment. To a minor extent, the former Traditional Participating Products segment included other
traditional insurance policies that were not placed in the Closed Block and that are now included in the Individual Life and Annuities segment in our Financial Services Businesses.

Historically, the participating products included in the Closed Block have yielded lower returns on capital invested than
many of our other businesses. The separation for reporting purposes of the Closed Block Business from our Financial Services Businesses permits us to better identify the results of these businesses. However, the relatively lower returns on
traditional participating products will continue to affect our consolidated results of operations for many years.

Our strategy for the Closed Block Business is to maintain the Closed Block as required by our Plan of Reorganization over the time period of its gradual
diminishment as policyholder benefits are paid in full. We are permitted under the Plan of Reorganization, with the prior consent of the New Jersey Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, to enter into agreements to transfer to a third party all or
any part of the risks under the Closed Block policies. As of December 31, 2003, we have begun to put in place the reinsurance contracts necessary to transfer a portion of these risks. As discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
if performance of the Closed Block is more favorable than we originally assumed in funding, we will pay the excess to Closed Block policyholders as additional policyholder dividends, and it will not be available to shareholders. See Note 19 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for revenues, income and loss, and total assets of the Closed Block Business.



Intangible and Intellectual Property

We use numerous federal, state and foreign service and trademarks. We believe that the goodwill associated with many of our
marks, particularly the word marks “Prudential,” “Prudential Financial,” “Growing and Protecting Your Wealth” and our “Rock” logo, are significant competitive assets in the U.S. In a number of countries
outside North and South America, primarily the United Kingdom, western Europe, and parts of Asia, there are limitations on our use of the “Prudential” name and mark. Where these limitations apply, we combine our “Rock” logo with
alternative word marks. We believe that these limitations do not materially affect our ability to operate or expand internationally.

Ratings

Claims-paying and credit ratings are important factors affecting public confidence in an insurer and its competitive position in marketing products.
Rating organizations continually review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including Prudential Insurance and our other insurance company subsidiaries. Our credit ratings are also important to our ability to raise capital through
the issuance of debt and to the cost of such financing.

Claims-paying ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding the financial ability of an insurance company to meet its obligations under an insurance policy. Credit ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding an
entity’s ability to repay its indebtedness. The following table summarizes the ratings for Prudential Financial, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries as of the date of this filing.

*

“NR” indicates not rated.

(1)

Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group’s (“S&P”) claims-paying ratings currently range from “AAA (superior)” to “CCC (extremely
vulnerable).” These ratings reflect S&P’s opinion of an operating insurance company’s financial capacity to meet the obligations of its insurance policies in accordance with their terms. According to S&P’s publications,
“A+” rated insurance companies have strong financial security characteristics, but are somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than insurers with higher ratings. The symbol (+) following “A” shows a
company’s relative standing within the “A” rating category. An insurer rated “AA” has very strong financial security characteristics, differing only slightly from those rated higher. A “+” or “-”
indicates relative strength within a category.

An S&P credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation, a specific class of financial obligations or a
specific financial program. S&P’s long-term issue credit ratings range from “AAA (highest rating)” to “D (payment default).” S&P publications indicate that an “A+” rated issue is somewhat more susceptible
to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic condition than obligations in higher rated categories; however, the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment to the obligation is still strong. S&P short-term
ratings range from “A-1 (highest category)” to “D (payment default).” Within the A-1 category some obligations are designated with a plus sign (+) indicating that the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on
the obligation is extremely strong.

(2)

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.’s (“Moody’s”) insurance claims-paying ratings (sometimes referred to as “financial strength” ratings) currently
range from “Aaa (exceptional)” to “C (lowest rated).” Moody’s insurance ratings reflect the ability of insurance companies to repay punctually senior policyholder claims and obligations. Moody’s indicates that
“A1” rated insurance companies offer good financial security, but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometimes in the future. Numeric modifiers are used to refer to the ranking within the group—with 1
being the highest and 3 being the lowest. However, the financial strength of companies within a generic rating symbol (“A” for example) is broadly the same.



Moody’s credit ratings currently range from “Aaa (best quality)” to “C (lowest rated).” Moody’s credit ratings grade debt according to its investment
quality. Moody’s considers “A2” and “A3” rated debt to be upper medium grade obligations, and that while factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate, elements may be present that suggest a
susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future.

Moody’s short-term ratings are opinions of the ability of issuers to honor senior financial obligations and contracts. Prime ratings range from “Prime-1” (P-1), which
represents a superior ability for repayment of senior short-term debt obligations, to “Prime-3” (P-3), which represents an acceptable ability for repayment of such obligations. Issuers rated “Not Prime” do not fall within any of
the Prime rating categories.

(3)

A.M. Best Company’s (“A.M. Best”) claims-paying ratings for insurance companies currently range from “A++ (superior)” to “F (in liquidation).”
A.M. Best’s ratings reflect its opinion of an insurance company’s financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders. A.M. Best considers “A+” rated companies to have a superior ability
to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders.

An A.M. Best long-term credit rating is an opinion of the capacity and willingness of an obligor to pay interest and principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation. A.M.
Best long-term credit ratings range from “aaa (exceptional)” to “d (in default),” with ratings from “aaa” to “bbb” considered as investment grade. A rating of “a” is assigned to issuers that possess
a low level of credit risk and a strong capacity to meet the terms of the obligation.

An A.M. Best short-term credit rating reflects an opinion of the issuer’s fundamental credit quality. Ratings range from “AMB-1+,” which represents an exceptional
ability to repay short-term debt obligations, to “AMB-4,” which correlates with a speculative (“bb”) long-term rating.

(4)

Fitch Ratings Ltd.’s (“Fitch”) claims-paying ratings (sometimes referred to as “financial strength” ratings) currently range from “AAA (negligible risk
factors)” to “DD (company is under an order of liquidation).” Fitch’s ratings reflect its assessment of the likelihood of timely payment of policyholder and contractholder obligations. According to Fitch, “AA-”
companies have very high claims-paying ability, strong protection factors and modest risk which may vary slightly over time due to economic and/or underwriting conditions.

Fitch long-term ratings currently range from “AAA (highest credit quality),” which denotes exceptionally strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments, to
“D (default).” Investment grade ratings range between “AAA” and “BBB.” Short-term ratings range from “F1 (highest credit quality)” to “C (high default risk).” Within long-term and short-term ratings,
a “+” or a “–” may be appended to a rating to denote relative status with major rating categories.

The ratings set forth above with respect to Prudential Financial, Prudential Funding, LLC, Prudential Insurance and our other insurance and financing
subsidiaries reflect current opinions of each rating organization with respect to claims-paying ability, financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet obligations to policyholders or debt holders, as the case may be. These ratings
are of concern to policyholders, agents and intermediaries. They are not directed toward stockholders and do not in any way reflect evaluations of the safety and security of the Common Stock. A downgrade in our claims-paying or credit ratings could
limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors or trading counterparties. Our claims-paying ratings are an important factor affecting public confidence in
most of our products and, as a result, our competitiveness. The interest rates we pay on our borrowings are largely dependent on our credit ratings.

Competition

In each of our businesses we face intense competition from domestic and foreign insurance companies, asset managers and diversified financial
institutions. Many of our competitors are large and well-capitalized and some have higher claims-paying or credit ratings than we do. We compete in our businesses generally on the basis of price, quality of service, scope of distribution, quality of
products and brand recognition. The relative importance of these factors varies across our products and the markets we serve.

In recent years, there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry, particularly as the U.S.
laws separating banking and insurance have been relaxed, resulting in increased competition from large, well-capitalized financial services firms. In particular, a number of large commercial banks, insurance companies and other broad-based financial
services firms have established or acquired other financial services businesses such as a broker-dealer or an insurance company. Many of these firms also have been able to increase their distribution systems through mergers or contractual
arrangements. We expect consolidation to continue and perhaps accelerate. While we are among the largest competitors in terms of market share in many of our business lines, in some cases there are one or more dominant market players in a particular
line of business. The trend toward consolidation in the financial services industry may result in competitors with increased market shares, or the introduction of larger or financially stronger competitors through acquisitions or otherwise, in those
or other lines of business in which we compete.

Certain of our
products compete on the basis of investment performance. A material decline in the investment performance of these products could have an adverse effect on our sales. Rankings and ratings of investment performance have a significant effect on our
ability to increase our assets under management.

Competition
for personnel in all of our businesses is intense, including for Prudential Agents, other captive sales personnel and our investment managers. In the ordinary course of business, we lose personnel from time to time in



whom we have invested significant training. We are directing substantial efforts on refocusing our Prudential Agents, improving recruiting and retention and
on increasing the productivity of Prudential Agents. The loss of key investment managers could have a material adverse effect on our Investment Management segment.

Many of our businesses are in industries where access to multiple sales channels may be a competitive advantage. We believe
that insurance and investment products will continue to be sold primarily through face-to-face sales channels, although customers’ desire for objective and not product-related advice will, over time, increase the amount of insurance and
investment products sold through non-affiliated distributors such as independent agents, insurance brokers and investment advisors. In addition, we expect that insurance and investment products will increasingly be sold through direct marketing,
including through electronic commerce.

The proliferation and
growth of multiple sales channels puts pressure on our face-to-face sales channels to either increase their productivity or reduce their costs. We continue our efforts to strengthen and broaden our sales channels, but we cannot assure they will be
successful. We run the risk that the marketplace will make a more significant or rapid shift to non-affiliated and direct distribution alternatives than we anticipate or are able to achieve ourselves. If this happens, our market share and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

Our current
claims-paying ratings have substantially reduced our ability to sell traditional guaranteed products. A downgrade in our claims-paying ratings could adversely affect our ability to sell our insurance products and reduce our profitability.

Our international life insurance business, other than
Gibraltar Life, competes by focusing on a limited market using our Life Planner model to offer high quality service and needs-based protection products. Certain competitors, including Sony Life in Japan, employ or seek to employ versions of the Life
Planner model.

Regulation

Overview

Our businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision. The purpose of these regulations is primarily to
protect our customers and not our shareholders. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are regularly re-examined, and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations.
U.S. law and regulation of our international business, particularly as it relates to monitoring customer activities, is likely to increase as a result of the recent terrorist activity in the U.S. and abroad and may affect our ability to attract and
retain customers.

Our international operations face political,
legal, operational and other risks that we do not face in our U.S. operations, including the risk of discriminatory regulation, nationalization or expropriation of assets, price controls and exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us
from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which they operate or converting local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies.

The discussion below is of U.S. regulation. Our international operations are subject to similar types of regulation in the
jurisdictions in which they operate.

Insurance Operations

State insurance laws regulate all aspects of our
domestic insurance businesses, and state insurance departments in the fifty states, the District of Columbia and various U.S. territories and possessions monitor our insurance operations. Prudential Insurance is organized in New Jersey and its
principal insurance regulatory authority is the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance. Our other insurance companies are principally regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are organized. Our international
insurance operations are principally regulated by non-U.S. insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdiction in which they operate, including the Japanese Ministry of Finance and Financial Services Agency. Generally, our insurance products must
be approved by the insurance regulators in the state in which they are sold. Our insurance products are substantially affected by federal, state and non-U.S. tax laws. Products in the U.S. that also constitute “securities”, such as
variable life insurance and variable annuities, are also subject to federal and state securities laws and regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (“NASD”),
state securities commissions and non-U.S. authorities for products offered outside the U.S. regulate and supervise these products.



Asset Management Operations

Our investment products and services, including mutual funds and private banking activities, are subject to federal, state
and non-U.S. securities, fiduciary, including the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”), and other laws and regulations. The SEC, the NASD, state securities commissions, the Department of Labor and similar non-U.S. authorities,
such as the United Kingdom’s Financial Services Authority (“FSA”), are the principal regulators that regulate our asset management operations. Federal, state and non-U.S. tax laws also substantially affect our investment products and
services.

Securities Operations

Our securities operations, principally conducted by a number of
SEC-registered broker-dealers and non-U.S. broker-dealers, are subject to federal, state and non-U.S. securities, commodities and related laws. The SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), state securities authorities, the
New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), the NASD and similar U.S. and non-U.S. authorities, such as the FSA, are the principal regulators of our securities operations.

Regulation Affecting Prudential Financial

Prudential Financial is the holding company for all of our operations. Prudential Financial itself is not licensed as an insurer, investment advisor,
broker-dealer, bank or other regulated entity. However, because it owns regulated entities, Prudential Financial is subject to regulation as an insurance holding company and a savings and loan holding company.

Insurance Holding Company Regulation

Prudential Financial is subject to the insurance holding company laws in the
states where our insurance subsidiaries are, or are treated as, organized, which currently include New Jersey, Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Minnesota, New York and others. These laws generally require each insurance company directly or
indirectly owned by the holding company to register with the insurance department in the insurance company’s state of domicile and to furnish annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company
system. Generally, all transactions affecting the insurers in the holding company system must be fair and arm’s length and, if material, require prior notice and approval or non-disapproval by the state’s insurance department.

Acquisition of Control

Under the New Jersey statute governing the demutualization and the Plan of
Reorganization, until December 17, 2004, no person, other than Prudential Financial, its subsidiaries or any employee benefit plans or trusts sponsored by us, may offer to acquire 5% or more of Prudential Financial’s Common Stock or total
voting power without the prior approval of the New Jersey insurance regulator. Under this statute, the New Jersey insurance regulator may not approve the acquisition unless he or she determines, among other things, that:

•

the acquisition would not frustrate the Plan of Reorganization;

•

either Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors has approved the acquisition or extraordinary circumstances that the Plan of Reorganization did not contemplate have arisen
that justify their approval of the acquisition; and

•

the acquisition would be in the interests of our policyholders.

The New Jersey statute governing the demutualization provides that any security that is subject to an agreement regarding acquisition or that is acquired
or to be acquired in violation of the statute or in violation of an order of the New Jersey insurance regulator may not be voted at any shareholders’ meeting, and any action of shareholders requiring the affirmative vote of a percentage of
shares may be taken as though these securities were not issued and outstanding. If these securities are voted, however, any action taken at a shareholders’ meeting will be valid unless it materially affects control of Prudential Financial or
unless a New Jersey court has otherwise ordered.

Most states,
including the states in which our insurance companies are domiciled, have insurance laws that require regulatory approval of a change of control of an insurer or an insurer’s holding company. Laws such as these that apply to us prevent any
person from acquiring control of Prudential Financial or of our insurance subsidiaries unless that



person has filed a statement with specified information with the insurance regulators and has obtained their prior approval. Under most states’
statutes, acquiring 10% or more of the voting stock of an insurance company or its parent company is presumptively considered a change of control, although such presumption may be rebutted. Accordingly, any person who acquires 10% or more of the
voting securities of Prudential Financial without the prior approval of the insurance regulators of the states in which our insurance companies are domiciled will be in violation of these states’ laws and may be subject to injunctive action
requiring the disposition or seizure of those securities by the relevant insurance regulator or prohibiting the voting of those securities and to other actions determined by the relevant insurance regulator.

In addition, many state insurance laws require prior notification of state
insurance departments of a change in control of a non-domiciliary insurance company doing business in that state. While these prenotification statutes do not authorize the state insurance departments to disapprove the change in control, they
authorize regulatory action in the affected state if particular conditions exist such as undue market concentration. Any future transactions that would constitute a change in control of Prudential Financial may require prior notification in those
states that have adopted preacquisition notification laws.

These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of Prudential Financial, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of the
stockholders of Prudential Financial might consider to be desirable.

Bank and Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation

Although The Prudential Bank and Trust Company is a “bank” as defined in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, Prudential Financial is exempted from regulation as a bank holding company under federal law as
long as we continue to comply with certain restrictions. As a result of its ownership of The Prudential Savings Bank, F.S.B., Prudential Financial is a savings and loan holding company. Federal and state banking laws generally provide that no person
may acquire control of Prudential Financial, and gain indirect control of The Prudential Bank and Trust Company, The Prudential Savings Bank, F.S.B. or Prudential Trust Company, without prior regulatory approval. Generally, beneficial ownership of
10% or more of the voting securities of Prudential Financial would be presumed to constitute control.

Insurance Operations

State
Insurance Regulation

State insurance authorities have
broad administrative powers with respect to all aspects of the insurance business including:

•

licensing to transact business,

•

licensing agents,

•

admittance of assets to statutory surplus,

•

regulating premium rates for certain insurance products,

•

approving policy forms,

•

regulating unfair trade and claims practices,

•

establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards,

•

fixing maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans and minimum accumulation or surrender values, and

•

regulating the type, amounts and valuations of investments permitted and other matters.

State insurance laws and regulations require our insurance companies to file financial statements with insurance departments
everywhere they do business, and the operations of our insurance companies and accounts are subject to examination by those departments at any time. Our insurance companies prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting
practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by these departments.

State insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the books and records, financial reporting, policy filings and market conduct of insurance companies domiciled in their states, generally once every three to five years.



Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the National Association
of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”). The New Jersey insurance regulator completed a financial examination of Prudential Insurance and its indirect insurance subsidiary, PRUCO Life Insurance Company of New Jersey, for each of the previous
five years for the period ended December 31, 2001, and found no material deficiencies.

Financial Regulation

Dividend Payment Limitations.

The New Jersey insurance law and the insurance laws of the other states and countries in which our insurance companies are domiciled regulate the amount of dividends that may be
paid by Prudential Insurance and our other insurance companies. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for more detail.

Risk-Based Capital.

In order to enhance the
regulation of insurers’ solvency, the NAIC adopted a model law to implement risk-based capital requirements for life, health and property and casualty insurance companies. All states have adopted the NAIC’s model law or a substantially
similar law. The RBC calculation, which regulators use to assess the sufficiency of an insurer’s capital, measures the risk characteristics of a company’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. RBC is calculated by
applying factors to various asset, premium and liability items. Within a given risk category, these factors are higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for items with lower underlying risk. Insurers that have less statutory
capital than the RBC calculation requires are considered to have inadequate capital and are subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending upon the level of capital inadequacy. The RBC ratios for each of our insurance companies currently
are well above the ranges that would require any regulatory or corrective action.

The NAIC approved a series of statutory accounting principles which have been adopted, in some cases with modifications, by all state insurance regulators. The measurement of statutory capital under these principles
has resulted in an increase in our RBC ratios.

IRIS
Tests.

The NAIC has developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies and
identifying companies that require special attention or action by insurance regulatory authorities. Insurance companies generally submit data annually to the NAIC, which in turn analyzes the data using prescribed financial data ratios, each with
defined “usual ranges.” Generally, regulators will begin to investigate or monitor an insurance company if its ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios. If an insurance company has insufficient capital,
regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance it can issue. None of our insurance companies is currently subject to regulatory scrutiny based on these ratios.

Insurance Reserves.

State insurance laws require us to analyze the adequacy of our reserves
annually. Our actuary must submit an opinion that our reserves, when considered in light of the assets we hold with respect to those reserves, make adequate provision for our contractual obligations and related expenses.

The NAIC has adopted a model regulation called “Valuation of Life
Insurance Policies Model Regulation” that establishes new minimum statutory reserve requirements for individual life insurance policies written after the effective date of the regulation. These reserve standards have been enacted by most of the
states, generally with a January 1, 2000 effective date. As a result, insurers selling some individual life insurance products such as term life insurance with guaranteed premium periods have adjusted reserves and/or shortened guarantee periods.
While the model regulation has been enacted by the states in which we have domestic companies, the enactment of the regulation has not had a material impact on us. The NAIC is currently considering revisions to this regulation, but we do not expect
the revisions to have a material impact on us.

Market
Conduct Regulation

State insurance laws and regulations
include numerous provisions governing the marketplace activities of insurers, including provisions governing the form and content of disclosure to consumers, illustrations, advertising, sales practices and complaint handling. State regulatory
authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations.

Insurance Guaranty Association Assessments

Each state has insurance guaranty association laws under which life and property and casualty insurers doing business in the state are members and may be assessed by state insurance guaranty associations for certain
obligations



of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Typically, states assess each member insurer in an amount related to the member
insurer’s proportionate share of the business written by all member insurers in the state. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, we paid approximately $1.2 million, $1.6 million and $2.1 million, respectively, in assessments
pursuant to state insurance guaranty association laws. While we cannot predict the amount and timing of any future assessments on our insurance companies under these laws, we have established reserves that we believe are adequate for assessments
relating to insurance companies that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings.

State Securities Regulation

Our mutual
funds, and in certain states our variable life insurance and variable annuity products, are securities within the meaning of state securities laws, and therefore are subject to regulation by state securities commissioners. Such regulation may affect
investment advice, sales and related activities for these products

.

Federal Regulation

Our variable life
insurance products, as well as our variable annuity and mutual fund products, generally are securities within the meaning of federal securities laws, are registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and are subject to regulation by the SEC and the
NASD. Federal and some state securities regulation similar to that discussed below under “—Asset Management Operations” and “—Securities Operations” affect investment advice, sales and related activities with respect to
these products. In addition, although the federal government does not comprehensively regulate the business of insurance, federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including taxation, financial services regulation and pension
and welfare benefits regulation, can significantly affect the insurance industry. Congress also periodically considers and is considering laws affecting privacy of information and genetic testing that could significantly and adversely affect the
insurance industry.

Tax Legislation

Current federal income tax laws generally permit certain holders to defer
taxation on the build-up of value of annuities and life insurance products until payments are actually made to the policyholder or other beneficiary and to exclude the build-up of value which is paid as a death benefit under a life insurance
contract. Congress from time to time considers legislation that could make our products less attractive to consumers, including legislation that would reduce or eliminate the benefit of this deferral on some annuities and insurance products, as well
as other types of changes that could reduce or eliminate the attractiveness of annuities and life insurance products to consumers.

In June 2001, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (the “2001 Act”) was enacted. The 2001 Act contains provisions that
will, over time, significantly lower individual tax rates. This will have the effect of reducing the benefits of tax deferral on the build-up of value of annuities and life insurance products. The 2001 Act also includes provisions that will
eliminate, over time, the estate, gift and generation-skipping taxes and partially eliminates the step-up in basis rule applicable to property held in a decedent’s estate. Some of these changes might hinder our sales and result in the increased
surrender of insurance and annuity products.

In May 2003, the
Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (the “2003 Act”) was enacted. Individual taxpayers are the principal beneficiaries of the 2003 Act, which includes an acceleration of certain of the income tax rate reductions enacted
originally under the 2001 Act, as well as capital gains and dividend tax rate reductions. Although most of these rate reductions expire after 2008 or later, these reductions have the effect of reducing the benefits of tax deferral on the build-up of
value of annuities and life insurance products. These changes may hinder our sales and result in increased surrender of insurance and annuity products.

The Bush Administration has also recently proposed that many of the foregoing rate reductions be made permanent, as well as several tax-favored savings
initiatives that, if enacted by Congress, could also adversely affect the sale of our annuity, life and tax-qualified retirement products and increase the surrender of such products.

ERISA

ERISA is a comprehensive federal statute that applies to employee benefit plans sponsored by private employers and labor unions. Plans subject to ERISA
include pension and profit sharing plans and welfare plans (including health, life and disability plans). ERISA provisions include reporting and disclosure rules, standards of conduct that apply to plan fiduciaries, prohibitions on
conflict-of-interest transactions and certain transactions between a benefit plan and a



party in interest (“prohibited transactions”), and a scheme of civil and criminal penalties and enforcement. Our insurance, asset management, plan
administrative services, brokerage and other businesses provide services to employee benefit plans subject to ERISA, including services where we may act as an ERISA fiduciary. In addition to ERISA regulation of those businesses in the sales of
products to and provisions of services to ERISA plans, we become parties in interest to those plans and subject to ERISA’s prohibited transaction rules for transactions with those plans, which may affect our ability to enter transactions, or
the terms on which transactions may be entered, with those plans, even in businesses unrelated to those giving rise to party in interest status.

USA Patriot Act

The USA Patriot Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”), enacted in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, contains anti-money
laundering and financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various new regulations applicable to broker-dealers and other financial services companies including insurance companies. The Patriot Act seeks to promote cooperation
among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. Anti-money laundering laws outside of the U.S. contain some similar provisions. The increased
obligations of financial institutions to identify their customers, watch for and report suspicious transactions, respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and share information with other financial
institutions, require the implementation and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls.

Asset Management Operations

Some of our separate accounts, mutual funds and other pooled investments, in addition to being registered under the Securities Act of 1933, are registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the shares of
certain of these entities are qualified for sale in some states and the District of Columbia. We also have several subsidiaries that are registered as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and are
subject to federal and state regulation, including but not limited to the SEC’s net capital rules. In addition, we have several subsidiaries that are investment advisors registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Our Prudential
Agents and other employees, insofar as they sell products that are securities, are subject to the Exchange Act and to examination requirements and regulation by the SEC, the NASD and state securities commissioners. Regulation also extends to various
Prudential entities that employ or control those individuals.

Federal and state regulators are devoting substantial attention to the mutual fund and variable annuity businesses. As a result of publicity relating to widespread perceptions of industry abuses, there have been numerous proposals for
legislative and regulatory reforms, including mutual fund governance, new disclosure requirements concerning mutual fund share classes, commission breakpoints, revenue sharing, advisory fees, market timing, late trading, portfolio pricing, annuity
products, hedge funds and other issues. It is difficult to predict at this time whether changes resulting from new laws and regulations will affect the industries or our asset management businesses, and, if so, to what degree.

For a discussion of potential federal tax legislation and other federal
regulation affecting our variable annuity products, see “—Insurance Operations—Federal Regulation” above.

Securities Operations

A number of our subsidiaries and Wachovia Securities, in which we have a 38% ownership interest, are registered as broker-dealers with the SEC and with
some or all of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. In addition, a number of our subsidiaries are also registered as investment advisors with the SEC. Our broker-dealer affiliates are members of, and are subject to regulation by
“self-regulatory organizations,” including the NASD and the NYSE. Many of these self-regulatory organizations conduct examinations of and have adopted rules governing their member broker-dealers. In addition, state securities and certain
other regulators have regulatory and oversight authority over our registered broker-dealers.

Broker-dealers and their sales forces are subject to regulations that cover many aspects of the securities business, including sales methods and trading practices. The regulations cover the suitability of investments
for individual customers, use and safekeeping of customers’ funds and securities, capital adequacy, record keeping, financial reporting and the conduct of directors, officers and employees.

The commodity futures and commodity options industry in the U.S. is subject
to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act. The CFTC is the federal agency charged with the administration of the Commodity Exchange Act and



the regulations adopted under the act. A number of our subsidiaries are registered with the CFTC as futures commission merchants, commodity pool operators or
commodity trading advisors. Our futures business is also regulated in the U.S. by the National Futures Association.

The SEC and other governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S., have the power to conduct
administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or suspension, termination or limitation of the activities of a broker-dealer or an investment advisor or its employees.

As registered broker-dealers and members of various self-regulatory
organizations, our U.S. registered broker-dealer subsidiaries and Wachovia Securities are subject to the SEC’s Uniform Net Capital Rule. The Uniform Net Capital Rule sets the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also
requires that at least a minimum part of a broker-dealer’s assets be kept in relatively liquid form. These net capital requirements are designed to measure the financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. Our broker-dealers are also
subject to the net capital requirements of the CFTC and the various securities and commodities exchanges of which they are a member. Compliance with the net capital requirements could limit those operations that require the intensive use of capital,
such as underwriting and trading activities, and may limit the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends to Prudential Financial.

Other Businesses

Our domestic banking operations are subject to extensive federal and state regulation, including examination and review by state authorities of consumer
finance offices. Prudential provides trust services through Prudential Trust Company, a state-chartered trust company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, The Prudential Bank and Trust Company, and The Prudential Savings
Bank, F.S.B. Our non-U.S. banking operations are subject to banking and securities regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are doing business. The sale of real estate franchises by our real estate brokerage franchise operation is regulated by
various state laws and the Federal Trade Commission. The federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and state real estate brokerage and unfair trade practice laws regulate payments among participants in the sale or financing of residences or the
provision of settlement services such as mortgages, homeowners insurance and title insurance.

Privacy Regulation

Federal and state law and regulation require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of health-related and customer information and to notify customers and other individuals about their policies and practices
relating to their collection and disclosure of health-related and customer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. Federal and state laws also regulate disclosures of that
information. Congress and state legislatures are expected to consider additional regulation relating to privacy, security and other aspects of personal information. Federal and state laws and regulations regulate financial institutions’
abilities to make telemarketing calls and to send unsolicited e-mail messages to consumers and customers, and they may consider additional or more detailed legislative or regulatory requirements regarding these subjects. Similar consumer and
employee privacy laws regulate our non-U.S. business operations.

Environmental Considerations

Federal, state
and local environmental laws and regulations apply to our ownership and operation of real property. Inherent in owning and operating real property is the risk of hidden environmental liabilities and the costs of any required clean-up. As to our
commercial mortgage lending, under the laws of certain states, contamination of a property may give rise to a lien on the property to secure recovery of the costs of clean-up. In several states, this lien has priority over the lien of an existing
mortgage against such property. In addition, in some states and under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), we may be liable, as an “owner” or “operator,”
for costs of cleaning-up releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at a property mortgaged to us. We also risk environmental liability when we foreclose on a property mortgaged to us. Recent legislation provides for a safe harbor from
CERCLA liability for secured lenders that foreclose and sell the mortgaged real estate, provided that certain requirements are met. However, there are circumstances in which actions taken could still expose us to CERCLA liability. Application of
various other federal and state environmental laws could also result in the imposition of liability on us for costs associated with environmental hazards.

We routinely conduct environmental assessments for real estate we acquire for investment and before taking title through foreclosure to real property
collateralizing mortgages that we hold. Although unexpected environmental



liabilities can always arise, based on these environmental assessments and compliance with our internal procedures, we believe that any costs associated with
compliance with environmental laws and regulations or any clean-up of properties would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Employees

As of December 31, 2003, we employed 39,422 employees. We believe our relations with our employees are satisfactory.

In January of 2002, the Office of Professional Employees International Union
(“OPEIU”), Local 153 (AFL-CIO), filed petitions with the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) seeking to represent those of our Prudential Agents who formerly had been represented by the United Food & Commercial Workers
International Union (AFL-CIO). In April of 2002, the NLRB conducted a mail ballot election, the result of which was that a majority of those who voted, voted against OPEIU representation. On February 2, 2004, the NLRB certified the April 2002
election results as final. On February 18, 2004, the OPEIU filed a new petition to represent the same group of Prudential Agents. A hearing is scheduled before the NLRB on March 11, 2004, and it is anticipated that an election date will be set at
that time.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are subject to legal and regulatory actions in the ordinary course of our businesses, including class action lawsuits. Our pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings specific to us and proceedings
generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which we operate. In our insurance operations, we are subject to class action lawsuits and individual lawsuits involving a variety of issues, including sales practices, underwriting
practices, claims payment and procedures, additional premium charges for premiums paid on a periodic basis, denial or delay of benefits, return of premiums or excessive premium charges and breaching fiduciary duties to customers. In addition to the
types of claims generally affecting our insurance operations, with respect to our former automobile and homeowners insurance businesses, we are also subject to certain individual and class action lawsuits involving a variety of issues arising out of
activities prior to the sale of these businesses. In our investment-related operations, we are subject to litigation involving commercial disputes with counterparties or partners and class action lawsuits and other litigation alleging, among other
things, that we made improper or inadequate disclosures in connection with the sale of assets and annuity and investment products or charged excessive or impermissible fees on these products, recommended unsuitable products to customers, mishandled
customer accounts or breached fiduciary duties to customers. In our securities operations, we are subject to class action lawsuits, arbitrations and other actions arising out of our former retail securities brokerage, account management,
underwriting, former investment banking and other activities, including claims of improper or inadequate disclosure regarding investments or charges, recommending unsuitable investments or products that were unsuitable for tax advantaged accounts,
assessing impermissible fees or charges, engaging in excessive or unauthorized trading, making improper underwriting allocations, breaching alleged duties to non-customer third parties and breaching fiduciary duties to customers. We may be a
defendant in, or be contractually responsible to third parties for, class action lawsuits and individual litigation arising from our other operations, including claims for breach of contract and payment of real estate taxes on transfer of equitable
interests in residential properties in our relocation businesses, or the businesses we are winding down or have divested, including claims under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, in connection with our divested residential first mortgage
operations and claims related to our discontinued healthcare operations. We are also subject to litigation arising out of our general business activities, such as our investments, contracts, leases and labor and employment relationships, including
claims of discrimination and harassment.

In some of our
pending legal and regulatory actions, parties are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. The following is a summary of certain pending proceedings.

Insurance

In August 2000, plaintiffs filed a purported national class action against us in the District Court of Valencia County, New
Mexico,

Azar, et al. v. Prudential Insurance

, based upon the alleged failure to adequately disclose the increased costs associated with payment of life insurance premiums on a “modal” basis,

i.e.,

more frequently than once



a year. Similar actions have been filed in New Mexico against over a dozen other insurance companies. The complaint includes allegations that we should have
disclosed to each policyholder who paid for coverage on a modal basis the dollar cost difference between the modal premium and the annual premium required for the policy, as well as the effective annual percentage rate of interest of such
difference. Based on these allegations, plaintiffs assert statutory claims including violation of the New Mexico Unfair Practices Act, and common law claims for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duty,
unjust enrichment and fraudulent concealment. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, compensatory and punitive damages, both in unspecified amounts, restitution, treble damages, pre-judgment interest, costs and attorneys’ fees. In March 2001,
the court entered an order granting partial summary judgment to plaintiffs as to liability and permitting us to appeal the order. In January 2003, the New Mexico Court of Appeals reversed the finding of summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs and
affirmed the denial of the Company’s motion to dismiss all claims on federal pre-emption grounds but dismissed the counts in the complaint for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and breach of fiduciary duty. The case was
remanded to the trial court to determine if the alleged nondisclosures were material to plaintiffs. Hearings on materiality were held in September and November 2003. The trial court has not yet issued a decision.

In October 2001, four housing advocacy groups and several individuals
represented by one of the groups filed an action against the Company in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia

, National Fair Housing Alliance, Inc., et al. v. Prudential Insurance, et al

. The complaint alleges,

inter alia

, that Prudential Insurance and Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Company intentionally engaged in discriminatory practices to limit, restrict or deny homeowners insurance in several urban areas, including Washington, D.C.,
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Richmond, Virginia and Toledo, Ohio, as well as suburban Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The complaint asserts causes of action based on alleged violations of the Fair Housing Act and describes allegedly discriminatory homeowners
insurance underwriting guidelines, terms and conditions and rating territories. The complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief and compensatory and punitive damages in unspecified amounts. In July 2002, the District Court denied our motion to
dismiss and, in August 2002, denied our motion for reconsideration of its decision.

Securities

In 1999, a
class action lawsuit,

Burns, et al. v. Prudential Securities, Inc., et al.

was filed in the Marion County, Ohio Court of Common Pleas against Jeffrey Pickett (a former Prudential Securities, Inc. (“Prudential Securities” or
“PSI”) Financial Advisor) and Prudential Securities alleging that Pickett transferred, without authorization, his clients’ equity mutual funds into fixed income mutual funds in October 1998. The claims were based on theories of
conversion, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and negligent supervision. Compensatory and punitive damages in unspecified amounts were sought by plaintiffs. In October 2002, the case was tried and the jury returned a verdict against
Prudential Securities and Pickett for $11.7 million in compensatory damages and against Prudential Securities for $250 million in punitive damages. In July 2003, the court denied PSI’s motion to set aside or reduce the jury verdict and
sustained the judgment in the amount of $269 million, including interest and attorneys fees. PSI has appealed.

In November 1998, purchasers of initial public offering (“IPO”) securities filed a purported class action lawsuit in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York,

Gillet v. Goldman, Sachs & Co., et al.

, against over two dozen underwriters, including Prudential Securities. This and a number of similar actions naming Prudential Securities and other
underwriters were consolidated under the name

In re Public Offering Fee Antitrust Litigation

. The amended complaint alleges that the defendants conspired to fix at 7% the spread that underwriting syndicates receive from issuers of securities
in certain offerings in violation of the federal antitrust laws, and seeks treble damages and injunctive relief. In February 2001, the District Court dismissed the purchaser cases for lack of antitrust standing, without leave to replead. Plaintiffs
appealed that dismissal and, in January 2003, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed and remanded the action to the District Court. In February 2004, the District Court dismissed the claims for damages on the ground that
plaintiffs were indirect purchasers of the IPO securities but did not dismiss the claim for injunctive relief. In July 2001, a consolidated class action complaint was filed by IPO issuers alleging the same violations of the antitrust laws as
purchasers,

In re Issuer Plaintiff IPO Antitrust Litigation

, in the same District Court. Defendants’ motions to dismiss that complaint were denied.

In June 2001, an action was commenced in Circuit Court, Cole County, Missouri,

Lakin, et al. v. Prudential Securities Inc., et al.,

against
Prudential Securities, Prudential Investments and Prudential Savings Bank by the insurance commissioners for Missouri, Mississippi, Tennessee and Oklahoma in their capacities as liquidators of six insurance companies previously controlled by Martin
R. Frankel. The complaint alleges that, in connection with accounts maintained by the insurance companies at Prudential, the Prudential defendants allowed Mr. Frankel and his associates to transfer funds without proper authority and failed to detect
and stop their looting activities. The complaint asserts causes of action for negligence, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty, and seeks compensatory



damages in an amount to be proved at trial. In August 2001, we removed the case to the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri,
Central Division. In December 2001, plaintiff moved for leave to file an amended complaint that contains substantially the same allegations as its original complaint. In March 2002, the court granted Prudential Savings Bank’s motion to dismiss
it from the action. Plaintiffs appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit which reversed and remanded the case to the trial court. The case is in discovery.

An affiliate of Prudential Securities was a participant in a technology-related joint venture that brought a lawsuit in 1986
against Kyocera Corporation (“Kyocera”), a Japanese corporation, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California,

LaPine Technology Corp. v. Kyocera Corp.

The complaint alleges, among other things, claims
for breach of contract relating to the manufacture and distribution of computer disk drives. In September 1987, the District Court granted Kyocera’s motion to compel arbitration and in 1994 an arbitration tribunal subsequently rendered a
decision in favor of the joint venture. In December 2003, Kyocera paid $332 million to certain subsidiaries of Prudential Financial in settlement of the arbitration award rendered against Kyocera.

Other Operations

Mutual Fund Market Timing Practices

The Company has received formal requests for information from regulators and
governmental authorities relating to the purchase and sale of mutual fund shares and, in some cases, variable annuities. The regulators and authorities include, among others, the SEC, the NYSE, the NASD, the New Jersey Bureau of Securities, the
State of New York Attorney General’s Office, the United States Attorney, District of Massachusetts (“USAM”) and the Securities Division of Massachusetts (the “MSD”). The Company is cooperating with all such inquiries.

The MSD filed an administrative complaint against three former
brokers and two former managers of a branch office in Boston, MA (the “Boston Branch”) of the retail brokerage business formerly owned by PSI, alleging violations of state securities laws. The SEC has filed a similar civil action against
five former brokers and one former manager of the Boston Branch in Massachusetts federal court. The Company is not a party to these actions. In addition, the Company has received subpoenas from the USAM for documents pertaining to the purchase and
sale of mutual fund shares and certain former brokers and their supervisors.

The MSD also filed an administrative complaint against PSI alleging that PSI knew or should have known about alleged deceptive market timing and late trading in mutual funds in the Boston Branch, failed reasonably to
supervise the conduct of the brokers in the Boston Branch and failed to implement controls designed to prevent and detect violations of Massachusetts securities law.

These matters could lead to proceedings that result in disgorgement, fines or other sanctions. The Company is unable to
estimate its ultimate exposure at this time.

Demutualization

The New Jersey law governing
the demutualization provides that a Commissioner’s order approving or disapproving a plan of reorganization shall be a final agency decision subject to appeal in accordance with, and within the time period specified by, the rules governing the
courts of the State of New Jersey. In 2001, certain policyholders, including plaintiffs in the lawsuits described below, filed notices of appeal with the Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division that challenged the Commissioner’s
approval of the Plan of Reorganization, including its provision for distribution of consideration to non-participating policyholders. In September 2003, in

In the Matter of the Plan of Reorganization of The Prudential Insurance Company of
America

, the Appellate Division affirmed the Decision and Order of the New Jersey Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, approving the Plan of Reorganization. In November 2003, the Supreme Court of New Jersey denied appellants’ petition for
certification and dismissed their appeal of the Appellate Division’s affirmance.

As previously reported, other lawsuits challenging the Plan of Reorganization were pending in the Superior Court of Essex County, New Jersey (

Hutcheson v. Prudential Insurance, et al.

,

Denenberg v.
Prudential Insurance

and

Scala v. Prudential Insurance)

and in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (

Wright, et al. v. Ryan, et al.).

All these cases have been dismissed.

Other

In November 1996, plaintiffs filed a purported class action lawsuit against Prudential Insurance, the Prudential Home
Mortgage Company, Inc. and several other subsidiaries in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Essex County,



Capitol Life Insurance Company v. Prudential Insurance, et al

., in connection with the sale of certain subordinated mortgage securities sold by a
subsidiary of Prudential Home Mortgage. In February 1999, the court entered an order dismissing all counts without prejudice with leave to refile after limited discovery. In May 2000, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint that alleges
violations of the New Jersey securities and RICO statutes, fraud, conspiracy and negligent misrepresentation, and seeks compensatory as well as treble and punitive damages. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss that was denied in October 2001. In
October 2002, plaintiffs’ motion for class certification was denied. Since that time, the court has permitted nine additional investors to intervene as plaintiffs.

In November 2003, an action was commenced in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York,

Enron Corp. v. J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc., et al.,

against approximately 100 defendants, including Prudential Insurance and other Prudential entities, who invested in Enron’s commercial paper. The complaint alleges that Enron’s
October 2001 prepayment of its commercial paper is a voidable preference under the bankruptcy laws and constitutes a fraudulent conveyance. The complaint alleges that the Company received prepayments of approximately $100 million. All defendants
have moved to dismiss the complaint.

In August 1999, a
Prudential Insurance employee and several Prudential Insurance retirees filed an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida,

Dupree, et al., v. Prudential Insurance, et al

., against Prudential Insurance
and its Board of Directors in connection with a group annuity contract entered into in 1989 between the Prudential Retirement Plan and Prudential Insurance. The suit alleged that the annuitization of certain retirement benefits violated ERISA and
that, in the event of demutualization, Prudential Insurance would retain shares distributed under the annuity contract in violation of ERISA’s fiduciary duty requirements. In July 2001, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint dropping three
counts, and we filed an answer denying the essential allegations of the complaint. The complaint seeks injunctive and monetary relief, including restitution to the Prudential Retirement Plan of amounts alleged to have been wrongfully withdrawn and
disgorgement of profits made on the use of Plan assets. In March 2002, the court dismissed certain of the claims against the individual defendants. In February 2004, the court denied defendants’ motion for summary judgment. The non-jury trial
commenced on February 17, 2004, and has not been completed.

Discontinued Operations

We have agreed to
indemnify Aetna for certain litigation involving the disposed healthcare operations, and we have been sued directly for certain alleged actions occurring before the disposition of those operations. This litigation includes class action lawsuits and
individual suits involving various issues, including payment of claims, denial of benefits, vicarious liability for malpractice claims, contract disputes with provider groups and former policyholders, purported class action lawsuits challenging
practices of our former managed care operations, including the class action lawsuits described below, and coordination of benefits with other carriers.

Nationwide class action lawsuits brought by policyholders and physicians were filed against us in 1999-2000 in several United States District Courts and
were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in October 2000, along with lawsuits pending against other managed health care companies, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, in

In re Managed Care Litigation.

In
one of these actions,

Shane v. Humana, et al.,

a purported nationwide class action lawsuit brought on behalf of provider physicians and physician groups, the complaint alleges that Prudential and other health care companies engaged in an
industry-wide conspiracy to defraud physicians by failing to pay under provider agreements and by unlawfully coercing providers to enter into agreements with unfair and unreasonable terms. An amended complaint, naming additional plaintiffs,
including three state medical associations, and an additional defendant, was filed in March 2001, and alleges claims of breach of contract, quantum meruit, unjust enrichment, violations of RICO, conspiracy to violate RICO, aiding and abetting RICO
violations, and violations of state prompt pay statutes and the California unfair business practices statute. The amended complaint seeks compensatory and punitive damages in unspecified amounts, treble damages pursuant to RICO, and attorneys’
fees. In September 2002, the District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification of a nationwide class of provider physicians. That order has been appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The appeal
is pending.

The policyholder claims in

In re Managed

Care have been resolved.

Batas and Vogel v. Prudential Insurance

was filed by policyholders in New York County Supreme Court in 1997 and alleges breach of contract, fraud, tortious interference with contractual relations claims and
violations of the New York deceptive acts and practices statute relating to the provision of managed care. Plaintiffs’ motion to certify a nationwide class of non-ERISA plan policyholders is pending.



Summary

Our litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and given its complexity and scope, its outcome cannot be predicted. It is possible that our results of
operations or cash flow in a particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of pending litigation and regulatory matters depending, in part, upon the results of operations or cash flow for
such period. Management believes, however, that the ultimate outcome of all pending litigation and regulatory matters, after consideration of applicable reserves, should not have a material adverse effect on our financial position.

SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matter was submitted to a vote of security holders of Prudential Financial during the fourth quarter of 2003.

PART II

ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER

MATTERS

General

The Common Stock was issued to eligible policyholders in
Prudential Insurance’s demutualization and sold to investors in Prudential Financial’s initial public offering. The Common Stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “PRU” on December 13, 2001. The
following table presents the high and low closing prices for the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange during the periods indicated and the dividends declared per share during such periods:

On February 27, 2004,
there were 3,366,793 registered holders of record for the Common Stock and 532.9 million shares outstanding. The closing price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on February 27, 2004, was $46.39.

The Class B Stock was issued to institutional investors (two subsidiaries of
American International Group, Inc. and Pacific Life Corp.) in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 on the date of demutualization. There is no established public trading market for the Class B Stock. During the
fourth quarter of 2002 and 2003, Prudential Financial paid an annual dividend of $9.625 per share of Class B Stock. On February 27, 2004, there were 3 holders of record for the Class B Stock and 2.0 million shares outstanding.

Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors currently intends to continue
to declare and pay annual dividends on the Common Stock and Class B Stock. Future dividend decisions will be based on, and affected by, a number of factors including the financial performance of the Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block
Business for the Common Stock and Class B Stock, respectively; our overall financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements and future prospects; regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by Prudential Financial’s
subsidiaries; and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant. Dividends payable by Prudential Financial are limited to the amount that would be legally available for payment under New Jersey corporate law. For additional
information on dividends and related regulatory restrictions, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



On the date of demutualization, Prudential Financial and Prudential Financial Capital Trust I (the
“Trust”), a statutory business trust, co-issued 13.8 million 6.75% equity security units (the “Units”). Each Unit has a stated amount of $50 and initially consists of a contract (requiring the holder to purchase shares of
Prudential Financial’s Common Stock on November 15, 2004, at a price determined by a formula described in the contract) and a redeemable capital security of the Trust with a stated liquidation amount of $50.

The distribution of Common Stock to eligible policyholders in the
demutualization was exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to Section 3(a)(10) based on the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance’s approval of the Plan of Reorganization.

See Item 12 for information about our equity compensation plans.

Common Stock and Class B Stock

The Common Stock and the Class B Stock are separate classes of common stock
under New Jersey corporate law.

Holders of Common Stock and
Class B Stock will be entitled to dividends if and when declared by Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors out of funds legally available to pay those dividends. To the extent dividends are paid on the Class B Stock, shares of Class B Stock
are repurchased or the Closed Block Business has net losses, the amount legally available for dividends on the Common Stock will be reduced. In addition, payment of dividends will be subject to the following additional conditions:

•

Common Stock will be entitled to receive dividends, if and when declared by Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors, only out of assets of the Financial Services Businesses
legally available for the payment of dividends under the New Jersey Business Corporation Act as if the Financial Services Businesses were a separate New Jersey corporation; and

•

Class B Stock will be entitled to receive dividends, if and when declared by Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors, only out of assets of the Closed Block Business legally
available for the payment of dividends under the New Jersey Business Corporation Act as if the Closed Block Business were a separate New Jersey corporation.

Dividends declared and paid on the Common Stock will depend upon the financial performance of the Financial Services
Businesses. Dividends declared and paid on the Common Stock will not depend upon or be affected by the financial performance of the Closed Block Business, unless the Closed Block Business is in financial distress. Dividends declared and paid on the
Common Stock also will not be affected by decisions with respect to dividend payments on the Class B Stock except as indicated in the following paragraph.

Dividends declared and paid on the Class B Stock will depend upon the financial performance of the Closed Block Business and, as the Closed Block matures,
the holders of the Class B Stock will receive the surplus of the Closed Block Business no longer required to support the Closed Block for regulatory purposes. Dividends on the Class B Stock will be payable in an aggregate amount per year at least
equal to the lesser of (i) a “Target Dividend Amount” of $19.25 million or (ii) the “CB Distributable Cash Flow” for such year, which is a measure of the net cash flows of the Closed Block Business. Notwithstanding this formula,
as with any common stock, we will retain the flexibility to suspend dividends on the Class B Stock; however, if CB Distributable Cash Flow exists for any period and Prudential Financial chooses not to pay dividends on the Class B Stock in an
aggregate amount at least equal to the lesser of the CB Distributable Cash Flow or the Target Dividend Amount for that period, then cash dividends cannot be paid on the Common Stock with respect to such period. The principal component of “CB
Distributable Cash Flow” will be the amount by which Surplus and Related Assets, determined according to statutory accounting principles, exceed surplus that would be required for the Closed Block Business considered as a separate insurer;
provided, however, that “CB Distributable Cash Flow” counts such excess only to the extent distributable as a dividend by Prudential Insurance under specified (but not all) provisions of New Jersey insurance law. See
“—Convertibility” for the definition of “CB Distributable Cash Flow.” Subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors of Prudential Financial, we currently anticipate paying dividends on the Class B Stock at the Target
Dividend Amount for the foreseeable future.

The shares of
Common Stock will vote together with the shares of Class B Stock on all matters (one share, one vote) except as otherwise required by law and except that holders of the Class B Stock will have class voting or consent rights with respect to specified
matters directly affecting the Class B Stock.



If shares of Class B Stock are outstanding at the time of a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of
Prudential Financial, each share of Common Stock and Class B Stock will be entitled to a share of net liquidation proceeds in proportion to the respective liquidation units of such class. Each share of Common Stock will have one liquidation unit,
and each share of Class B Stock will have 2.83215 liquidation units.

On December 18, 2001, Prudential Financial’s shareholder rights agreement became effective. Under the shareholder rights agreement, one shareholder protection right is attached to each share of Common Stock but not to any share of
Class B Stock. Each right initially entitles the holder to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of a series of Prudential Financial preferred stock upon payment of the exercise price. At the time of the demutualization, the Board of Directors of
Prudential Financial determined that the initial exercise price per right is $110, subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in the shareholder rights agreement. The shareholders rights agreement will expire by its terms on December 18,
2011.

Convertibility

The Common Stock is not convertible.

Prudential Financial may, at its option, at any time, exchange all
outstanding shares of Class B Stock into such number of shares of Common Stock as have an aggregate average market value (discussed below) equal to 120% of the appraised “Fair Market Value” (discussed below) of the outstanding shares of
Class B Stock.

In addition, if (1) Prudential Financial sells
or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of the Closed Block Business or (2) a “change of control” of Prudential Financial occurs, Prudential Financial must exchange all outstanding shares of Class B Stock into such number of
shares of Common Stock as have an aggregate average market value of 120% of the appraised Fair Market Value of such shares of Class B Stock. For this purpose, “change of control” means the occurrence of any of the following events (whether
or not approved by the Board of Directors of Prudential Financial): (a)(i) any person(s) (as defined) (excluding Prudential Financial and specified related entities) is or becomes the beneficial owner (as defined), directly or indirectly, of more
than 50% of the total voting power of the then outstanding equity securities of Prudential Financial; or (ii) Prudential Financial merges with, or consolidates with, another person or disposes of all or substantially all of its assets to any person,
other than, in the case of either clause (i) or (ii), any transaction where immediately after such transaction the persons that beneficially owned immediately prior to the transaction the then outstanding voting equity securities of Prudential
Financial beneficially own more than 50% of the total voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of the surviving person; or (b) during any year or any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period
constituted the Board of Directors of Prudential Financial (together with any new directors whose election by such Board of Directors or whose nomination for election by the shareholders of Prudential Financial was approved by a vote of a majority
of the directors of Prudential Financial then still in office who were either directors at the beginning of such period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved) cease for any reason, other than pursuant to (x) a
proposal or request that the Board of Directors be changed as to which the holder of the Class Stock seeking the conversion has participated or assisted or is participating or assisting or (y) retirements in the ordinary course (as defined), to
constitute a majority of the Board of Directors then in office.

Holders of Class B Stock will be permitted to convert their shares of Class B Stock into such number of shares of Common Stock as have an aggregate average market value equal to 100% of the appraised Fair Market Value of the outstanding
shares of Class B Stock (1) in the holder’s sole discretion, in the year 2016 or at any time thereafter, and (2) at any time in the event that (a) the Class B Stock will no longer be treated as equity of Prudential Financial for federal income
tax purposes or (b) the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance amends, alters, changes or modifies the regulation of the Closed Block, the Closed Block Business, the Class B Stock or the IHC debt in a manner that materially adversely affects
the CB Distributable Cash Flow (as defined below); provided, however, that in no event may a holder of Class B Stock convert shares of Class B Stock to the extent such holder immediately upon such conversion, together with its affiliates, would be
the “beneficial owner” (as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of in excess of 9.9% of the total outstanding voting power of Prudential Financial’s voting securities. In the event a holder of shares of Class B Stock
requests to convert shares pursuant to clause (2)(a) in the preceding sentence, Prudential Financial may elect, instead of effecting such conversion, to increase the Target Dividend Amount to $12.6875 per share per annum retroactively from the time
of issuance of the Class B Stock.

“CB Distributable Cash
Flow” means, for any quarterly or annual period, the sum of (i) the excess of (a) the Surplus and Related Assets over (b) the “Required Surplus” applicable to the Closed Block Business within Prudential Insurance, to the extent that
Prudential Insurance is able to distribute such excess as a dividend to PHLLC under New Jersey law without giving effect, directly or indirectly, to the “earned surplus” requirement of Section 17:27A-4c.(3) of



the New Jersey Insurance Holding Company Systems Law, plus (ii) any amount held by PHLLC allocated to the Closed Block Business in excess of remaining debt
service payments on the IHC debt. For purposes of the foregoing, “Required Surplus” means the amount of surplus applicable to the Closed Block Business within Prudential Insurance that would be required to maintain a quotient (expressed as
a percentage) of (i) the “Total Adjusted Capital” applicable to the Closed Block Business within Prudential Insurance (including any applicable dividend reserves) divided by (ii) the “Company Action Level RBC” applicable to the
Closed Block Business within Prudential Insurance, equal to 100%, where “Total Adjusted Capital” and “Company Action Level RBC” are as defined in the regulations promulgated under the New Jersey Dynamic Capital and Surplus Act of
1993. These amounts are determined according to statutory accounting principles.

In the event of any reclassification, recapitalization or exchange of, or any tender offer or exchange offer for, the outstanding shares of Common Stock, including by merger, consolidation or other business
combination, as a result of which shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or converted into another security which is both registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and publicly traded, then the Class B Stock will remain outstanding
(unless exchanged by virtue of a “change of control” occurring or otherwise, or otherwise converted) and, in the event 50% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock are so exchanged or converted, holders of outstanding Class B
Stock will be entitled to receive, in the event of any subsequent exchange or conversion, the securities into which the Common Stock has been exchanged or converted by virtue of such reclassification, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, tender
offer, exchange offer or other business combination. If, in the event of any reclassification, recapitalization or exchange, or any tender or exchange offer for, the outstanding shares of Common Stock, including by merger, consolidation or other
business combination, as a result of which a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock are converted into or exchanged or purchased for either cash or securities which are not public securities, or a combination thereof, the Class B Stock
will be entitled to receive cash and/or securities of the type and in the proportion that such holders of Class B Stock would have received if an exchange or conversion of the Class B Stock had occurred immediately prior to the conversion, exchange
or purchase of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock and the holders of Class B Stock had participated as holders of Common Stock in such conversion, exchange or purchase. The amount of cash and/or securities payable upon such
exchange or conversion will be calculated based upon the Fair Market Value of the Class B Stock as of the date on which the Common Stock was exchanged, converted or purchased and will be multiplied by 120%.

For purposes of all exchanges and conversions, the “average market
value” of the Common Stock will be determined during a specified 20 trading day period preceding the time of the exchange or conversion. “Fair Market Value” of the Class B Stock means the fair market value of all of the outstanding
shares of Class B Stock as determined by appraisal by a nationally recognized actuarial or other competent firm independent of and selected by the Board of Directors of Prudential Financial and approved by the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Class B Stock. Fair Market Value will be the present value of expected future cash flows to holders of the Class B Stock, reduced by any payables to the Financial Services Businesses. Future cash flows will be projected
consistent with the policy, as described in the Plan of Reorganization, for the Board of Directors of Prudential Insurance to declare policyholder dividends based on actual experience in the Closed Block. Following the repayment in full of the IHC
debt, these cash flows shall be the excess of statutory surplus applicable to the Closed Block Business over Required Surplus (as defined in the definition of “CB Distributable Cash Flow”) for each period that would be distributable as a
dividend under New Jersey law if the Closed Block Business were a separate insurer. These cash flows will be discounted at an equity rate of return, to be estimated as a risk-free rate plus an equity risk premium. The risk-free rate will be an
appropriate ten-year U.S. Treasury rate reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The equity risk premium will be eight and one quarter percent initially, declining evenly to four percent over the following 21 years and remaining constant
thereafter. Fair Market Value will be determined by appraisal as of a specified date preceding the time of the exchange or conversion.

Any exchange or conversion of Class B Stock into Common Stock could occur at a time when either or both of the Common Stock and Class B Stock may be
considered to be overvalued or undervalued. In the future, if the Class B Stock is exchanged for or converted into Common Stock, the number of shares of Common Stock then obtainable by the Class B Stockholders might constitute a higher proportion of
the total shares of Common Stock then outstanding than the proportion represented by (x) the number of shares of Class B Stock initially issued divided by (y) the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding upon completion of the
demutualization. The degree of any such proportionate increase would depend principally on: the performance of the Closed Block Business over time and the valuation of the Closed Block Business at the time of exchange or conversion; whether the
exchange or conversion implemented involves a premium; the number of any new shares of Common Stock we issue after the demutualization for financing, acquisition or other purposes or any repurchases of Common Stock that we may make; and the market
value of our Common Stock at the time of exchange or conversion.



ITEM 6.    SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

We derived the selected consolidated income statement data for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 and the selected consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 from our Consolidated
Financial Statements included elsewhere herein. We derived the selected consolidated income statement data for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 and the selected consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 from
consolidated financial statements not included herein.

On May
1, 2003 we completed our acquisition of Skandia U.S. Inc., which included American Skandia, Inc. Results for 2003 included results of American Skandia from the date of acquisition.

On July 1, 2003, we completed an agreement with Wachovia to combine each company’s respective retail securities
brokerage and clearing operations forming Wachovia Securities. We have a 38% ownership interest in the joint venture, while Wachovia owns the remaining 62%. The transaction included our securities brokerage operations but did not include our equity
sales, trading and research operations. As part of the transaction we retained certain assets and liabilities related to the contributed businesses, including liabilities for certain litigation and regulatory matters. We account for our 38%
ownership of the joint venture under the equity method of accounting; periods prior to July 1, 2003, continue to reflect the results of our previously wholly owned securities brokerage operations on a fully consolidated basis. Accordingly, operating
results for 2003 reflect our securities brokerage operations on a consolidated basis for the first six months of 2003 and earnings from the joint venture on the equity basis for the remaining six month period. Results for 2002 and prior years
reflect our securities brokerage operations on a consolidated basis.

In April 2001, we completed the acquisition of Gibraltar Life, which has adopted a November 30 fiscal year end. Consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 includes Gibraltar Life assets and liabilities as of
November 30 and consolidated income statement data for 2001 includes Gibraltar Life results from April 2, 2001, the date of its reorganization, through November 30, 2001. Consolidated income statement data for 2002 and 2003 includes Gibraltar Life
results for the twelve months ended November 30, 2002 and 2003, respectively.

We have made several dispositions that materially affect the comparability of the data presented below. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we completed the sale of our property and casualty insurance companies that
operate nationally in

48 states outside of New Jersey, and the District of Columbia, to Liberty Mutual Group (“Liberty Mutual”), as well as our New Jersey property and casualty insurance companies to Palisades Group. Results for
2003 include a pre-tax loss of $491 million related to the disposition of these businesses. In the fourth quarter of 2000, we terminated the capital markets activities of Prudential Securities. This business had pre-tax income of $287 million in
2003 (including the gain from a $332 million settlement of an arbitration award), a pre-tax loss of $36 million in 2002, a pre-tax loss of $159 million in 2001, a pre-tax loss of $620 million in 2000, and pre-tax income of $23 million in 1999. The
loss from these operations in 2000 included charges of $476 million associated with our termination and wind-down of these businesses. In 2000, we sold Gibraltar Casualty Company, a commercial property and casualty insurer that we placed in
wind-down status in 1985. We incurred losses of $81 million in 2003 and $79 million in 2002 under a stop-loss agreement we entered into at the time of sale. Gibraltar Casualty had no impact on results in 2001 and incurred pre-tax losses of $6
million in 2000, and $72 million in 1999.

On December 18,
2001, Prudential Insurance converted from a mutual life insurance company owned by its policyholders to a stock life insurance company and became an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial. “Demutualization costs and
expenses” amounted to $588 million in 2001, $143 million in 2000, and $75 million in 1999. “Demutualization costs and expenses” in 2001 include $340 million of demutualization consideration paid to former Canadian branch
policyholders.



You should read this selected consolidated financial information in conjunction with
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein.

(1)

Earnings per share data for 2001 reflects earnings for the period from December 18, 2001, the date of demutualization, through December 31, 2001 only. Net income during this period
was $38 million and $3 million for the Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business, respectively.



(2)

For purposes of this computation, earnings are defined as income from continuing operations before income taxes excluding undistributed income from equity method investments, fixed
charges and interest capitalized. Fixed charges are the sum of gross interest expense, interest credited to policyholders’ account balances and an estimated interest component of rent expense. Due to the Company’s loss in 2001, the ratio
coverage was less than 1:1 and is therefore not presented. Additional earnings of $156 million would have been required in 2001 to achieve a ratio of 1:1.

(3)

Effective December 31, 2003, the Company adopted the revised guidance under FIN No. 46. As a result, the Trust was deconsolidated and the Prudential Financial debentures are
reported as “Long-term debt.”

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

You should read the following analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the Forward-Looking Statements included on the Table of Contents, “Selected Financial Data” and the
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The consolidated financial statements of Prudential Insurance for periods prior to the demutualization in December 2001 became the historical Consolidated Financial
Statements of Prudential Financial.

Overview

Demutualization and Related Transactions

On the date of demutualization, Prudential Insurance converted from a mutual
life insurance company owned by its policyholders to a stock life insurance company and became an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial. On that date, eligible policyholders, as defined in the Plan of Reorganization, received
shares of Prudential Financial’s Common Stock or the right to receive cash or policy credits, which are increases in policy values or increases in other policy benefits, upon the extinguishment of all membership interests in Prudential
Insurance.

Also on the date of demutualization, Prudential
Financial completed an initial public offering of its Common Stock and completed the sale, through a private placement, of its Class B Stock, a separate class of common stock. The Common Stock reflects the performance of the Financial Services
Businesses and the Class B Stock reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business, which are discussed below.

Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business

Financial Services Businesses

We refer to the businesses in our three operating divisions and our Corporate and Other operations, collectively, as our Financial Services Businesses.
The Insurance division consists of our Individual Life and Annuities and Group Insurance segments. The Investment division consists of our Investment Management, Financial Advisory, Retirement, and Other Asset Management segments. The International
Insurance and Investments division consists of our International Insurance and International Investments segments. We also have Corporate and Other operations, which includes our real estate and relocation services business, as well as corporate
items and initiatives that are not allocated to business segments. Corporate and Other operations also include businesses that have been or will be divested and businesses that we have placed in wind-down status.

We attribute financing costs to each segment based on the amount of financing
used by each segment. The net investment income of each segment includes earnings on the amount of equity that management believes is necessary to support the risks of that segment.

We seek growth internally and through acquisition, joint ventures or other forms of business combination or investment. Our
principal acquisition focus is in our current business lines, both domestic and international.

Closed Block Business

In connection with the demutualization, we ceased offering domestic participating products. The liabilities for our individual in force participating products were segregated, together with assets, in a regulatory mechanism referred to as
the “Closed Block,” as required by the Plan of Reorganization. The Closed Block is designed generally to provide for the reasonable expectations for future policy dividends after demutualization of holders of policies included in the



Closed Block by allocating assets that will be used exclusively for payment of benefits, including policyholder dividends, expenses and taxes with respect to
these products. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Closed Block. We selected the amount and type of Closed Block assets and Closed Block liabilities included in the Closed Block so that the Closed Block
assets initially had a lower book value than the Closed Block liabilities. We expect that the Closed Block assets will generate sufficient cash flow, together with anticipated revenues from the Closed Block policies, over the life of the Closed
Block to fund payments of all expenses, taxes, and policyholder benefits to be paid to, and the reasonable dividend expectations of, policyholders of the Closed Block policies. We also segregated for accounting purposes the assets that we need to
hold outside the Closed Block to meet capital requirements related to the policies included within the Closed Block. No policies sold after demutualization will be added to the Closed Block, and its in force business is expected to ultimately
decline as we pay policyholder benefits in full. We also expect the proportion of our business represented by the Closed Block to decline as we grow other businesses.

Also concurrently with our demutualization, Prudential Holdings, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial that
owns the capital stock of Prudential Insurance, issued $1.75 billion in senior secured notes (the “IHC debt”). The net proceeds from the issuances of the Class B Stock and IHC debt, except for $72 million used to purchase a guaranteed
investment contract to fund a portion of the bond insurance cost associated with that debt, were allocated to the Financial Services Businesses. However, we expect that the IHC debt will be serviced by the net cash flows of the Closed Block Business
over time, and we include interest expenses associated with the IHC debt when we report results of the Closed Block Business.

The Closed Block Business consists principally of the Closed Block, assets held outside the Closed Block that Prudential Insurance needs to hold to meet
capital requirements related to the Closed Block policies, invested assets held outside the Closed Block that represent the difference between the Closed Block assets and Closed Block liabilities and the interest maintenance reserve, deferred policy
acquisition costs related to Closed Block policies, the principal amount of the IHC debt and related hedging activities and certain other related assets and liabilities.

For periods prior to demutualization, the results of the Closed Block Business are those of our former Traditional
Participating Products segment. Upon the establishment of the Closed Block Business, we transferred $5.6 billion of net assets previously associated with the former Traditional Participating Products segment, which were in excess of the amounts
necessary to support the Closed Block Business, to the Financial Services Businesses. Consequently, income from continuing operations before income taxes of the Closed Block Business includes returns on these net assets for periods prior to the
demutualization.

Revenues and Expenses

We earn our revenues principally from insurance premiums; mortality,
expense, and asset management fees from insurance and investment products; and investment of general account and other funds. We earn premiums primarily from the sale of individual life insurance and group life and disability insurance. We earn
mortality, expense, and asset management fees from the sale and servicing of separate account products including variable life insurance and variable annuities. We also earn asset management and administrative fees from the distribution, servicing
and management of mutual funds, retirement products and other asset management products and services. Our operating expenses principally consist of insurance benefits provided, general business expenses, dividends to policyholders, commissions and
other costs of selling and servicing the various products we sell and interest credited on general account liabilities.

Profitability

Our profitability depends principally on our ability to price and manage risk on insurance products, our ability to attract and retain customer assets and
our ability to manage expenses. Specific drivers of our profitability include:

•

our ability to manufacture and distribute products and services and to introduce new products that gain market acceptance on a timely basis;

•

our ability to price our insurance products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the expense of acquiring customers and administering
those products;

•

our mortality and morbidity experience on individual and group life insurance, annuity and group disability insurance products;

•

our persistency experience, which affects our ability to recover the cost of acquiring new business over the lives of the contracts;



•

our cost of administering insurance contracts and providing asset management products and services;

•

our returns on invested assets, net of the amounts we credit to policyholders’ accounts;

•

our ability to earn commissions and fees from the distribution and servicing of mutual funds, annuities, defined contribution and other investment products at a level that enables
us to earn a margin over the expense of providing such services;

•

the performance of our investment in Wachovia Securities;

•

the amount of our assets under management and changes in their fair value, which affect the amount of asset management fees we receive; and

•

our ability to generate favorable investment results through asset-liability management and strategic and tactical asset allocation.

In addition, factors such as regulation, competition, interest rates, taxes,
foreign exchange rates, securities market conditions and general economic conditions affect our profitability. In some of our product lines, particularly those in the Closed Block Business, we share experience on mortality, morbidity, persistency
and investment results with our customers, which can offset the impact of these factors on our profitability from those products.

Historically, the participating products included in the Closed Block have yielded lower returns on capital invested than many of our other businesses. As
we have ceased offering domestic participating products, we expect that the proportion of the traditional participating products in our in force business will gradually diminish as these older policies age, and we grow other businesses. However, the
relatively lower returns to us on this existing block of business will continue to affect our consolidated results of operations for many years. Our Common Stock reflects the performance of our Financial Services Businesses, but there can be no
assurance that the market value of the Common Stock will reflect solely the performance of these businesses.

Executive Summary

Prudential Financial is one of the largest financial services firms in the U.S., offering clients a wide array of financial products and services, including individual life insurance, annuities, group life and
disability insurance and pension and retirement services. We also offer mutual funds, asset management, real estate and relocation services and, through our investment in Wachovia Securities, securities brokerage services. We serve individual and
institutional customers in over 30 countries through a variety of channels, including one of the largest proprietary distribution forces in the life insurance industry.

The significant developments and events in 2003 reflected our efforts to effectively redeploy capital to seek enhanced
returns. These developments included:

•

The acquisition of American Skandia, completed May 1, 2003, for a total purchase price of $1.184 billion, the results of which are included in our Individual Life and Annuities
segment.

•

The combination of our retail securities brokerage and clearing operations with those of Wachovia, forming a joint venture, Wachovia Securities, in which we retained a 38% ownership
interest.

•

The sale of our property and casualty insurance business.

•

The repurchase of 29.1 million shares of Common Stock during the year, at a total cost of $1.0 billion.

•

A 25% increase in our Common Stock dividend, to 50 cents per share.

It is our intention to continue strategies to redeploy capital to enhance returns in 2004, with specific focus on the following:

•

Completion of the previously announced acquisition of CIGNA’s retirement business, expected to close in the first half of 2004.

•

Integration of Hyundai Investment and Securities Co., Ltd., a Korean asset management firm of which we acquired 80% in early 2004.

•

Continuation of our share repurchase program. In early 2004, Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized
to purchase up to $1.5 billion of outstanding Common Stock in 2004.



Our Common Stock (NYSE:PRU) reflects the performance of our Financial Services Businesses, which consist
of our Insurance, Investment, and International Insurance and Investments divisions as well as our Corporate and Other operations. Our Class B Stock, which is not traded on any exchange, reflects the performance of our Closed Block Business, which
includes our in force participating life insurance and annuity policies and assets that are being used for the payment of benefits and policyholder dividends on these policies, as well as other assets and equity that support these policies.

We analyze performance of the segments of the Financial
Services Business using a non-GAAP measure called adjusted operating income. See “—Consolidated Results of Operations” for a definition of adjusted operating income and a discussion of its use as a measure of operating performance.

Shown below are the segments providing the largest
contribution to our adjusted operating income in 2003, their comparable contributions in prior years, the adjusted operating income of our remaining segments and a reconciliation of adjusted operating income of our segments to income (loss) from
continuing operations before income taxes. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the presentation of segment results.

Results for 2003
presented above reflect the following:

•

Continued strong performance of our international insurance operations, including pretax adjusted operating income of $370 million from our Gibraltar Life operations, and pretax
adjusted operating income of $449 million from our international insurance operations other than Gibraltar Life.

•

Significantly improved results of our Individual Life and Annuities segment reflecting improved results of our annuities operations, including $167 million in pretax adjusted
operating income in 2003 from the American Skandia operations acquired during the year.

•

Improved results of our Retirement, Group Insurance and Investment Management segments as we benefited from improved market conditions, lower expenses and improved benefits
experience.

•

A loss, on a pretax adjusted operating income basis, of $111 million from our Financial Advisory segment. Included in the loss are transition costs of $100 million incurred related
to the transaction and costs of $107 million related to obligations we retained in connection with the businesses contributed to Wachovia Securities, primarily retained litigation and regulatory matters. Our share of earnings from our investment in
Wachovia Securities, before transition costs, was $88 million, commencing with the formation of the combined company on July 1, 2003.

•

Income within Corporate and Other reflects a lower level of income from our own qualified pension plan, offset in part by a lower level of expenses in 2003.

•

Realized investment losses, net, and related charges and adjustments for the Financial Services Businesses in 2003 included impairments and credit-related losses of $404 million,
down from $1,055 million in 2002.



•

Included in the divested businesses results are a pretax loss of $491 million related to the disposition of our property and casualty insurance operations, as well as pretax income
from our receipt of $332 million in connection with a favorable settlement related to a former business of Prudential Securities.

•

Results of the Closed Block Business for 2003 include realized investment gains of $426 million, as compared to realized investment losses of $587 million in the prior year.

We manage our capital levels consistent with our
risk, rating objectives and regulatory requirements. Our ratings targets are “AA/Aa/AA” for Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group (“S&P”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and Fitch Ratings Ltd.
(“Fitch”), respectively, and “A+” for A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”) for our core domestic life insurance companies. Our debt rating targets for Prudential Financial are “A” for S&P, Moody’s and
Fitch and “a” for A.M. Best. At year-end 2003, we had $21 billion of total capital and $2.6 billion of unused borrowing capacity, which we believe are sufficient to capitalize our existing businesses. Together with anticipated future
earnings in 2004, we believe these resources are adequate to cover expected growth in capital requirements, including the acquisition of the CIGNA retirement business, while maintaining balance sheet strength consistent with our ratings objectives.
See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information.

Accounting Policies & Pronouncements

Application of Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree
of judgment. Management, on an ongoing basis, reviews estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements. If management determines that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate given current facts and
circumstances, results of operations and financial position as reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements could change significantly.

The following sections discuss the accounting policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are most dependent on the
application of estimates and assumptions.

Valuation of Investments

A large portion of our investments is reflected at
fair value in the statements of financial position based on quoted market prices or estimates from independent pricing services. However, when such information is not available, for example, with respect to private placement fixed maturity
securities which comprise 18% of our investments as of December 31, 2003, fair value is estimated, typically by using a discounted cash flow model, which considers current market credit spreads for publicly traded issues with similar terms by
companies of comparable credit quality. Consequently, changes in estimated future cash flows or in our assessment of the issuer’s credit quality will result in changes in fair value estimates. Fixed maturities and equity securities classified
as available for sale are carried at these fair values and the impact of changes in fair value are recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of equity. In addition,
fixed maturities and equity securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity are subject to our review to identify when a decline in value is other than temporary. Factors we consider in determining whether a decline in value is other
than temporary include: whether the decline is substantial; the duration of the decline, generally greater than six months; the reasons for the decline in value, credit event or interest rate related; our ability and intent to hold the investment
for a period of time that will allow for a recovery of value; and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. When it is determined that a decline in value is other than temporary, the carrying value of the security is reduced to
its estimated fair value, with a corresponding charge to earnings. This corresponding charge is referred to as an impairment and is reflected in “Realized investment gains (losses), net” in the statements of operations. The level of
impairment losses can be expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and decrease when economic conditions improve.

“Commercial loans,” which comprise 11% of our investments as of December 31, 2003, are carried primarily at unpaid principal balances, net of
unamortized discounts and an allowance for losses. This allowance includes a loan specific portion as well as a portfolio reserve for incurred but not specifically identified losses. The loan specific portion is based on management’s judgment
as to ultimate collectibility of loan principal. The portfolio reserve is based on a number of factors, such as historical experience and portfolio diversification. Similar to impairment losses discussed above, the allowance for losses can be
expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and decrease when economic conditions improve.

See “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments” for a discussion of our investment portfolio and related results,
including policies regarding other than temporary declines in investment value.



Policyholder Liabilities

The liability for “Future policy benefits” is the largest liability included in our statements of financial
position, 32% of total liabilities as of December 31, 2003. Changes in this liability are generally reflected in the “Policyholders’ benefits” caption in our statements of operations. This liability is primarily comprised of the
present value of estimated future payments to holders of life insurance and annuity products where the timing and amount of payment depends on policyholder mortality, surrender or retirement experience. For traditional participating life insurance
products of our Closed Block Business, the mortality and interest rate assumptions we apply are those used to calculate the policies’ guaranteed cash surrender values. For life insurance and annuity products of our Financial Services
Businesses, expected mortality is generally based on the Company’s historical experience or standard industry tables. Interest rate assumptions are based on factors such as market conditions and expected investment returns. Although mortality
and interest rate assumptions are “locked-in” upon the issuance of new insurance or annuity business with fixed and guaranteed terms, significant changes in experience or assumptions may require us to provide for expected future losses on
a product by establishing premium deficiency reserves.

Our
liability for “Unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses,” which is less than 1% of total liabilities as of December 31, 2003, includes estimates of claims that we believe have been incurred, but have not yet been reported
(“IBNR”) as of the balance sheet date, primarily attributable to our Group Insurance segment. Consistent with industry accounting practice, we do not establish loss reserves until a loss has occurred. These IBNR estimates, and estimates of
the amounts of loss we will ultimately incur on reported claims, which are based in part on our historical experience, are regularly adjusted to reflect actual claims experience. When actual experience differs from our previous estimate, the
resulting difference will be included in our reported results for the period of the change in estimate in the “Policyholders’ benefits” caption in our statements of operations. On an ongoing basis, trends in actual experience are a
significant factor in the determination of claim reserve levels.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs

For
most life insurance and annuity products that we sell, we defer costs that vary with and are related primarily to the production of new business to the extent these costs are deemed recoverable from future profits, and we record these costs as an
asset known as “Deferred policy acquisition costs” or “DAC”, which is 2% of total assets as of December 31, 2003. We amortize this DAC asset over the expected lives of the contracts, based on the level and timing of either
estimated profits or premiums, depending on the type of contract. For products with amortization based on estimated profits, the amortization rate is periodically updated to reflect current period experience or changes in assumptions that affect
future profitability, such as lapse rates, investment returns, mortality experience, expense margins and surrender charges. However, for products with amortization based on future premiums, the amortization rate is locked-in when the product is
sold.

Expected profitability is a significant element in
evaluating deferred policy acquisition costs related to annuity products. Deferred policy acquisition costs related to annuity products are evaluated quarterly by comparing our actual profitability to our expectations. Expected profitability
considers, among other assumptions, our estimate of future asset returns that determine the future fees we will earn, the costs we expect to incur associated with minimum death benefit and other contractual guarantees, as well as other profitability
factors. If actual asset returns do not differ significantly from our expectations, they do not result in a change in the rate of amortization of deferred acquisition costs. Where actual asset returns differ significantly from expectations, future
asset return assumptions are evaluated using a reversion to mean approach. Under the reversion to mean approach, we consider historical returns over a period of time and project returns for a future four year period so that the investments
underlying the annuities grow at a targeted return for the entire period. A calculated rate of return over the four future years, which we refer to as the look-forward period, is determined so that this calculated rate, together with the actual rate
of return for the historical period, produces the targeted return for the entire period. If the calculated rate of return is consistent with our range of expectations in light of market conditions, we use it to project the asset growth for the next
four years. If the calculated rate of return is not supported by our current expectations, we adjust the rate of return for purposes of these computations. For contract years after the look-forward period, we project asset growth using our long-term
rate, currently an 8% annual blended rate of return, which reflects an assumed rate of return of 8.85% for equity type assets. Beginning in the second quarter of 2002 and continuing throughout 2002, we utilized a rate of return lower than the
calculated return, which contributed to our additional amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the second and third quarters of 2002. The equity rate of return used in the immediate four year look-forward period varies by product, but was
under 10% for all of our variable annuity products for our evaluation of deferred policy acquisition costs as of December 31, 2003. For the average remaining life of our variable annuity contracts in force as of December 31, 2003, our evaluation of
deferred policy acquisition costs is based on a 7.7% annual blended rate of return that reflects an



assumed rate of return of 8.9% for equity type assets. Deterioration in market conditions may result in increases in the amortization of deferred policy
acquisition costs, while further improvement in market conditions may result in a decrease in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs. These changes in DAC balances are included as a component of “General and administrative
expenses” in our statements of operations.

See
“—Insurance Division—Individual Life and Annuities” for discussion of the impact of DAC amortization on our results of our annuities businesses, including a reduction in amortization recorded in 2003 reflecting an increase in our
estimate of future gross profits on variable annuities and increases in amortization recorded in 2002 and 2001 reflecting our decreases in estimates of future gross profits during those years.

Goodwill

We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of December 31 of each year and more frequently if events occur or
circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Impairment testing requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill, and
record an impairment charge if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The determination of a reporting unit’s fair value is based on management’s best estimate, which generally considers the unit’s
expected future earnings and market-based earning multiples of peer companies. As of December 31, 2003, we have $435 million of goodwill reflected on our statement of financial position.

Reserves For Contingencies

A contingency is an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved upon the occurrence of future events. Under
GAAP, reserves for contingencies are required to be established when the future event is probable and its impact can be reasonably estimated. An example is the establishment of a reserve for losses in connection with an unresolved legal matter. The
initial reserve reflects management’s best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and, ultimately, when the matter is brought to closure.

Other Significant Estimates

In addition to the items discussed above, the application of GAAP requires
management to make other estimates and assumptions. For example, accounting for pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefits requires estimates of future returns on plan assets, expected increases in compensation levels and trends in
health care costs. See “—Corporate and Other Operations” for a discussion of our pension assumptions and related returns. Another example is the recognition of deferred tax assets, which depends on management’s assumption that
future earnings will be sufficient to realize the deferred benefit. This is discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accounting Policies Adopted

Accounting for Stock Options

Employee stock options issued during 2001 and 2002 are accounted for using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion
(“APB”) No. 25, “Accounting to Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations, an allowable alternative method under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No.123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.” Under APB No. 25, we did not recognize any stock-based compensation expense for employee stock options as all employee stock options had an exercise price equal to the market value of our Common Stock at the date of grant.
Effective January 1, 2003, we changed our accounting for employee stock options to adopt the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended, prospectively for all new awards granted to employees on or after January 1, 2003. Under
these provisions, the fair value of all employee stock options awarded on or after January 1, 2003, is included in the determination of net income, but not for options awarded prior thereto. Accordingly, the amount we include in the determination of
net income is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value method had been applied to all awards since inception of the employee stock option plan. The fair value of employee stock options issued prior to January 1, 2003 was
estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For options issued on or after January 1, 2003, the fair value of each option was estimated using a binomial option-pricing model. Both option-pricing models consider the following assumptions in
estimating fair value: dividend yield, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected life of the option. If we had accounted for all employee stock options under the fair value based accounting method, net income of the



Financial Services Businesses for the year ended December 31, 2003, would have been reduced by $35 million or, $.06 and $.07 per share of Common Stock on a
basic and diluted basis, respectively. The net income of the Closed Block Business for the year ended December 31, 2003, would have been reduced by $1 million with no change in earnings per share of the Class B Stock. For the year ended December 31,
2002, net income would have been reduced by $30 million or $.05 per share of Common Stock on a basic and diluted basis. For the period December 18, 2001 through December 31, 2001, net income and basic and diluted earnings per share of Common Stock
would have been reduced by $1 million and $.01, respectively.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, including the adoption of Statement of Position 03-01, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration
Contracts and for Separate Accounts” (“SOP 03-01”), effective January 1, 2004.

Consolidated Results of Operations

Net Income and Other Data

The following table
summarizes income from continuing operations for the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business as well as other components comprising net income.

In managing our
business, we analyze operating performance separately for our Financial Services Businesses and our Closed Block Business. For the Financial Services Businesses, we analyze our segments’ operating performance using a non-GAAP measure we call
“adjusted operating income.” Results of the Closed Block Business for all periods are evaluated and presented only in accordance with GAAP. We calculate adjusted operating income for the segments of the Financial Services Businesses by
adjusting our income from continuing operations before income taxes to exclude the following items:

•

realized investment gains, net of losses, and related charges and adjustments;

•

the contribution to income/loss of divested businesses that have been or will be sold or exited that do not qualify for “discontinued operations” accounting treatment
under GAAP;

•

life insurance sales practices remedies and costs; and

•

demutualization costs and expenses.



The contributions to income / loss of wind-down businesses that we have not divested remain in adjusted operating income.

The excluded items are important to an understanding of our
overall results of operations. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP, and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies. However, we believe that
the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of the Financial
Services Businesses. Adjusted operating income excludes net realized investment gains and losses. A significant element of realized losses is impairments and losses from sales of credit-impaired securities, the timing of which depends largely on
market credit cycles and can vary considerably across periods. The timing of other sales that would result in gains or losses is largely subject to our discretion and influenced by market opportunities. Trends in the underlying profitability of our
businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of these transactions. Adjusted operating income excludes life insurance sales practices remedies and costs relating to the settlement of individual life insurance sales
practices issues for the period from 1982 through 1995 because they relate to a substantial and identifiable non-recurring event. Adjusted operating income excludes the results of divested business, which are not indicative of our future operating
results. Adjusted operating income also excludes demutualization costs and expenses as they are directly related to demutualization and would distort the trends associated with ongoing operations.

Individual Life and Annuities

Operating Results

The following table sets forth the Individual Life and Annuities
segment’s operating results for the periods indicated.

(1)

Revenues exclude realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments. For a discussion of these items see “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account
Investments—Realized Investment Gains.”

(2)

Benefits and expenses exclude related charges which represent the unfavorable (favorable) impact of realized investment gains (losses), net, on change in reserves and deferred
policy acquisition cost amortization. For a discussion of these items see “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments —Realized Investment Gains.”



On May 1, 2003, we completed our acquisition of Skandia U.S. Inc., which included American Skandia for a
total purchase price of $1.184 billion. Beginning May 1, 2003, the results of American Skandia have been included in our consolidated results and are included as a component of our annuity business discussed below. See Note 3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion of this acquisition and purchase price allocation.

Adjusted Operating Income

2003 to 2002 Annual Comparison.

The decrease in adjusted operating income for the segment’s individual life insurance business is primarily the result of claims experience, net of reinsurance, less
favorable than in the prior year, partially offset by the favorable impact of increases in the market value of variable life insurance assets.

Results of the segment’s individual annuity business for 2003 included adjusted operating income of $167 million from the initial eight months of
operations of American Skandia, which consisted of revenues of $416 million and total benefits and expenses of $249 million. American Skandia’s revenues consisted primarily of policy charges and fee income of $242 million and asset management
and service fees of $126 million. Benefits and expenses consisted primarily of general and administrative expenses of $200 million, including $38 million of amortization of the value of business acquired asset (“VOBA”) established in
purchase accounting, which amounted to $440 million as of the date of acquisition, and guaranteed minimum death benefit payments of $35 million.

Adjusted operating income of the segment’s individual annuity business, excluding American Skandia, increased $137 million, from a loss, on an
adjusted operating income basis, of $42 million in 2002 to income of $95 million in 2003. Adjusted operating income for 2003 included a $39 million reduction in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs due to our increased estimate of
future gross profits on variable annuities reflecting market value increases in underlying assets. This benefit to adjusted operating income was largely offset by a $36 million charge to strengthen reserves for our periodic income annuities. Results
for 2002 included charges totaling $137 million for additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, reflecting our lower estimates of future gross profits resulting from greater expected costs from minimum death benefit guarantees and
lower expected fees under individual annuity contracts due to declines in asset values.

2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison.

Results for the segment’s individual life insurance business for 2002 benefited from a decline in operating expenses, reflecting savings that we
continue to realize from our field management and agency restructuring program implemented in 2001, for which that year’s expenses included $90 million of implementation costs. Additionally, results of our individual life insurance business for
2002 benefited from increased investment income, primarily from an increase in the level of invested assets. However, these items were partially offset by less favorable mortality experience in 2002, as well as a $47 million increase in amortization
of deferred policy acquisition costs, primarily due to a market decline and related policy lapses associated with declines in variable life insurance account values. Results for 2001 included $25 million of net losses from insurance claims arising
out of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the U.S.

Results of our annuity business in 2002 included charges totaling $137 million for additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs discussed above. Results for 2001 included similar charges for additional amortization of
deferred policy acquisition costs totaling $30 million. A decline in fee revenues in 2002 from our variable annuity products due to a decrease in average account values was partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses resulting from our
expense management efforts.

Revenues

2003 to 2002 Annual Comparison.

The
segment’s individual life insurance business reported revenues, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” of $1.936 billion in 2003 compared to $1.952 billion 2002, a $16 million decrease. Premiums decreased $43
million, from $395 million in 2002 to $352 million in 2003, reflecting approximately $80 million in decreased premiums on term insurance we issued under policy provisions to customers who previously had lapsing variable life insurance policies with
us, partially offset by increased sales and growth of our in force block of term insurance products.

Revenues from the segment’s individual annuity business increased $402 million, from $744 million in 2002 to $1.146 billion in 2003, which included
revenues of $416 million from American Skandia. Revenues of the segment’s existing individual annuity business declined $14 million, from $744 million in 2002 to $730 million in 2003, due primarily to an $18 million decrease in policy charges
and fees as, despite a year to year increase, the average market value of variable annuity customer accounts declined in 2003 from 2002.



2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison.

The segment’s individual life
insurance business reported revenues of $1.952 billion in 2002, compared to $1.907 billion in 2001, a $45 million increase. Net investment income increased $28 million from $391 million in 2001 to $419 million in 2002, primarily from an increase in
the level of invested assets. Commissions and other income increased $12 million, from $112 million in 2001 to $124 million in 2002, primarily due to an increased level of reinsurance activity. Premiums amounted to $395 million in 2002, essentially
unchanged from the prior year.

Revenues from our individual
annuity business declined $57 million, from $801 million in 2001 to $744 million in 2002. Policy charges and fees and asset management fees decreased $48 million from $315 million in 2001 to $267 million in 2002, driven primarily from our variable
annuity products, reflecting a decline in the average market value of customer accounts on which our fees are based. Net investment income declined $22 million, from $440 million in 2001 to $418 million in 2002, primarily due to lower yields on our
investment portfolio. These declines were partially offset by higher premiums resulting from increased sales of our immediate income annuity product.

Benefits and Expenses

2003 to 2002 Annual Comparison.

Benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under “—Operating
Results,” of the segment’s individual life insurance business increased $59 million from $1.520 billion in 2002 to $1.579 billion in 2003. The increase reflects a $97 million increase in policyholder benefits and related changes in
reserves, from $676 million in 2002 to $773 million in 2003, as well as an increase in employee termination and related costs. The increase in policyholder benefits and related changes in reserves came primarily from claims experience, net of
reinsurance, less favorable than the prior year, partially offset by decreased policy reserves on term insurance, corresponding to the decreased premiums discussed above. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in amortization of
deferred policy acquisition costs, due primarily to less favorable claims experience and lower policy surrenders.

Benefits and expenses of the segment’s individual annuity business increased $98 million, from $786 million in 2002 to $884 million in 2003, which
included $249 million of expenses related to American Skandia. Benefits and expenses of the segment’s existing individual annuity business decreased $151 million, from $786 million in 2002 to $635 million in 2003. Amortization of deferred
policy acquisition costs declined $178 million from 2002 to 2003, primarily as a result of the changes in our estimated future gross profits as discussed above. Partially offsetting this was a $28 million increase in policyholder benefits and
related change in reserves, reflecting the $36 million charge to strengthen reserves for our periodic income annuities discussed above, which resulted from refinements in our calculation of these reserves. Benefits and expenses of our individual
annuity business include $69 million of guaranteed minimum death benefits in 2003 of which $35 million is associated with the American Skandia business.

Effective January 1, 2004, we adopted SOP 03-01, which requires the recognition of a liability for a guaranteed minimum death benefit (“GMDB”)
feature, as well as a change in the valuation and presentation of our liability associated with a market value adjustment (“MVA”) feature, both of which are contained in certain of our annuity contracts. We estimate the effect of adopting
SOP 03-01 resulting from our annuities business will be a net charge of approximately $26 million after taxes. This charge will be recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. The net impact of recognition of a liability for
GMDB provisions associated with the American Skandia business and the change in the liability for the MVA feature associated with the American Skandia business will be largely offset by a net decrease in VOBA of approximately $130 million, since the
expected cash flows on American Skandia’s business in force at the time of the acquisition that correspond to the obligations covered by SOP 03-01 were considered in establishing the initial VOBA.

2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison.

Benefits and
expenses of our individual life insurance business decreased $105 million, or 6%, from $1.625 billion in 2001 to $1.520 billion in 2002. Operating expenses, including distribution costs that we charge to expense, decreased $150 million, from $557
million in 2001 to $407 million in 2002, reflecting savings from our program to restructure our field management and agency structure, for which expenses in 2001 included $90 million of implementation costs. Policyholder benefits and related changes
in reserves decreased $12 million, from $688 million in 2001 to $676 million in 2002, as the impact of claims arising from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the U.S. on 2001 benefits and expenses was partially offset by less favorable
mortality experience in 2002 than that of 2001, other than the impact of those claims. A $47 million increase in amortization of deferred acquisition costs, primarily due to the market impact of declines in variable life insurance account values,
was a partial offset to the aforementioned decreases in benefits and expenses.

The segment’s individual annuity business reported benefits and expenses of $786 million in 2002, compared to $694 million in 2001, an increase of $92 million, or 13%. The increase reflects an increase in
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs of $87 million, which primarily includes charges for additional amortization of $137 million in



2002 and $30 million in 2001 resulting from decreases in expected future gross profits on our annuity products as discussed above. Guaranteed minimum death
benefit payments increased $23 million, from $14 million in 2001 to $37 million in 2002.

Sales Results and Account Values

The following table sets forth the individual life insurance business’s sales, as measured by scheduled premiums from new sales on an annualized basis and first year excess premiums and deposits on a
cash-received basis and changes in account value for the individual annuity business, for the periods indicated. Sales of the individual life insurance business do not correspond to revenues under GAAP. They are, however, a relevant measure of
business activity. In managing our individual life insurance business, we analyze new sales based on the measure described above, as this measures the current sales performance of the business, while revenues primarily reflect the renewal
persistency and aging of in force policies written in prior years and net investment income, as well as current sales. For our individual annuity business, assets are reported at account value and net sales (redemptions) are gross sales minus
redemptions or surrenders and withdrawals, as applicable.

(1)

Scheduled premiums from new sales on an annualized basis and first year excess premiums and deposits on a cash-received basis.

(2)

Excluding corporate-owned life insurance.

(3)

Variable annuities include only those sold as retail investment products. Investments through defined contribution plan products are included with such products.

(4)

Includes maintenance and insurance charges assessed, net bonus payments credited to contract holder accounts, annuity benefits and other adjustments, as well as decreases in
policyholder account balances during 2002 of $45 million for variable annuities and $56 million for fixed annuities due to the distribution of policy credits, subsequently paid out in cash, as demutualization consideration in connection with the
Company’s demutualization. 2001 includes increases to policyholder account values as a result of the issuance of policy credits of $429 million for variable annuities and $157 million for fixed annuities.

2003 to 2002 Annual Comparison.

Sales of new
life insurance excluding corporate-owned life insurance, measured as described above, increased $21 million from 2002 to 2003. Sales of our universal life and term life



products, both of which were updated as to features and pricing in 2003, increased $46 million and $21 million, respectively. These increases were offset by
a decline of $46 million in variable life sales, which were negatively affected by customer response to prolonged volatile equity market conditions. Sales of corporate-owned life insurance, substantially all of which is sold by the third-party
distribution channel, declined by $101 million. The decline primarily resulted from a single large sale in 2002.

Sales from Prudential Agents decreased slightly from 2002 to 2003, reflecting a decline in the average number of agents for the period from approximately
4,500 in 2002 to approximately 4,300 in 2003 associated with selective hiring of new agents and closures of several offices to promote the cost effectiveness of the Prudential Agent distribution channel as well as some attrition of agents resulting
from the Company’s sale of its property and casualty insurance businesses in 2003. Sales by the third party distribution channel, other than corporate-owned life insurance, increased $29 million 2002 to 2003, reflecting increased universal and
term life sales through this channel.

Total account values for
fixed and variable annuities amounted to $47.5 billion as of December 31, 2003, an increase of $28.7 billion, which included $22.4 billion from the May 1, 2003 acquisition of American Skandia. The remainder of the increase came primarily from
increases in the market value of customers’ variable annuities as well as net sales of $526 million. Individual variable annuity gross sales increased by $3.0 billion, from $1.4 billion for 2002 to $4.4 billion for 2003, primarily due to $2.5
billion in variable annuity sales contributed by American Skandia from the date of acquisition. Excluding American Skandia, variable annuity gross sales increased by $528 million driven by improving market conditions, product enhancements, and
continued expansion in third party distribution. Sales of fixed annuities declined year-over-year by $358 million due primarily to management’s decision to lower crediting rates in the current interest rate environment. Surrenders and
withdrawals increased $1.7 billion in 2003 from 2002, including $2.1 billion from American Skandia, reflecting the larger base of business.

2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison.

Sales of new life insurance excluding corporate-owned life insurance, measured as described
above, increased $45 million from 2001 to 2002. Increased sales of our universal life insurance products, which we introduced in late 2001, and our term insurance products, reflecting revised product pricing, more than offset a $63 million decline
in variable life sales associated with customer response to equity market conditions. Sales of corporate-owned life insurance products, substantially all of which is sold by the third party distribution channel, decreased $77 million, reflecting
several large sales in 2001, as compared to a single large sale in 2002.

Sales from Prudential Agents increased $25 million from 2001 to 2002, an increase in agent productivity, partially offset by a decline in the average number of agents for the period from approximately 5,200 in 2001 to
approximately 4,500 in 2002. The decline in the number of average agents from 2001 reflected actions we took in 2001 to increase the productivity standards required to continue agents’ contracts. Sales by the third party distribution channel,
other than corporate-owned life insurance, increased $20 million from 2001 to 2002, reflecting increased universal and term life sales through this channel.

Total account values for fixed and variable annuities amounted to $18.7 billion as of December 31, 2002, a decrease of $2.9 billion from December 31,
2001. This decrease is due primarily to declines in market values of our variable annuities resulting from adverse market conditions as well as net redemptions. Net redemptions for 2002 were $451 million as compared to $1.2 billion in 2001. The $730
million decline in net redemptions is primarily the result of a $609 million increase in gross sales due to product and compensation enhancements as well as strengthening of distribution relationships.

Policy Surrender Experience

The following table sets forth the individual life insurance business’s
policy surrender experience for variable life insurance, measured by cash value of surrenders, for the periods indicated. These amounts do not correspond to expenses under GAAP. In managing this business, we analyze the cash value of surrenders
because it is a measure of the degree to which policyholders are maintaining their in force business with us, a driver of future profitability. Our term life insurance products do not provide for cash surrender values.



2003 to 2002 Annual Comparison.

The total cash value of surrenders
decreased $39 million from 2002 to 2003. The level of surrenders as a percentage of mean future policy benefit reserves, policyholders’ account balances and separate account balances decreased from 2002 to 2003, reflecting a higher level of
lapses in 2002 associated with declines in variable life insurance account values due to adverse equity market conditions.

2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison.

The total cash value of surrenders increased $55 million in 2002 from 2001. The level of
surrenders as a percentage of mean future policy benefit reserves, policyholders’ account balances and separate account balances increased from 2001 to 2002, reflecting an increase in lapses associated with declines in variable life insurance
account values.

Group Insurance

Operating Results

The following table sets forth the Group Insurance segment’s operating
results for the periods indicated.

(1)

Revenues exclude realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustment. For a discussion of these items see “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account
Investments—Realized Investment Gains.”

Adjusted Operating Income

2003 to 2002
Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income increased $14 million from 2002 to 2003. Adjusted operating income for 2003 included a net favorable effect of $8 million from refinements in group life reserves for waiver of
premium features and estimates of amounts due policyholders on experience rated cases, while the prior year benefited $19 million from refinements in reserves relating to our group long-term disability product. Excluding the $11 million net negative
impact of these refinements, adjusted operating income increased $25 million in 2003 from 2002, reflecting more favorable group life benefits experience in 2003 and a greater contribution from investment results.

2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted
operating income increased $85 million from 2001 to 2002. Adjusted operating income for 2001 included a charge of approximately $36 million reflecting a refinement in our reserve for group life incurred but not reported claims. Adjusted operating
income for 2002 benefited $19 million from refinements in reserves relating to our group long-term disability product. Excluding these reserve refinements, adjusted operating income increased $30 million from 2001 due primarily to growth in both
group life and disability premiums and a lower benefits ratio on group disability products.

Revenues

2003 to
2002 Annual Comparison.

Revenues, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased by $104 million, or 3%, from 2002 to 2003. Group life insurance premiums increased by $81 million, or 4%,
to $2.176 billion primarily due to growth in business in force resulting from new sales and continued strong persistency, which declined slightly from 95% in 2002 to 93% in 2003. Group disability premiums, which include long-term care products,
increased by $56 million, or 10%, to $630 million reflecting the growth in business in force resulting from new sales and continued strong persistency, which decreased slightly from 87% in 2002 to 85% in 2003. We expect persistency for both group
life and disability to decrease from the current levels as a result of the pricing adjustments we implemented in 2002, as discussed below, and a highly competitive market. These increases in premiums were partially offset by a $9 million increase in
our estimate of amounts due policyholders on experience



rated cases, as discussed above. Policy charges and fee income declined by $42 million primarily as a result of a $17 million increase in our estimate of
amounts due policyholders on experience rated cases, as discussed above, and lower fees on experience rated contracts sold to employers for funding of employee benefit programs and retirement arrangements. Although net investment income was
relatively unchanged in 2003 from 2002, the portion of this income from policyholder loans declined, with a corresponding decline in interest credited to policyholders’ account balances, which resulted in a greater contribution from investment
results to adjusted operating income in 2003, as the remaining base of invested assets increased.

2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison.

Revenues increased by $338 million, or 10%, from 2001 to 2002. Group life insurance premiums
increased by $314 million, or 18%, to $2.095 billion primarily due to growth in business in force resulting from new sales and continued strong persistency, which decreased slightly from 97% in 2001 to 95% in 2002, as well as a change in coverage
for one large client from group universal life to group basic life. Group disability premiums, which include long-term care products, increased by $67 million, or 13%, to $574 million reflecting the growth in business in force resulting from new
sales and continued strong persistency, which decreased slightly from 89% in 2001 to 87% in 2002. The decreases in persistency are primarily a result of the pricing adjustments implemented in 2002, discussed below, and a highly competitive market.
Net investment income increased $35 million, or 6%, primarily due to a larger base of invested assets. These increases in revenue were partially offset by an $84 million decrease in policy charges and fee income primarily due to the change,
discussed above, in coverage for one large client from group universal life to group basic life.

Benefits and Expenses

The following table sets forth the Group Insurance segment’s benefits and administrative operating expense ratios for the periods indicated.

(1)

Ratio of policyholder benefits to earned premiums, policy charges and fee income. Group disability ratios include long-term care products.

(2)

Ratio of administrative operating expenses (excluding commissions) to gross premiums, policy charges and fee income. Group disability ratios include long-term care products.

2003 to 2002 Annual
Comparison.

Benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased by $90 million from 2002 to 2003. Current year benefits were reduced $34 million as a result of the
refinements in group life reserves for waiver of premium features discussed above, while the prior year benefited $19 million from reduction in benefits due to the refinement in reserves relating to our group long-term disability product. Excluding
these items, benefits and expenses increased $105 million. This increase resulted principally from an increase of $94 million in policyholders’ benefits, including change in policy reserves, reflecting the growth of business in force.

Beginning in 2002, we refocused group life and disability on
improved risk selection and reduced benefits ratios. We continuously make pricing adjustments, when contractually permitted, which consider the emerging experience on our group insurance products. While there can be no assurance, we expect these
actions, as well as pricing discipline in writing new business, will allow us to maintain or improve our benefits ratios.

The group life benefits ratio for 2003 improved 0.8 percentage points from 2002 reflecting lower claims incidence. The group disability benefits ratio
increased by 4.5 percentage points, of which 3.2 percentage points resulted from the reserve refinement in 2002 discussed above. The remaining 1.3 percentage point increase in the group disability benefits ratio is primarily due to a decrease in net
claim resolutions on our long-term disability products, partially offset by favorable morbidity experience on our other disability products. The group life and disability administrative operating expense ratios remained relatively unchanged from
2002 to 2003.



2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison.

Benefits and expenses increased by $253
million, or 8%, from 2001 to 2002. The increase resulted in large part from an increase of $213 million, or 9%, in policyholders’ benefits, including the change in policy reserves. Excluding the reserve refinements noted above,
policyholders’ benefits increased $268 million, or 11%, reflecting the growth of business in force. An increase of $25 million, or 5%, in operating expenses, including amortization of deferred acquisition costs, also contributed to the increase
in benefits and expenses. The increase in operating expenses, from $466 million in 2001 to $491 million in 2002, resulted primarily from the growth in business in force and related sales-based compensation costs.

The group life benefits ratio for 2002 improved 0.9 percentage points from
2001. Absent the negative impact to 2001 from the $36 million reserve refinement, the 2002 group life benefits ratio increased 0.8 percentage points reflecting higher claim incidence, primarily early in the year. The group disability benefits ratio
improved by 7.3 percentage points from 2001 to 2002. The benefit from the $19 million reserve refinement recorded in 2002 represented 3.2 percentage points of the improvement. The remainder of the improvement reflects improved case resolution and
our ongoing efforts to improve the quality of our underwriting and claims management processes. The group life administrative operating expense ratio remained flat from 2001 to 2002. The group disability administrative operating expense ratio
improved from 2001 to 2002 reflecting the impact of our efforts to improve operational efficiencies.

Sales Results

The following table sets forth the Group Insurance segment’s new annualized premiums for the periods indicated. In managing our group insurance
business, we analyze new annualized premiums, which do not correspond to revenues under GAAP because new annualized premiums measure the current sales performance of the business unit, while revenues primarily reflect the renewal persistency and
aging of in force policies written in prior years and net investment income in addition to current sales.

(1)

Amounts exclude new premiums resulting from rate changes on existing policies, from additional coverage under our Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance contract and from excess
premiums on group universal life insurance that build cash value but do not purchase face amounts and include premiums from the takeover of claim liabilities.

(2)

Includes long-term care products.

2003 to 2002 Annual Comparison.

Total new annualized premiums decreased $60 million, or 14%, from 2002 to 2003. Group life
sales decreased in 2003 due primarily to a smaller contribution from large case sales in 2003 as well as the expected slowing of our sales due to the implementation of pricing adjustments in 2002. Group disability sales decreased in 2003 due
primarily to one large sale in the fourth quarter of 2002.

2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison.

Total new annualized premiums decreased $145 million, or 25%, from 2001 to 2002 due to a decrease in group life sales. The group life sales decrease came from a decrease in sales
to new customers reflecting a sale of $99 million to one large customer in 2001 and the expected slowing of our sales due to the implementation of pricing adjustments in 2002, partially offset by increased sales to existing customers. Group
disability sales increased in 2002 due primarily to one large fourth quarter sale.



Investment Division

Investment Management

Operating Results

The following table sets forth the Investment Management segment’s operating results for the periods indicated.

(1)

Revenues exclude realized investment gains (losses), net. For a discussion of these items see “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments—Realized
Investment Gains.”

Adjusted Operating
Income

2003 to 2002 Annual
Comparison.

Adjusted operating income increased $23 million, from $139 million in 2002 to $162 million in 2003. The increase reflected lower expenses, excluding the impact of recent acquisitions, and higher asset-based
fees in our investment management and advisory operations, which were partially offset by a decline in retained fees as a result of the combination of our retail securities brokerage and clearing operations with those of Wachovia. We estimate the
decline in retained fees reduced the segment’s adjusted operating income for the second half of 2003 by $22 million.

2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income for 2002 was essentially unchanged from 2001. Lower fee revenues
resulting from declines in market value of the underlying equity assets under management as well as lower average mutual fund customer account balances on which our fees are based, and lower mortgage loan origination and servicing revenue were
largely offset by a decrease in expenses resulting from the decline in revenue and cost saving measures implemented in 2001. We incurred $23 million and $55 million of employee termination and facilities consolidation costs in 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

Revenues

The following tables set forth the Investment Management segment’s
revenues, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” by source and assets under management for the periods indicated. In managing our business we analyze assets under management, which do not correspond to GAAP assets,
because our primary sources of revenues are fees based on assets under management.

(1)

Consists of individual mutual funds and both variable annuities and variable life insurance asset management revenues from our separate accounts. This also includes funds invested
in proprietary mutual funds through our defined contribution plan products. Revenues from fixed annuities and the fixed rate options of both variable annuities and variable life insurance are included in the general account.

(2)

Represents mutual fund revenues other than asset management fees paid to affiliates, which are included in the appropriate categories above.



(1)

Consists of individual mutual funds, including investments in our mutual funds through wrap-fee products, and both variable annuities and variable life insurance assets in our
separate accounts. Fixed annuities and the fixed rate options of both variable annuities and variable life insurance are included in the general account.

(2)

Consists of third-party institutional assets and group insurance contracts.

2003 to 2002 Annual Comparison.

Revenues, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased
$24 million, from $1.235 billion in 2002 to $1.259 billion in 2003. The increase came primarily from the management of institutional customer assets inclusive of revenues associated with an international real estate asset manager that we acquired at
the end of 2002. A decline in mutual fund revenues from lower average account balances on which our fees are based was partially offset by the inclusion of revenues of the mutual fund business of American Skandia, commencing May 1, 2003.

2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison.

Revenues
decreased $122 million, from $1.357 billion in 2001 to $1.235 billion in 2002. The decrease came from a decline of $74 million in revenues from management of institutional and retail customer assets as well as a decline of $42 million in our mutual
fund revenue. The decrease in revenues from management of institutional and retail customer assets came primarily from declines in market value of the underlying equity assets under management on which our fees are based, as well as lower loan
origination and servicing revenue. The decline in mutual fund revenues was the result of lower average market values of customer accounts on which our fees are based.

Expenses

2003 to 2002 Annual Comparison.

Expenses, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” were
essentially unchanged from 2002. Lower employee termination and facility consolidation costs in 2003, and lower asset based and other expenses in our mutual fund operations were offset by the inclusion of expenses associated with the mutual fund
business of American Skandia commencing May 1, 2003 and an international real estate asset manager which we acquired at the end of 2002.

2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison.

Expenses decreased $120 million, from $1.216 billion in 2001 to $1.096 billion in 2002. The
decrease primarily reflects decreases in incentive compensation expenses. Additionally, our 2002 results reflect savings associated with cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2001. In 2002 and 2001 our results reflect $23 million and $55
million, respectively, in employee termination and facility consolidation costs.

Financial Advisory

Operating Results

The following table sets forth the Financial Advisory
segment’s operating results for the periods indicated.

(1)

Results of this segment are the same on both an adjusted operating income basis and a GAAP basis.



On July 1, 2003, we completed the previously announced agreement with Wachovia to combine each
company’s respective retail securities brokerage and clearing operations forming Wachovia Securities, a joint venture headquartered in Richmond, VA. We have a 38% ownership interest in the joint venture, while Wachovia owns the remaining 62%.
The transaction included our securities brokerage operations but did not include our equity sales, trading and research operations. As part of the transaction we retained certain assets and liabilities related to the contributed businesses,
including liabilities for certain litigation and regulatory matters. We account for our 38% ownership of the joint venture under the equity method of accounting; periods prior to July 1, 2003, continue to reflect the results of our previously
wholly-owned securities brokerage operations on a fully consolidated basis. Accordingly “—Operating Results”, as shown above for 2003, reflect our securities brokerage operations on a consolidated basis for 2001, 2002 and the first
six months of 2003 and earnings from the joint venture on the equity basis for the remaining six months of 2003. In addition, in the third quarter of 2003 we decided to exit our existing consumer banking business; therefore, the results of our
consumer banking operations previously included within the Financial Advisory segment are shown as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

2003 to 2002 Annual Comparison.

The Financial Advisory segment reported a loss, on an adjusted operating income basis, of
$111 million in 2003. This loss includes a loss of $53 million from our securities brokerage operations prior to combination of these operations with Wachovia on July 1, 2003. The segment’s loss for 2003 includes our share of earnings from
Wachovia Securities, on a pre-tax basis and excluding transition costs, of $88 million. Offsetting these results were expenses of $107 million relating primarily to obligations for litigation and regulatory matters we retained in connection with the
contributed businesses. Full year results from our securities brokerage operations for 2003 include $100 million of transition costs, of which $32 million represents our share of costs incurred by the venture, as well as a pre-tax gain of $22
million recorded on the completion of the combination of the businesses. In addition, results for 2003 include income of $2 million from our equity sales and trading operations that were not contributed to the new entity.

In 2002 the segment reported a loss of $43 million. The loss consisted of an
$87 million loss from our securities brokerage operations, which were contributed to the joint venture, partially offset by income of $44 million from our equity sales and trading operations.

2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison.

The Financial
Advisory segment reported losses, of $43 million for 2002 and $140 million for 2001. The $97 million decline in the segment’s loss came primarily from reduced losses in our securities brokerage operations that were contributed to the joint
venture, which reported a loss of $87 million for 2002 as compared to a loss of $180 million for 2001. These operations incurred costs of $38 million in 2002 and $65 million in 2001 to reduce staffing levels, occupancy and other overhead costs. The
reduction in the loss reflects lower non-interest expenses resulting from these actions, as well as the $27 million decrease in implementation costs, which together more than offset the negative impact of the continued decline in retail client
commissions and net interest revenue. Adjusted operating income from our equity sales and trading operations increased $4 million, to $44 million for 2002, due primarily to cost reduction initiatives and a decrease in costs associated with
implementing these initiatives, from $15 million in 2001 to $5 million in 2002.

Retirement

Operating Results

The following table sets forth the Retirement
segment’s operating results for the periods indicated.



(1)

Revenues exclude realized investment gains (losses), net, and related adjustments. For a discussion of these items see “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account
Investments—Realized Investment Gains.”

(2)

Benefits and expenses exclude related charges which represent the unfavorable (favorable) impact of net realized investment gains (losses), net, on change in reserves and deferred
policy acquisition cost amortization. For a discussion of these items see “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments—Realized Investment Gains.”

Adjusted Operating Income

2003 to 2002 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted
operating income increased $51 million, or 36%, in 2003 from 2002. Our guaranteed products business reported adjusted operating income of $193 million in 2003, an increase of $28 million from 2002, reflecting more favorable investment results and
lower operating expenses in the current year, partially offset by an $18 million decrease in income from prepayments of investments. As a result of the interest rate and market environment, our results reflect higher than expected income from
prepayment activity and favorable market conditions which may not continue at the same pace. The remainder of the increase in adjusted operating income came from the segment’s full service defined contribution business, which also benefited
from more favorable investment results and lower operating expenses in 2003.

2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income increased $31 million, or 28%, in 2002 from 2001 reflecting an increase in adjusted operating income of $26 million from our
guaranteed products business and a $5 million reduction in the loss from our full service defined contribution business. Our guaranteed products business reported adjusted operating income of $165 million in 2002. The increase reflects income in
2002 of $30 million from a single mortgage loan prepayment and the recording of a $29 million charge to recognize increased estimates of policy liabilities in 2001. Absent the impact of these items, adjusted operating income for the guaranteed
products business decreased $33 million, or 20%, mostly due to lower investment results in 2002.

Revenues

2003 to 2002 Annual Comparison.

Revenues, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” decreased
$94 million, or 4%, from 2002 to 2003. Net investment income decreased $47 million, from $2.090 billion in 2002 to $2.043 billion in 2003, due primarily to an $18 million decrease in income from prepayments of investments and a decline in yields
resulting from the reinvestment of assets in a lower interest rate environment. Premiums decreased $48 million on our guaranteed products business primarily as a result of lower single premium annuity and structured settlement product sales.

2002 to 2001 Annual
Comparison.

Revenues decreased $19 million from 2001 to 2002. Net investment income decreased $58 million, from $2.148 billion in 2001 to $2.090 billion in 2002, due to a decline in yields on invested assets, partially
offset by $30 million of income from a single mortgage loan prepayment in 2002. Policy charges and fee income decreased $9 million from 2002 to 2001 reflecting a decrease associated with our full service defined contribution business. Partially
offsetting these lower revenues, were premium increases of $57 million on our guaranteed products business primarily due to increased sales of structured settlement and single sum products and the recording of increased estimates of policy
liabilities for return premiums in 2001.

Benefits and
Expenses

2003 to 2002 Annual
Comparison.

Benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” decreased $145 million, or 6%, from 2002 to 2003. Policyholders’ benefits, together with the change in policy
reserves and interest credited to policyholders, decreased $121 million due to the decrease in premium activity noted above, as well as more favorable investment results in 2003 and lower crediting rates on customer balances. Operating expenses,
excluding amortization of deferred acquisition costs and commission expense, decreased $16 million from 2002 to 2003 reflecting cost reduction measures implemented in prior periods.

2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison.

Benefits and expenses decreased $50 million, or 2%, from 2001
to 2002. Policyholders’ benefits, together with the change in policy reserves and interest credited to policyholders, decreased $32 million from 2001 to 2002 reflecting the decline in yields and increased estimates on policy liabilities
recorded in 2001 as discussed above. These items were partly offset by the increase in premium activity noted above. Operating expenses, excluding amortization of deferred acquisition costs and commission expense, for our defined contribution
business decreased $21 million due primarily to cost reduction measures implemented in prior periods.



Sales Results and Account Values

The following table shows the changes in the account values and net sales of Retirement segment products for the periods
indicated. Net sales are total sales minus withdrawals or withdrawals and benefits, as applicable. Sales and net sales do not correspond to revenues under GAAP, but are used as a relevant measure of business activity.

(1)

The year ended December 31, 2002 includes increases to account values of $360 million added to customer accounts due to Common Stock received as demutualization consideration and
increases to account values of $448 million added to customer accounts from inclusion of amounts not previously reflected in this segment. The year ended December 31, 2001 includes increases to account values of $433 million added to customer
accounts due to Common Stock received as demutualization consideration.

(2)

Prudential’s retirement plan accounted for 15%, 32% and 29% of sales for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. This sales activity predominantly
represents repricing of scheduled maturities. These scheduled maturities are also reflected in withdrawals and therefore have no impact on net sales. Ending total account value includes assets of Prudential’s retirement plan of $9.7 billion,
$8.5 billion and $9.1 billion as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

(3)

Represents changes in asset balances for externally managed accounts. The year ended December 31, 2001 includes an increase to policyholder account values of $181 million
representing cumulative conversions of client balances to products currently included in the business.

2003 to 2002 Annual Comparison.

Account values in our full service defined contribution business amounted to $28.7 billion
as of December 31, 2003, an increase of $5.7 billion from $22.9 billion as of December 31, 2002. The increase came primarily from increases in the market value of mutual funds and separate accounts as well as net sales of $1.8 billion, primarily as
the result of a single large case sale in the third quarter of 2003. Account values for our guaranteed products business amounted to $42.0 billion as of December 31, 2003, an increase of $2.9 billion from December 31, 2002, reflecting an increase in
market value and interest income partially offset by net withdrawals of $757 million. Included in net withdrawals are sales of $1.050 billion from the sale of funding agreements issued through our Funding Agreement Notes Issuance Program that was
launched in 2003, as well a large sale in the third quarter of 2003 related to same case mentioned above.

2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison.

Account values in our full service defined contribution business amounted to $22.9 billion
as of December 31, 2002, a decrease of $1.7 billion from December 31, 2001. The decrease came primarily from a decline in market value of mutual funds reflecting the general downturn of the equity markets. This decline was partially offset by net
sales of $610 million and $808 million added to customer accounts from inclusion of amounts not previously reflected in this segment and Common Stock received as demutualization consideration. Account values for guaranteed products amounted to $39.1
billion as of December 31, 2002, a decrease of $767 million from December 31, 2001.



Other Asset Management

Operating Results

The following table sets forth the Other Asset Management segment’s operating results for the periods indicated.

(1)

Results of this segment are the same on both an adjusted operating income basis and a GAAP basis.

2003 to 2002 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income was essentially unchanged in 2003
from 2002, as an increase in earnings from our proprietary investment and syndication activities was offset by a decline in earnings from our hedge portfolios.

2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income decreased $10 million, from $55 million in 2001 to $45 million
in 2002. Increases in adjusted operating income from our commercial mortgage securitization operation and proprietary investment and syndication activities were more than offset by a decline in the adjusted operating income of our hedge portfolios,
which were significantly reduced in size during 2002.

International
Insurance and Investments Division

International Insurance

Our international insurance operations are subject to
currency fluctuations that can materially affect the U.S. dollar results of our international insurance operations from period to period even if results on a local currency basis are relatively constant. Exchange rates fluctuated significantly for
the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001. The financial results of our International Insurance segment reflect the impact of forward currency transactions and internal hedges, whereby some currency fluctuation exposure, primarily associated
with our Japanese insurance operations, including Gibraltar Life, is assumed in our Corporate and Other operations. These hedging transactions decreased adjusted operating income of the International Insurance segment by $46 million in 2003 and
increased its adjusted operating income by $32 million in 2002 and $45 million in 2001. An integral element in the management of this exposure is our execution of forward currency transactions with independent counterparties, the results of which
are reflected in Corporate and Other operations. Unless otherwise stated, we have translated all information in this section, including the impact of the currency hedging transactions, on the basis of actual exchange rates for the periods indicated.
To provide a better understanding of local operating performance, where indicated below, we have analyzed local results both on the basis of actual exchange rates and on the basis of constant exchange rates. When we discuss constant exchange rate
information below, it is on the basis of the average exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2003.



Operating Results

The following table sets forth the International Insurance segment’s operating results for the periods indicated.

(1)

Revenues exclude realized investment gains (losses), net. For a discussion of these items see “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments—Realized
Investment Gains.”

(2)

Benefits and expenses for Gibraltar Life exclude related charges which represent the portion of dividends to policyholders that represents realized investment gains required to be
paid as dividends to policyholders. For a discussion of these items see “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments—Realized Investment Gains.”

Adjusted Operating Income

2003 to 2002 Annual Comparison.

The decrease
in Gibraltar Life’s adjusted operating income reflected a $21 million negative impact of currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, adjusted operating income of Gibraltar Life increased $13 million in 2003 from 2002.
This increase reflected improved investment results in 2003 and the negative impact in 2002 of refinements in estimates, primarily related to amounts due to policyholders. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in the amount of Gibraltar
Life’s business in force as expected during the period following its restructuring and a less favorable level of policy benefits and expenses in 2003 than the year-ago period.

Adjusted operating income from our international insurance operations, other than Gibraltar Life, increased $70 million,
from $379 million in 2002 to $449 million in 2003. Adjusted operating income of our operations in countries other than Japan increased $56 million, from $37 million in 2002 to $93 million in 2003, including a $17 million favorable impact of currency
fluctuations. The $56 million increase came primarily from our operation in Korea, reflecting strong sales and continued favorable persistency. The contribution from continued growth of our Japanese insurance operation other than Gibraltar Life and
the more favorable level of policyholder benefits in 2003 was partially offset by a less favorable level of expenses which include costs of relocating to a new home office in Tokyo during the first quarter of 2003 and an $18 million negative impact
of currency fluctuations.

The segment’s increase in
adjusted operating income includes the effect of year over year fluctuations in currency exchange rates as well as the impact of our hedging at expected exchange rates. On a constant exchange rate basis, excluding the impact of currency hedging,
adjusted operating income, including results of Gibraltar Life, increased 11%.

2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison.

Adjusted operating income for Gibraltar Life increased $116 million from $262 million for the initial eight months of operations in 2001, which included a
$56 million gain from policy surrenders associated with the initial period of operations after restructuring, to $378 million for 2002. Gibraltar Life’s adjusted operating income for 2002 reflects charges from refinements of estimates,
primarily of amounts due to policyholders, and lower surrender gains due to more favorable persistency. The impact of these items was offset primarily by favorable mortality experience and a decrease in the estimated liability for guaranty fund
assessments.



Gibraltar Life’s $378 million adjusted operating income reported for 2002 included expenses of
approximately $25 million related to the refinements of estimates which considered Gibraltar Life’s first full year of operations following its reorganization, favorable mortality and improved investment results reflecting the transition from
short-term investments to longer-term investments consistent with our asset-liability management strategies. As a result of Gibraltar Life’s emergence from reorganization proceedings in April of 2001 and the reduction in benefits for in force
policies, when we established Gibraltar Life’s initial liability for future policy benefits, we assumed a higher than normal level of policy surrenders for the near term. Our surrender rate assumptions commencing at the date of reorganization
were 6% in the first year and 4% thereafter for paid-up policies and range from 2% to 38% in the first year, 3% to 14% in the second year, and 6% to 10% thereafter for premium paying policies. Gibraltar Life’s adjusted operating income included
in our results for 2002 was reduced by $21 million because of the deviation of policy surrenders from our initial assumptions.

Adjusted operating income, excluding Gibraltar Life, increased $30 million from $349 million in 2001 to $379 million in 2002. Adjusted operating income
from our Japanese insurance operation increased $7 million, from $335 million in 2001 to $342 million in 2002. The contribution from continued growth of our existing Japanese insurance operation was partially offset in 2002 by a $19 million negative
impact of currency fluctuations and a loss from the termination of a large case that provided individual life insurance coverage to multiple employees of an organization. Our adjusted operating income from operations in countries other than Japan
increased $23 million, from $14 million in 2001 to $37 million in 2002, as increased profits from our operation in Korea, reflecting strong sales and continued favorable persistency, offset continued costs of expansion into other countries and the
$8 million benefit to results of the year-ago period from a refinement in the methodology used to calculate reserves in our Korean operation. Excluding the impact of the currency fluctuations, our international insurance operations other than
Gibraltar Life would have had a 20% increase in adjusted operating income over the prior year.

The segment’s increase in adjusted operating income includes the effect of year-over-year fluctuations in currency exchange rates as well as the impact of our hedging at expected exchange rates. On a constant
exchange rate basis and excluding the impact of currency hedging, adjusted operating income, including results of Gibraltar Life, increased $175 million.

Revenues

2003 to 2002 Annual Comparison.

Revenues, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased
$582 million from 2002 to 2003, which include a net favorable impact of $291 million relating to currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, revenues increased $291 million, from $5.436 billion in 2002 to $5.727 billion in
2003. Revenues on this basis from our international insurance operations, other than Gibraltar Life, increased $419 million, or 17%. This increase in revenues came primarily from an increase in premiums and policy charges and fee income of $373
million, or 16%, from $2.343 billion in 2002 to $2.716 billion in 2003. Premiums and policy charges and fee income from our Japanese operation other than Gibraltar Life increased $210 million, from $1.734 billion in 2002 to $1.944 billion in 2003
and premiums from our Korean operation increased $120 million, from $459 million in 2002 to $579 million in 2003. The increase in premium and policy charges and fee income in both operations was primarily the result of new sales and strong
persistency. Premiums in all other countries increased modestly from 2002 to 2003.

Revenues for Gibraltar Life excluding the impact of the currency fluctuations, decreased $128 million, from $2.898 billion in 2002 to $2.770 billion in 2003. Gibraltar Life’s decrease of $128 million is primarily
due to a $114 million decline in premium revenue. The decline in premium revenue reflects a reduction in the in force business resulting from a higher than normal level of policy surrenders associated with the periods following Gibraltar Life’s
restructuring.

2002 to 2001 Annual
Comparison.

Revenues increased $927 million from $4.146 billion in 2001 to $5.073 billion in 2002, including a net unfavorable effect of $191 million related to currency fluctuations. Revenues on a constant exchange rate
basis increased $1.118 billion, $765 million from Gibraltar Life and $353 million from our international insurance operations other than Gibraltar Life. The $353 million increase in revenues from our international insurance operations other than
Gibraltar Life came primarily from an increase in premium revenue of $301 million, or 16%, from $1.925 billion in 2001 to $2.226 billion in 2002. Premiums, on this same basis, from our Korean operation increased $150 million, from $309 million in
2001 to $459 million in 2002, and premiums in our Japanese operation other than Gibraltar Life increased $125 million primarily the result of strong persistency and new sales. Premium revenue in all other countries increased $26 million from 2001 to
2002.



Benefits and Expenses

2003 to 2002 Annual Comparison.

Benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under
“—Operating Results,” increased $520 million, from $4.316 billion in 2002 to $4.836 billion in 2003, which include a negative impact of $316 million relating currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations,
benefits and expenses increased $204 million reflecting a $347 million increase in our international insurance operations, other than Gibraltar Life, partially offset by a $143 million decrease from Gibraltar Life. The $347 million increase in our
international insurance operations, other than Gibraltar Life, reflects an increase in policyholders’ benefits, including changes in reserves, and an increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs resulting from the aging of
business in force and a greater volume of business in force in our Japanese and Korean operations, which was driven by new sales and continued strong persistency.

Gibraltar Life’s benefits and expenses increased $34 million, from $2.316 billion in 2002 to $2.350 billion in 2003,
which include an increase of $177 million relating to year over year fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of the currency fluctuations, benefits and expenses decreased $143 million, from $2.518 billion in 2002 to $2.375
billion in 2003. The $143 million decrease is primarily due to a decrease in policyholder benefits, including changes in reserves, as a result of a continued reduction of the in force business resulting from a higher than normal level of policy
surrenders associated with the periods following Gibraltar Life’s restructuring.

2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison.

Benefits and expenses increased $781 million from $3.535 billion in 2001 to $4.316 billion in 2002, including a $552 million increase from Gibraltar Life.
Excluding the impact of the Gibraltar Life acquisition, benefits and expenses increased $229 million, or 13%, from $1.771 billion in 2001 to $2.000 billion in 2002. The $229 million increase in benefits and expenses came primarily from an increase
of $164 million in policyholders’ benefits, which includes the change in reserves for future policy benefits, and an increase of $56 million in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs. Policyholders’ benefits increased from
$1.382 billion in 2001 to $1.546 billion in 2002. The increase reflected a greater volume of business in force, which was driven by the aging of business in force in markets where our operations are more mature, new sales, and continued strong
persistency, partially offset by the impact of currency fluctuations. On a constant exchange rate basis, total segment benefits and expenses increased $944 million.

Sales Results

In managing our international insurance business, we analyze new annualized premiums, which do not correspond to revenues under GAAP, as well as revenues,
because new annualized premiums measure the current sales performance of the segment, while revenues reflect the renewal persistency and aging of in force policies written in prior years and net investment income, in addition to current sales. New
annualized premiums on an actual and constant exchange rate basis are as follows for the periods indicated.

2003 to 2002 Annual
Comparison.

On a constant exchange rate basis, new annualized premiums increased $114 million, or 14%, from 2002 to 2003, reflecting a $46 million increase from Gibraltar Life. On the same basis, new annualized premiums
from our Japanese insurance operation other than Gibraltar Life increased $66 million, or 20%, to $398 million in 2003, which benefited from the conclusion of an agent conference qualification period. There was no similar benefit to 2002. An
increase in the Life Planner count also contributed to the growth in sales. Sales in all other countries, also on a constant exchange rate basis were essentially unchanged, primarily as a result of the benefit to sales in 2002 in our operation in
Korea, from sales activity in anticipation of a premium rate increase in April 2002.



2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison.

On a constant exchange rate basis, new
annualized premiums increased $69 million from 2001 to 2002, including an increase of $137 million from Gibraltar Life. On that basis, new annualized premiums from our operations in Japan were $584 million in 2002, including $253 million from
Gibraltar Life, compared to $505 million in 2001 when Gibraltar Life’s sales force sold policies for our existing Japanese insurance operation during a portion of the year, pending the completion of Gibraltar Life’s reorganization. Since
the first quarter of 2001, the Gibraltar Life sales force has distributed only Gibraltar Life products. Sales in Japan other than Gibraltar Life during 2001 were particularly strong due to anticipated premium rate increases that took effect on April
1, 2001 and October 1, 2001. Sales in all other countries, also on a constant exchange rate basis, decreased $11 million as a result of a decrease from our operations in Taiwan and Korea, where 2002 sales were affected by premium rate increases in
2001.

Investment Margins and Other Profitability Factors

Many of our insurance products sold in international
markets provide for the buildup of cash values for the policyholder at mandated guaranteed interest rates. The spread between the actual investment returns and these guaranteed rates of return to the policyholder is an element of the profit or loss
that we will experience on these products. Interest rates guaranteed in our Japanese insurance contracts are regulated by Japanese authorities. Between July 1, 1996, and April 1, 1999, we guaranteed premium rates using an interest rate of 3.1% on
most of the products we sold in Japan even though the yield on Japanese government and high-quality corporate bonds was less than that much of this time. This resulted in some negative investment spreads for much of this business over this period.
As a consequence, our profitability with respect to these products in Japan during that period resulted primarily from margins on mortality, morbidity and expense charges. In response to the low interest rate environment, Japanese regulators
approved a reduction in the required rates for most of the products we sell to 2.35% in April 1999, which results in our charging higher premiums on new business for the same amount of insurance. While this has also resulted in an improvement in
investment spreads, these spreads continued to have a negative impact on adjusted operating income from our Japanese insurance operation other than Gibraltar Life in 2003, 2002, and 2001 and the profitability of these products in Japan continues to
result primarily from margins on mortality, morbidity, and expense charges. In 2001 and 2003, Japanese regulators approved further reductions in the required interest rates applicable to most of the products we sell. As a result, we increased
premium rates on many of our products sold in Japan when the new rates were implemented, in April 2001, October 2001, and August 2003 for some products. Additionally, interest rates on our guaranteed products sold in Korea are regulated by Korean
authorities, who approved, in April 2001, January 2002, April 2002, and January 2003, reductions in the required interest rates credited for most of the products we sell, allowing us to charge higher premiums on new business for the same amount of
insurance. While these actions enhance our ability to set rates commensurate with available investment returns, the major sources of profitability on our products in Korea, as in Japan, are margins on mortality, morbidity and expense charges rather
than investment spreads.

We base premiums and cash values in
most countries in which we operate on mandated mortality tables. Our mortality experience in the International Insurance segment on an overall basis for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was well within our pricing assumptions and below the guaranteed levels
reflected in the premiums we charge.

International Investments

Operating Results

The following table sets forth the International Investments segment’s
operating results for the periods indicated. In the second quarter of 2003 we decided to exit certain operations of two Japanese asset management units, and all periods presented below exclude the results of these operations, as they have been
included within divested businesses.

(1)

Revenues exclude realized investment gains (losses), net. For a discussion of these items see “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments—Realized
Investment Gains.”



2003 to 2002 Annual Comparison.

Our International Investments segment
reported a loss, on an adjusted operating income basis, of $17 million for 2003, compared to a loss of $6 million in 2002, as 2003 included a charge of $34 million to write off a receivable related to an investment in Korea. Excluding this charge,
adjusted operating income increased $23 million. The improved results reflect the benefit of recently acquired units and a lower level of expenses related to our existing businesses, as well as higher earnings from our global derivatives businesses.

2002 to 2001 Annual
Comparison.

Our International Investments segment reported a loss, on an adjusted operating income basis, of $6 million for 2002 compared to a loss of $44 million in 2001. The $38 million reduction in the loss reflected
earnings from recently acquired units and lower expenses resulting from our earlier actions to reduce the cost structure.

Corporate and Other Operations

Corporate and Other operations include corporate-level activities that we do not allocate to our business segments, real estate and relocation services,
and international ventures and businesses that we have placed in wind-down status but have not divested, which, collectively, we refer to as “Other Businesses.”

Corporate-level activities consist primarily of corporate-level income and expenses not allocated to any of our business
segments, costs for company-wide initiatives in years prior to 2003, income from our qualified pension plans and investment returns on capital that is not deployed in any of our segments. Corporate-level activities also include returns from
investments that we do not allocate to any of our business segments, including a debt-financed investment portfolio, which was substantially reduced in 2001 and liquidated in 2002, as well as the impact of transactions with other segments.
Corporate-level activities also include certain retained obligations relating to policyholders with whom we had previously agreed to provide insurance for reduced or no premium in accordance with contractual settlements related to prior individual
life sales practices remediation.

2003 to 2002 Annual Comparison.

Corporate and
Other operations resulted in adjusted operating income of $93 million in 2003 and $160 million in 2002, a decline of $67 million. Adjusted operating income from corporate-level activities decreased $79 million, from $121 million in 2002 to $42
million in 2003. Income from our qualified pension plan declined $130 million, from $502 million in 2002 to $372 million in 2003, reflecting a decline in the expected rate of return on plan assets from 9.50% to 8.75% and a reduction in the discount
rate from 7.25% to 6.50%. For purposes of calculating pension income from our own qualified pension plan for the year ended December 31, 2004, we will apply a discount rate of 5.75%, compared to 6.50% in 2003, and we will continue to apply an
expected return on plan assets of 8.75% and a 4.50% rate of increase in compensation levels. We determined our expected return on plan assets based upon the arithmetic average of prospective returns, which is based upon a risk free rate as of the
measurement date adjusted by a risk premium that considers historical statistics and expected investment manager performance, for equity, debt and real estate markets applied on a weighted average basis to our pension asset portfolio. Giving effect
to the foregoing assumptions, we expect that income from our own qualified pension plan will continue to contribute to



adjusted operating income in 2004, but at a level of about $20 million to $30 million below that of the year 2003. In 2004, pension service costs related to
active employees will be allocated to our business segments. The increase in allocated expenses to our business segments will be partially offset by a reduction in the allocation of other benefit costs related to non-active employees which will be
retained in Corporate-level activities. Investment income, net of interest expense, declined by $57 million, reflecting the funding of the acquisition of American Skandia and share repurchases. Corporate-level general and administrative expenses
were $551 million in 2003, before qualified pension income, compared to $626 million in 2002, a decrease of $75 million. General and administrative expenses for 2003 included $37 million of costs related to a structured financing transaction.
General and administrative expenses, other than this cost, decreased by $112 million primarily due to reduced costs pertaining to certain company-wide initiatives, as well as our outsourcing of certain human resource support functions to a third
party.

Corporate-level activities included $23 million of
costs in 2003 from retained obligations relating to policyholders with whom we had previously agreed to provide insurance for reduced or no premium in accordance with contractual settlements related to prior individual life sales practices
remediation, as compared to $96 million in 2002. The lower costs in 2003 were primarily attributable to improved equity market conditions in 2003. The costs in 2002 were partially offset by a $26 million reduction of a liability we established in
2001 for death and other benefits due with respect to policies for which we had not received a death claim but where death had occurred, due to a change in our estimate.

Other businesses included in Corporate and Other operations resulted in adjusted operating income of $51 million in 2003
compared to $39 million in 2002. The improvement relates to our real estate and relocation business, which benefited from decreased expenses in the current period.

2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison

.    Corporate and Other operations resulted in adjusted operating
income of $160 million in 2002 and a loss of $25 million in 2001, an increase of $185 million. Corporate-level activities resulted in adjusted operating income of $121 million in 2002 and $1 million in 2001. The increase was primarily due to higher
investment income, net of interest expense, of $44 million. Corporate-level activities benefited from the impact of the transfer of net assets from the Traditional Participating Products segment at the date of our demutualization and from cash and
short-term investments held at the parent company. This additional investment income was offset by lower returns from joint venture and limited partnership investments and reduced investment income, net of interest expense, from the wind-down of a
debt-financed portfolio and lower yields on corporate-level invested assets.

Corporate-level general and administrative expenses were $626 million in 2002, before qualified pension income, compared to $727 million in 2001. Lower expenses, reflecting in part the impact of previous expense
reduction initiatives, more than offset expenses incurred in the 2002 period associated with servicing our stockholder base and expenses associated with the implementation of our organizational changes announced in August 2002. Income from our own
qualified pension plan amounted to $502 million in 2002, compared to $540 million in 2001. The $38 million decline reflects changes in pension plan assumptions, primarily a decrease in the discount rate from 7.75% to 7.25%.

Corporate-level activities in 2002 included expenses of $96 million related
to supplemental benefits paid to policyholders whom we had previously agreed to provide insurance for reduced or no premium in accordance with contractual settlements related to prior individual life sales practices remediation. These expenses were
partially offset by a $26 million reduction, in 2002, of a liability we established in 2001 for death and other benefits due with respect to policies for which we had not received a death claim but where death had occurred, due to a change in our
estimate.

In 2001 Corporate-level activities included a $20
million charge offsetting the income earned by Prudential Securities as co-manager in the initial public offering of our Common Stock, which was included in adjusted operating income of our Financial Advisory segment.

Other businesses included in Corporate and Other operations resulted in
adjusted operating income of $39 million in 2002, as compared to a loss, on an adjusted operating income basis, of $26 million in 2001. The improvement relates primarily to our real estate and relocation business, which reported adjusted operating
income of $46 million in 2002 compared to a loss, on an adjusted operating income basis, of $11 million in 2001. The loss in 2001 reflected expenses of $35 million incurred by this business to consolidate its operating facilities, while 2002 results
benefited from increased transaction volume, lower expense levels and activities of a subsidiary acquired in the fourth quarter of 2001. In addition, losses from the remaining operations included in other businesses decreased $8 million, on an
adjusted operating income basis, from $15 million in 2001 to $7 million in 2002, primarily reflecting the write-off of goodwill in our international ventures unit in 2001.



Divested Businesses

Our income from continuing operations before income taxes includes results from several businesses that have been or will be
sold or exited that do not qualify for “discontinued operations” accounting treatment under GAAP. The results of divested business are reflected in our Corporate and Other operations. A summary of the income from continuing operations
before income taxes for these businesses is as follows for the periods indicated:

Property and Casualty Insurance

In the fourth quarter of 2003, we completed our
previously announced agreements to sell our property and casualty insurance companies that operate nationally in

48 states outside of New Jersey, and the District of Columbia, to Liberty Mutual Group (“Liberty Mutual”), as well as
our New Jersey property and casualty insurance companies to Palisades Group. Results of the property and casualty insurance operations have been reclassified as a divested business for all periods presented.

Historically, the Individual Life and Annuities segment has been compensated
for property and casualty insurance products sold through its distribution network. Following the sale of the property and casualty insurance operations, Prudential Agents will have continued access to non-proprietary property and casualty products
under distribution agreements entered into with the purchasers of these businesses, and therefore, the Individual Life and Annuities segment will continue to be compensated for sales of these products, although the extent of these revenues cannot be
predicted. In addition, certain expenses incurred at the corporate level that previously were allocated to the Property and Casualty Insurance segment have been reclassified to Corporate and Other operations, for all periods presented. These
expenses, which we will seek to mitigate over time, will continue to be absorbed by Corporate and Other operations in future periods.

In addition, in 2003 we sold our specialty automobile insurance business and entered into an agreement to sell our work-place distribution property and
casualty insurance operations, which closed in the first quarter of 2004. The results of operations for these businesses are included in “Loss from discontinued operations” for all periods presented.

Operating Results

The following table sets forth the Property and Casualty Insurance
segment’s operating results for the periods indicated:

Income From
Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes

2003 to 2002
Annual Comparison.

Income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $418 million, from income of $71 million in 2002 to a loss of $347 million in 2003. The loss in 2003 includes a charge of $491 million,
which primarily reflects the write-down of the assets to be sold to fair value and management’s best



estimate of the cost of retained liabilities. The retained liabilities include pre-closing litigation and obligations under reinsurance contracts provided in
connection with potential adverse loss development on the business sold to Liberty Mutual. Excluding the $491 million charge recorded in the 2003 period, income from continuing operations increased by $73 million, primarily reflecting improved
underwriting results.

2002 to 2001 Annual
Comparison.

Income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased $129 million, from $200 million in 2001 to $71 million in 2002. Results for 2002 reflected a $102 million lower net benefit from prior
accident-year development and a $39 million lower benefit from stop-loss reinsurance recoveries.

Other Divested Businesses

The results for the Prudential Securities capital markets businesses in 2003 include the gain from a $332 million settlement of an arbitration award. Partly offsetting this gain in 2003, are losses related to the
residual investment portfolio of the business that continues to be liquidated. The losses in 2002 and 2001 also reflect the liquidation of the residual investment portfolio, as well as costs related to the wind-down of the business.

The results for the Gibraltar Casualty Company, a commercial property and
casualty insurer that we sold in September 2000 to Everest Re Group, Ltd. (“Everest”), reflect losses of $81 million in 2003 and $79 million in 2002 from a stop-loss reinsurance agreement we entered into pursuant to the sale, whereby if
and when aggregate post-sale claim and claim-related payments exceed Gibraltar Casualty’s reserves recorded at the time of sale, we will pay Everest for 80% of the first $200 million of such excess. As of December 31, 2003, we are fully
reserved for future payments under this agreement.

Also
reflected in other divested businesses are the results of the Prudential Home Mortgage business and certain international securities operations, as well as the operations of certain Japanese asset management units.

Sales Practices Remedies and Costs

Our income from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended
December 31, 2002 includes a pre-tax charge of $20 million of additional individual life sales practices costs including related administrative costs, litigation costs and settlements, which is reflected in our Corporate and Other operations.

Demutualization Costs and Expenses

We incurred costs and expenses related to demutualization totaling $588
million for the year ended December 31, 2001, which are reflected in our Corporate and Other operations. Demutualization costs in 2001 included $340 million of demutualization consideration paid to our former Canadian branch policyholders.
Demutualization expenses consisted primarily of the costs of engaging independent accounting, actuarial, investment banking, legal and other consultants that advised us and insurance regulators in the demutualization process and related matters as
well as printing and postage for communication with policyholders.

Results of Operations of Closed Block Business

We established the Closed Block Business effective at the date of demutualization. The Closed Block Business includes our in force traditional participating life insurance and annuity products and assets that are being used for the payment
of benefits and policyholder dividends on these policies, as well as other assets and equity and related liabilities that support these policies. We no longer offer these traditional participating policies. See “—Overview—Financial
Services Businesses and Closed Block Business” for additional details.

At the end of each year, the Board of Directors of Prudential Insurance determines the dividends payable for participating policies for the following year based on its statutory results and past experience, including
investment income, net realized investment gains over a number of years, mortality experience and other factors. As required by GAAP, we developed an actuarial calculation of the timing of the maximum future earnings from the policies included in
the Closed Block, and if actual cumulative earnings in any given period are greater than the cumulative earnings we expect, we will record this excess as a policyholder dividend obligation. We will subsequently pay this excess to



Closed Block policyholders as an additional dividend unless it is otherwise offset by future Closed Block performance that is less favorable than we
originally expected. The policyholder dividends we charge to expense within the Closed Block Business will include any policyholder dividend obligations that we recognize for the excess of actual cumulative earnings in any given period over the
cumulative earnings we expect in addition to the actual policyholder dividends declared by the Board of Directors of Prudential Insurance. If cumulative performance is less favorable than we expected, the policyholder dividends we charge to expense
within the Closed Block Business will be the actual dividends declared by the Board of Directors. Subsequent to the date of demutualization, there was no required charge to expense to recognize a policyholder dividend obligation for the excess of
actual cumulative earnings in any given period over the cumulative earnings we expect. However, net unrealized investment gains that have arisen subsequent to the establishment of the Closed Block have been reflected as a policyholder dividend
obligation to be paid to Closed Block policyholders, unless otherwise offset by future experience, with an offsetting amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, and, as such, we have a policyholder dividend obligation to Closed Block
policyholders of $2.443 billion recorded as of December 31, 2003.

Operating Results

Management does not
consider adjusted operating income to assess operating performance of the Closed Block Business. Consequently, results of the Closed Block Business for all periods are presented only in accordance with GAAP. The following table sets forth the Closed
Block Business GAAP results for the periods indicated.

Income from
Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes

2003 to 2002
Annual Comparison.

Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased $1.127 billion to $370 million in 2003, from a loss of $757 million in 2002. The increase in income from continuing operations before
income taxes reflects an increase in realized investment gains (losses), net, of $1.013 billion in 2003 from 2002. In addition, dividends to policyholders decreased by $54 million, reflecting reductions in the dividend scale for 2003, and a decline
in operating expenses of $49 million. For a discussion of Closed Block Business realized investment gains (losses), net, see “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account Investments—Realized Investment Gains.”

2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison.

Loss from
continuing operations before income taxes increased $138 million, to $757 million for 2002 from $619 million in 2001. The increase in the loss from continuing operations before income taxes reflects a decline in net investment income, including
interest expense on the IHC debt, of $402 million. This decline reflects our transfer of $5.6 billion of net assets previously associated with the former Traditional Participating Products segment at the date of our demutualization in late 2001 and
a lower investment yield on the assets remaining in the Closed Block Business, as well as interest expense associated with the IHC debt that we issued in December 2001. Partially offsetting these items was a decrease in the charge for policyholder
dividends of $127 million, reflecting changes in the dividend scale for 2002 and 2003. In addition, we established $144 million of reserves in 2001 for death and other benefits due with respect to policies for which we had not received a death claim
but where death had occurred. Lastly, we benefited from our expense reduction efforts, for which the Closed Block Business incurred $48 million of implementation costs in 2001.

Revenues

2003 to 2002 Annual Comparison.

Revenues, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” increased
$861 million, or 12%, in 2003 from 2002. Realized investment gains (losses), net, increased $1.013 billion, from net realized investment losses of $587 million in 2002 to net realized investment gains of $426 million in 2003. Premiums decreased $162
million from $4.022 billion in 2002 to $3.860 billion in 2003. We expect the decline in premiums for this business to continue as the policies in force mature or terminate in this closed block of traditional participating insurance.



2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison

.    Revenues decreased $607 million, or 8%,
from 2001 to 2002. Net investment income declined $279 million, from $3.897 billion in 2001 to $3.618 billion in 2002, for the reasons discussed above. Premiums decreased $228 million, or 5%, from $4.250 billion in 2001 to $4.022 billion in 2002,
reflecting a decline in first year and renewal premiums as well as paid-up additions, which represent additional insurance purchased with policyholder dividends. Realized investment losses, net of gains, increased $44 million, from $543 million in
2001 to $587 million in 2002.

Benefits and Expenses

2003 to 2002 Annual
Comparison.

Benefits and expenses, as shown in the table above under “—Operating Results,” decreased $266 million, or 3%, in 2003 from 2002. Policyholder benefits and related changes in reserves, including
interest credited to policyholders’ accounts, decreased $131 million, from $4.444 billion in 2002 to $4.313 billion in 2003, consistent with the discontinuation of sales of traditional products, as discussed above. Dividends to policyholders
amounted to $2.452 billion in 2003, a decrease of $54 million, from $2.506 billion in 2002, reflecting reductions in the dividend scale for 2003 based on evaluations of the experience underlying the dividend scale. Operating expenses, including
distribution costs that we charge to expense, decreased $49 million in 2003 from 2002, reflecting lower distribution costs as we have discontinued sales of traditional products as well as our continued efforts to reduce operating cost levels.

2002 to 2001 Annual
Comparison.

Benefits and expenses decreased $469 million, or 6%, from 2001 to 2002. Operating expenses, including distribution costs that we charge to expense, decreased $136 million, from 2001 to 2002, reflecting our
efforts to reduce operating cost levels and $48 million of implementation costs for this program incurred by the Closed Block Business in 2001. An increase in interest expense associated with the IHC debt we issued in December 2001 was a partial
offset. Policyholder benefits and related changes in reserves, including interest credited to policyholders’ accounts, decreased $278 million, from $4.722 billion in 2001 to $4.444 billion in 2002. Policyholder benefits for 2001 included $144
million of reserves established for death and other benefits due with respect to policies for which we had not received a death claim but where death has occurred. Reserves established for new and renewal business decreased in 2002, consistent with
our expectations and reflecting our discontinuation of sales of traditional products discussed above, partially offset by growth in reserves due to aging of policies in force. Dividends to policyholders amounted to $2.506 billion in 2002, a decrease
of $127 million, or 5%, from $2.633 billion in 2001. The decline reflects reductions in the dividend scales for 2002 and 2003 based on evaluations of the experience underlying the dividend scale.

Policy Surrender Experience

The following table sets forth policy surrender experience for the Closed
Block Business, measured by cash value of surrenders, for the periods indicated. In managing this business, we analyze the cash value of surrenders because it is a measure of the degree to which policyholders are maintaining their in force business
with us, a driver of future profitability.

2003 to 2002 Annual
Comparison.

The total cash value of surrenders increased $130 million in 2003 from 2002. The level of surrenders as a percentage of mean future policy benefit reserves increased to 2.9% in 2003 from 2.6% in 2002. The
increase reflects the surrender of a few large cash value policies during 2003.

2002 to 2001 Annual Comparison.

The total cash value of surrenders decreased $12 million in 2002 from 2001, primarily as a result of our efforts during 2001 to locate policyholders in
connection with our demutualization. The level of surrenders as a percentage of mean future policy benefit reserves was relatively unchanged in 2002 from 2001.



Income Taxes

Shown below is our income tax provision (benefit) for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, separately
reflecting the impact of certain significant items. Also presented below is the income tax provision (benefit) that would have resulted from application of the statutory 35% federal income tax rate in each of these periods.

For the year ended
December 31, 2003, the difference between taxes excluding the items shown above and taxes that would have resulted from the application of the statutory rate is attributable, in part, to nontaxable investment income, reductions in foreign tax rates
and an increase in tax credits, partially offset by an increase in state taxes.

For the year ended December 31, 2001, the difference between taxes excluding the items shown above and taxes that would have resulted from the application of the statutory rate is attributable, in part, to the
inclusion of non-deductible demutualization costs and expenses in income from continuing operations.

Discontinued Operations

Included within net income are the results of businesses which are reflected as discontinued operations under GAAP. A summary of the results of discontinued operations by business is as follows for the periods
indicated:

Realized Investment
Gains and General Account Investments

Realized Investment Gains

Realized investment gains, net of losses, primarily
include gains and losses resulting from sales and impairments of fixed income and equity investments, prepayment premiums we receive on private bond issues, and gains and losses in connection with derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge
accounting treatment. We perform impairment reviews on an ongoing basis and record an impairment charge when we determine that a decline in value is other than temporary. The level of impairments generally reflects economic conditions and is
expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and to decrease when economic conditions improve. We may realize additional credit-related losses through sales of investments pursuant to our credit risk and portfolio management objectives. We
require most issuers of private fixed maturity securities to pay us make-whole yield maintenance payments when they prepay the securities. Prepayments are driven by factors specific to the activities of our borrowers as much as by the interest rate
environment.



We use derivative contracts to hedge the risk that changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange
rates will affect the market value of certain investments. We also use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk that unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates will reduce U.S. dollar equivalent earnings generated by certain of our non-U.S.
businesses. Derivative contracts also include forward purchases and sales of to-be-announced mortgage-backed securities primarily related to our mortgage dollar roll program. The vast majority of these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge
accounting, and consequently we recognize the changes in fair value of such contracts from period to period in current earnings, although we do not necessarily account for the hedged assets or liabilities the same way. Accordingly, realized
investment gains and losses from our hedging activities contribute significantly to fluctuations in net income.

The comparisons below discuss realized investment gains, net of losses and related charges and adjustments. Related charges, which are not applicable to
the Closed Block Business, pertain to policyholder dividends, deferred policy acquisition costs and reserves for future policy benefits. A percentage of net realized investment gains on specified Gibraltar Life assets is required to be paid as
dividends to Gibraltar Life policyholders. We amortize deferred policy acquisition costs for interest sensitive products based on estimated gross profits, which include net realized investment gains on the underlying invested assets, and the related
charge for amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs represents the amortization related to net realized investment gains. We adjust the reserves for some of our policies when cash flows related to these policies are affected by net realized
investment gains, and the related charge for reserves for future policy benefits represents that adjustment. The changes in these related charges from one period to another may be disproportionate to the changes in realized investment gains, net of
losses, evaluated over several periods.

A portion of realized
gains, pertaining to certain derivative results, is included in adjusted operating income. Pursuant to a currency hedging program, we execute forward sale contracts in the hedged currencies in exchange for U.S. dollars at a specified exchange rate.
The maturities of these contracts correspond with future periods in which non-U.S. earnings are expected to be generated. These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under GAAP. All resulting profits or losses from such contracts, including
mark-to-market adjustments of open contracts, are included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” When the contracts are terminated in the same period that the expected earnings emerge, the resulting positive or negative cash flow
is included in adjusted operating income. In addition, we utilize interest and currency swaps to manage interest and currency exchange rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities, including duration mismatches. For the swap
contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, mark-to-market adjustments of open contracts as well as periodic settlements are included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” Periodic settlements pertaining to such
contracts are included in adjusted operating income.



The following tables set forth realized investment gains (losses), net, by investment type for the
Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business, as well as related charges and adjustments associated with the Financial Services Businesses, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. For a discussion of our
investment portfolio and related results, including overall income yield and investment income, as well our policies regarding other than temporary declines in investment value, see “—General Account Investments” below.

2003 to 2002 Annual
Comparison.

The Financial Services Businesses’ net realized investment losses in 2003 were $156 million compared to $778 million in 2002. Realized losses in 2003 included fixed maturity impairments of $266 million and
credit-related losses of $22 million compared with $385 million and $470 million for 2002, respectively. Impairments in 2003 were concentrated in the manufacturing, finance, services and transportation sectors and were primarily driven by downgrades
in credit, bankruptcy or other adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers. Impairments in 2002 were concentrated in the transportation, technology, services, finance and manufacturing sectors and were primarily driven by downgrades in
credit, bankruptcy or other adverse financial conditions of the respective issuers. Realized losses in 2003 and 2002 on fixed maturity securities were offset, in part, by realized gains driven largely by sales of fixed maturity securities in a
declining rate environment, along with gains on private bond prepayment premiums. We realized net gains on equity securities of $23 million in 2003 compared to net losses of $149 million in 2002. We recognized $101 million and $164 million of
impairments on equity securities in 2003 and 2002, respectively, primarily related to our Gibraltar Life operations. The equity securities impairments in both periods were primarily the result of market declines over a prolonged period. Impairments
on equity securities in 2003 were more than offset by equity trading gains, primarily in Gibraltar Life, as it shifted its portfolio to a passive index strategy. Realized losses in 2003 include net derivative losses of $231 million, compared to net
derivative losses of $226 million in 2002. The losses in 2003 included negative mark-to-market adjustments of $161 million on forward currency contracts used to hedge the future income of non-U.S. businesses, driven by the weakening of the U.S.
dollar. Derivative losses in 2002 were primarily the result of losses of $152 million on treasury futures contracts used to manage the duration of the Company’s fixed maturity investment portfolio, as well as losses of $88 million on foreign
currency forward contracts used to hedge the future income of non-U.S. businesses, driven by the weakening of the U.S. dollar.



For the Closed Block Business, net realized investment gains in 2003 were $426 million compared to losses
of $587 million in 2002. Realized gains in 2003 reflected net realized gains on sales of fixed maturity securities in a declining rate environment and private bond prepayment premiums, partially offset by fixed maturity impairments of $123 million
and credit-related losses of $46 million. Impairments in 2003 were concentrated in the manufacturing, finance, and services sectors and were primarily driven by downgrades in credit, bankruptcy or other adverse financial conditions of the respective
issuers. Realized losses in 2002 included $302 million of fixed maturity impairments and $420 million of credit-related losses, which were partially offset by realized gains on sales of fixed maturity securities in a declining rate environment and
private bond prepayment gains. Impairments in 2002 were concentrated in the transportation, services, technology, and finance sectors and were primarily driven by downgrades in credit, bankruptcy or other adverse financial conditions of the
respective issuers. We realized net losses on equity securities of $33 million in 2003, including $59 million of impairments, compared to losses of $186 million in 2002, which included $145 million of impairments. The equity security impairments in
both periods were primarily the result of market declines over a prolonged period. Net gains on derivatives were $64 million in 2003 compared to losses of $174 million in 2002. The derivative losses in 2002 were largely attributable to losses on
equity futures contracts and currency hedges of non-U.S. dollar investments. Realized investment gains in 2003 also include $41 million of gains in connection with the partial divestiture of an equity investment in a real estate operating
company.

2002 to 2001 Annual
Comparison.

The Financial Services Businesses’ net realized investment losses for 2002 were $778 million compared to $131 million for 2001. Realized losses in 2002 included fixed maturity impairments of $385 million
and credit related losses of $470 million for 2002 compared with $392 million and $225 million for 2001, respectively. These losses were offset in part, in both periods, by realized gains driven largely by sales of fixed income securities in
declining rate environments and gains from prepayments of private bonds. We realized net losses on equity securities of $149 million in 2002, including $164 million of impairments, compared to losses of $59 million in 2001, which included $153
million of impairments. Realized losses for 2002 include derivative losses of $226 million, compared to derivative gains of $236 million for 2001. Derivative losses in 2002 were primarily the result of losses of $152 million on treasury futures
contracts used to manage the duration of the Company’s fixed maturity investment portfolio, as well as losses of $88 million on foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge the future income of non-U.S. businesses, driven by the weakening
of the U.S. dollar. Derivative gains recorded for 2001 were primarily attributable to the impact of the strengthening dollar on currency hedges of non-U.S. dollar investments, as well as gains on Japanese equity futures contracts held in
anticipation of sales of equity securities.

For the Closed
Block Business, net realized investment losses for 2002 were $587 million compared to $543 million for 2001. Realized losses in 2002 include fixed maturity impairments of $302 million and credit related losses of $420 million, which were offset in
part by realized gains on sales of fixed income securities and prepayment premiums. Realized losses in 2001 included fixed maturity impairments of $385 million and credit related losses of $184 million, which were offset in part by realized gains on
sales of fixed income securities and prepayment premiums. We realized net losses on equity securities of $186 million in 2002, including $145 million of impairments, compared to losses of $177 million in 2001, which included $86 million of
impairments. Net losses on derivatives were $174 million for 2002 compared to $10 million for 2001. Derivative losses for 2002 were largely attributable to losses on equity futures contracts and currency hedges of non-U.S. dollar investments.

General Account Investments

We maintain a diversified investment portfolio in our insurance companies to
support our liabilities to customers in our Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, as well as our other general liabilities. Our general account does not include assets of our securities brokerage, securities trading, banking
operations, assets of our asset management operations managed for third parties, and separate account assets for which the customer assumes risks of ownership.

The General Account portfolio is managed pursuant to the distinct objectives of the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. The
primary investment objectives of the Financial Services Businesses include:

•

matching the liability characteristics of the major products and other obligations of the Company; and

•

maximizing the portfolio book yield within risk constraints.

The primary investment objectives of the Closed Block Business include:

•

providing for the reasonable dividend expectations of the participating policyholders within the Closed Block Business and the Class B shareholders; and



•

maximizing total return and preserving principal, within risk constraints, while matching the liability characteristics of the major products in the Closed Block Business.

Management of Investments

We design asset mix strategies for our general account to match the
characteristics of our products and other obligations and seek to closely approximate the interest rate sensitivity of the assets with the estimated interest rate sensitivity of the product liabilities. We achieve income objectives through
asset/liability management and strategic and tactical asset allocations within a disciplined risk management framework. Our asset allocation also reflects our desire for broad diversification across asset classes, sectors and issuers.

The Investment Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our proprietary
investments. It also reviews performance and risk positions quarterly. Our Senior Vice President, Asset Liability and Risk Management, approves the investment policy for the general account assets of our insurance subsidiaries and oversees the
investment process for our general account. Under his direction, the Asset Liability and Risk Management Group works with our business units to develop investment objectives, performance factors and measures and asset allocation ranges.

The Asset Liability and Risk Management Group also works closely with each
of our business units to ensure that the specific characteristics of our products are incorporated into its processes. The Asset Liability and Risk Management Group has the authority to initiate tactical shifts within exposure ranges approved
annually by the Investment Committee. The Investment Management segment manages virtually all of our investments, other than those of our International Insurance segment, under the direction of the Asset Liability and Risk Management Group. Our
International Insurance segment manages the majority of its investments locally.

Asset/Liability Management

The Asset
Liability and Risk Management Group uses a disciplined, risk-controlled approach to asset/liability management. The methodology focuses on aligning assets to the effective sensitivity of the cash flow and return requirements of our liabilities. The
Asset Liability and Risk Management Group consults with the product experts in the businesses on an ongoing basis to arrive at asset/liability matching policies and decisions. We adjust this dynamic process as products change, as we develop new
products and as changes in the market environment occur.

We
develop asset strategies for specific classes of product liabilities and attributed or accumulated surplus, each with distinct risk characteristics. Most of our products can be categorized in to the following three classes:

•

interest-crediting products for which the rates credited to customers are periodically adjusted to reflect market and competitive forces and actual investment experience, such as
fixed annuities;

•

participating individual and experience rated group products in which customers participate in actual investment and business results through annual dividends, interest or return of
premium; and

•

guaranteed products for which there are price or rate guarantees for the life of the contract, such as GICs.

We determine a target asset mix for each product class, which we reflect in
our investment policies. Our asset/liability management process has permitted us to manage interest-sensitive products successfully through several market cycles.

Portfolio Composition

Our investment portfolio consists primarily of public and private fixed maturity securities, commercial loans, equity securities and other invested
assets. Portfolio composition is a critical element of our investment management process. The composition of our general account reflects, within the discipline provided by our risk management approach, our need for competitive results and the
diverse selection of investment alternatives available through our Investment Management segment. The size of our portfolio enables us to invest in asset classes that may be unavailable to the typical investor.



Our total general account investments were $174.9 billion and $169.2 billion as of December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively, which are segregated between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. Total general account investments attributable to the Financial Services Businesses were $110.9 billion and $105.1 billion as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, while total general account investments attributable to the Closed Block Business were $64.0 billion and $64.1 billion as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The following table sets forth the
composition of the investments of our general account as of the dates indicated.

(1)

Other long-term investments consist of real estate and non-real estate related investments in joint ventures (other than our equity investment in Wachovia Securities) and
partnerships, investment real estate held through direct ownership, our interest in separate account investments and other miscellaneous investments.

(2)

Includes invested assets of securities brokerage, securities trading, and banking operations. Excludes assets of our asset management operations managed for third parties and
separate account assets for which the customer assumes risks of ownership.

As of December 31, 2003, our general account investment portfolio attributable to the Financial Services Businesses consisted primarily of $87.4 billion of fixed maturity securities (79% of the total portfolio in 2003
and 78% in 2002), $11.8 billion of commercial loans (11% of the total portfolio in 2003 and 11% in 2002), $1.1 billion of equity securities (1% of the total portfolio in 2003 and 1% in 2002) and $10.6 billion of other investments (9% of the total
portfolio in 2003 and 10% in 2002). Portfolio growth in 2003 was due primarily to the reinvestment of net investment income.



As of December 31, 2003, our general account investment portfolio attributable to the Closed Block
Business consisted primarily of $44.6 billion of fixed maturity securities (70% of the total portfolio in 2003 and 72% in 2002), $7.0 billion of commercial loans (11% of the total portfolio in 2003 and 11% in 2002), $2.3 billion of equity securities
(3% of the total portfolio in 2003 and 2% in 2002) and $10.1 billion of other investments (16% of the total portfolio in 2003 and 15% in 2002). The portfolio size was relatively the same as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 as the reinvestment of net
investment income was largely offset by net operating outflows.

Investment Results

The overall income
yield on our general account investments after investment expenses, excluding realized investment gains (losses), was 5.51% and 5.73% for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decline in yield on the portfolio in 2003 from
2002 is primarily attributable to reinvestment activities over the last two years in a declining interest rate environment.

The net investment income yield attributable to the Financial Services Businesses was 4.96% for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 5.16% for the
year ended December 31, 2002. The change in yield between periods was primarily due to declines in fixed maturities and commercial loan yields primarily attributable to reinvestment activities in a declining interest rate environment and lower
mortgage prepayment fees in 2003, partially offset by more favorable results from limited partnerships within other investments. The yield on the Financial Services Businesses reflects the income yield on the investment portfolio of our Japanese
insurance operations, which was 2.02% for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 1.93% for the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase in yield on the Japanese insurance portfolio in 2003 from 2002 is primarily attributable to the
redeployment of excess cash and investment in U.S. mortgage-backed bonds during 2002.

The net investment income yield attributable to the Closed Block Business was 6.49% for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to 6.75% for the year ended December 31, 2002. The change in yield between periods was
primarily due to declines in fixed maturities primarily attributable to reinvestment activities in a declining interest rate environment, partially offset by more favorable results from limited partnerships within other investments.

Continuation of the current low interest rate environment will result in our
reinvestment of maturing securities at lower rates and would reduce the yield we are able to earn on our investments, which support our obligations for certain products, including traditional whole life insurance, fixed annuities and guaranteed
investment contracts. This reduction in yield would also have a corresponding impact on the “spread,” which is the difference between the yield on our investments and the amounts that we are required to pay our customers related to these
products and which could have a negative impact on our future profitability.



The following table sets forth the income yield and investment income, excluding realized investment
gains (losses), for each major investment category of our general account for the periods indicated.

(1)

Yields are based on average carrying values except for fixed maturities, equity securities and securities lending activity. Yields for fixed maturities are based on amortized cost.
Yields for equity securities are based on cost. Yields for securities lending activity are calculated net of corresponding liabilities and rebate expenses. Yields for 2002 are presented on a basis consistent with our current reporting practices.

(2)

Investment income of securities brokerage and securities trading operations.

Fixed Maturity Securities

Investment Mix

Our fixed maturity securities portfolio consists of publicly traded and private placed debt securities across an array of industry categories. Our
international portfolios are predominantly foreign government securities.

We manage our public portfolio to a risk profile directed by the Asset Liability and Risk Management Group and, in the case of our international insurance portfolios, to a profile that reflects local market
regulations and our investment competencies in these markets. We seek to employ relative value analysis both in credit selection and in purchasing and selling securities. The total return that we earn on the portfolio will be reflected both as
investment income and also as realized gains or losses on investments.

We use our private placement and asset-backed portfolios to enhance the diversification and yield of our overall fixed maturity portfolio. Within our domestic portfolios, we maintain a private fixed income portfolio that is larger than the
industry average as a percentage of total fixed income holdings.

Over the last several years, our investment staff has directly originated more than half of our annual private placement originations. Our origination capability offers the
opportunity to lead transactions and gives us the opportunity for better terms, including covenants and call protection, and to take advantage of innovative deal structures.



Investments in fixed maturity securities attributable to the Financial Services Businesses were $83.0
billion at amortized cost with an estimated fair value of $87.4 billion as of December 31, 2003 versus $77.3 billion at amortized cost with an estimated fair value of $81.9 billion as of December 31, 2002.

Investments in fixed maturity securities attributable to the Closed Block
Business were $41.3 billion at amortized cost with an estimated fair value of $44.6 billion as of December 31, 2003 versus $43.2 billion at amortized cost with an estimated fair value of $46.2 billion as of December 31, 2002.

related to residential mortgage loans. Collateralized mortgage obligations represented the remaining 8% of mortgage-backed securities, and less than 1% of fixed maturities.

The gross unrealized losses related to our fixed maturity portfolio attributable to the Financial Services Businesses were
$0.4 billion as of December 31, 2003, compared to $0.4 billion as of December 31, 2002. The gross unrealized losses in 2003 were concentrated primarily in the foreign government, manufacturing and finance sectors while gross unrealized losses in
2002 were concentrated in the manufacturing, utilities, and services sectors. Non-investment grade securities represented 13% of the gross unrealized losses attributable to the Financial Services Businesses in 2003 versus 51% of gross unrealized
losses in 2002.

The following table sets forth the composition
of the portion of our fixed maturity securities portfolio by industry category attributable to the Closed Block Business as of the dates indicated and the associated gross unrealized gains and losses.

traded agency pass-through securities related to residential mortgage loans. Collateralized mortgage obligations represented the remaining 27% of mortgage-backed securities, and less than 1% of fixed maturities.

The gross unrealized losses related to our fixed maturity portfolio
attributable to the Closed Block Business were $0.1 billion as of December 31, 2003, compared to $0.3 billion as of December 31, 2002. The gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2003, were concentrated primarily in the manufacturing, U.S.
Government and utilities sectors while gross unrealized losses in 2002 were concentrated in manufacturing, utilities, and services sectors. Non-investment grade securities represented 40% of the gross unrealized losses attributable to the Closed
Block Business as of December 31, 2003, versus 63% of gross unrealized losses as of December 31, 2002.



Fixed Maturity Securities Credit Quality

The Securities Valuation Office (“SVO”) of the NAIC evaluates the
investments of insurers for regulatory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called “NAIC Designations.” NAIC designations of “1” or “2” include fixed maturities considered
investment grade, which include securities rated Baa3 or higher by Moody’s or BBB- or higher by S&P. NAIC Designations of “3” through “6” are referred to as below investment grade, which include securities rated Ba1 or
lower by Moody’s and BB+ or lower by S&P. As a result of time lags between the funding of investments, the finalization of legal documents and the completion of the SVO filing process, the fixed maturity portfolio generally includes
securities that have not yet been rated by the SVO as of each balance sheet date. Pending receipt of SVO ratings, the categorization of these securities by NAIC designation is based on the expected ratings indicated by internal analysis.

Non-U.S. dollar denominated investments of our Japanese
insurance companies are not subject to NAIC guidelines; however, they are regulated locally by the Financial Services Agency, an agency of the Japanese government. The Financial Services Agency has its own investment quality criteria and risk
control standards. Our Japanese insurance companies comply with the Financial Services Agency’s credit quality review and risk monitoring guidelines. The credit quality ratings of the non-U.S. dollar denominated investments of our Japanese
insurance companies are based on ratings assigned by Moody’s or rating equivalents based on Japanese government ratings.

The amortized cost of our public and private below-investment grade fixed maturities attributable to the Financial Services Businesses totaled $5.7
billion, or 7%, of the total fixed maturities as of December 31, 2003, compared to $6.1 billion, or 8%, of total fixed maturities as of December 31, 2002. The decrease in the amount of below-investment grade fixed maturities as of December 31, 2003,
from a year earlier was primarily driven by SVO ratings upgrades, principally on private bonds, as well as the maturity or prepayment of some below investment grade bonds.

The amortized cost of our public and private below-investment grade fixed maturities attributable to the Closed Block
Business totaled $5.9 billion, or 14%, of the total fixed maturities as of December 31, 2003, compared to $6.0 billion, or 14%, of total fixed maturities as of December 31, 2002.

Unrealized Losses from Fixed Maturity Securities

The following table sets forth the amortized cost and gross unrealized losses of fixed maturity securities attributable to
the Financial Services Businesses where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost by 20% or more for the following timeframes:

The gross unrealized losses in 2003 were primarily concentrated in the manufacturing and asset-backed securities sectors, as well as other corporate
securities, while the gross unrealized losses in 2002 were concentrated in the utilities, retail and wholesale, and manufacturing sectors.

The following table sets forth the amortized cost and gross unrealized losses of fixed maturity securities attributable to the Closed Block Business where
the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost by 20% or more for the following timeframes:



The gross unrealized losses in 2003 were primarily concentrated in the manufacturing, utilities, and
transportation sectors while the gross unrealized losses in 2002 were concentrated in the manufacturing, utilities and finance sectors.

Impairments of Fixed Maturity Securities

We maintain separate monitoring processes for public and private fixed maturities and create watch lists to highlight securities that require special
scrutiny and management. Our public fixed maturity asset managers formally review all public fixed maturity holdings on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings
downgrades, unexpected price variances, and/or industry specific concerns. We classify public fixed maturity securities of issuers that have defaulted as securities not in good standing and all other public watch list assets as closely monitored.

For private placements our credit and portfolio management
processes help ensure prudent controls over valuation and management. We have separate pricing and authorization processes to establish “checks and balances” for new investments. We apply consistent standards of credit analysis and due
diligence for all transactions, whether they originate through our own in-house origination staff or through agents. Our regional offices closely monitor the portfolios in their regions. We set all valuation standards centrally, and we assess the
fair value of all investments quarterly.

Our private fixed
maturity asset managers conduct specific servicing tests on each investment on an ongoing basis to determine whether the investment is in compliance or should be placed on the watch list or assigned an early warning classification. We assign early
warning classifications to those issuers that have failed a servicing test or experienced a minor covenant default, and we continue to monitor them for improvement or deterioration. In certain situations, the general account benefits from negotiated
rate increases or fees resulting from a covenant breach. We assign closely monitored status to those investments that have been recently restructured or for which restructuring is a possibility due to substantial credit deterioration or material
covenant defaults. We classify as not in good standing securities of issuers that are in more severe conditions, for example, bankruptcy or payment default.

We classify our fixed maturity securities as either held to maturity or available for sale. Securities classified as held to maturity are those securities
where we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity. These securities are reflected at amortized cost in our consolidated statement of financial position. Securities not classified as held to maturity are considered
available for sale, and, as a result, we record unrealized gains and losses to the extent that amortized cost is different from estimated fair value. All held to maturity securities and all available for sale securities with unrealized losses are
subject to our review to identify other-than-temporary impairments in value. In evaluating whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, we consider several factors including, but not limited to, the following:

•

whether the decline is substantial;

•

the duration of the decline (generally greater than six months);

•

the reasons for the decline in value (credit event or interest rate related);

•

our ability and intent to hold our investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value; and

•

the financial condition of and near-term prospects of the issuer.

When we determine that there is an other-than-temporary impairment, we record a write down to estimated fair value which reduces the cost basis. The new
cost basis of an impaired security is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value. Estimated fair values for fixed maturities, other than private placement securities, are based on quoted market prices or prices obtained from
independent pricing services. Estimated fair values for private placement fixed maturities are determined primarily by using a discounted cash flow model which considers the current market spreads between the U.S. Treasury yield curve and corporate
bond yield curve, adjusted for type of issue, its current credit quality and its remaining average life. The estimated fair value of certain non-performing private placement fixed maturities is based on management’s estimates.

Impairments of fixed maturity securities attributable to the Financial
Services Businesses totaled $266 million in 2003 and $385 million in 2002. Impairments of fixed maturity securities attributable to the Closed Block Business totaled $123 million in 2003 and $302 million in 2002. For a further discussion of
impairments, see “—Realized Investment Gains” above.



Commercial Loans

Investment Mix

We originate domestic commercial mortgages using dedicated investment staff and a network of independent companies through our various regional offices
across the country. All loans are underwritten consistently to Company standards using our proprietary quality rating system that has been developed from our experience in real estate and mortgage lending. Our loan portfolio strategy emphasizes
diversification by property type and geographic location.

Consumer loans are loans extended by Gibraltar Life to individuals for financing purchases of consumer goods and services and are guaranteed by third party guarantor companies.

Ongoing surveillance of the portfolio is performed and loans are placed on watch list status based on a predefined set of
criteria. We place loans on early warning status in cases where we detect that the physical condition of the property, the financial situation of the borrower or tenant or other market factors could lead to a loss of principal or interest. We
classify loans as closely monitored when there is a collateral deficiency or other credit events that will lead to a potential loss of principal or interest. Loans not in good standing are those loans where there is a high probability of loss of
principal, such as when the loan is in the process of foreclosure or the borrower is in bankruptcy. In our domestic operations, our workout and special servicing professionals manage the loans on the watch list. In our international portfolios, we
monitor delinquency in consumer loans on a pool basis and evaluate any servicing relationship and guarantees the same way we do for commercial loans.

As of both December 31, 2003 and 2002, we held approximately 11% of our general account investments in commercial loans. These percentages are gross of a
$0.4 billion allowance for losses as of both December 31, 2003 and 2002.

Our loan portfolio strategy emphasizes diversification by property type and geographic location. The following tables set forth the breakdown of the gross carrying values of our commercial loan portfolio by geographic
region and property type as of the dates indicated.



Commercial Loans by
Contractual Maturity Date

The following tables set forth
the breakdown of our commercial loan portfolio by contractual maturity as of December 31, 2003.

Commercial Loan
Quality

We establish valuation allowances for loans that
are determined to be non-performing as a result of our loan review process. We define a non-performing loan as a loan for which it is probable that amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected. Valuation
allowances for a non-performing loan are recorded based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. We record
subsequent adjustments to our valuation allowances when appropriate.

The following tables set forth the gross carrying value for commercial loans by loan classification as of the dates indicated:

sectors while the gross unrealized losses in 2002 were concentrated in the manufacturing, finance, and energy sectors.

The following table sets forth the cost and gross unrealized losses of our equity securities attributable to the Closed Block Business where the estimated
fair value had declined and remained below cost by 20% or more for the following timeframes:

The gross unrealized
losses in 2003 were primarily concentrated in the retail and wholesale, manufacturing, and services sectors while the gross unrealized losses in 2002 were concentrated in the manufacturing, services, and finance sectors.

Impairments of Equity Securities

We classify all of our equity securities as available-for-sale, and, as a
result, we record unrealized gains and losses to the extent cost is different from estimated fair value. All securities with unrealized losses are subject to our review to identify other-than-temporary impairments in value. In evaluating whether a
decline in value is other-than-temporary, we consider several factors including, but not limited to, the following:

•

whether the decline is substantial;

•

the duration of the decline (generally greater than six months);

•

the reasons for the decline in value (credit event or market fluctuation);

•

our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value; and

•

the financial condition of and near-term prospects of the issuer.

Where we have determined that there is an other-than-temporary impairment, we record a write down to estimated fair value which adjusts the cost basis.
The new cost basis of an impaired security is not adjusted for subsequent increases in fair value. Estimated fair values for publicly traded equity securities are based on quoted market prices or prices obtained from independent pricing services.
Fair values for privately traded equity securities are established using valuation and discounted cash flow models that call for a substantial level of judgment from management.

Impairments of equity securities attributable to the Financial Services Businesses totaled $101 million in 2003 and $164
million in 2002. Impairments of equity securities attributable to the Closed Block Business totaled $59 million in 2003 and $145 million in 2002. For a further discussion of impairments, see “—Realized Investment Gains” above.

Other Long-Term Investments

“Other long-term investments” are comprised as follows:



Liquidity and Capital Resources

Prudential Financial Liquidity

The principal sources of funds available to Prudential Financial, the parent holding company, to meet its obligations, including the payment of
shareholder dividends, debt service, capital contributions to subsidiaries and operating expenses, are cash and short-term investments, dividends, returns of capital and interest income from its subsidiaries. These sources of funds are complemented
by Prudential Financial’s capital markets access. We believe that cash flows from these sources are sufficient to satisfy the liquidity requirements of Prudential Financial. As of December 31, 2003, Prudential Financial had cash and short-term
investments of approximately $1.7 billion, a decrease of $59 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2002. Principal sources and uses of cash and short-term investments at Prudential Financial for the year ended December 31, 2003 were as follows:

(1)

Includes approximately $0.9 billion returned to Prudential Financial associated with the sale of our property and casualty insurance businesses and dividends/returns of capital of
approximately $250 million from the Insurance division, approximately $375 million from the Investment division, and approximately $220 million from Corporate and other operations.

(2)

For a discussion of this activity see “—Financing Activities.”

(3)

Includes the acquisition of American Skandia for approximately $1.2 billion and capital contributions of approximately $50 million for the Insurance division, approximately $460
million for the Investment division and $140 million for the International Insurance and Investments division.

(4)

Includes demutualization consideration paid to eligible policyholders and payments related to policy credit notes issued to Prudential Insurance. See “—Uses of
Capital—Demutualization Consideration” for a discussion of this activity.

Prudential Financial Capital Adequacy – Financial Services Businesses

Prudential Financial seeks to capitalize its businesses consistent with its risk, ratings objectives and regulatory requirements, all of which are
considered when determining the aggregate capital requirements for the Company. Our ratings targets are “AA/Aa/AA” for S&P, Moody’s and Fitch, respectively, and “A+” for A.M. Best for our core domestic life insurance
companies. Our debt rating targets are “A” for S&P, Moody’s and Fitch and “a” for A.M. Best for Prudential Financial.

The primary components of capitalization for the Financial Services Businesses consist of the equity we attribute to the Financial Services Businesses,
excluding unrealized gains and losses on investments, the contractual obligations of holders of our Equity Security Units to purchase Prudential Financial, Inc. Common Stock in November, 2004 and outstanding borrowings of the Financial Services
Businesses that are ascribed to “general corporate purposes” as discussed below under “—Financing Activities”. Based on these components, the capital position of the Financial Services Businesses as of December 31, 2003, was
as follows:



As shown in the table above, as of December 31, 2003, the Financial Services Businesses had approximately
$21 billion in capital, all of which was available to support the aggregate capital requirements of the businesses in its three divisions and its Corporate and Other operations. Based on our assessment of these businesses and operations, we believe
that the capital of the Financial Services Businesses as of December 31, 2003, exceeds the amount required to support its business risks. In addition, we believe this capital position, combined with our borrowing capacity, gives us substantial
financial flexibility.

The Risk Based Capital
(“RBC”) ratio is the primary measure by which we evaluate the capital adequacy of Prudential Insurance, which encompasses businesses of both the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. We manage Prudential
Insurance’s RBC ratio to a level consistent with our ratings targets for it. RBC is determined by statutory formulas that consider risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets, insurance-related risks associated with Prudential
Insurance’s products, interest rate risks and general business risks. The RBC ratio calculations are intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring the adequacy of Prudential Insurance’s statutory capitalization. As of December 31,
2003, Prudential Insurance’s RBC ratio was above the level that we believe is required to meet our ratings targets.

Prudential Insurance’s statutory capital as of December 31, 2003, included approximately $2.0 billion associated with the insurance policies in the
Closed Block Business that we believe will not be necessary to cover the risk of the Closed Block Business. We have commenced a process of entering into reinsurance arrangements that will enable us to redeploy this capital. In addition, its
statutory capital included $500 million to $750 million relating to our on-going domestic life insurance business that we believe is not necessary to cover its risks due to changes to statutory minimum reserve requirements and reinsurance
arrangements with respect to such business entered into in the second half of 2003. We expect to use $2.1 billion of this capital ($2.5 billion to $2.75 billion) to support the acquisition of CIGNA’s retirement business. This will leave between
$400 million and $650 million of capital beyond that which we believe is consistent with maintaining or improving our ratings.

Similarly, we believe that our international insurance subsidiaries have capital of $500 million to $750 million in excess of the amounts needed to
maintain or improve their ratings and that such capital (which generally is not distributable to Prudential Financial without regulatory approval) can be deployed in the growth of our businesses. We used a portion of the $500 million to $750 million
to fund the acquisition of Hyundai.

We also consider
additional borrowing capacity in evaluating the capital position of the Financial Services Businesses. We measure this additional borrowing capacity by calculating the amount of additional borrowings the Financial Services Businesses could incur for
general corporate purposes before we reach our Corporate Debt to Capital Ratio limit, which is currently 20%. We believe that a ratio of 20% or less is currently consistent with our ratings targets. As of December 31, 2003, this ratio was 10.0%,
indicating that the Financial Services Businesses could have incurred $2.6 billion of additional borrowings for general corporate purposes as of that date without exceeding the limit. As of December 31, 2003, the overall outstanding borrowings of
the Financial Services Businesses included approximately $1 billion the proceeds of which were temporarily invested in cash and short-term investments or loans to affiliates. A reallocation of these proceeds to general corporate purposes would be
considered in calculating the ratio of corporate debt to total capital and would reduce the $2.6 billion of additional borrowings available for general corporate purposes.

Uses of Capital

CIGNA Retirement Acquisition.

As noted above, we plan to use $2.1 billion of the $2.5 billion to $2.75 billion of the
capital described above to fund the acquisition of CIGNA’s retirement business, which is expected to close during the first half of 2004.

Share Repurchases.

During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company acquired 6.5 million shares of its Common Stock at a total
cost of approximately $252 million. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we repurchased 29.1 million shares of Common Stock at a total cost of approximately $1.0 billion.

On February 10, 2004, Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which
Prudential Financial is authorized to purchase up to $1.5 billion of its outstanding Common Stock in 2004. The timing and amount of any repurchases under the authorization will be determined by management based on market conditions and other
considerations, and such repurchases may be effected in the open market or through negotiated transactions. This stock repurchase program supersedes all previous repurchase programs.



Demutualization Consideration.

During 2003, Prudential Financial paid out
$142 million in demutualization consideration to eligible policyholders whom we have located since the time of demutualization and to governmental authorities in respect of other eligible policyholders we continue to be unable to locate. We remain
obligated to disburse additional payments of $812 million to governmental authorities to the extent we are still unable to locate remaining eligible policyholders within a prescribed period of time specified by state escheat laws. These laws
historically required remittance to the states in periods that typically ranged from three to seven years, but many states have enacted new legislation that reduces the escheatment time period and a number of other states are pursuing similar
legislation. Liabilities relating to demutualization consideration payments were established at the time of demutualization in 2001. For an estimate of expected payments by period see “—Contractual Obligations.” In addition, at the
time of demutualization, Prudential Financial made a contribution of $1.050 billion to Prudential Insurance to cover demutualization consideration for eligible policyholders who received policy credits as a part of our demutualization. The
contribution was financed with proceeds from the purchase by Prudential Insurance of a series of notes issued by Prudential Financial with market rates of interest and maturities ranging from nineteen months to three years. During 2003, notes
totaling $300 million matured. Of the remaining notes, $600 million matures in 2004 and $150 million matures in 2005.

Restrictions on Dividends and Returns of Capital from Subsidiaries

Our insurance and various other companies are subject to regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends and on other
transfers of funds to affiliates. With respect to Prudential Insurance, New Jersey insurance law provides that, except in the case of extraordinary dividends or distributions, all dividends or distributions paid by Prudential Insurance may be
declared or paid only from unassigned surplus, as determined pursuant to statutory accounting principles, less unrealized investment gains and revaluation of assets. As of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, Prudential Insurance’s
unassigned surplus (deficit) was $1,557 million and $(420) million, respectively. There were applicable adjustments for unrealized investment gains of $624 million as of December 31, 2003 and no adjustments as of December 31, 2002. There was no
revaluation of assets for purposes of the law referred to above regarding dividends and distributions in either year. Prudential Insurance also must notify the New Jersey insurance regulator of its intent to pay a dividend. If the dividend, together
with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, would exceed a specified statutory limit, Prudential Insurance must also obtain a non-disapproval from the New Jersey insurance regulator. The current statutory
limitation applicable to New Jersey life insurers generally is the greater of 10% of the prior calendar year’s statutory surplus or the prior calendar year’s statutory net gain from operations (excluding realized capital gains and losses).
In addition to these regulatory limitations, the terms of the IHC debt contain restrictions potentially limiting dividends by Prudential Insurance applicable to the Financial Services Businesses in the event the Closed Block Business is in financial
distress and other circumstances. Prudential Insurance provided no dividends to Prudential Financial in 2003.

The laws regulating dividends of the other states and foreign jurisdictions where our other insurance companies are domiciled are similar, but not
identical, to New Jersey’s. Pursuant to Gibraltar Life’s reorganization, in addition to regulatory restrictions, there are certain restrictions on Gibraltar Life’s ability to pay dividends to Prudential Financial. There are regulatory
restrictions on the payment of dividends by Prudential Life Insurance Company Ltd (“Prudential of Japan”). We anticipate that it will be several years before these restrictions will allow Gibraltar and Prudential of Japan to pay dividends.
The ability of our asset management subsidiaries, and the majority of our other operating subsidiaries, to pay dividends is unrestricted.

Liquidity of Subsidiaries

Domestic Insurance Subsidiaries

General Liquidity

Liquidity refers to a company’s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the needs of its operations. We manage the liquidity of our
domestic insurance operations to ensure stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of cash flows to meet all of our obligations. Liquidity is provided by a variety of sources, as described more fully below, including portfolios of liquid assets.
The investment portfolios of our domestic and foreign insurance operations are integral to the overall liquidity of those operations. We segment our investment portfolios and employ an asset/liability management approach specific to the requirements
of our product lines. This enhances the discipline applied in managing the liquidity, as well as the interest and credit risk profiles, of each portfolio in a manner consistent with the unique characteristics of the product liabilities.

Liquidity is monitored through the use of internally developed benchmarks,
which take into account the characteristics of the asset portfolio. The results are affected substantially by the overall quality of our investments.



Our domestic insurance companies’ flexibility and liquidity are enhanced through access to a variety
of instruments available for funding and/or to manage short-term cash flow mismatches, including securities lending and repurchase agreements, commercial paper (issued through Prudential Funding, LLC, discussed below), medium- and long-term debt,
common stock and other capital securities. Although our domestic insurance companies generate adequate cash flow to meet the needs of their normal operations, they may incur indebtedness from time to time to fund expansion, investment opportunities,
temporary cash flow timing mismatches and the retirement of debt.

Cash Flow from Operations

The principal
sources of liquidity of Prudential Insurance and our other domestic insurance subsidiaries are premiums and annuity considerations, investment and fee income and investment maturities and sales associated with our insurance, annuities and guaranteed
products operations. Principal uses of liquidity relate to benefits, claims, dividends paid to policyholders, and payments to policyholders and contract holders in connection with surrenders, withdrawals and net policy loan activity. Uses of
liquidity also include commissions, general and administrative expenses, purchases of investments, and repayments in connection with financing activities.

In managing the liquidity of our domestic insurance operations, we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than
our assumptions in selecting assets to support these contractual obligations. We use surrender charges and other contract provisions to mitigate the extent, timing and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers from annuity contracts
and deposit liabilities. The following table sets forth withdrawal characteristics of our general account annuity reserves and deposit liabilities (based on statutory liability values) as of the dates indicated.

Gross account
withdrawals for our domestic insurance operations’ products amounted to $7.8 billion and $6.1 billion for the years ending December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These withdrawals include contractually scheduled maturities of general account
guaranteed investment contracts of $1,274 million and $1,064 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Since these contractual withdrawals, as well as the level of surrenders experienced, were consistent with our
assumptions in asset liability management, the associated cash outflows did not have an adverse impact on our overall liquidity.

Individual life insurance policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than our annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may incur
surrender charges and undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy. Annuity benefits under group annuity contracts are generally not subject to early withdrawal. Included in the table above are approximately 43% of
annuity reserves and deposit fund liabilities that are not subject to early withdrawal as of December 31, 2003.

The domestic insurance operations’ cash flows from investment activities result from repayments of principal, proceeds from maturities and sales of
invested assets and investment income, net of amounts reinvested. The primary liquidity risks with respect to these flows are the risk of default by debtors, our counterparties’ willingness to extend repurchase and/or securities lending
arrangements, and market volatility. We closely monitor and manage these risks through the credit risk management process and regular monitoring of our liquidity position.

We believe that cash flows from our insurance, annuity and guaranteed products operations are adequate to satisfy liquidity
requirements of these operations based on our current liability structure and considering a variety of reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios. The continued adequacy of this liquidity will depend upon factors including future securities market
conditions, changes in interest rate levels and policyholder perceptions of our financial strength, which could lead to reduced cash inflows or increased cash outflows.



Liquid Assets

Liquid assets include cash, cash-equivalents, short-term investments, marketable fixed maturities and public equity
securities. As of December 31, 2003, and 2002, the domestic insurance operations had $108.2 billion and $104.3 billion in liquid assets, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, $82.8 billion, or 87% of the fixed maturity securities held in our
domestic insurance company General Account portfolios were rated investment grade. The remaining $12.3 billion, or 13% of fixed maturity investments were rated non-investment grade. We consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets
(for example, type of asset and credit quality) in calculating internal liquidity benchmark results in order to evaluate the adequacy of our domestic insurance operations’ liquidity under a variety of stress scenarios. We believe that the
liquidity profile of our assets is sufficient to satisfy liquidity requirements of reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios. For additional discussion of our investment portfolios, see “—Realized Investment Gains and General Account
Investments—General Account Investments.”

Prudential Funding, LLC

Prudential Funding,
LLC (“Prudential Funding”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Insurance, continues to serve as a source of financing for Prudential Insurance and its subsidiaries, as well as for other subsidiaries of Prudential Financial. Prudential
Funding operates under a support agreement with Prudential Insurance whereby Prudential Insurance has agreed to maintain Prudential Funding’s positive tangible net worth at all times. Prudential Funding borrows funds primarily through the
direct issuance of commercial paper and private placement medium-term notes. Prudential Funding’s outstanding loans to other subsidiaries of Prudential Financial are expected to decline over time as it transitions into a financing company
primarily for Prudential Insurance and its remaining subsidiaries. We anticipate that our other subsidiaries will borrow directly from third parties and from Prudential Financial, as well as from Prudential Funding from time to time. The impact of
Prudential Funding on liquidity is considered in the internal liquidity benchmarks of the domestic insurance operations.

As of December 31, 2003, Prudential Financial, Prudential Insurance and Prudential Funding had unsecured committed lines of credit totaling $2.6 billion.
Currently, Prudential Insurance and Prudential Funding have access to $1.6 billion of the lines and there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities as of December 31, 2003 or December 31, 2002. For a further discussion on lines of
credit, see “—Financing Activity—Lines of Credit and Other Credit Facilities.”

International Insurance Subsidiaries

In our international insurance operations, liquidity is provided through ongoing operations as well as portfolios of liquid assets. In managing the liquidity and the interest and credit risk profiles of our
international insurance portfolios, we employ a discipline similar to the discipline employed for our domestic insurance subsidiaries. Liquidity is monitored through the use of internal liquidity benchmarks taking into account the liquidity of the
asset portfolios.

Similar to our domestic operations, in
managing the liquidity of these operations we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions in selecting assets to support these contractual obligations. As of December 31, 2003, and December
31, 2002, our international insurance subsidiaries had total insurance related liabilities (other than dividends payable to policyholders) of $38.3 billion and $33.2 billion, respectively. Of that amount, $28.8 billion and $26.1 billion are
associated with Gibraltar Life, our largest international insurance subsidiary. Concurrent with our acquisition of Gibraltar Life in April 2001, substantially all of its insurance liabilities were restructured, under a reorganization, to include
special surrender penalties on existing policies. These charges mitigate the extent, timing, and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers and apply to $25.8 billion and $24.6 billion of Gibraltar Life’s insurance related
reserves as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. The following table sets forth the schedule (for each year ending March 31) of special surrender charges on policies that were in force at the time of the acquisition:









15%

14%

12%

10%

8%

6%

4%

2%

Policies issued by
Gibraltar Life post acquisition are not subject to the above restructured policy surrender charge schedule. Policies issued post acquisition are subject to discretionary withdrawal at contract value, less applicable surrender charges, currently 5%
or more.

Prudential of Japan, with $7.8 and $6.0 billion of
insurance related liabilities as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively, is our second largest international insurance subsidiary

. Prudential of Japan did not



have a material amount of general account annuity reserves and deposit liabilities subject to discretionary withdrawal as of December 31, 2003 or December
31, 2002. Additionally, we believe that the individual life insurance policies sold by Prudential of Japan do not have significant withdrawal risk because policyholders may incur surrender charges and must undergo a new underwriting process in order
to obtain a new insurance policy.

As of December 31, 2003 and
December 31, 2002, our international insurance subsidiaries had cash and short-term investments of approximately $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, and fixed maturity investments classified as “available for sale” with fair
values of $30.2 billion and $26.7 billion, respectively. We believe that ongoing operations and the liquidity profile of our international insurance assets provide sufficient liquidity in reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios.

Prudential Securities Group Liquidity

Prudential Securities Group’s assets totaled $7.5 billion and $20.3
billion as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. On July 1, 2003, we completed the combination of our retail brokerage business with Wachovia. As a result, we contributed $16.3 billion of assets and corresponding liabilities and equity in
return for our investment in Wachovia Securities. Prudential Securities Group continues to own our investment in Wachovia Securities as well as the retained wholly owned businesses. The wholly owned businesses remaining in Prudential Securities
Group continue to maintain sufficiently liquid balance sheets consisting mostly of cash and cash equivalents, segregated client assets, short-term collateralized receivables from clients and broker-dealers, and collateralized loans to clients.
Prudential Securities Group’s total capitalization, including equity, subordinated debt and long-term debt, was $2.4 billion and $3.6 billion as December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively.

In October 2000, we announced that we would terminate our institutional fixed
income activities that constituted the major portion of the debt capital markets operations of Prudential Securities Group. As of December 31, 2003, Prudential Securities Group had remaining assets amounting to approximately $700 million related to
its institutional fixed income activities, compared to $900 million as of December 31, 2002.

Financing Activities

As of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, total short- and long-term debt of the Company were $10.349 billion and $8.226 billion, respectively, including debt associated with the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block
Business. Outstanding short- and long-term debt of the parent company amounted to $2.615 billion as of December 31, 2003, which amount is included in the total consolidated outstanding short- and long-term debt of the Company above. Prudential
Financial had no short- and long-term debt as of December 31, 2002.

Prudential Financial is authorized to borrow funds from various sources to meet its capital needs, as well as the capital needs of its subsidiaries. The following table sets forth the outstanding short- and long-term debt of Prudential
Financial, including that related to the Equity Security Units, as of the dates indicated:

(1)

Long-term debt as of December 31, 2003, includes debt related to the Prudential Financial’s equity security units, previously included in “Guaranteed beneficial interest
in Trust holding solely debentures of parent” as of December 31, 2002. The $711 million includes $690 million corresponding to contractual obligations of Equity Security Units to purchase Prudential Financial Common Stock in November 2004.

Prudential Financial’s short-term debt
includes commercial paper borrowings of $412 million. The weighted average interest rate on the commercial paper borrowings under this program was 1.21% for the full year ended December 31, 2003.

To enhance financial flexibility, Prudential Financial filed a $5 billion
shelf registration statement, effective April 25, 2003, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which permits the issuance of public debt, equity and hybrid



securities. The total principal amount of debt outstanding under this shelf program as of December 31, 2003 was $1.5 billion. In addition, upon the adoption
of the revised guidance under FIN 46, $711 million in borrowings associated with our equity security units are now included in long-term debt of Prudential Financial. The weighted average interest rate on Prudential Financial’s long-term debt,
including the effect of interest rate hedging activity, was 3.76% for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Effective April 25, 2003, we formally allocated $1.0 billion of an unsecured committed line of credit expiring in October 2006 to Prudential Financial.
There were no outstanding borrowings under this facility as of December 31, 2003 or December 31, 2002. For a discussion of our lines of credit, see “—Lines of Credit and Other Facilities” below.

Current capital markets activities principally consist of unsecured
short-term and long-term debt borrowings issued at Prudential Funding and Prudential Financial and asset-based or secured forms of financing. The secured financing arrangements include transactions such as securities lending and repurchase
agreements, which we generally use to finance liquid securities in our short-term spread portfolios, primarily within Prudential Insurance.

The following table sets forth total consolidated borrowings of the Company as of the dates indicated:

(1)

Long-term debt as of December 31, 2003, includes debt related to the Prudential Financial’s equity security units, previously included in “Guaranteed beneficial interest
in Trust holding solely debentures of parent” as of December 31, 2002. The $711 million includes $690 million corresponding to contractual obligations of Equity Security Units to purchase Prudential Financial Common Stock in November 2004.

(2)

As of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, $1.75 billion of limited and non-recourse debt is within the Closed Block Business.

(3)

Includes $ 0.5 billion and $1.3 billion related to Prudential Securities Group as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. Does not include $1.1 billion of
medium-term notes of consolidated trust entities secured by funding agreements purchased with the proceeds of such notes, which are included in “Policyholders’ account balances”.

(4)

Includes $0.7 billion and $8.9 billion related to Prudential Securities Group as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively.

Total general debt obligations increased by $2.6 billion, or 45%, from
December 31, 2002, reflecting a $1.3 billion net increase in long-term debt and a $1.3 billion net increase in short-term debt. The increase in long-term debt was driven primarily by the issuance of $1.5 billion of long-term debt at Prudential
Financial. In addition, upon the adoption of FIN 46,

borrowings associated with our equity security units are now included in long-term debt. These increases were partially offset by $400 million in a mortgage repayment and another $400
million in long-term notes becoming current at Prudential Funding. The net increase in short-term debt was driven by increased commercial paper issuance of $1.6 billion at Prudential Funding and $412 million at Prudential Financial. These increases
were partially offset by long-term debt maturities of approximately $300 million at Prudential Funding and a $300 million surplus note maturity at Prudential Insurance. In addition, direct third party borrowings of subsidiaries declined by $539
million, primarily due to reduced bank borrowings of $374 million at Prudential Securities Group.

Total long-term limited and non-recourse debt declined by $515 million. This change was due to a decline of approximately $400 million resulting from the
deconsolidation of certain entities upon adoption of FIN 46 and another $112 million decline related to the sale of warehoused investments whose debt previously was included in our consolidated financial position.



Asset-based financing declined by $12.1 billion primarily due to an $8.2 billion decline at Prudential
Securities Group. This was due to the combination of our retail brokerage operations with Wachovia. The decrease was also driven by the Company’s adoption of SFAS 149, under which assets and liabilities associated with dollar roll activity are
netted. This resulted in a decrease of approximately $2.0 billion in asset-based financing outstanding at year end. In addition, asset-based financing also declined by approximately $1.5 billion at Prudential Insurance.

Prudential Funding’s commercial paper borrowings as of December 31, 2003
and December 31, 2002, were $2.8 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. In the second quarter of 2002, Prudential Financial issued a subordinated guarantee covering Prudential Funding’s domestic commercial paper program. The weighted average
interest rates on the commercial paper borrowings under this program were 1.13%, 1.26%, and 4.22% for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 respectively.

The total principal amount of debt outstanding under Prudential Funding’s medium-term note programs as of December 31,
2003 and December 31, 2002, was $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. The weighted average interest rates on Prudential Funding’s long-term debt, including the effect of interest rate hedging activity, were 1.87%, 3.21%, and 4.58% for
the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

We had outstanding surplus notes totaling $691 million and $990 million as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. These debt securities, which are included as surplus of Prudential Insurance on a statutory accounting
basis, are subordinate to other Prudential Insurance borrowings and to policyholder obligations and are subject to regulatory approvals for principal and interest payments.

Our total borrowings consist of amounts used for general corporate purposes, investment related debt, securities business
related debt and debt related to specified other businesses. Borrowings used for general corporate purposes include those used for cash flow timing mismatches at Prudential Financial, Prudential Financial’s investments in equity and debt
securities of subsidiaries and amounts utilized for regulatory capital purposes. Investment related borrowings consist of debt issued to finance specific investment assets or portfolios of investment assets, including institutional spread lending
investment portfolios, real estate and real estate related investments held in consolidated joint ventures, as well as institutional and insurance company portfolio cash flow timing differences. Securities business related debt consists of debt
issued to finance primarily the liquidity of our broker-dealers and our capital markets and other securities business related operations. Debt related to specified other businesses consists of borrowings associated with our discontinued consumer
banking business, the individual annuity business, real estate franchises and relocation services. Borrowings under which either the holder is entitled to collect only against the assets pledged to the debt as collateral, or has only very limited
rights to collect against other assets, have been classified as limited and non-recourse debt. Consolidated borrowings as of December 31, 2003 and 2002

include $1.75 billion of limited and non-recourse debt within the Closed Block Business.



The following table summarizes our borrowings, categorized by use of proceeds, as of the dates indicated:

(1)

Long-term debt as of December 31, 2003, includes debt related to the Prudential Financial’s equity security units, previously included in “Guaranteed beneficial interest
in Trust holding solely debentures of parent” as of December 31, 2002. The $711 million includes $690 million corresponding to contractual obligations of Equity Security Units to purchase Prudential Financial Common Stock in November 2004.

Lines of Credit and Other Credit Facilities

As of December 31, 2003, Prudential Financial, Prudential Insurance and
Prudential Funding had unsecured committed lines of credit totaling $2.6 billion. Of this amount, $1.0 billion is under a facility that expires in May 2004, $0.1 billion is under a 364-day facility that expires in October 2004, and $1.5 billion is
under a facility that expires in October 2006. Borrowings under the outstanding facilities will mature no later than the respective expiration dates of the facilities. The facility expiring in May 2004 includes 28 financial institutions, many of
which are also among the 27 financial institutions participating in the October 2006 facility. We use these facilities primarily as back-up liquidity lines for our commercial paper programs, and there were no outstanding borrowings under these
facilities as of December 31, 2003 or December 31, 2002. Effective April 25, 2003, we formally allocated $1.0 billion of the October 2006 facility to Prudential Financial. As a result, Prudential Insurance and Prudential Funding now have access to
the remaining $1.5 billion in unsecured committed credit lines.

Our ability to borrow under these facilities is conditioned on our continued satisfaction of customary conditions, including maintenance at all times by Prudential Insurance of total adjusted capital of at least $5.5 billion based on
statutory accounting principles prescribed under New Jersey law. Prudential Insurance’s total adjusted capital as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, was $10.9 billion and $9.1 billion, respectively. The ability of Prudential Financial
to borrow under these facilities is conditioned on its maintenance of consolidated net worth of at least $12.5 billion, based on generally accepted accounting principles. Prudential Financial’s consolidated net worth totaled $21.3 billion and
$21.3 billion as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. In addition, we have a credit facility expiring in December 2004 utilizing a third party-sponsored, asset-backed commercial paper conduit, under which we can borrow up to
$500 million. This facility is supported in its entirety by unsecured committed lines of credit from many of the financial institutions included in our other facilities. Our actual ability to borrow under this facility depends on market conditions,
and with respect to the lines of credit, Prudential Financial is subject to the same net worth requirement as with our other facilities. We also use uncommitted lines of credit from banks and other financial institutions.



Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes the payments due for the specific contractual obligations outlined below as of December 31, 2003.

(1)

See Footnote 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

(2)

See Footnote 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

(3)

We offer various investment-type products with contractually scheduled maturities through which customers deposit funds with us that typically provide for a rate of interest on the
amount invested through the maturity of the contract. These obligations are backed by our general account assets, and we bear all of the investment and asset/liability management risk on these contracts. Examples of these types of products include
GICs, funding agreements, and annuities without life contingencies. These liabilities are reflected within “Policyholders’ account balances” on our consolidated statements of financial position and amount to $7.717 billion as of
December 31, 2003. The difference between our recorded liability and the total payment amount reflects $1.537 billion of future interest to be credited.

(4)

Prudential Financial remains obligated to disburse demutualization consideration for eligible policyholders that we have been unable to locate. To the extent we continue to be
unable to locate these policyholders within a prescribed period of time specified by state escheat laws, typically three to seven years, the funds must be remitted to governmental authorities. Many states have enacted new legislation that reduces
the escheatment time period and a number of other states are pursuing similar legislation. The amounts reflected in the table above are reflective of state escheat laws as of December 31, 2003. These liabilities are reflected within “Other
liabilities” on our consolidated statements of financial position.

(5)

This amount represents our best estimate as of the date of this filing of our aggregated expected contributions to our non-qualified pension and post-retirement plans for 2004. We
do not currently expect to make any contributions in 2004 to our qualified plans. We have not included any amounts subsequent to 2004, as these amounts are not readily determinable at this time. See Footnote 15 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information regarding the estimated 2004 contribution.

We enter into agreements to purchase goods and services in the normal course of business; however, these agreements are not material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position.

Contractual Commitments

In connection with our commercial mortgage banking business, we originate commercial mortgage loans. As of December 31,
2003, we had outstanding commercial mortgage loan commitments with borrowers of $1.282 billion. In certain of these transactions, we prearrange that we will sell the loan to an investor after we fund the loan. As of December 31, 2003, $559 million
of our commitments to originate commercial mortgage loans are subject to such arrangements.

In connection with our discontinued consumer banking business, we have commitments under home equity lines of credit and other lines of credit to lend up to specified limits to customers. It is anticipated that
commitment amounts will only be partially drawn down based on overall customer usage patterns and, therefore, do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each credit decision on such commitments at least annually and have the
ability to cancel or suspend such lines at our option. The total commitments for home equity lines of credit and other lines of credit were $1.859 billion, of which $818 million remains available as of December 31, 2003.

We also have other commitments, which primarily include commitments to fund
investments. These commitments amounted to $2.964 billion as of December 31, 2003.



In connection with certain acquisitions, we agreed to pay additional consideration in future periods,
based upon the attainment by the acquired entity of defined operating objectives. In accordance with GAAP, we do not accrue contingent consideration obligations prior to the attainment of the objectives. As of December 31, 2003, maximum potential
future consideration pursuant to such arrangements, to be resolved over the following six years, is $269 million. Any such payments would result in increases in intangible assets, including goodwill.

See “—Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements—Guarantees” below
for a discussion of financial guarantees.

The following table
summarizes the expirations of the contractual commitments discussed above as of December 31, 2003.

Ratings

See “Business—Ratings” for a summary of the Company’s
insurance claims-paying ratings and credit ratings.

Deferred Policy
Acquisition Costs

We capitalize costs that vary with and
are related primarily to the production of new insurance and annuity business. These costs include commissions, costs to issue and underwrite the policies and certain variable field office expenses. The capitalized amounts are known as deferred
policy acquisition costs, or DAC. Our total DAC, including the impact of unrealized investment gains and losses, amounted to $7.8 billion and $7.0 billion as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, approximately 49% of
our total DAC relates to our Individual Life and Annuities segment, approximately 35% relates to our International Insurance segment and approximately 16% relates to our Closed Block Business.

If we were to experience a significant decrease in asset values or increase
in lapse or surrender rates on policies for which we amortize DAC based on estimated gross margins or gross profits, such as participating and variable life insurance, we would expect acceleration of the write-off of DAC for the affected blocks of
policies. Additionally, for all policies on which we have outstanding DAC, we would be required to evaluate whether this experience called into question our ability to recover all or a portion of the DAC, and we would be required to write off some
or all of the DAC if we concluded that we could not recover it. An accelerated write-off of DAC would negatively affect our reported earnings and level of capital under generally accepted accounting principles.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Guarantees

We provide financial guarantees incidental to other transactions. These credit-related financial instruments have
off-balance sheet credit risk because only their origination fees, if any, and accruals for probable losses, if any, are recognized until the obligation under the instrument is fulfilled or expires. These instruments can extend for several years and
expirations are not concentrated in any single period. We seek to control credit risk associated with these instruments by limiting credit, maintaining collateral where customary and appropriate and performing other monitoring procedures.



A number of guarantees provided by the Company relate to real estate investments, in which the
unconsolidated investor has borrowed funds, and we have guaranteed their obligation to their lender. In some cases, the investor is an affiliate, and in other cases an unaffiliated investor purchases the real estate investment from us. We provide
these guarantees to assist them in obtaining financing for the transaction on more beneficial terms. Our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees was $880 million as of December 31, 2003. Any payments that may become required of us under
these guarantees would either first be reduced by proceeds received by the creditor on a sale of the assets, or would provide us with rights to obtain the assets. As of December 31, 2003 no amounts were accrued as a result of our assessment that it
is unlikely that payments will be required.

We are subject to
other financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements, including those related to business that have been sold. Some of these guarantees may extend far into the future and are subject to caps aggregating to $36 million. In other limited cases, the
amount that can be claimed from us or the time in which these claims may be presented to us are not limited. As of December 31, 2003, we have accrued liabilities of $11 million associated with all other financial guarantees and indemnity
arrangements, which does not include liabilities we retained associated with sold businesses.

Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities, or variable interests in unconsolidated entities or other similar transactions, arrangements or relationships that
serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support, that we believe are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or our access to or requirements for capital resources. In addition, we do not have relationships with any unconsolidated entities that are contractually limited to narrow activities that facilitate our transfer of or access to assets.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Risk Management, Market Risk and Derivative Instruments

Risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes
intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns on the underlying assets or liabilities. We consider risk management an integral part of our core business.

Market risk

is the risk of change in the value of financial instruments as a result of absolute or relative changes
in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates or equity or commodity prices. To varying degrees, the investment and trading activities supporting all of our products and services generate market risks. The market risks incurred and our
strategies for managing these risks vary by product.

With
respect to non-variable life insurance products, fixed rate annuities, the fixed rate options in our variable life insurance and annuity products, consumer banking products, and other finance businesses, we incur market risk primarily in the form of
interest rate risk. We manage this risk through asset/liability management strategies that seek to match the interest rate sensitivity of the assets to that of the underlying liabilities. Our overall objective in these strategies is to limit the net
change in value of assets and liabilities arising from interest rate movements. While it is more difficult to measure the interest sensitivity of our insurance liabilities than that of the related assets, to the extent that we can measure such
sensitivities we believe that interest rate movements will generate asset value changes that substantially offset changes in the value of the liabilities relating to the underlying products.

For variable annuities and variable life insurance products, excluding the
fixed rate options in these products, mutual funds and most separate accounts, our main exposure to the market is the risk that asset management fees decrease as a result of declines in assets under management due to changes in prices of securities.
We also run the risk that asset management fees calculated by reference to performance could be lower. For variable annuity and variable life insurance products with minimum guaranteed death and other benefits, we also face the risk that declines in
the value of underlying investments as a result of changes in prices of securities may increase our net exposure to these death and other benefits under these contracts. See



“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Result of Operations for Financial Services Businesses
by Segment—Insurance Division—Individual Life and Annuities” for payments made under the guaranteed minimum death benefit provision of certain individual annuity contracts, which we do not believe add significantly to our overall
market risk.

We manage our exposure to equity price risk
relating to our general account primarily by seeking to match the risk profile of equity investments against risk-adjusted equity market benchmarks. We measure benchmark risk levels in terms of price volatility in relation to the market in general.

The sources of our exposure to market risk can be divided into
two categories, “other than trading” activities conducted primarily in our insurance, annuity and guaranteed products operations, and “trading” activities conducted primarily in our equity and futures operations, as well as,
historically, in our former domestic retail securities brokerage business. As part of our management of both “other than trading” and “trading” market risks, we use a variety of risk management tools and techniques. These include
sensitivity and Value-at-Risk (“VaR”) measures, position and other limits based on type of risk, and various hedging methods.

Other Than Trading Activities

We hold the majority of our assets for “other than trading” activities in our segments that offer insurance, annuities and guaranteed products.
We incorporate asset/liability management techniques and other risk management policies and limits into the process of investing our assets. We use derivatives for hedging purposes in the asset/liability management process.

Insurance, Annuities and Guaranteed Products Asset/Liability Management

We seek to maintain interest rate and equity exposures
within established ranges, which we periodically adjust based on market conditions and the design of related products sold to customers. Our risk managers establish investment risk limits for exposures to any issuer, geographic region, type of
security or industry sector and oversee efforts to manage risk within policy constraints set by management and approved by the Board of Directors.

We use duration and convexity analyses to measure price sensitivity to interest rate changes. Duration measures the relative sensitivity of the fair value
of a financial instrument to changes in interest rates. Convexity measures the rate of change of duration with respect to changes in interest rates. We seek to manage our interest rate exposure by legal entity by matching the relative sensitivity of
asset and liability values to interest rate changes, or controlling “duration mismatch” of assets and liabilities. We have target duration mismatch constraints for each entity. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the difference between the
pre-tax duration of assets and the target duration of liabilities in our duration managed portfolios was within our constraint limits. We consider risk-based capital implications in our asset/liability management strategies.

We also perform portfolio stress testing as part of our regulatory cash flow
testing. In this testing, we evaluate the impact of altering our interest-sensitive assumptions under various moderately adverse interest rate environments. These interest-sensitive assumptions relate to the timing and amount of redemptions and
prepayments of fixed-income securities and lapses and surrenders of insurance products and the potential impact of any guaranteed minimum interest rates. We evaluate any shortfalls that this cash flow testing reveals to determine if we need to
increase statutory reserves or adjust portfolio management strategies.

Market Risk Related to Interest Rates

Our
“other than trading” assets that subject us to interest rate risk include primarily fixed maturity securities, commercial loans and policy loans. In the aggregate, the carrying value of these assets represented 74% of our consolidated
assets, other than assets that we held in separate accounts, as of December 31, 2003 and 70% as of December 31, 2002.

With respect to “other than trading” liabilities, we are exposed to interest rate risk through policyholder account balances relating to
interest-sensitive life insurance, annuity and investment-type contracts and through outstanding short-term and long-term debt.

We assess interest rate sensitivity for “other than trading” financial assets, financial liabilities and derivatives using hypothetical test
scenarios that assume either upward or downward 100 basis point parallel



shifts in the yield curve from prevailing interest rates. The following tables set forth the potential loss in fair value from a hypothetical 100 basis point
upward shift as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, because this scenario results in the greatest net exposure to interest rate risk of the hypothetical scenarios tested at those dates. While the test scenario is for illustrative purposes only and does
not reflect our expectations regarding future interest rates or the performance of fixed-income markets, it is a near-term, reasonably possible hypothetical change that illustrates the potential impact of such events. These test scenarios do not
measure the changes in value that could result from non-parallel shifts in the yield curve, which we would expect to produce different changes in discount rates for different maturities. As a result, the actual loss in fair value from a 100 basis
point change in interest rates could be different from that indicated by these calculations.

(1)

As of December 31, 2003, “Short-term and long-term debt” includes long-term debt related to our equity security units. As of December 31, 2002, our equity security units
were included in “Guaranteed beneficial interest in Trust holding solely debentures of Parent.”



The tables above do not include approximately $104 billion of insurance reserve and deposit liabilities
as of December 31, 2003 and $99 billion as of December 31, 2002. We believe that the interest rate sensitivities of these insurance liabilities offset, in large measure, the interest rate risk of the financial assets set forth in these tables.

The $598 million increase in the total estimated potential
loss as of December 31, 2003 from December 31, 2002 resulted primarily from the increase in our portfolio of fixed maturities available for sale during 2003.

The estimated changes in fair values of our financial assets shown above relate primarily to assets invested to support our insurance liabilities, but do
not include assets associated with products for which investment risk is borne primarily by the contract holders rather than by us.

Market Risk Related to Equity Prices

We actively manage equity price risk against benchmarks in respective markets. We benchmark our return on equity holdings against a blend of market
indices, mainly the S&P 500 and Russell 2000, and we target price sensitivities that approximate those of the benchmark indices. We estimate our equity price risk from a hypothetical 10% decline in equity benchmark market levels and measure this
risk in terms of the decline in fair market value of equity securities we hold. Using this methodology, our estimated equity price risk as of December 31, 2003 was $340 million, representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of equity
securities we held at that date from $3.401 billion to $3.061 billion. Our estimated equity price risk using this methodology as of December 31, 2002 was $281 million, representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of equity securities we
held at that date from $2.807 billion to $2.526 billion. In calculating these amounts, we exclude equity securities related to products for which the investment risk is borne primarily by the contractholder rather than by us. While these scenarios
are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect our expectations regarding future performance of equity markets or of our equity portfolio, they represent near term reasonably possible hypothetical changes that illustrate the potential impact
of such events.

Market Risk Related to Foreign Currency
Exchange Rates

We are exposed to foreign currency
exchange rate risk in our general account and through our operations in foreign countries. In our international life insurance business, we generally invest in assets denominated in the same currencies as our insurance liabilities, which mitigates
our foreign currency exchange rate risk for these operations.

Our exposure to foreign currency risk within the general account investment portfolios supporting our U.S. insurance operations arises primarily from purchased investments that are denominated or payable in foreign currencies. We generally
hedge substantially all foreign currency-denominated fixed-income investments supporting our U.S. operations into U.S. dollars, using foreign exchange forward contracts and currency swaps, in order to mitigate the risk that the fair value of these
investments fluctuates as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates. We generally do not hedge all of the foreign currency risk of our equity investments in unaffiliated foreign entities.

Our operations in foreign countries create two additional sources of foreign
currency risk. First, we reflect the operating results of our foreign branches and subsidiaries in our financial statements based on the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. We hedge some of these foreign currency flows based on our
overall risk management strategy and loss limits. We generally hedge our anticipated exposure to adjusted operating income fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our International operations in Japan and
Korea, of which our Japanese insurance operations are the most significant, using foreign exchange forward contracts and currency swaps. Second, we translate our equity investment in foreign branches and subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using the
foreign currency exchange rate at the financial statement period-end date. We have chosen to partially hedge this exposure.

We actively manage foreign currency exchange rate risk within specified limits at the consolidated level using VaR analysis. This statistical technique
estimates, at a specified confidence level, the potential pre-tax loss in portfolio market value that could occur over an assumed time horizon due to adverse market movements. We calculate this using a variance/covariance approach.



We calculate VaR estimates of exposure to loss from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates for
one-month time periods. Our estimated VaR as of December 31, 2003 for foreign currency assets not hedged to U.S. dollars, measured at the 95% confidence level and using a one-month time horizon, was $24 million, representing a hypothetical decline
in fair market value of these foreign currency assets from $811 million to $787 million. Our estimated VaR as of December 31, 2002 for foreign currency assets not hedged to U.S. dollars, measured at the 95% confidence level and using a one-month
time horizon, was $9 million, representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of these foreign currency assets from $494 million to $485 million. These calculations use historical price volatilities and correlation data at a 95% confidence
level. We discuss limitations of VaR models below. Our estimated VaR for foreign exchange forward contracts and currency swaps used to hedge our anticipated exposure to adjusted operating income fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign
currency exchange rates relating to our international operations, measured at the 95% confidence level and using a one-month time horizon, was $59 million as of December 31, 2003 and $110 million as of December 31, 2002.

Our average monthly Value-at-Risk for foreign currency assets not hedged to
U.S. dollars from foreign currency exchange rate movements, measured at the 95% confidence level over a one month time horizon, was $18 million during 2003 and $15 million during 2002.

Derivatives

Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices, or the prices of securities
or commodities. Derivative financial instruments may be exchange-traded or contracted in the over-the-counter market and include swaps, futures, options and forward contracts. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of
our derivative activities as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. Under insurance statutes, our insurance companies may use derivative financial instruments to hedge actual or anticipated changes in their assets or liabilities, to replicate cash market
instruments or for certain income-generating activities. These statutes generally prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. We use derivative financial instruments primarily to seek to reduce market risk from changes in interest
rates or foreign currency exchange rates, and to alter interest rate or foreign currency exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities. In addition, derivatives are used in our futures operations for trading purposes.

Trading Activities

We engage in trading activities primarily in connection with our equity and
futures operations, as well as, historically, in our former domestic retail securities brokerage business. We maintain trading inventories in various equity, foreign exchange instruments and commodities, primarily to facilitate transactions for our
clients. Market risk affects the values of our trading inventories through fluctuations in absolute or relative interest rates, credit spreads, foreign currency exchange rates, securities and commodity prices. We seek to use short security positions
and forwards, futures, options and other derivatives to limit exposure to interest rate and other market risks. We also trade derivative financial instruments that allow our clients to manage exposure to interest rate, currency and other market
risks. Most of our derivative transactions involve exchange-listed contracts and are short term in duration. We act both as a broker, by selling exchange-listed contracts, and as a dealer, by entering into futures and security transactions as a
principal. As a broker, we assume counterparty and credit risks that we seek to mitigate by using margin or other credit enhancements and by establishing trading limits and credit lines. As a dealer, we are subject to market risk as well as
counterparty and credit risk. We manage the market risk associated with trading activities through hedging activities and formal policies, risk and position limits, counterparty and credit limits, daily position monitoring, and other forms of risk
management.

Value-at-Risk

VaR is one of the tools we use to monitor and manage our exposure to the
market risk of our trading activities. We calculate a VaR that encompasses our trading activities using a 95% confidence level. The VaR method incorporates the risk factors to which the market value of our trading activities is exposed, which
consist of interest rates, including credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices, estimates of volatilities from historical data, the sensitivity of our trading activities to changes in those market factors and



the correlations of those factors. We regularly test our VaR model by comparing actual adverse results to those estimated by the VaR model with a 95%
confidence level over a one-day time horizon. The VaR for our trading activities expressed in terms of adverse changes to fair value at the 95% confidence level over a one-day time horizon was $2 million as of December 31, 2003 and $2 million as of
December 31, 2002. The average daily VaR for our trading activities, expressed in terms of adverse changes to fair value with a 95% confidence level over a one-day time horizon, was $2 million during 2003 and $4 million during 2002. The following
table sets forth a breakdown of this VaR by risk component as follows:

(1)

As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and during the years then ended, VaR from foreign currency exchange rate risk in our trading activities was immaterial.

Limitations of VaR Models

Although VaR models represent a recognized tool for risk management, they
have inherent limitations, including reliance on historical data that may not be indicative of future market conditions or trading patterns. Accordingly, you should not view VaR models as a predictor of future results. We may incur losses that could
be materially in excess of the amounts indicated by the models on a particular trading day or over a period of time, and there have been instances when results have fallen outside the values generated by our VaR models. A VaR model does not estimate
the greatest possible loss. We use these models together with other risk management tools, including stress testing. The results of these models and analysis thereof are subject to the judgment of our risk management personnel.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.    BUSINESS

Prudential Financial, Inc. (“Prudential Financial”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Prudential” or the “Company”) provide a wide range of insurance, investment management, and other financial products and
services to both retail and institutional customers throughout the United States and in many other countries. Principal products and services provided include life insurance, annuities, mutual funds, pension and retirement related investments and
administration, and asset management. In addition, the Company provides securities brokerage services indirectly through a minority ownership in a joint venture. The Company has organized its principal operations into the Financial Services
Businesses and the Closed Block Business. The Financial Services Businesses operate through three operating divisions: Insurance, Investment, and International Insurance and Investments. Businesses that are not sufficiently material to warrant
separate disclosure and businesses to be divested are included in Corporate and Other operations within the Financial Services Businesses. The Closed Block Business, which includes the Closed Block (see Note 8), is managed separately from the
Financial Services Businesses. The Closed Block Business was established on the date of demutualization and includes the Company’s in force participating insurance and annuity products and assets that are used for the payment of benefits and
policyholder dividends on these products, as well as other assets and equity that support these products and related liabilities. In connection with the demutualization, the Company has ceased offering these participating products.

Demutualization and Initial Public Offering

On December 18, 2001 (the “date of demutualization”), The
Prudential Insurance Company of America (“Prudential Insurance”) converted from a mutual life insurance company to a stock life insurance company and became an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial. The demutualization
was completed in accordance with the Company’s Plan of Reorganization, which was approved by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance of the State of New Jersey in October 2001.

On the date of demutualization, policyholder membership interests in Prudential Insurance were extinguished and eligible
policyholders collectively received shares of Common Stock, the rights to receive cash and increases to their policy values in the form of policy credits. The demutualization was accounted for as a reorganization. Accordingly, the Company’s
retained earnings on the date of demutualization, after the distribution of the above consideration, was reclassified to “Common Stock” and “Additional paid-in capital.” At the time of demutualization, Prudential Financial
completed an initial public offering of 126.5 million shares of Common Stock at a price of $27.50 per share which included 16.5 million shares of Common Stock as a result of the exercise of the over-allotment option granted to underwriters in the
initial public offering. Also on the date of demutualization, Prudential Financial completed the sale, through a private placement, of 2.0 million shares of Class B Stock, a separate class of common stock, at a price of $87.50 per share. The Common
Stock reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Class B Stock reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business.

Concurrent with the demutualization, Prudential Insurance completed a corporate reorganization whereby various subsidiaries (and certain related assets
and liabilities) of Prudential Insurance were dividended so that they became wholly owned subsidiaries of Prudential Financial rather than of Prudential Insurance. The subsidiaries distributed by Prudential Insurance to Prudential Financial included
its property and casualty insurance companies, its principal securities brokerage companies, its international insurance companies, its principal asset management operations, its international securities and investments operations, its domestic
banking operations and its residential real estate brokerage franchise and relocation services operations.

2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Prudential Financial, its majority-owned subsidiaries and those partnerships and joint ventures in which the Company has a majority financial interest, except in those instances
where the Company cannot exercise control because the minority owners have substantive participating rights in the operating and capital decisions of the entity. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Intercompany



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(continued)

balances and transactions have been eliminated. Effective on the date of
demutualization and corporate reorganization, the historical consolidated financial statements of Prudential Insurance became the historical consolidated financial statements of Prudential Financial.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, in particular deferred policy acquisition costs, value of business acquired, investments, future policy benefits, disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Earnings Per Share

As discussed in Note 1 under “Demutualization and Initial Public Offering,” the Company has outstanding two separate classes of common stock.
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing available income attributable to each of the two groups of common shareholders by the respective weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share
reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised.

Stock Options

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company changed its accounting for employee stock options to adopt the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” as amended, prospectively for all new awards granted to employees on or after January 1, 2003. During 2002 and 2001, the Company
accounted for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations. Under this method, the Company did not recognize
any stock-based compensation expense for employee stock options as all options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying Common Stock on the date of grant. The Company accounts for non-employee stock options using the
fair value method. See Note 14 for pro forma net income and earnings per share, as well as additional information pertaining to stock options.

Investments

Fixed maturities classified as “available for sale” are carried at estimated fair value. Fixed maturities that the Company has both the positive
intent and ability to hold to maturity are stated at amortized cost and classified as “held to maturity.” The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such
amortization and accretion is included in “Net investment income.” The amortized cost of fixed maturities is written down to estimated fair value when a decline in value is considered to be an other than temporary impairment. See the
discussion below on realized investment gains and losses for a description of the accounting for impairments. Unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities “available for sale,” net of income tax and the effect on deferred policy
acquisition costs, future policy benefits and policyholders’ dividends that would result from the realization of unrealized gains and losses, are included in a separate component of equity, “Accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss).”

Trading account assets and securities sold but
not yet purchased consist primarily of investments and derivatives used by the Company either in its capacity as a broker-dealer, its operation of hedge portfolios or its use of derivatives for asset and liability management activities. These
instruments are carried at estimated fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading account assets and securities sold but not yet purchased are included in “Commissions and other income.”

Equity securities, available for sale, are comprised of common and
non-redeemable preferred stock and are carried at estimated fair value. The associated unrealized gains and losses, net of income tax and the effect on deferred policy acquisition costs, future policy benefits and policyholders’ dividends that
would result from the realization of



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(continued)

unrealized gains and losses, are included in “Accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss).” The cost of equity securities is written down to estimated fair value when a decline in value is considered to be an other than temporary impairment. See the discussion below on realized investment gains and losses
for a description of the accounting for impairments.

Commercial loans are stated primarily at unpaid principal balances, net of unamortized discounts and an allowance for losses. In connection with the acquisition of Gibraltar Life (see Note 3), commercial loans were acquired at a discount to
par and are carried at amortized cost. Accretion of the discount over the remaining lives of the loans is included in “Net investment income.” The allowance for losses includes a loan specific reserve for non-performing loans and a
portfolio reserve for incurred but not specifically identified losses. Non-performing loans include those loans for which it is probable that amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not all be collected. These loans
are measured at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Interest received on non-performing loans, including
loans that were previously modified in a troubled debt restructuring, is either applied against the principal or reported as revenue, according to management’s judgment as to the collectibility of principal. Management discontinues accruing
interest on non-performing loans after the loans are 90 days delinquent as to principal or interest, or earlier when management has serious doubts about collectibility. When a loan is recognized as non-performing, any accrued but uncollectible
interest is reversed against interest income of the current period. Generally, a loan is restored to accrual status only after all delinquent interest and principal are brought current and, in the case of loans where the payment of interest has been
interrupted for a substantial period, a regular payment performance has been established. The portfolio reserve for incurred but not specifically identified losses considers the Company’s past loan loss experience, the current credit
composition of the portfolio, historical credit migration, property type diversification, default and loss severity statistics and other relevant factors.

Policy loans are carried at unpaid principal balances.

Securities repurchase and resale agreements and securities borrowed and loaned transactions are used to generate income, to borrow funds, or to facilitate
trading activity. Securities repurchase and resale agreements are generally short-term in nature, and therefore, the carrying amounts of these instruments approximate fair value. Securities repurchase and resale agreements are collateralized
principally by U.S. government and government agency securities. Securities borrowed or loaned are collateralized principally by cash or U.S. government securities. For securities repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions used to
generate income, the cash received is typically invested in cash equivalents, short-term investments or fixed maturities.

Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase that satisfy certain criteria are treated as
collateralized financing arrangements. These agreements are carried at the amounts at which the securities will be subsequently resold or reacquired, as specified in the respective agreements. The Company’s policy is to take possession or
control of securities purchased under agreements to resell and to value the securities daily. Assets to be repurchased or resold are the same, or substantially the same, as the assets transferred or received. The market value of securities to be
repurchased is monitored, and additional collateral is obtained, where appropriate, to protect against credit exposure. Income and expenses related to these transactions executed within our general account, insurance subsidiaries, and broker-dealer
used to generate income is reported as net investment income; however, for transactions used to borrow funds, the associated borrowing cost is reported as interest expense (included in “General and administrative expenses”). Income and
expenses related to these transactions executed within our mortgage banking, derivative dealer and hedge portfolio operations are reported in “Commissions and other income.”

Securities borrowed and securities loaned are treated as financing arrangements and are recorded at the amount of cash
advanced or received. With respect to securities loaned, the Company obtains collateral in an amount equal to 102% and 105% of the fair value of the domestic and foreign securities, respectively. The Company monitors the market value of securities
borrowed and loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained or provided as necessary. Substantially all of the Company’s securities borrowed transactions are with brokers and dealers,

(continued)

commercial banks and institutional clients. Substantially all of the
Company’s securities loaned transactions are with large brokerage firms. Income and expenses associated with securities borrowing activities is included in “Net investment income.” Income and expenses associated with securities
lending activities used to generate income is generally included in “Net investment income;” however, for securities lending activity used for funding purposes the associated rebate is reported as interest expense (included in
“General and administrative expenses”).

Other
long-term investments consist of the Company’s investments in joint ventures and limited partnerships in which the Company does not exercise control as well as investments in the Company’s own separate accounts, which are carried at
estimated fair value, and investment real estate. Joint venture and partnership interests are generally accounted for using the equity method of accounting, except in instances in which the Company’s interest is so minor that it exercises
virtually no influence over operating and financial policies. In such instances, the Company applies the cost method of accounting. The Company’s net income from investments in joint ventures and partnerships is generally included in “Net
investment income.”

Real estate held for disposal is
carried at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value less estimated selling costs and is not further depreciated once classified as such. Real estate which the Company has the intent to hold for the production of income is carried at depreciated
cost less any write-downs to fair value for impairment losses and is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the review indicates that
the carrying value of the investment real estate exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows (excluding interest charges) from the investment. At that time, the carrying value of the investment real estate is written down to fair value.
Depreciation on real estate held for the production of income is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the properties, and is included in “Net investment income.”

Short-term investments consist of highly liquid debt instruments with a
maturity of greater than three months and less than twelve months when purchased. These investments are carried at amortized cost which, because of their short term, approximates fair value.

Realized investment gains (losses), net are computed using the specific
identification method. Costs of fixed maturities and equity securities are adjusted for impairments, which are declines in value that are considered to be other than temporary. Impairment adjustments are included in “Realized investment gains
(losses), net.” In evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary, the Company considers several factors including, but not limited to the following: (1) whether the decline is substantial; (2) the duration of the decline
(generally greater than six months); (3) the reasons for the decline in value (credit event, interest related or market fluctuation); (4) the Company’s ability and intent to hold the investments for a period of time to allow for a recovery of
value; and (5) the financial condition of and near-term prospects of the issuer. Provisions for losses on commercial loans are included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” Decreases in the carrying value of investment real estate
held for disposal or for the production of income are recorded in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.”

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks, money market instruments and other debt issues with a maturity of three months or
less when purchased.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs

The costs that vary with and that are related
primarily to the production of new insurance and annuity business are deferred to the extent such costs are deemed recoverable from future profits. Such costs include commissions, costs of policy issuance and underwriting, and variable field office
expenses. Deferred policy acquisition costs (“DAC”) are subject to recoverability testing at the end of each accounting period. DAC, for applicable products, is adjusted for the impact of unrealized gains or losses on investments as if
these gains or losses had been realized, with corresponding credits or charges included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).”

(continued)

For participating life insurance included in the Closed
Block, DAC is amortized over the expected life of the contracts (up to 45 years) in proportion to estimated gross margins based on historical and anticipated future experience, which is evaluated regularly. The average rate of assumed future
investment yield used in estimating expected gross margins was 7.33% at December 31, 2003 and gradually increases to 8.06% for periods after December 31, 2031. The effect of changes in estimated gross margins on unamortized deferred acquisition
costs is reflected in “General and administrative expenses” in the period such estimated gross margins are revised. Policy acquisition costs related to interest-sensitive and variable life products and certain investment-type products are
deferred and amortized over the expected life of the contracts (periods ranging from 7 to 30 years) in proportion to estimated gross profits arising principally from investment results, mortality and expense margins, and surrender charges based on
historical and anticipated future experience, which is updated periodically. The effect of changes to estimated gross profits on unamortized deferred acquisition costs is reflected in “General and administrative expenses” in the period
such estimated gross profits are revised. DAC related to non-participating traditional individual life insurance is amortized over the expected life of the contracts in proportion to premiums.

The Company has offered programs under which policyholders, for a selected
product or group of products, can exchange an existing policy or contract issued by the Company for another form of policy or contract. These transactions are known as internal replacements. If policyholders surrender traditional life insurance
policies in exchange for life insurance policies that do not have fixed and guaranteed terms, the Company immediately charges to expense an estimate of the remaining unamortized DAC on the surrendered policies. For other internal replacement
transactions, the unamortized DAC on the surrendered policies is immediately charged to expense if the terms of the new policies are not substantially similar to those of the former policies. If the new policies have terms that are substantially
similar to those of the earlier policies, the DAC is retained with respect to the new policies and amortized over the expected life of the new policies.

For property and casualty insurance contracts, DAC is amortized over the period in which related premiums are earned. Future investment income is
considered in determining the recoverability of DAC.

For group
annuity defined contribution contracts and funding agreement notes issuance program, acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the expected life of the contracts in proportion to estimated gross profits. For group and individual long-term
care contracts, acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the expected life of the contracts in proportion to premiums. For other group life and disability insurance, group annuities and guaranteed investment contracts, acquisition costs
are expensed as incurred.

Separate Account Assets and Liabilities

Separate account assets and liabilities are reported
at estimated fair value and represent segregated funds which are invested for certain policyholders, pension funds and other customers. The assets consist of common stocks, fixed maturities, real estate related investments, real estate mortgage
loans and short-term investments. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are generally not subject to claims that arise out of any other business of the Company. Investment risks associated with market value changes are borne by the
customers, except to the extent of minimum guarantees made by the Company with respect to certain accounts. The investment income and gains or losses for separate accounts generally accrue to the policyholders and are not included in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Mortality, policy administration and surrender charges on the accounts are included in “Policy charges and fee income.” Asset management fees charged to the accounts are included in “Commissions
and other income.”

Other Assets and Other Liabilities

Other assets consist primarily of prepaid benefit
costs, reinsurance recoverables, certain restricted assets, trade receivables, value of business acquired, goodwill and other intangible assets, the Company’s investment in Wachovia Securities Financial Holdings, LLC. (“Wachovia
Securities”), mortgage securitization inventory, property and equipment and receivables resulting from sales of securities that had not yet settled at the balance sheet date. Commercial mortgage loans and other securities sold by the Company in
securitization transactions for the years ended

(continued)

December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, were $1,179 million, $615 million and
$1,409 million, respectively. In some of the commercial loan securitizations, the Company retained servicing responsibilities, however, did not retain any material ownership interest in the financial assets that were transferred. The Company
recognized net pre-tax gains of $19 million, $18 million and $60 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, in connection with securitizations transactions, which are recorded in “Commissions and other
income.” Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which generally range from 3 to 40 years. Other
liabilities consist primarily of trade payables, employee benefit liabilities, demutualization consideration not yet paid to policyholders and payables resulting from purchases of securities that had not yet settled at the balance sheet date.

As a result of certain acquisitions and the application of
purchase accounting, the Company reports a financial asset representing the value of business acquired (“VOBA”). VOBA represents the present value of future profits embedded in acquired insurance and annuity contracts. VOBA is determined
by estimating the net present value of future cash flows from the contracts in force at the date of acquisition. For acquired traditional insurance contracts, future positive cash flows generally include net valuation premiums while future negative
cash flows include policyholders’ benefits and certain maintenance expenses. For acquired annuity contracts, future positive cash flows generally include fees and other charges assessed to the contracts as long as they remain in force as well
as fees collected upon surrender, if applicable, while future negative cash flows include costs to administer contracts, and benefit payments. The Company amortizes VOBA over the effective life of the acquired contracts. For acquired traditional
insurance contracts, VOBA is amortized in proportion to gross premiums or in proportion to the face amount of insurance in force, as applicable. For acquired annuity contracts VOBA is amortized in proportion to estimated gross profits arising from
the contracts and anticipated future experience, which is evaluated regularly. The effect of changes in estimated gross profits on unamortized VOBA is reflected in “General and administrative expenses” in the period such estimates of
expected future profits are revised.

Contingencies

Amounts related to contingencies are accrued if it is probable that a
liability has been incurred and an amount is reasonably estimable.

Insurance Revenue and Expense Recognition

Premiums from life insurance policies, excluding interest-sensitive life contracts, are recognized when due. Benefits are recorded as an expense when they are incurred. A liability for future policy benefits is recorded when premiums are
recognized using the net level premium method.

Premiums from
non-participating group annuities with life contingencies, structured settlements with life contingencies and single premium immediate annuities with life contingencies are recognized when received. Benefits are recorded as an expense when they are
incurred. A liability for future policy benefits is recorded when premiums are recognized, based on the present value of future benefits and expenses.

Certain annuity contracts provide the holder a guarantee that the benefit received upon death will be no less than a minimum prescribed amount that is
based upon a combination of net deposits to the contract, net deposits to the contract accumulated at a specified rate or the highest historical account value on a contract anniversary. To the extent the guaranteed minimum death benefit exceeds the
current account value at the time of death, the Company incurs a cost that is recorded as “Policyholders’ benefits” for the period in which death occurs.

Amounts received as payment for interest-sensitive life contracts, deferred annuities, structured settlements and other
contracts without life contingencies, and participating group annuities are reported as deposits to “Policyholders’ account balances.” Revenues from these contracts are reflected in “Policy charges and fee income,” or as a
reduction of “Interest credited to policyholders’ account balances,” and consist primarily of fees assessed during the period against the policyholders’ account balances for mortality charges, policy administration charges and
surrender charges. Benefits and expenses for these products include claims in excess of related account balances, expenses of contract administration, interest credited and amortization of DAC.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

(continued)

For group life and disability insurance, and property and
casualty insurance, premiums are recognized over the period to which the premiums relate in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided. Claim and claim adjustment expenses are recognized when incurred.

Premiums, benefits and expenses are stated net of reinsurance ceded to other
companies. Estimated reinsurance recoverables and the cost of reinsurance are recognized over the life of the reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the underlying policies.

Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations and subsidiaries reported in
other than U.S. dollars are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period. Revenues, benefits and other expenses are translated at the average rate prevailing during the period. The effects of translating the statements of
financial position of non-U.S. entities with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included, net of related hedge gains and losses and income taxes, in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).”

Commissions and Other Income

Commissions and other income principally includes securities and commodities
commission revenues and asset management fees which are recognized in the period in which the services are performed, as well as earnings from our investment in Wachovia Securities. Realized and unrealized gains from trading activities of the
Company’s securities and investment management businesses are also included in “Commissions and other income.”

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company adopted SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended, on January 1, 2001. Except as
noted below, the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the results of operations of the Company. In 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.” The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the results of operations of the Company, other than as discussed below.

Upon its adoption of SFAS No. 133, the Company reclassified “held to maturity” securities with a fair market value of approximately $12,085
million to “available for sale” as permitted by the new standard. This reclassification resulted in unrealized investment gains of $94 million, net of tax, which were recorded as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss)” at the time of the transfer in 2001.

Upon its
adoption of SFAS No. 149, the Company recharacterized certain contracts to acquire “to be announced” securities from “Fixed maturities—available for sale” to derivatives within “Other long-term investments”. The
impact of adoption of this standard included a reduction of approximately $3.2 billion of available for sale securities, as of December 31, 2003, with the related offsets recorded in “Other assets” and “Other liabilities.” In
addition, an asset related to these contracts of approximately $12 million was reported in “Other long-term investments,” as of December 31, 2003, with a related gain reported in “Realized investment gains (losses), net” for the
year ended December 31, 2003.

Derivatives are financial
instruments whose values are derived from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices, or the values of securities or commodities. Derivative financial instruments used by the Company include swaps, futures, forwards and option
contracts and may be exchange-traded or contracted in the over-the-counter market. Derivative positions are carried at estimated fair value, generally by obtaining quoted market prices or through the use of pricing models. Values can be affected by
changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices, values of securities or commodities, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity. Values can also be affected by changes in estimates and assumptions used in pricing models.

Derivatives are used to manage the characteristics of the
Company’s asset/liability mix, manage the interest rate and currency characteristics of invested assets and to mitigate the risk of a diminution, upon translation to U.S. dollars,



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

(continued)

of expected non-U.S. earnings resulting from unfavorable changes in
currency exchange rates. They are also used in a derivative dealer capacity in the Company’s securities operations to meet the needs of clients by structuring transactions that allow clients to manage their exposure to interest rates, foreign
exchange rates, indices or prices of securities and commodities and similarly in a dealer capacity through the operation of hedge portfolios in a limited-purpose subsidiary. Additionally, derivatives may be used to seek to reduce exposure to
interest rate and foreign currency risks associated with assets held or expected to be purchased or sold, and liabilities incurred or expected to be incurred.

Derivatives are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position either as assets, within “Trading account assets,”
“Broker-dealer related receivables,” or “Other long-term investments,” or as liabilities, within “Broker-dealer related payables” or “Other liabilities.” Realized and unrealized changes in fair value of
derivatives used in a dealer capacity are included in “Commissions and other income” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the periods in which the changes occur. Cash flows from such derivatives are reported in the operating
activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

As discussed in detail below and in Note 18, all realized and unrealized changes in fair value of non-dealer related derivatives, with the exception of the effective unrealized portion of cash flow hedges and effective hedges of net
investments in foreign operations, are recorded in current earnings. Cash flows from these derivatives are reported in the investing activities section in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

For non-dealer related derivatives the Company designates derivatives as
either (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or unrecognized firm commitment (“fair value” hedge); (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a
recognized asset or liability (“cash flow” hedge); (3) a foreign-currency fair value or cash flow hedge (“foreign currency” hedge); (4) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation; or (5) a derivative that does not qualify
for hedge accounting.

To qualify for hedge accounting
treatment, a derivative must be highly effective in mitigating the designated risk of the hedged item. Effectiveness of the hedge is formally assessed at inception and throughout the life of the hedging relationship. Even if a derivative qualifies
for hedge accounting treatment, there may be an element of ineffectiveness of the hedge. Under such circumstances, the ineffective portion of adjusting the derivative to fair value is recorded in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.”

The Company formally documents all relationships between
hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as fair value, cash flow or foreign currency hedges to
specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions.

When a derivative is designated as a fair value hedge and is determined to be highly effective, changes in its fair value, along with changes in the fair
value of the hedged asset or liability (including losses or gains on firm commitments), are reported on a net basis in the income statement line item associated with the hedged item. Under certain circumstances, the change in fair value of an
unhedged item is either not recorded or recorded instead in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” When such items are hedged and the hedge qualifies as a fair value hedge, the change in fair value of both the hedged item and the
derivative are reported on a net basis in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” Periodic settlements associated with such derivatives are recorded in the same income statement line as the related settlements of the hedged items.

When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge and is
determined to be highly effective, changes in its fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows (

e.g

., when periodic settlements on a
variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings). At that time, the related portion of deferred gains or losses on the derivative instrument is reclassified and reported in the income statement line item associated with the hedged item.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(continued)

When a derivative is designated as a foreign currency
hedge and is determined to be highly effective, changes in its fair value are recorded in either current period earnings or “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” depending on whether the hedge transaction is a fair value hedge
(

e.g

., a hedge of a firm commitment that is to be settled in a foreign currency) or a cash flow hedge (

e.g

., a foreign currency denominated forecasted transaction). When a derivative is used as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign
operation, its change in fair value, to the extent effective as a hedge, is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment account within “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).”

If a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting, all changes in its
fair value, including net receipts and payments, are included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net” without considering changes in the fair value of the economically associated assets or liabilities.

The Company occasionally is a party to a financial instrument that contains a
derivative instrument that is “embedded” in the financial instrument. At inception, the Company assesses whether the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the
remaining component of the financial instrument (

i.e

., the host contract) and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative instrument. When it is determined that (1)
the embedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract, and (2) a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the
embedded derivative is separated from the host contract, carried at fair value, and changes in its fair value are included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.”

When it is determined that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair value or cash flow hedge or management
removes the hedge designation, the derivative will continue to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value, with changes in fair value recognized currently in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” The asset or liability under a
fair value hedge will no longer be adjusted for changes in fair value and the existing basis adjustment is amortized to the income statement line associated with the asset or liability. The component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss)” related to discontinued cash flow hedges is amortized to the income statement line associated with the hedged cash flows over the original term of the hedge contract.

When hedge accounting is discontinued because the hedged item no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment, or
because it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the specified time period, the derivative will continue to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value, with changes in fair value recognized currently in
“Realized investment gains (losses), net.” Any asset or liability that was recorded pursuant to recognition of the firm commitment is removed from the balance sheet and recognized currently in “Realized investment gains (losses),
net.” Gains and losses that were in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” pursuant to the hedge of a forecasted transaction are recognized immediately in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.”

Income Taxes

The Company and its eligible domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return that includes both life
insurance companies and non-life insurance companies. In addition to taxes on operations, the Internal Revenue Code imposes an “equity tax” on mutual life insurance companies. Subsequent to the demutualization, the Company is no longer
subject to the equity tax. Subsidiaries operating outside the United States are taxed, and income tax expense is recorded, based on applicable foreign statutes.

Deferred income taxes are recognized, based on enacted rates, when assets and liabilities have different values for financial statement and tax
reporting purposes. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce a deferred tax asset to the amount expected to be realized.

Demutualization Costs and Expenses

Demutualization costs and expenses include the cost of engaging external
accounting, actuarial, investment banking, legal and other consultants to advise the Company, the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance and the New York State Insurance Department in the demutualization process and related matters as well
as the cost of printing and postage for communications with policyholders and other administrative costs. Demutualization costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001 also include $340 million of demutualization consideration paid to
former Canadian branch policyholders pertaining to certain policies that Prudential Insurance transferred to London Life Insurance Company in 1996.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) revised Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 46, “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities”, which was originally issued in January 2003. FIN No. 46 addresses whether certain types of entities, referred to as variable interest entities (“VIEs”), should be consolidated in a company’s financial
statements. A VIE is an entity that either (1) has equity investors that lack certain essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest (including the ability to control the entity, the obligation to absorb the entity’s expected
losses and the right to receive the entity’s expected residual returns) or (2) lacks sufficient equity to finance its own activities without financial support provided by other entities, which in turn would be expected to absorb at least some
of the expected losses of the VIE. An entity should consolidate a VIE if it stands to absorb a majority of the VIE’s expected losses or to receive a majority of the VIE’s expected residual returns. The Company adopted FIN No. 46 for
relationships with VIEs that began on or after February 1, 2003, and on December 31, 2003, adopted the revised guidance for all relationships with VIEs that are special purpose entities (“SPEs”). The Company will implement the revised
guidance to relationships with potential VIEs that are not SPEs as of March 31, 2004. The transition to the revised guidance for SPEs as of December 31, 2003, resulted in the deconsolidation of certain previously consolidated SPEs, with no material
effect to the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company does not believe the transition to the revised guidance on March 31, 2004, will have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

In July 2003, the
Accounting Standards Executive Committee (“AcSEC”) of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) issued Statement of Position (“SOP”) 03-01, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises
for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts.” AcSEC has developed the SOP to address the evolution of product designs since the issuance of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 60,
“Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises,” and SFAS No. 97, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments” and the
need for interpretive guidance to be developed in three areas: separate account presentation and valuation; the accounting recognition given sales inducements (bonus interest, bonus credits, persistency bonuses); and the classification and valuation
of certain long-duration contract liabilities.

The most
significant accounting implications of the SOP are as follows: (1) reporting and measuring assets and liabilities of separate account products as general account assets and liabilities when specified criteria are not met; (2) reporting and measuring
seed money in separate accounts as general account assets based on the insurer’s proportionate beneficial interest in the separate account’s underlying assets; (3) capitalizing sales inducements that meet specified criteria and amortizing
such amounts over the life of the contracts using the same methodology as used for amortizing deferred acquisition costs, but immediately expensing those sales inducements accrued or credited if such criteria are not met; (4) recognizing
contractholder liabilities for: (a) modified guaranteed (market value adjusted) annuities at accreted balances that do not include the then current market value surrender adjustment, (b) two-tier annuities at the lower (non-annuitization) tier
account value, (c) persistency bonuses at amounts that are not reduced for expected forfeitures, (d) group pension participating and similar general account “pass through” contracts that are not accounted for under SFAS No. 133 at amounts
based on the fair value of the assets or index that determines the investment return pass through; (5) establishing an additional liability for guaranteed minimum death and similar mortality and morbidity benefits only for contracts determined to
have mortality and morbidity risk that is other than

(continued)

nominal and when the risk charges made for a period are not proportionate
to the risk borne during that period; and (6) for contracts containing an annuitization benefits contract feature, if such contract feature is not accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No. 133 establishing an additional liability for the
contract feature if the present value of expected annuitization payments at the expected annuitization date exceeds the expected account balance at the expected annuitization date.

The Company will adopt the SOP effective January 1, 2004. The effect of initially adopting this SOP will be reported as a
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the 2004 results of operations, which the Company expects to be a charge of approximately $75 million, net of taxes. This charge is caused primarily by the impact of converting a large group
annuity contract and certain individual market value adjusted (“MVA”) annuity contracts from separate account accounting treatment to general account accounting treatment and an increase in reserves for guaranteed minimum death benefits.
In addition, the FASB is currently considering the accounting for certain unearned revenue liabilities under the SOP, which could result in a decrease in the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle to be recorded.

In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 133 Implementation Issue No.
B36, “Embedded Derivatives: Modified Coinsurance Arrangements and Debt Instruments That Incorporate Credit Risk Exposures That Are Unrelated or Only Partially Related to the Creditworthiness of the Obligor Under Those Instruments.”
Implementation Issue No. B36 indicates that a modified coinsurance arrangement (“modco”), in which funds are withheld by the ceding insurer and a return on those withheld funds is paid based on the ceding company’s return on certain
of its investments, generally contains an embedded derivative feature that is not clearly and closely related to the host contract and should be bifurcated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities.” Effective October 1, 2003, the Company adopted the guidance prospectively for existing contracts and all future transactions. As permitted by SFAS No. 133, all contracts entered into prior to January 1,
1999, were grandfathered and are exempt from the provisions of SFAS No. 133 that relate to embedded derivatives. The application of Implementation Issue No. B36 had no impact on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the
Company.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150,
“Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.” SFAS No. 150 generally applies to instruments that are mandatorily redeemable, that represent obligations that will be settled with a
variable number of company shares, or that represent an obligation to purchase a fixed number of company shares. For instruments within its scope, the statement requires classification as a liability with initial measurement at fair value.
Subsequent measurement depends upon the certainty of the terms of the settlement (such as amount and timing) and whether the obligation will be settled by a transfer of assets or by issuance of a fixed or variable number of equity shares. The
Company’s adoption of SFAS No. 150, as of July 1, 2003, did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.”
SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 146, such amounts were recorded
upon the Company’s commitment to a restructuring plan. The Company has adopted this statement for applicable transactions occurring on or after January 1, 2003.

In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,
Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.” FIN No. 45 expands existing accounting guidance and disclosure requirements for certain guarantees and requires the recognition of a liability for the fair value of certain types of
guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The January 1, 2003 adoption of the Interpretation’s guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets.” SFAS No. 142 requires that an intangible asset acquired either individually or with a group of other assets shall initially be recognized and measured based on fair value. An intangible asset with a finite life is amortized
over its useful life to the reporting



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

(continued)

entity; an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life, including
goodwill, is not amortized. All indefinite lived intangible assets shall be tested for impairment in accordance with the statement. The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 as of January 1, 2002.

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”
SFAS No. 144 eliminated the requirement that discontinued operations be measured at net realizable value or that entities include losses that have not yet occurred. SFAS No. 144 eliminated the exception to consolidation for a subsidiary for which
control is likely to be temporary. The implementation of this provision was not material to the Company’s financial position. SFAS No. 144 requires that long-lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book value
or fair value less cost to sell. An impairment for assets that are not to be disposed of is recognized only if the carrying amounts of long-lived assets are not recoverable and exceed their fair values. Additionally, SFAS No. 144 expands the scope
of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations and cash flows that (1) can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and (2) will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal
transaction. Consequently, certain activities included in discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements would not have been recorded as discontinued operations prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 144. See Note 3 for additional
information pertaining to discontinued operations. The Company adopted SFAS No. 144 effective January 1, 2002.

Certain amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

3.    ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

Acquisition of CIGNA Corporation’s Retirement Business

On November 17, 2003, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive Stock Purchase and Asset Transfer Agreement with CIGNA Corporation
(“CIGNA”) and certain of its affiliates, pursuant to which the Company will acquire CIGNA’s retirement business. The total consideration payable in the transaction is a cash purchase price of $2.1 billion, subject to certain
adjustments. The transaction is subject to various closing conditions, including, among others, state insurance and other regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first half of 2004.

Acquisition of Skandia U.S. Inc

.

On May 1, 2003, the Company acquired Skandia U.S. Inc. (“Skandia
U.S.”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Skandia Insurance Company Ltd. (“Skandia”). The Company purchased newly issued shares of common stock representing 90% of the outstanding common stock of Skandia U.S. and one share of a newly
issued class of preferred stock (collectively the “Shares”) and entered into an agreement at the date of acquisition whereby the Company had the right to acquire, and Skandia had the right to require the Company to acquire, the remaining
10% of outstanding common stock. This agreement was accounted for as a financing transaction until the Company purchased the remaining 10% in the third quarter of 2003. The Company’s acquisition of Skandia U.S. included American Skandia, Inc.
(“American Skandia”). American Skandia, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, is the largest distributor of variable annuities through independent financial planners in the U. S. and operates a mutual fund business.

Effective May 1, 2003, 100% of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
and the results of operations have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The total purchase price was as follows:

3.    ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

(continued)

The following table represents an allocation of the purchase price to assets
acquired and liabilities assumed:

(a)

The proceeds were used by Skandia U.S. to retire an aggregate of $646 million of unsecured debt and collateralized notes held by Skandia.

(b)

Prior to the Company’s acquisition of Skandia U.S., Skandia acquired certain subsidiaries of Skandia U.S. The cash Skandia paid to Skandia U.S. for these subsidiaries has been
repaid to Skandia and is considered a component of the purchase price.

(c)

In May 2003, subsequent to the Company’s acquisition of Skandia U.S., Skandia U.S. paid a dividend to Prudential Financial of approximately $108 million, reducing the equity of
Skandia U.S. by that amount.

As described in
Note 2, VOBA represents the present value of profits embedded in acquired insurance and annuity contracts and is determined based on the net present value of future cash flows expected to result from the contracts in force at the date of
acquisition. For the American Skandia business, future cash flows include future positive cash flows such as fees and other charges assessed against the contract, and future negative cash flows such as costs to administer the contracts and benefit
payments including payments under guaranteed minimum death benefit (“GMDB”) provisions.

Certain contracts issued by American Skandia include a MVA feature that requires the Company to pay to the contract holder upon surrender the accreted
value of the fund as well as a market value adjustment based on the crediting rates on the contract surrendered compared to crediting rates on newly issued contracts. As of December 31, 2003, this liability is reflected at market value, which
considers the effects of unrealized gains and losses in contract value resulting from changes in crediting rates. Upon adoption of SOP 03-01 effective January 1, 2004, the Company will account for American Skandia’s contracts containing MVA
features as described previously under “New Accounting Pronouncements” and will recognize an explicit liability for the GMDB provision of its contracts. The recognition of a liability for GMDB provisions associated with the American
Skandia business and the change in the liability for the MVA feature associated with the American Skandia business will result in a net decrease in VOBA of approximately $130 million, since the expected cash flows on American Skandia’s business
in force at the time of acquisition that corresponds to the obligations covered by SOP-03-01 were considered in establishing the initial VOBA.

As of December 31, 2003, the Company’s VOBA was $489 million, principally related to the American Skandia acquisition.

The following table provides estimated future amortization of value of
business acquired, net of interest, including the effect of adoption of SOP 03-01, for the periods indicated.

Investment in Wachovia
Securities

On July 1, 2003, the Company completed the
combination of its retail securities brokerage and clearing operations with those of Wachovia Corporation (“Wachovia”) to form a joint venture, Wachovia Securities Financial Holdings, LLC (“Wachovia Securities”). The Company has
a 38% ownership interest in the joint venture, while Wachovia owns the remaining 62%. The transaction included certain assets and liabilities of the Company’s securities brokerage operations but did not include its equity sales, trading and
research operations. As part of the transaction the Company retained certain assets and liabilities related to the contributed businesses, including liabilities for certain litigation and regulatory matters. The Company accounts for its 38%
ownership of the joint venture under the equity method of accounting; periods prior to July 1, 2003, continue to reflect the results of the Company’s previously wholly-owned securities brokerage operations on a fully consolidated basis.

Results for the year ended December 31, 2003, include a
pre-tax gain of $22 million from the combination of the businesses.

The Company recognized pre-tax equity earnings from Wachovia Securities of $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The pre-tax equity earnings from Wachovia Securities are included in “Commissions and other income”
within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company’s investment in Wachovia Securities as of December 31, 2003, was $1 billion and is included in “Other assets” in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

Acquisition of Kyoei Life Insurance Company, Ltd.

In April 2001, the Company completed the acquisition of Kyoei Life Insurance
Co., Ltd. (“Kyoei”), a stock life insurance company located in Japan, which has been accounted for as a purchase. Kyoei was renamed Gibraltar Life Insurance Company, Ltd. (“Gibraltar Life”) by the Company concurrent with the
acquisition. Gibraltar Life primarily offers individual life insurance in Japan, and its distribution is primarily through an agency force and affinity groups.

3.    ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

(continued)

Prior to its acquisition, Gibraltar Life filed for reorganization under the
Reorganization Law of Japan. The Reorganization Law, similar to Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, is intended to provide a mechanism for restructuring financially troubled companies by permitting the adjustment of the interests of creditors,
shareholders and other interested parties. On April 2, 2001, the Tokyo District Court issued its official recognition order approving the Reorganization Plan. The Reorganization Plan became effective immediately upon the issuance of the recognition
order, and is binding upon Gibraltar Life, its creditors, including policyholders, its former shareholders and other interested parties, whether or not they submitted claims or voted for or against the plan. The Reorganization Plan included the
extinguishment of all existing stock for no consideration and the issuance of 1.0 million new shares of common stock. Also under the Reorganization Plan, Gibraltar Life was discharged from all financial indebtedness, retaining only liabilities under
insurance policies and contracts, certain pension liabilities, liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business and certain other claims. Gibraltar Life’s in force insurance policies, except for group life, collective term and
reinsurance policies, were restructured such that guaranteed interest rates and cash surrender values were reduced and special surrender charges imposed. Pursuant to the Reorganization Plan, on April 19, 2001 the Company contributed ¥50 billion
($395 million based on currency exchange rates at that time) in cash to Gibraltar Life’s capital and on April 20, 2001 received 100% of Gibraltar Life’s newly issued common stock. The Company also provided ¥98 billion ($775 million
based on currency exchange rates at that time) to Gibraltar Life in the form of a subordinated loan.

In years four and eight following the recognition of the Reorganization Plan by the Tokyo District Court, a special dividend to certain Gibraltar Life
policyholders will be payable based on 70% of net realized investment gains, if any, over the value included in the Reorganization Plan of real estate and loans, net of transaction costs and taxes. As of December 31, 2003, a liability of $882
million is included in “Policyholders’ dividends” which is based on the difference between the current estimated fair values of loans and real estate at the date of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and the value of
such assets included in the Reorganization Plan.

For purposes
of inclusion in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, Gibraltar Life has adopted a November 30 fiscal year end; therefore, the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, include Gibraltar Life’s assets
and liabilities as of November 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, include Gibraltar Life’s results of operations for the periods April 2, 2001 through November 30, 2001,
December 1, 2001 through November 30, 2002 and December 1, 2002 through November 30, 2003. The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements include income from continuing operations before income taxes for Gibraltar Life of $345 million, $221
million and $238 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Discontinued Operations

Results of operations of discontinued businesses, including charges upon disposition, for the years ended December 31, are as follows:



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

3.    ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

(continued)

The Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include
total assets and total liabilities related to discontinued businesses of $1,511 million and $1,172 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003 and $3,107 million and $2,600 million, respectively, at December 31, 2002.

(a)

In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company announced its decision to exit certain of the international securities operations of Prudential Securities Group Inc. in Europe. The
exited operations include European retail transaction-oriented stockbrokerage and related activities. As a result of exiting these activities, the primary business of Prudential Securities Group Inc. in Europe is the provision of private banking and
wealth management services to high net worth individuals. Institutional services in Europe are limited primarily to the sale of U.S. equities. The loss for the discontinued businesses for the year ended December 31, 2002 includes a pre-tax charge of
$38 million relating primarily to severance and termination benefits and office closure costs.

In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company determined, based upon its expected continued involvement with certain of the international securities operations of Prudential Securities
Group Inc. after their sale, that those operations no longer qualified for discontinued operations treatment. As such, the results of these businesses (after tax losses of $15 million and $4 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, and after tax
income of $1 million in 2001) were reclassified to continuing operations for all periods.

(b)

In the third quarter of 2002, the Company discontinued its web-based business for the workplace distribution of voluntary benefits. The loss for the year ended December 31, 2002
includes a pre-tax impairment charge of $32 million on the Company’s investment in a vendor of that distribution platform, as well as a pre-tax charge of $7 million related to severance and contract termination costs.

(c)

The sale of the Company’s healthcare business to Aetna was completed in 1999. The loss the Company previously recorded upon the disposal of its healthcare business was reduced
in each of the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. The reductions were primarily the result of favorable resolution of certain legal, regulatory and contractual matters. Although the Company no longer issues or renews healthcare policies,
it was required to issue and renew policies for specified periods of time after the closing date, in order to provide for uninterrupted operation and growth of the business that Aetna acquired. All such policies were 100% coinsured by Aetna.
Consequently, the following amounts pertaining to the coinsurance agreement had no effect on the Company’s results of operations. Ceded premiums and benefits were $(2) million and $(7) million, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2003.
Ceded premiums and benefits were $27 million and $17 million, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2002. Ceded premium and benefits were $966 million and $827 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2001. Reinsurance
recoverable under this agreement, included in “Other assets,” was $14 million at December 31, 2003 and $45 million at December 31, 2002.

(d)

Includes the results of the Company’s specialty automobile and work-place distribution property and casualty insurance operations, which the Company sold in 2003 and early
2004, respectively.

(e)

Other includes the results of the consumer banking operations, which the Company decided to exit in the third quarter of 2003, and the retail broker-dealer operations in Tokyo which
the Company decided to sell in the fourth quarter of 2002.

Charges recorded in connection with the disposals of businesses include estimates that are subject to subsequent adjustment. It is possible that such adjustments might be material to future results of operations of a
particular quarterly or annual period.

Disposition of Other Property and
Casualty Insurance Operations

In the fourth quarter
of 2003, the Company completed the sale of its property and casualty insurance companies that operated nationally in 48 states outside of New Jersey, and the District of Columbia, to Liberty Mutual Group, as well as its New Jersey property and
casualty insurance companies to Palisades Group. Results of these businesses are included in “Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes” for all periods. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company recognized a
loss on disposition of $491 million ($319 million after taxes), recorded within “Loss from disposition of property and casualty insurance operations,” which also includes management’s best estimate of the cost of retained liabilities,
including litigation pertaining to events before the closing and the estimated value of indemnification coverage provided in connection with potential adverse claim experience and a $57 million abandonment and impairment loss recorded in connection
with certain long-lived assets.

The following
table shows the fair value and gross unrealized losses aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual fixed maturity securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, as of December 31, 2003:

(1)

Includes $1,617 million of fair value and $26 million of gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2003 on securities classified as held to maturity, which are not reflected in
accumulated other comprehensive income.

As of
December 31, 2003, gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities totaled $493 million comprising 1,023 issuers. Of this amount, there was $412 million in less than twelve months category comprising 922 issuers and $81 million in the greater than
twelve months category comprising 101 issuers. The $493 million of gross unrealized losses is comprised of $396 million related to investment grade securities and $97 million related to below investment grade securities. Approximately $39 million of
the total gross unrealized losses represented declines in value of greater than 20%, none of which had been in that position for a period of twelve months or more, and substantially all of which were less than six months old. The $81 million of
gross unrealized losses of twelve months or more were concentrated in the retail, finance and manufacturing sectors and there were no individual issuers with gross unrealized losses greater than $10 million. Based on a review of the above
information in conjunction with other factors as outlined in the policy surrounding other than temporary impairments (see Note 2), the Company has concluded that an adjustment for other than temporary impairments is not warranted at December 31,
2003.

AND OTHER INTANGIBLES

The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 as
of January 1, 2002. The Company ceased the amortization of goodwill as of that date and determined that the implementation of the standard’s transition provisions did not result in an impairment loss as of the adoption date. Net loss would have
been approximately $133 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, had the provisions of the new standard been applied as of January 1, 2001. Goodwill amortization amounted to $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The changes in the
book value of goodwill by segment, are as follows:

(a)

Other represents foreign currency translation and purchase price adjustments.

The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually as of December 31 and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more
likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The December 31, 2003 annual impairment test resulted in no impairments. As a result of the December 31, 2002 annual impairment test, the Company determined that
the goodwill related to its Property and Casualty Insurance business, included in Corporate and Other above, was impaired. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $33 million representing the entire carrying amount of the
business’s goodwill.

7.    POLICYHOLDERS’ LIABILITIES

Future Policy Benefits

Future policy benefits at December 31, are as follows:

The Company’s
individual participating insurance is included within the Closed Block Business. Participating insurance represented 30% and 34% of domestic individual life insurance in force at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and 92%, 91% and 92% of
domestic individual life insurance premiums for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Life insurance liabilities include reserves for death and endowment policy benefits, terminal dividends and certain health benefits. Annuity liabilities include reserves for life contingent immediate annuities and
life contingent group annuities. Other contract liabilities primarily consist of unearned premium and benefit reserves for group health products and, for periods prior to December 31, 2003, property and casualty insurance.

Future policy benefits for individual participating traditional life
insurance are based on the net level premium method, calculated using the guaranteed mortality and nonforfeiture interest rates which range from 2.5% to 9.5%; less than 1% of the reserves are based on an interest rate in excess of 8%.

Future policy benefits for individual non-participating traditional life
insurance policies, group and individual long-term care policies and individual health insurance policies are equal to the aggregate of (1) the present value of future benefit payments and related expenses, less the present value of future net
premiums, and (2) premium deficiency reserves. Assumptions as to mortality, morbidity and persistency are based on the Company’s experience when the basis of the reserve is established. Interest rates used for the aggregate reserves range from
1.4% to 14%; less than 1% of the reserves are based on an interest rate in excess of 8%.

Future policy benefits for individual and group annuities are equal to the aggregate of (1) the present value of expected future payments on the basis of actuarial assumptions established at issue, and (2) premium
deficiency reserves. Assumptions as to mortality are based on the Company’s experience when the basis of the reserve is established. The interest rates used in the determination of the aggregate reserves range from 1.8% to 14.8%; less than 2%
of the reserves are based on an interest rate in excess of 8%.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

7.    POLICYHOLDERS’ LIABILITIES

(continued)

Future policy benefits for other contract liabilities are generally equal to
the present value of expected future payments based on the Company’s experience (except for certain group insurance coverages for which future policy benefits are equal to gross unearned premium reserves). The interest rates used in the
determination of the aggregate reserves range from 2.5% to 9.3%; less than 3% of the reserves are based on an interest rate in excess of 8%.

Premium deficiency reserves are established, if necessary, when the liability for future policy benefits plus the present value of expected future gross
premiums are determined to be insufficient to provide for expected future policy benefits and expenses and to recover any unamortized policy acquisition costs. Premium deficiency reserves have been recorded for the group single premium annuity
business, which consists of limited-payment, long-duration traditional and non-participating annuities; structured settlements and single premium immediate annuities with life contingencies; and for certain individual health policies. Liabilities of
$2,830 million and $2,457 million are included in “Future policy benefits” with respect to these deficiencies at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Policyholders’ Account Balances

Policyholders’ account balances at December 31, are as follows:

Policyholders’
account balances for interest-sensitive life and investment-type contracts represent an accumulation of account deposits plus credited interest less withdrawals, expenses and mortality charges, if applicable. Included in funding agreements at
December 31, 2003, are $1,052 million of medium-term notes of consolidated trust entities secured by funding agreements purchased with the proceeds of such notes. The interest rates associated with such notes range from 1.3% to 3.9%. Interest
crediting rates range from 0.5% to 9.5% for interest-sensitive life contracts and from 0.0% to 13.8% for investment-type contracts. Less than 3% of policyholders’ account balances have interest crediting rates in excess of 8%.

The accident and health reinsurance recoverable balance related to unpaid claims at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 includes $1 million, $9 million and $117 million, respectively, attributable to the Company’s discontinued healthcare business.

The unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses presented
above include estimates for liabilities associated with reported claims and for incurred but not reported claims based, in part, on the Company’s experience. Changes in the estimated cost to settle unpaid claims are charged or credited to the
Consolidated Statements of Operations periodically as the estimates are revised. Accident and health unpaid claims liabilities are discounted using interest rates ranging from 3.5% to 7.5%.

The amounts incurred for claims and claim adjustment expenses for property
and casualty that related to prior years were primarily driven by lower than anticipated losses for the auto line of business and prior period reserve releases related to mold claims in 2003 and group personal catastrophe coverage in 2002. The
amounts incurred for claims and claim adjustment expenses for accident and health in 2003 that related to prior years were primarily due to required interest somewhat offset by long-term disability claim termination experience, and long-term
disability claim termination experience for 2002 and 2001.

8.    CLOSED BLOCK

On the
date of demutualization, Prudential Insurance established a Closed Block for certain individual life insurance policies and annuities issued by Prudential Insurance in the United States. The Closed Block forms the principal component of the Closed
Block Business. For a discussion of the Closed Block Business see Note 19. The Company established a separate closed block for participating individual life insurance policies issued by the Canadian

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

8.    CLOSED BLOCK

(continued)

branch of Prudential Insurance. Due to the substantially smaller number of outstanding
Canadian policies, this separate closed block is insignificant in size and is not included in the information presented below.

The policies included in the Closed Block are specified individual life insurance policies and individual annuity contracts that were in force on the
effective date of the Plan of Reorganization and for which Prudential Insurance is currently paying or expects to pay experience-based policy dividends. Assets have been allocated to the Closed Block in an amount that has been determined to produce
cash flows which, together with revenues from policies included in the Closed Block, are expected to be sufficient to support obligations and liabilities relating to these policies, including provision for payment of benefits, certain expenses, and
taxes and to provide for continuation of the policyholder dividend scales in effect in 2000, assuming experience underlying such scales continues. To the extent that, over time, cash flows from the assets allocated to the Closed Block and claims and
other experience related to the Closed Block are, in the aggregate, more or less favorable than what was assumed when the Closed Block was established, total dividends paid to Closed Block policyholders in the future may be greater than or less than
the total dividends that would have been paid to these policyholders if the policyholder dividend scales in effect in 2000 had been continued. Any cash flows in excess of amounts assumed will be available for distribution over time to Closed Block
policyholders and will not be available to stockholders. If the Closed Block has insufficient funds to make guaranteed policy benefit payments, such payments will be made from assets outside of the Closed Block. The Closed Block will continue in
effect as long as any policy in the Closed Block remains in force unless, with the consent of the New Jersey insurance regulator, it is terminated earlier.

The recorded assets and liabilities were allocated to the Closed Block at their historical carrying amounts.

The excess of Closed Block Liabilities over Closed Block Assets at the date
of the demutualization (adjusted to eliminate the impact of related amounts in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)”) represented the estimated maximum future earnings at that date from the Closed Block expected to result from
operations attributed to the Closed Block after income taxes. In establishing the Closed Block, the Company developed an actuarial calculation of the timing of such maximum future earnings. If actual cumulative earnings of the Closed Block from
inception through the end of any given period are greater than the expected cumulative earnings, only the expected earnings will be recognized in income. Any excess of actual cumulative earnings over expected cumulative earnings will represent
undistributed accumulated earnings attributable to policyholders, which are recorded as a policyholder dividend obligation. The policyholder dividend obligation represents amounts to be paid to Closed Block policyholders as an additional
policyholder dividend unless otherwise offset by future Closed Block performance that is less favorable than originally expected. If the actual cumulative earnings of the Closed Block from its inception through the end of any given period are less
than the expected cumulative earnings of the Closed Block, the Company will recognize only the actual earnings in income. However, the Company may reduce policyholder dividend scales in the future, which would be intended to increase future actual
earnings until the actual cumulative earnings equaled the expected cumulative earnings. As of December 31, 2003, the Company has not recognized a policyholder dividend obligation for the excess of actual cumulative earnings over the expected
cumulative earnings. However, net unrealized investment gains that have arisen subsequent to the establishment of the Closed Block have been reflected as policyholder dividend obligations of $2,443 million and $1,606 million at December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively, to be paid to Closed Block policyholders unless otherwise offset by future experience, with an offsetting amount reported in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).”

On December 11, 2002 and November 13, 2001, Prudential Insurance’s Board
of Directors acted to reduce dividends, effective January 1, 2003 and 2002, respectively, on Closed Block policies to reflect unfavorable investment experience that had emerged since July 1, 2000, the date the Closed Block was originally funded.
These actions resulted in a $56 million reduction of the liability for policyholder dividends recognized in the year ended December 31, 2002.

9.    REINSURANCE

The
Company participates in reinsurance in order to provide additional capacity for future growth and limit the maximum net loss potential arising from large risks. Life reinsurance is accomplished through various plans of reinsurance, primarily yearly
renewable term and coinsurance. Prior to the sale of the Company’s property and casualty insurance businesses, property and casualty reinsurance was placed on a pro-rata basis and excess of loss, including stop-loss, basis. Reinsurance ceded
arrangements do not discharge the Company as the primary insurer. Ceded balances would represent a liability of the Company in the event the reinsurers were unable to meet their obligations to the Company under the terms of the reinsurance
agreements. Reinsurance premiums, commissions, expense reimbursements, benefits and reserves related to reinsured long-duration contracts are accounted for over the life of the underlying reinsured contracts using assumptions consistent with those
used to account for the underlying contracts. The cost of reinsurance related to short-duration contracts is accounted for over the reinsurance contract period. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers, for both short and long-duration reinsurance
arrangements, are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liabilities and policy benefits associated with the reinsured policies.

The tables presented below exclude amounts pertaining to the Company’s discontinued operations.

Reinsurance amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for
the years ended December 31, were as follows:

(continued)

Reinsurance recoverables, included in “Other assets” at December
31, are as follows:

Three major
reinsurance companies account for approximately 65% of the reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2003. The Company periodically reviews the financial condition of its reinsurers and amounts recoverable therefrom in order to minimize its exposure
to loss from reinsurer insolvencies, recording an allowance when necessary for uncollectible reinsurance.

10.    SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT

Short-term Debt

Short-term debt at December 31, is as follows:

The weighted average
interest rate on outstanding short-term debt, excluding the current portion of long-term debt, was approximately 1.1% and 1.6% at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

At December 31, 2003, the Company had $2,566 million in committed lines of credit from numerous financial institutions, all
of which were unused. These lines of credit generally have terms ranging from one to five years.

The Company issues commercial paper primarily to manage operating cash flows and existing commitments, to meet working capital needs and to take advantage
of current investment opportunities. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, a portion of commercial paper borrowings were supported by $2,500 million of the Company’s existing lines of credit. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the weighted average
maturity of commercial paper outstanding was 18 and 19 days, respectively.

(continued)

Long-term Debt

Long-term debt at December 31, is as follows:

(a)

Annual scheduled repayments of principal for the Series A and Series C notes begin in 2013. Annual scheduled repayments of principal for the Series B notes begin in 2018.

(b)

U.S. Dollar fixed rate notes at December 31, 2003 include $711 million related to the issuance of equity security units. See Note 11 for more details regarding equity security
units.

(c)

The interest rate on the Series A notes is a floating rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.875% per year. The interest rate ranged from 1.94% to 2.29% in 2003 and 2.29% to 2.87% in 2002.

(d)

The interest rate on the Japanese Yen denominated fixed rate note was 2.2% in 2002. This note was prepaid in 2003.

(e)

The interest rates on the U.S. dollar denominated FRNs are generally based on rates such as LIBOR, Constant Maturity Treasury and the Federal Funds Rate. Interest rates on the U.S.
dollar denominated FRNs ranged from 1.72% to 4.58% in 2002. U.S. Dollar floating rate notes at December 31, 2002 included $375 million related to a variable interest entity that was deconsolidated upon the adoption of the revised guidance under FIN
No. 46 on December 31, 2003.

(f)

The interest rates on the Japanese Yen denominated FRNs are based on the Yen LIBOR plus 1.20%. The interest rates ranged from 1.27% to 1.33% in 2002. These FRNs were prepaid in
2003.

(g)

The interest rate on the Surplus notes ranged from 7.65% to 8.30% in 2003 and 2002.

Several long-term debt agreements have restrictive covenants related to the total amount of debt, net tangible assets and
other matters. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants.

Payment of interest and principal on the surplus notes issued after 1993, of which $691 million and $690 million was outstanding at December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively, may be made only with the prior approval of the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance of the State of New Jersey (“the Commissioner”). The Commissioner could prohibit the payment of the interest and principal on the
surplus notes if certain statutory capital requirements are not met. At December 31, 2003, the Company has met these statutory capital requirements.

In order to modify exposure to interest rate and currency exchange rate movements, the Company utilizes derivative instruments, primarily interest rate
swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt issues. These instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The impact of these instruments, which is not reflected in the rates presented in the table above, were decreases in interest expense of
$18 million and $15 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Floating rates are determined by contractual formulas and may be subject to certain minimum or maximum rates. See Note 18 for additional information on the
Company’s use of derivative instruments.

Interest expense
for short-term and long-term debt was $403 million, $427 million and $647 million, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Securities business related interest expense of $82 million, $144 million and $287 million for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, is included in “Net investment income.”

Included in “Policyholders’ account balances” are additional debt obligations of the Company. See Note 7 for further discussion.

Prudential Holdings, LLC Notes

On the date of demutualization, Prudential Holdings, LLC
(“PHLLC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial, issued $1.75 billion in senior secured notes (the “IHC debt”). PHLLC owns the capital stock of Prudential Insurance and does not have any operating businesses of its
own. The IHC debt represents senior secured obligations of PHLLC with limited recourse; neither Prudential Financial, Prudential Insurance nor any other affiliate of PHLLC is an obligor or guarantor on the IHC debt. The IHC debt is collateralized by
13.8% of the outstanding common stock of Prudential Insurance and other items specified in the indenture, primarily the “Debt Service Coverage Account” (the “DSCA”) discussed below.

PHLLC’s ability to meet its obligations under the IHC debt is dependent
principally upon sufficient available funds being generated by the Closed Block Business and the ability of Prudential Insurance, the sole direct subsidiary of PHLLC, to dividend such funds to PHLLC. The payment of scheduled principal and interest
on the Series A notes and the Series B notes is insured by a financial guarantee insurance policy. The payment of principal and interest on the Series C notes is not insured. The IHC debt is redeemable prior to its stated maturity at the option of
PHLLC and, in the event of certain circumstances, the IHC debt bond insurer can require PHLLC to redeem the IHC debt.

Net proceeds from the IHC debt amounted to $1,727 million. The majority of the net proceeds, or $1,218 million, was distributed to Prudential Financial
through a dividend on the date of demutualization for use in the Financial Services Businesses. Net proceeds of $437 million were deposited to a restricted account within PHLLC. This restricted account, referred to as the DSCA, constitutes
additional collateral for the IHC debt. The remainder of the net proceeds, or $72 million, was used to purchase a guaranteed investment contract to fund a portion of the financial guarantee insurance premium related to the IHC debt.

Summarized consolidated financial data for Prudential Holdings, LLC is
presented below. Amounts for 2001 include results of operations and cash flows of Prudential Insurance prior to the date of demutualization.

Prudential Financial
is a holding company and is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. The rights of Prudential Financial to participate in any distribution of assets of any subsidiary, including upon its liquidation or reorganization, are subject
to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary, except to the extent that Prudential Financial may itself be a creditor of that subsidiary and its claims are recognized. PHLLC and its subsidiaries have entered into covenants and arrangements
with third parties in connection with the issuance of the IHC debt which are



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

10.    SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT

(continued)

intended to confirm their separate, “bankruptcy-remote” status, by assuring that
the assets of PHLLC and its subsidiaries are not available to creditors of Prudential Financial or its other subsidiaries, except and to the extent that Prudential Financial and its other subsidiaries are, as shareholders or creditors of PHLLC and
its subsidiaries, or would be, entitled to those assets.

At
December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with all IHC debt covenants.

11.    EQUITY SECURITY UNITS

On the date of demutualization, Prudential Financial and Prudential Financial Capital Trust I (the “Trust”) co-issued 13,800,000 6.75% equity security units (the “Units”) to the public at an offering price of $50 per
Unit for gross proceeds of $690 million. Each Unit has a stated amount of $50 and initially consists of (1) a contract requiring the holder to purchase (the “purchase contract”) shares of Common Stock of Prudential Financial on November
15, 2004 (the “settlement date”), at a price determined by a formula described in the purchase contract and (2) a redeemable capital security of the Trust, with a stated liquidation amount of $50. The Trust was created as a statutory
business trust under Delaware law and as a wholly-owned financing subsidiary of Prudential Financial, and was consolidated into the financial statements of the Company prior to the adoption of the revised guidance under FIN No. 46 described below.
The redeemable capital securities are initially pledged to secure the obligations of the Unit holders to purchase Common Stock under the purchase contracts. The number of shares of Common Stock that will be received upon settlement of the purchase
contracts (the “settlement rate”) will be based upon the “applicable market value” of the Common Stock, defined as the average of the closing price per share of Common Stock on each of the twenty consecutive trading days ending
on the third trading day preceding the settlement date. If the “applicable market value” of the Common Stock is equal to or greater than $34.10, then the settlement rate will be 1.47 shares of Common Stock per purchase contract. If the
“applicable market value” of the Common Stock is less than or equal to $27.50, then the settlement rate will be 1.82 shares of Common Stock per purchase contract. If the “applicable market value” of the Common Stock is greater
than $27.50 but less than $34.10, the settlement rate will be equal to $50 divided by the “applicable market value” of Common Stock per purchase contract.

At the time of issuance of the Units, the Trust also issued 426,805 shares of common securities to Prudential Financial at a
price of $50 per common security for gross proceeds of $21 million. The combined proceeds to the Trust from the issuances of the redeemable capital securities and the common securities (collectively, the “Trust securities”), or $711
million, were invested by the Trust in $711 million aggregate principal amount of 5.34% debentures of Prudential Financial maturing on November 15, 2006. The interest rate payable on the debentures will be reset to, and at the time of, any reset to
the distribution rate on the redeemable capital securities as noted below. Prudential Financial may defer interest payments on the debentures; however, the payments cannot be deferred beyond the maturity date of the debentures of November 15, 2006.
Upon repayment of the debentures by Prudential Financial to the Trust on their maturity date, the Trust will use the cash proceeds, after satisfaction of any liabilities to creditors of the Trust, to repay the redeemable capital securities at their
aggregate stated liquidation amount plus any accrued and unpaid distributions. The Trust may not redeem the redeemable capital securities at any other time, for any reason or under any other circumstances. The debentures represent the sole assets of
the Trust and the redeemable capital securities and common securities represent an undivided beneficial ownership interest in the assets of the Trust. The redeemable capital securities rank equally with the common securities except that, in the
event of default by Prudential Financial on the debentures, the redeemable capital securities become senior to the common securities. The debentures are unsecured obligations of Prudential Financial and rank equally in right of payment to all other
senior unsecured debt of Prudential Financial. Prudential Financial is dependent on dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries in order to make the principal and interest payments on the debentures.

Holders of the purchase contracts receive, from Prudential Financial,
quarterly contract fee payments at an annual rate of 1.41% of the stated amount of $50 per purchase contract through and including the settlement date. Prudential Financial has the option to defer contract fee payments on the purchase contracts;
however, the payments cannot be deferred beyond the settlement date. Holders of the redeemable capital securities receive, from the Trust, quarterly cumulative cash distributions at an annual rate of 5.34% of the stated liquidation amount of $50 per
redeemable capital



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

11.    EQUITY SECURITY UNITS

(continued)

security through and including August 15, 2004. The quarterly distribution rate on the
redeemable capital securities may be reset, in conjunction with a planned remarketing of the redeemable capital securities on August 15, 2004, effective for distributions and interest accrued from August 16, 2004 to November 15, 2006. If Prudential
Financial defers interest payments on the debentures as noted above, the Trust will also defer distributions on the Trust securities. During any period in which payments are deferred on the purchase contracts or on the debentures and Trust
securities, Prudential Financial cannot declare or pay any dividends or distributions on its capital stock, other than the Class B stock, or make certain other payments relating to the capital stock, other than the Class B Stock, and debt of the
Company that is equal to or junior to the debentures. As of December 31, 2003, no payments have been deferred.

Prudential Financial has irrevocably guaranteed, on a senior and unsecured basis, distributions on and the stated liquidation amount of the redeemable
capital securities to the extent of available Trust funds. The guarantee is unsecured and ranks equally in right of payment to all other senior unsecured debt of Prudential Financial. Prudential Financial currently has no outstanding secured or
other debt that would rank senior to this guarantee; however, Prudential Financial’s guarantee is effectively junior to the debt and other liabilities of its subsidiaries. The guarantee, when taken together with Prudential Financial’s
obligations under the debentures and its obligations to the Trust, have the effect of providing a full and unconditional guarantee of amounts due on the redeemable capital securities.

Prior to December 31, 2003, the financial statements of the Trust are consolidated within the financial statements of the
Company. Accordingly, the investment in the common securities of the Trust by Prudential Financial and the investment in the debentures of Prudential Financial by the Trust are eliminated in consolidation and the redeemable capital securities, to
which the entire gross proceeds of $690 million from the issuance of the Units have been allocated, are reported as “Guaranteed beneficial interest in Trust holding solely debentures of Parent.” In addition, the interest payments on the
debentures by Prudential Financial and the corresponding interest income recognized by the Trust are eliminated in consolidation and the distributions on the redeemable capital securities by the Trust are reported within “General and
administrative expenses.” The present value of the sum of the contract fee payments on the purchase contracts of $26 million was recorded at issuance in 2001 as a charge directly to equity with a corresponding credit to liabilities. The
contract fee payments are allocated to the liability established and interest expense as the payments are made. Total issuance costs incurred in connection with the offering of the Units, which were paid by Prudential Financial, amounted to $27
million and are included in “Other assets.” The issuance costs are being amortized over the life of the debentures.

Effective December 31, 2003 the Company implemented the revised guidance under FIN No. 46. As a result, the financial statements of the Trust, a variable
interest entity, are no longer consolidated within the financial statements of the Company, since the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the Trust. Accordingly, the $711 million of Prudential Financial debentures maturing on November 15, 2006
is now reported as “Long-term debt,” and the investment in common securities of $21 million is reported in “Other assets.” Additionally, beginning in 2004 the distributions on the redeemable capital securities will no longer be
recognized within the financial statements of the Company, but will be replaced by the interest expenses attributable to the payments on the debentures. The contract fee payments and the issuance cost in connection with the offering of the Units
will continue to be accounted for as discussed above.

12.    STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Preferred Stock

Prudential Financial
adopted a shareholder rights plan (the “rights plan”) under which each outstanding share of Common Stock is coupled with a shareholder right. The rights plan is not applicable to any Class B Stock. Each right initially entitles the holder
to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of a series of Prudential Financial preferred stock upon payment of the exercise price. At the time of the demutualization, the Board of Directors of Prudential Financial determined that the initial exercise
price per right is $110, subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in the rights plan. There was no preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2003 and 2002.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

12.    STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

(continued)

Common Stock and Class B Stock

On the date of demutualization, Prudential Financial completed an initial
public offering of 110.0 million shares of its Common Stock at an initial public offering price of $27.50 per share. The shares of Common Stock issued in the offerings were in addition to shares of Common Stock the Company distributed to
policyholders as part of the demutualization. On December 21, 2001, Prudential Financial issued an additional 16.5 million shares of Common Stock at an offering price of $27.50 per share as a result of the exercise of the over-allotment option
granted to underwriters in the initial public offering. The Common Stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “PRU.” Also on the date of demutualization, Prudential Financial completed the sale, through a private
placement, of 2.0 million shares of Class B Stock at a price of $87.50 per share. The Class B Stock is a separate class of common stock which is not publicly traded. The Common Stock reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses and
the Class B Stock reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business.

Holders of Common Stock have no interest in a legal entity representing the Financial Services Businesses and holders of the Class B Stock have no interest in a legal entity representing the Closed Block Business and
holders of each class of common stock are subject to all of the risks associated with an investment in the Company.

In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, holders of Common Stock and holders of Class B Stock would be entitled to receive
a proportionate share of the net assets of the Company that remain after paying all liabilities and the liquidation preferences of any preferred stock.

Dividends

The principal sources of funds available to Prudential Financial to meet its obligations, including the payment of shareholder dividends, debt service,
capital contributions to subsidiaries, and operating expenses, are cash and short-term investments, dividends, returns of capital, and interest from its subsidiaries. The regulated insurance and various other subsidiaries are subject to regulatory
limitations on their payment of dividends and other transfers of funds to Prudential Financial.

New Jersey insurance law provides that dividends or distributions may be declared or paid by Prudential Insurance without prior regulatory approval only
from unassigned surplus, as determined pursuant to statutory accounting principles, less unrealized capital gains and certain other adjustments. Unassigned surplus of Prudential Insurance was $1,557 million at December 31, 2003. There were
applicable adjustments for unrealized capital gains of $624 million at December 31, 2003. In addition, Prudential Insurance must obtain non-disapproval from the New Jersey insurance regulator before paying a dividend if the dividend, together with
other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, would exceed the greater of 10% of Prudential Insurance’s surplus as of the preceding December 31 or its net gain from operations for the twelve month period ending on
the preceding December 31, excluding realized capital gains and losses.

The laws regulating dividends of Prudential Financial’s other insurance subsidiaries domiciled in other states are similar, but not identical, to New Jersey’s. The laws of foreign countries may also limit the ability of the
Company’s insurance and other subsidiaries organized in those countries to pay dividends to Prudential Financial.

The declaration and payment of dividends on the Common Stock depends primarily upon the financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements,
future prospects and other factors relating to the Financial Services Businesses. Dividends declared and paid on the Common Stock do not depend upon and are not affected by the financial performance of the Closed Block Business, unless the Closed
Block Business is in financial distress. Dividends declared and paid on the Common Stock are not affected by decisions with respect to dividend payments on the Class B Stock except as indicated in the following paragraph. Furthermore, dividends on
the Common Stock are limited to both the amount that is legally available for payment under New Jersey corporate law if the Financial Services Businesses were treated as a separate corporation thereunder and the amount that is legally available for
payment under New Jersey corporate law on a consolidated basis after taking into account dividends on the Class B Stock.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

12.    STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

(continued)

The declaration and payment of dividends on the Class B Stock depends upon
the financial performance of the Closed Block Business and, as the Closed Block matures, the holders of the Class B Stock will receive the surplus of the Closed Block Business no longer required to support the Closed Block for regulatory purposes.
Dividends on the Class B Stock are payable in an aggregate amount per year at least equal to the lesser of (1) a Target Dividend Amount of $19.25 million or (2) the CB Distributable Cash Flow for such year, which is a measure of the net cash flows
of the Closed Block Business. Notwithstanding this formula, as with any common stock, Prudential Financial will retain the flexibility to suspend dividends on the Class B Stock; however, if CB Distributable Cash Flow exists and Prudential Financial
chooses not to pay dividends on the Class B Stock in an aggregate amount at least equal to the lesser of the CB Distributable Cash Flow or the Target Dividend Amount for that period, then cash dividends cannot be paid on the Common Stock with
respect to such period.

Stock Conversion Rights of the Class B Stock

Prudential Financial may, at its option, at any time,
exchange all outstanding shares of Class B Stock into such number of shares of Common Stock as have an aggregate average market value equal to 120% of the appraised fair market value of the outstanding shares of Class B Stock.

Holders of Class B Stock will be permitted to convert their shares of Class B
Stock into such number of shares of Common Stock as have an aggregate average market value equal to 100% of the appraised fair market value of the outstanding shares of Class B Stock (1) in the holder’s sole discretion, in the year 2016 or at
any time thereafter, and (2) at any time in the event that (a) the Class B Stock will no longer be treated as equity of Prudential Financial for federal income tax purposes or (b) the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance amends, alters,
changes or modifies the regulation of the Closed Block, the Closed Block Business, the Class B Stock or the IHC debt in a manner that materially adversely affects the CB Distributable Cash Flow; provided, however, that in no event may a holder of
Class B Stock convert shares of Class B Stock to the extent such holder immediately upon such conversion, together with its affiliates, would be the beneficial owner (as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of in excess of 9.9% of the
total outstanding voting power of Prudential Financial’s voting securities. In the event a holder of shares of Class B Stock requests to convert shares pursuant to clause (2)(a) in the preceding sentence, Prudential Financial may elect, instead
of effecting such conversion, to increase the Target Dividend Amount to $12.6875 per share per annum retroactively from the time of issuance of the Class B Stock.

Treasury Stock

In January 2002, Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $1 billion of Prudential Financial’s
outstanding Common Stock. During 2002, the Company acquired 26,027,069 shares of Common Stock at a total cost of $800 million, including 1,696,929 shares at a cost of $56 million that were immediately reissued to the Prudential Securities
Incorporated (“Prudential Securities”) deferred compensation program referred to in Note 14.

In March 2003, Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program that authorized Prudential Financial to purchase
up to an additional $1 billion of its outstanding Common Stock. During 2003, the Company acquired 29,076,809 shares of Common Stock at a total cost of $1.0 billion.

In March 2004, Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which the
Company is authorized to purchase up to $1.5 billion of its outstanding Common Stock in 2004. This stock repurchase program supersedes all previous repurchase programs. The timing and amount of repurchases are determined by management based on
market conditions and other considerations, and such repurchases may be effected in the open market or throughout negotiated transactions.

Treasury stock is accounted for at cost. When treasury stock is reissued, the treasury stock balance is reduced by the average cost per share.

The balance of and
changes in each component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” for the years ended December 31, are as follows (net of taxes):

Statutory Net Income and Surplus

Prudential Financial’s U.S. insurance
subsidiaries are required to prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the state of domicile. Statutory accounting practices primarily differ from
GAAP by charging policy acquisition costs to expense as incurred, establishing future policy benefit liabilities using different actuarial assumptions as well as valuing investments and certain assets and accounting for deferred taxes on a different
basis. Statutory net income (loss) of Prudential Insurance amounted to $1,231 million, $(490) million and $(896) million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Statutory capital and surplus of Prudential Insurance
amounted to $7,472 million and $5,699 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

13.    EARNINGS PER SHARE

The Company has outstanding two separate classes of common stock. The Common Stock reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Class B Stock reflects the performance of the Closed Block
Business. Accordingly, earnings per share is calculated separately for each of these two classes of common stock. Earnings per common share amounts are based on the earnings available to common stockholders for the periods subsequent to the date of
demutualization.

Net income for the Financial Services
Businesses and the Closed Block Business is determined in accordance with GAAP and includes general and administrative expenses charged to each of the respective businesses based on the



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

13.    EARNINGS PER SHARE

(continued)

Company’s methodology for the allocation of such expenses. Cash flows between the
Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business related to administrative expenses are determined by a policy servicing fee arrangement that is based upon insurance and policies in force and statutory cash premiums. To the extent
reported administrative expenses vary from these cash flow amounts, the differences are recorded, on an after tax basis, as direct equity adjustments to the equity balances of the businesses. The direct equity adjustments modify the earnings
available to each of the classes of common stock for earnings per share purposes.

Common Stock

A reconciliation of the
numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted per share computations is as follows:

For the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, 9,333,483 and 5,349,629 options, respectively, weighted for the portion of the period they were outstanding, with a weighted average exercise price of $31.66 and $32.97 per share, respectively, were excluded from the
computation of diluted earnings per share because the options, based on application of the treasury stock method, were antidilutive.

Class B Stock

The net income (loss) attributable to the Closed Block Business available to holders of Class B Stock after direct equity adjustment for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the period December 18, 2001 through



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

13.    EARNINGS PER SHARE

(continued)

December 31, 2001, amounted to $179 million, $(528) million and $3 million, respectively. For
the year ended December 31, 2003, the direct equity adjustment resulted in a decrease of $60 million in the net income attributable to the Closed Block Business applicable to holders of Class B Stock for earnings per share purposes. For the year
ended December 31, 2002, the direct equity adjustment resulted in an increase in loss of $43 million applicable to holders of the Class B stock for earnings per share purposes. There was no direct equity adjustment in 2001. For the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the period December 18, 2001 through December 31, 2001, the weighted average number of shares of Class B Stock used in the calculation of basic earnings per share amounted to 2,000,000 shares. There are no potentially
dilutive shares associated with the Class B Stock.

14.    STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

In March 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted the Prudential Financial, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Omnibus Plan”). Upon adoption of the Omnibus Plan, the Prudential Financial, Inc. Stock Option Plan
previously adopted by the Company on January 9, 2001 (the “Option Plan”) was merged into the Omnibus Plan. The Omnibus Plan provides for equity-based compensation incentives through the grant of stock options, and stock appreciation rights
(“SARs”), as did the Option Plan. The Omnibus Plan also provides for the grant of restricted stock shares, restricted stock units, and dividend equivalents, as well as cash and equity-based performance awards (“performance
shares”). Any authorized shares of Common Stock not used under the Option Plan are available for the grant of awards under the Omnibus Plan. All outstanding award grants under the Option Plan continue in full force and effect, subject to the
original terms under the Option Plan.

As of December 31, 2003,
65,231,100 authorized shares remained available for grant under the Omnibus Plan including previously authorized but unissued shares under the Option Plan.

Under the Omnibus Plan, the Company made grants of stock options, restricted stock shares, restricted stock units and performance share awards to
executives. Restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock options and performance shares are granted to executives on a recurring basis primarily as replacements for a portion of long-term cash compensation.

Through December 31, 2003, there have been no grants of SARs.

Options

Under the Option Plan, the Company had made two types of grants, an Associates Grant and general grants (the “Executive
Grants”). The Associates Grant, which occurred in December 2001, was a one-time broad based award that granted 240 stock options per full-time participant and 120 options per part-time participant. The Executive Grants, which began in 2002, are
awarded to certain officers on a recurring basis primarily as replacement for a portion of long-term cash compensation. Each stock option granted under either type of grant has or will have an exercise price no less than the fair market value of the
Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant and has a maximum term of 10 years. Generally, one third of the option grant vests in each of the first three years. Participants are employees and non-employees (i.e. statutory agents who perform
services for the Company and participating subsidiaries.)

Under the Option Plan, and subsequently the Omnibus Plan, a total of 12,322,009 shares were initially authorized for the Associates Grant and a total of 30,805,024 shares were initially authorized for the Executive Grants.

Employee Stock Option Grants

During 2002 and 2001, the Company accounted for employee stock options using
the intrinsic value method of APB No. 25, and related interpretations. Under this method, the Company did not recognize any stock-based compensation expense for employee stock options as all options granted had an exercise price equal to the market
value of the underlying Common Stock on the date of grant. Effective January 1, 2003, the Company changed its accounting for employee stock options to adopt the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended,



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

14.    STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

(continued)

prospectively for all new awards granted to employees on or after January 1, 2003. Generally,
awards previously issued under the Option Plan vest over three years. If the Company had accounted for all 2001 and 2002 employee stock option grants under the fair value based accounting method of SFAS No. 123 for the years ended December 31, 2003
and 2002 and the period December 18, 2001 through December 31, 2001, net income and earnings per share would have been as follows:

Grants of stock
options since the demutualization include the one-time Associates Grant in December 2001 and the Executive Grants during 2002 and 2003. The Executive Grants replace a portion of long-term cash compensation, which would have been expensed. The table
above reflects the pro forma effect of the fair value based accounting method considering both the 2001 Associates Grant and the 2002 Executive Grants. The pro forma effect of the 2002 Executive Grants, without considering the Associates Grant,
would have been to reduce net income by $24 million and $12 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, with a corresponding reduction of $0.04 and $0.02 to basic and diluted net income per share of Common Stock for the
years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The fair
value of each option issued prior to January 1, 2003 was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For options issued on or after January 1, 2003, the fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant
using a binomial option-pricing model. The weighted average assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of each option are as follows:

The dividend yield
reflects the assumption that the current dividend payout will continue with no anticipated increases.

Non-employee Stock Option Grants

The Company applies SFAS No. 123 in accordance with
Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 96-18 “Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees” and related interpretations in accounting for its non-employee stock options.

Prior to January 1, 2003, the fair value of each option was estimated on the
balance sheet date for nonvested options and on the vesting date for vested options using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. In 2003, the Company implemented a binomial option-pricing model. The fair value of each option under the binomial model
was estimated on the balance sheet date for nonvested options and on the vesting date for any option vesting during 2003. The weighted average assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of each option are as follows:

The dividend yield
reflects the assumption that the current dividend payout will continue with no anticipated increases.

The compensation expense recognized for stock-based non-employee compensation awards was $5 million, $4 million and $270 thousand for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the period December 18, 2001 through December 31, 2001, respectively.

A summary of the status of the Company’s non-employee stock option
grants is as follows:

Options exercisable
were 495,397 shares with a weighted average exercise price of $27.85 at December 31, 2003, 268,080 shares with a weighted average exercise price of $27.50 at December 31, 2002 and 1,200 shares with a weighted average exercise price at $27.50 at
December 31, 2001. The weighted average fair value for nonvested options and options vesting during the year was $14.80, $9.26 and $12.77 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The following table summarizes information about the non-employee stock
options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2003:

Restricted Stock Shares and
Restricted Stock Units

A restricted stock share
represents a grant of Common Stock to employee and non-employee participants that is subject to certain transfer restrictions and forfeiture provisions for a specified period of time. A restricted stock unit is an unfunded, unsecured right to
receive a share of Common Stock at the end of a specified period of time, which is also subject to forfeiture and transfer restrictions. Generally, the restrictions on restricted stock shares and restricted stock units will lapse on the third
anniversary of the date of grant. Restricted stock shares subject to the transfer restrictions and forfeiture provisions are considered nonvested shares. Nonvested shares forfeited by participants revert to the Company and are reflected as treasury
stock of the Company as of the date of forfeiture.

Performance Share Awards

Performance share awards are awards of units denominated in Common Stock.
The number of units is determined over the performance period, and may be adjusted based on the satisfaction of certain performance goals. Performance share awards are payable in Common Stock.

The following tables summarize awards granted, weighted average price,
compensation expense recorded and nonvested awards for restricted stock shares, restricted stock units and performance shares:

The weighted average
price of employee restricted stock shares, restricted stock units, and performance shares is based on the quoted fair value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant. The weighted average price of non-employee restricted stock shares
is based on the Company’s Common Stock price at the balance sheet date.

Deferred Compensation Program

Prior to the contribution of the Company’s
retail securities brokerage and clearing operations into the joint venture with Wachovia on July 1, 2003, the Company maintained a deferred compensation program for Financial Advisors and certain other employees (the “participants”) of the
contributed operations, under which participants elected to defer a portion of their compensation. Amounts deposited to participant accounts, including matching contributions as well as other amounts based on the attainment of specific performance
goals, vest in 3 to 8 years. Nonvested balances are forfeited if the participant is terminated for cause or voluntarily terminates prior to the vesting date. In 2002, participants were permitted to elect to redeem all or a portion of their existing
nonvested account balances and invest the proceeds in Prudential Financial Common Stock. Accordingly, the Company acquired, on behalf of the participants electing to participate, 1,696,929 shares of Common Stock at a total cost of $56 million. On
the date the account balances were converted to Common Stock, related remaining deferred compensation expense of $29 million, which is

being amortized over the vesting period, was recorded as a reduction in stockholders’
equity. The deferred compensation expense of $14 million, as of July 1, 2003, was included in the net assets of the Company’s retail securities brokerage and clearing operations contributed to the joint venture with that of Wachovia. The
results of operations of the joint venture, of which the Company owns a 38% interest, will include the amortization of the deferred compensation expense. As of December 31, 2003, there were 1,000,963 nonvested shares in participants accounts. The
Company continues to repurchase forfeited shares from the joint venture, which are reflected as treasury stock of the Company as of the date of forfeiture.

15.    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

The Company has funded and non-funded contributory and non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, which cover substantially all of its employees. For
some employees, benefits are based on final average earnings and length of service, while benefits for other employees are based on an account balance that takes into consideration age, service and salary during their career.

The Company provides certain life insurance and health care benefits for its
retired employees, their beneficiaries and covered dependents (“other postretirement benefits”). The health care plan is contributory; the life insurance plan is non-contributory. Substantially all of the Company’s U.S. employees may
become eligible to receive other postretirement benefits if they retire after age 55 with at least 10 years of service or under certain circumstances after age 50 with at least 20 years of continuous service. The Company has elected to amortize its
transition obligation for other postretirement benefits over 20 years.

On December 8, 2003 President Bush signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“the Act”) into law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D). This
legislation may eventually reduce the Company’s costs for retiree health care benefits.

On January 12, 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. SFAS 106-1, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003”
(“FSP 106-1”). As permitted by FSP 106-1, the Company is electing to defer the accounting for the effects of the Act. The deferral remains in effect until the earlier of the re-measurement of plan assets and obligations subsequent to
January 31, 2004 or the issuance of guidance by the FASB. The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement cost in the financial statements and accompanying notes do not reflect the effect of the Act.

million, respectively, at September 30, 2003 and $1,480 million, $1,247 million and $77
million, respectively, at September 30, 2002.

In 2003 and
2002, the pension plan purchased annuity contracts from Prudential Insurance for $3 million and $68 million, respectively. The approximate future annual benefit payment for all annuity contracts was $22 million and $20 million in 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

The benefit obligation for pensions increased by
$17 million in 2003 for the inclusion of a new non-qualified pension plan for mid-career hires. The benefit obligation for pensions increased by $218 million in 2002 for amendments related to the distribution of value to the pension plan upon
demutualization for $200 million and $18 million related to Prudential Securities cash balance feature, which increased the amount of earnings considered pensionable.

The benefit obligation for other postretirement benefits decreased by $73 million in 2003 for changes in the substantive
plan made to medical, dental and life insurance benefits. There was a reduction in cost related to changes in the prescription drug program of $39 million and a reduction of $39 million for cost sharing shifts to certain retirees for medical and
dental benefits. There was an increase in cost of $5 million associated with providing Prudential Financial benefits to former Prudential Securities Inc. employees that transferred to Prudential Financial effective July 1, 2003. The benefit
obligation for other postretirement benefits decreased by $141 million in 2002 for changes in the substantive plan made to medical and dental benefits. The significant cost reduction relates to changes in the prescription drug program of $128
million for co-payments and $13 million for cost sharing shifts to certain retirees for medical and dental benefits. Also in 2002, the Company approved the establishment of a new category of retiree called disabled retirees. Based on this new
category, $95 million of medical and dental benefits were transferred from postemployment benefits to postretirement benefits.

The pension benefits were amended during the time periods presented for 2002 and 2001 to provide contractual termination benefits to certain plan
participants whose employment had been terminated. Costs related to these amendments are reflected in contractual termination benefits in the table below.

Employees were provided special termination benefits in conjunction with their termination of employment related to the Prudential Securities Inc. and
Prudential Property and Casualty transactions in 2003. These benefits include the cost of vesting plan participants, accruing benefits until year-end, crediting service for vesting purposes and certain early retirement subsidies.

Net periodic (benefit) cost included in “General and administrative
expenses” in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, includes the following components:

(continued)

The increase in the minimum liability included in “Accumulated other
comprehensive income” as of September 30, 2003 and September 30, 2002 is as follows:

The assumptions as of
September 30, used by the Company to calculate the benefit obligations as of that date and to determine the benefit cost in the year are as follows:

The pension and
postretirement expected long term rates of return for 2003 were determined based upon an approach that considered an expectation of the allocation of plan assets during the measurement period of 2003. Expected returns are estimated by asset class as
noted in the discussion of investment policies and strategies. The expected returns by an asset class contemplate the risk free interest rate environment as of the measurement date and then add a risk premium. The risk premium is a range of
percentages and is based upon historical information and other factors such as expected reinvestment returns and asset manager performance.

The Company applied the same approach to the determination of the expected long term rate of return in 2004. The expected long term rate of return for
2004 is 8.75% and 7.75%, respectively, for the pension and postretirement plans.

The Company, with respect to pension benefits, uses market related value to determine the components of net periodic benefit cost. Market related value is a measure of asset value that reflects the difference between
actual and expected return on assets over a 5 year period.

Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plan. A one-percentage point increase and decrease in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

Pension and postretirement plan asset allocation as of September 30, 2003
and September 30, 2002, are as follows:

The Company, for its
domestic pension and postretirement plans, has developed guidelines for asset allocations. As of the September 30, 2003 measurement date the range of target percentages are as follows:

Management reviews its
investment strategy on an annual basis.

The investment goal of
the domestic pension plan assets is to generate an above benchmark return on a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds and real estate, while meeting the cash requirements for a pension obligation that includes a traditional formula principally
representing payments to annuitants and a cash balance formula which allows lump sum payments and annuity payments. The pension plan risk management practices include guidelines for asset concentration, credit rating and liquidity. The pension plan
does not invest in leveraged derivatives. Derivatives such as futures contracts are used to reduce transaction costs and change asset concentration.

The investment goal of the domestic postretirement plan assets is to generate an above benchmark return on a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds and
municipal bonds, while meeting the cash requirements for the postretirement obligations that includes a medical benefit including prescription drugs, a dental benefit and a life benefit. The postretirement domestic equity is used to provide expected
growth in assets deposited into the plan assets. International equity is used to provide diversification to domestic equity as well as expected capital growth. Bonds provide liquidity and income. Short-term investments provide liquidity and allow
for defensive asset mixes. Municipal bonds provide liquidity and tax efficient income, where appropriate. The postretirement plans risk management practices include guidelines for asset concentration, credit rating, liquidity, and tax efficiency.
The postretirement plan does not invest in leveraged derivatives. Derivatives such as futures contracts are used to reduce transaction costs and change asset concentration.

Pension assets include Prudential Financial Inc. common stock in the amount of $103 million (1.2 percent of total plan
assets) as of September 30, 2002. There were no investments in Prudential Financial Inc. common stock as of September 30, 2003. Pension plan assets of $7,216 million and $6,385 million are included in Separate Account assets and liabilities as of
September 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

(continued)

Postretirement equity securities did not include any Prudential Financial
Inc. common stock as of September 30, 2003 or 2002.

The
expected benefit payments for the Company’s domestic pension and postretirement plans for the years indicated are as follows:

The Company
anticipates that it will make cash contributions in 2004 of $37 million to the non-qualified pension plan and $2 million to the postretirement plans. The Company does not anticipate making any contributions to the qualified pension plan in 2004.

Postemployment Benefits

The Company accrues postemployment benefits primarily for life and health
benefits provided to former or inactive employees who are not retirees. The net accumulated liability for these benefits at December 31, 2003 and 2002, was $52 million and $91 million, respectively, and is included in “Other liabilities.”

Other Employee Benefits

The Company sponsors voluntary savings plans for employees (401(k) plans).
The plans provide for salary reduction contributions by employees and matching contributions by the Company of up to 4% of annual salary. The matching contributions by the Company included in “General and administrative expenses” were $54
million, $55 million and $72 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

16.    INCOME TAXES

The components of income tax expense (benefit) for the years ended December 31, were as follows:



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

16.    INCOME TAXES

(continued)

The Company’s actual income tax expense (benefit) for the years ended
December 31, differs from the expected amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% to income from continuing operations before income taxes for the following reasons:

Deferred tax assets
and liabilities at December 31, resulted from the items listed in the following table:

Management believes
that based on its historical pattern of taxable income, the Company will produce sufficient income in the future to realize its deferred tax asset after valuation allowance. A valuation allowance has been recorded primarily related to tax benefits
associated with foreign operations and state and local deferred tax assets. Adjustments to the valuation allowance will be made if there is a change in management’s assessment of the amount of the deferred tax asset that is realizable. At
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, the Company had federal net operating and capital loss carryforwards of $170 million and $348 million, which expire between 2007 and 2018. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, the Company had state
operating and capital loss carryforwards for tax purposes approximating $5,160 million and $4,182 million, which expire between 2005 and 2023. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, the Company had foreign operating loss carryforwards for tax
purposes approximating $35 million and $341 million, $24 million of which expires between 2004 and 2012 and $11 million have an unlimited carryforward.

The Company previously had not provided U.S. income taxes on unremitted foreign earnings of its non-U.S. operations because such earnings had been
considered to be permanently reinvested in such operations. During 2003,



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

16.    INCOME TAXES

(continued)

the Company determined that earnings from companies in high tax jurisdictions will be
repatriated to the U.S. Accordingly, earnings from its Japanese insurance operations are no longer considered permanently reinvested. U.S. income tax expense associated with the assumed repatriation of such earnings in the amount of $112 million
have been recognized. The Company has undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, other than its Japanese insurance operations, of $674 million and $353 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, for which deferred taxes have not been
provided. Such earnings are considered permanently invested in the foreign subsidiaries. Determining the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were remitted is not practicable.

The Internal Revenue Service (the “Service”) has completed all examinations of the consolidated federal income tax
returns through 1996. The Service has begun its examination of 1997 through 2001. Management believes sufficient provisions have been made for potential adjustments.

17.    FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The estimated fair values presented below have been determined by using available market information and by applying
valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is applied in interpreting data to develop the estimates of fair value. Estimated fair values may not be realized in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation
methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair values. The methods and assumptions discussed below were used in calculating the estimated fair values of the instruments. See Note 18 for a discussion of derivative instruments.

Fixed Maturities

Estimated fair values for fixed maturities, other than private placement
securities, are based on quoted market prices or prices obtained from independent pricing services. Estimated fair values for private placement fixed maturities are determined primarily by using a discounted cash flow model which considers the
current market spreads between the U.S. Treasury yield curve and corporate bond yield curve, adjusted for the type of issue, its current credit quality and its remaining average life. The estimated fair value of certain non-performing private
placement fixed maturities is based on amounts estimated by management.

Commercial Loans

The estimated fair
value of commercial loans is primarily based upon the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the appropriate U.S. Treasury rate or Japanese Government Bond rate for yen based loans, adjusted for the current market spread for
similar quality loans.

Policy Loans

The estimated fair value of U.S. insurance policy loans is calculated using
a discounted cash flow model based upon current U.S. Treasury rates and historical loan repayment patterns, while Japanese insurance policy loans use the risk-free proxy based on the Yen Libor.

Mortgage Securitization Inventory

The estimated fair value of the mortgage securitization inventory is based
upon various factors, including the terms of the loans, the intended exit strategy for the loans based upon either a securitization pricing model or commitments from investors, prevailing interest rates, and credit risk.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

17.    FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

(continued)

Investment Contracts

For guaranteed investment contracts, income annuities and other similar
contracts without life contingencies, estimated fair values are derived using discounted projected cash flows based on interest rates being offered for similar contracts with maturities consistent with those of the contracts being valued. For
individual deferred annuities and other deposit liabilities, fair value approximates carrying value.

Debt and Guaranteed beneficial interest in Trust holding solely debentures of Parent

The estimated fair value of short-term and long-term debt and the guaranteed beneficial interest in Trust holding solely debentures of Parent is derived
by using discount rates based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for debt and financial instruments with similar terms and remaining maturities.

The carrying amount approximates or equals fair value for the following instruments: fixed maturities, available for sale,
equity securities, short-term investments, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and securities, separate account assets and liabilities, trading account assets, broker-dealer related receivables/payables, securities purchased under agreements
to resell, cash collateral for borrowed securities, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, cash collateral for loaned securities, and securities sold but not yet purchased. The following table discloses the Company’s financial
instruments where the carrying amounts and estimated fair values differ at December 31,

(a)

Effective December 31, 2003, the Company adopted the revised guidance under FIN No. 46. As a result, the Trust was deconsolidated, and the Prudential Financial debentures are
reported as “Long-term debt.” See Note 11 for additional information.

18.    DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

Types of Derivative Instruments

Interest rate swaps are used by the Company to manage interest rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities (including duration mismatches) and to hedge against changes in the value of assets
it anticipates acquiring and other anticipated transactions and commitments. As an example, the Company may use interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the value of mortgage loans it has originated and plans to securitize
in the future. Under interest rate swaps, the Company agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount.
Generally, no cash is exchanged at the outset of the contract and no principal payments are made by either party. Cash is paid or received based on the terms of the swap. These transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that provide
for a single net payment to be made by one counterparty at each due date.

Exchange-traded futures and options are used by the Company to reduce market risks from changes in interest rates, to alter mismatches between the duration of assets in a portfolio and the duration of liabilities
supported by those assets, and to hedge against changes in the value of securities it owns or anticipates acquiring or selling. In exchange-traded futures transactions, the Company agrees to purchase or sell a specified number of contracts, the
value of which are determined by the value of designated classes of securities, and to post variation margin on a daily basis in an

(continued)

amount equal to the difference in the daily market values of those contracts. The Company
enters into exchange-traded futures and options with regulated futures commissions merchants who are members of a trading exchange.

Treasury futures typically are used to hedge duration mismatches between assets and liabilities by replicating Treasury performance. Treasury futures move
substantially in value as interest rates change and can be used to either modify or hedge existing interest rate risk. This strategy protects against the risk that cash flow requirements may necessitate liquidation of investments at unfavorable
prices resulting from increases in interest rates. This strategy can be a more cost effective way of temporarily reducing the Company’s exposure to a market decline than selling fixed income securities and purchasing a similar portfolio when
such a decline is believed to be over.

When the Company
anticipates a significant decline in the stock market that will correspondingly affect its diversified portfolio, it may purchase put index options where the basket of securities in the index is appropriate to provide a hedge against a decrease in
the value of the Company’s equity portfolio or a portion thereof. This strategy affects an orderly sale of hedged securities. When the Company has large cash flows that it has allocated for investment in equity securities, it may purchase call
index options as a temporary hedge against an increase in the price of the securities it intends to purchase. This hedge is intended to permit such investment transactions to be executed with less adverse market impact.

Currency derivatives, including exchange-traded currency futures and options,
currency forwards and currency swaps, are used by the Company to reduce market risks from changes in currency exchange rates with respect to investments denominated in foreign currencies that the Company either holds or intends to acquire or sell.
The Company also uses currency forwards to hedge the currency risk associated with net investments in foreign operations and anticipated earnings of its foreign operations.

Under exchange-traded currency futures and options, the Company agrees to purchase or sell a specified number of contracts
and to post variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal to the difference in the daily market values of those contracts. The Company enters into exchange-traded currency futures and options with regulated futures commissions merchants who
are members of a trading exchange.

Under currency forwards,
the Company agrees with other parties to deliver a specified amount of an identified currency at a specified future date. Typically, the price is agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for such a contract is made at the specified future
date. As noted above, the Company uses currency forwards to mitigate the risk that unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates will reduce U.S. dollar equivalent earnings generated by certain of its non-U.S. businesses, primarily its Japanese
insurance operations. The Company executes forward sales of the hedged currency in exchange for U.S. dollars at a specified exchange rate. The maturities of these forwards correspond with the future periods in which the non-U.S. earnings are
expected to be generated. These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting.

Under currency swaps, the Company agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between one currency and another at a forward exchange rate and calculated by reference to an agreed
principal amount. Generally, the principal amount of each currency is exchanged at the beginning and termination of the currency swap by each party. These transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that provide for a single net
payment to be made by one counterparty for payments made in the same currency at each due date.

Credit derivatives are used by the Company to enhance the return on the Company’s investment portfolio by providing comparable exposure to fixed
income securities that might not be available in the primary market. Credit derivatives are sold for a premium and are recorded at fair value.

Forward contracts are used by the Company to manage market risks relating to interest rates. The Company also uses “to be announced” (TBA)
forward contracts to gain exposure to the investment risk and return of mortgage-backed securities. TBA transactions can help the Company to achieve better diversification and to enhance the return on its investment portfolio. TBAs provide a more
liquid and cost effective method of achieving these goals than

purchasing or selling individual mortgage-backed pools. Typically, the price is agreed upon
at the time of the contract and payment for such a contract is made at a specified future date. A portion of this activity was exited in connection with the restructuring of Prudential Securities Group Inc.’s capital markets activities.

Cash Flow, Fair Value and Net Investment Hedges

The ineffective portion of derivatives accounted for using hedge accounting
in the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was not material to the results of operations of the Company. In addition, there were no instances in which the Company discontinued cash flow hedge accounting because the forecasted transaction
did not occur on the anticipated date or within the additional time period permitted by SFAS No. 133.

Presented below is a roll forward of current period cash flow hedges in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” before taxes:

It is anticipated that
a pre-tax gain of approximately $5 million will be reclassified from “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” to earnings during the year ended December 31, 2004, offset by amounts pertaining to the hedged items. The maximum length
for which variable cash flows are hedged is 20 years. Income amounts deferred in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” as a result of cash flow hedges are included in “Net unrealized investment gains (losses)” in the
Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity.

For
effective net investment hedges, the amounts, before applicable taxes, recorded in the cumulative translation adjustments account within “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” were losses of $84 million in 2003, losses of $67
million in 2002 and gains of $77 million in 2001.

For the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, there were no derivative reclassifications to earnings due to hedged firm commitments no longer deemed probable or due to hedged forecasted transactions that had not occurred by the end of the originally
specified time period.

Credit Risk

The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of
nonperformance by counterparties to derivative financial instruments. Generally, the current credit exposure of the Company’s derivative contracts is limited to the fair value at the reporting date. The credit exposure of the Company’s
swaps transactions is represented by the fair value (market value) of contracts with a positive fair value (market value) at the reporting date. Because exchange-traded futures and options are effected through regulated exchanges, and positions are
marked to market on a daily basis, the Company has little exposure to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to such financial instruments. The credit exposure of exchange-traded instruments is represented by the
negative change, if any, in the fair value (market value) of contracts from the fair value (market value) at the reporting date. The credit exposure of currency forwards is represented by the difference, if any, between the exchange rate specified
in the contract and the exchange rate for the same currency at the reporting date.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

(continued)

The Company manages credit risk by entering into transactions with
creditworthy counterparties and obtaining collateral where appropriate and customary. In addition, the Company enters into over-the-counter swaps pursuant to master agreements that provide for a single net payment to be made by one counterparty to
another at each due date and upon termination. Likewise, the Company effects exchange-traded futures and options through regulated exchanges and these positions are marked to market on a daily basis.

19.    SEGMENT INFORMATION

Segments

The Company has organized its principal operations into the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business.
Within the Financial Services Businesses, the Company operates through three divisions, which together encompass eight reportable segments. Businesses that are not sufficiently material to warrant separate disclosure and businesses to be divested
are included in Corporate and Other operations. Collectively, the businesses that comprise the three operating divisions and Corporate and Other are referred to as the Financial Services Businesses.

The Insurance division consists of the Individual Life and Annuities and
Group Insurance segments. The Individual Life and Annuities segment manufactures and distributes individual variable life, term life, universal life, non-participating whole life insurance, and variable and fixed annuity products, primarily to the
U.S. mass affluent market and mass market. The Group Insurance segment manufactures and distributes a full range of group life, long-term and short-term group disability, long-term care and corporate-owned and trust-owned life insurance products in
the U.S. to institutional clients primarily for use in connection with employee and membership benefit plans.

The Investment division consists of the Investment Management, Financial Advisory, Retirement and Other Asset Management segments. The Investment
Management segment provides a broad array of investment management and advisory services, mutual funds and other structured products. These products and services are marketed and provided to the public and private marketplace in addition to the
Insurance division, the International Insurance and Investments division, and the Retirement segment. The Financial Advisory segment includes, effective July 1, 2003, our equity method investment in the Wachovia Securities joint venture. This
segment also includes the equity sales, trading and research operations. The Retirement segment manufactures and distributes products and provides administrative services for qualified and non-qualified retirement plans as well as offers guaranteed
investment contracts, funding agreements and group annuities. The Other Asset Management segment includes the Company’s commercial mortgage securitization operations, hedge portfolios and proprietary investment and syndication activities.

The International Insurance and Investments division consists
of the International Insurance and International Investments segments. The International Insurance segment manufactures and distributes individual life insurance products to the affluent market in Japan and other foreign markets through life
planners. In addition, as a result of the acquisition of Gibraltar Life, similar products are offered to the broad middle income market across Japan through life advisors, the proprietary distribution channel of Gibraltar Life. The International
Investments segment offers private banking, asset management, investment advice and product choice to high net worth and mass affluent retail clients and to institutional clients in selected international markets.

Corporate and Other operations include corporate-level activities and
international ventures that are not allocated to business segments as well as the real estate and relocation services operations and certain divested and wind-down businesses. The divested businesses consist primarily of the property and casualty
insurance business, Gibraltar Casualty, and Prudential Securities Capital Markets. Wind-down businesses include individual health insurance and Canadian life insurance. Corporate-level activities include corporate-level income and expenses not
allocated to any business segments, including the cost of company-wide initiatives, investment returns on capital not deployed in any segments, returns from investments not allocated to any business segments including a debt-financed investment
portfolio, transactions with other segments and consolidating adjustments. Corporate-level activities also include certain obligations, relating to policyholders whom the Company had previously agreed to provide insurance for reduced or no premium
in accordance with contractual settlements related to prior life insurance sales practices remediation.



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

(continued)

The Closed Block Business, which is managed separately from the Financial
Services Businesses, was established on the date of demutualization. It includes the Closed Block (as discussed in Note 8); assets held outside the Closed Block necessary to meet insurance regulatory capital requirements related to products included
within the Closed Block; deferred policy acquisition costs related to the Closed Block policies; the principal amount of the IHC debt (as discussed in Note 10) and related unamortized debt issuance costs and an interest rate swap related to the IHC
debt; and certain other related assets and liabilities. For the periods prior to the date of demutualization, the results of the Closed Block Business are those of the former Traditional Participating Products segment, which historically sold
primarily participating insurance and annuity products that the Company ceased offering in connection with demutualization. Upon the establishment of the Closed Block Business, $5.6 billion of net assets previously associated with the former
Traditional Participating Products segment was transferred to the Financial Services Businesses. Consequently, the results of the Financial Services Businesses for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the period December 18, 2001 through
December 31, 2001 include returns on these assets.

The
accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” Results for each segment include earnings on attributed equity established at a level which management considers
necessary to support the segment’s risks. Operating expenses specifically identifiable to a particular segment are allocated to that segment as incurred. Operating expenses not identifiable to a specific segment that are incurred in connection
with the generation of segment revenues are generally allocated based upon the segment’s historical percentage of general and administrative expenses.

Adjusted Operating Income

In managing the Financial Services Businesses, the Company analyzes the operating performance of each segment using “adjusted operating income,”
which is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted operating income is calculated by adjusting income from continuing operations before income taxes to exclude certain items. The items excluded are realized investment gains, net of losses, and related charges
and adjustments (as discussed further below); life insurance sales practices remedies and costs; the contribution to income/loss of divested businesses that have been or will be sold or exited that did not qualify for “discontinued
operations” accounting treatment under GAAP; and demutualization costs and expenses.

The excluded items are important to an understanding of overall results of operations. Adjusted operating income is not a substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP, and the Company’s definition
of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies. However, the Company believes that the presentation of adjusted operating income as measured for management purposes enhances the understanding of results of operations by
highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability factors of the Financial Services Businesses.

Adjusted operating income excludes net realized investment gains and losses. A significant element of realized losses is impairments and losses from sales
of credit-impaired securities, the timing of which depends largely on market credit cycles and can vary considerably across periods. The timing of other sales that would result in gains or losses is largely subject to the Company’s discretion
and influenced by market opportunities. Trends in the underlying profitability of the Company’s businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of these transactions. Adjusted operating income excludes life insurance
sales practices remedies and costs relating to the settlement of individual life insurance sales practices issues for the period from 1982 through 1995 because they relate to a substantial and identifiable non-recurring event. Adjusted operating
income excludes the results of divested businesses, which are not indicative of the Company’s future operating results. Adjusted operating income also excludes demutualization costs and expenses as they are directly related to demutualization
and could distort the trends associated with ongoing business operations.

The related charges, which offset against net realized investment gains and losses, relate to policyholder dividends, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, and reserves for future policy benefits. The
related charges associated with policyholder dividends include a percentage of net realized investment gains on specified Gibraltar



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

19.    SEGMENT INFORMATION

(continued)

Life assets that is required to be paid as dividends to Gibraltar Life policyholders.
Deferred policy acquisition costs for certain investment-type products are amortized based on estimated gross profits, which include net realized investment gains and losses on the underlying invested assets, and the related charge for amortization
of deferred policy acquisition costs represents the portion of this amortization associated with net realized investment gains and losses. The reserves for certain policies are adjusted when cash flows related to these policies are affected by net
realized investment gains and losses, and the related charge for reserves for future policy benefits represents that adjustment.

Gains and losses pertaining to derivatives contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, other than derivatives used for trading purposes,
are included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” This includes mark-to-market adjustments of open contracts as well as periodic settlements. As discussed further below, adjusted operating income includes a portion of realized
gains and losses pertaining to certain derivative contracts.

Adjusted operating income of the International Insurance segment reflects the impact of an intercompany arrangement with Corporate and Other operations pursuant to which the segment’s results for a particular year, including its
interim reporting periods, are translated at fixed currency exchange rates. The fixed rates are determined in connection with a currency hedging program designed to mitigate the risk that unfavorable rate changes will reduce the segment’s U.S.
dollar equivalent earnings. Pursuant to this program, the Company executes forward sale contracts in the hedged currency in exchange for U.S. dollars at a specified exchange rate. The maturities of these contracts correspond with the future periods
in which the non-U.S. earnings are expected to be generated. These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under GAAP and, as noted above, all resulting profits or losses from such contracts are included in “Realized investment gains
(losses), net.” When the contracts are terminated in the same period that the expected earnings emerge, the resulting positive or negative cash flow effect is included in adjusted operating income (losses of $51 million, and revenues of $42
million and $34 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively). As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the fair value of open contracts used for this purpose was a net liability of $152 million and $52 million, respectively.

The Company utilizes interest and currency swaps to manage
interest and currency exchange rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities, including duration mismatches. For the swap contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, mark-to-market adjustments of open
contracts as well as periodic settlements are included in “Realized investment gains (losses), net.” However, the periodic settlements are included in adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income includes $51 million and $52
million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, of periodic settlements of such contracts. Amounts in 2001 were insignificant.

The Other Asset Management segment uses hedging instruments to mitigate the risk that operating results will fluctuate due to changes in the estimated
fair value of mortgages held for sale, commitments to lend and loan applications received. Changes in the estimated fair value of such instruments are included on a current basis in “Commissions and other income.” Commencing in the fourth
quarter of 2002, the Company applied hedge accounting treatment to new mortgage loan inventory. Consequently, changes in the fair value of such inventory are included on a current basis in “Commissions and other income” of the Other Asset
Management segment, consistent with the related hedges. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2002, the mortgage loan inventory was recorded at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. However, for segment reporting, changes in the estimated fair value
of the mortgage loans (losses of $5 million, $2 million and $21 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively) were included in adjusted operating income of the Other Asset Management segment with an offsetting
adjustment to adjusted operating income of Corporate and Other operations.

The Investment Management segment revenues include intersegment revenues of
$352 million, $395 million and $390 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, primarily consisting of asset-based management and administration fees. In addition, the Financial Advisory segment revenues include
intersegment revenues of $85 million, $194 million and $193 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, relating to the sale of proprietary investments products. Management has determined the intersegment revenues
with reference to market rates. Intersegment revenues are eliminated in consolidation.

20.    COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES, CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION

Commitments and Guarantees

The following table presents, as of December 31, 2003, the Company’s future commitments on long-term debt, as more fully described in Note 10, and future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating
leases:

The Company occupies
leased office space in many locations under various long-term leases and has entered into numerous leases covering the long-term use of computers and other equipment. Rental expense incurred for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was
$308 million, $449 million and $520 million, respectively.

In
connection with the Company’s commercial mortgage banking business, it originates commercial mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had outstanding commercial mortgage loan commitments with borrowers of $1,282 million. In certain
of these transactions, the Company prearranges that it will sell the loan to an investor after the Company funds the loan. As of December 31, 2003, $559 million of the Company’s commitments to originate commercial mortgage loans are subject to
such arrangements.

In connection with the Company’s
discontinued consumer banking business, it has commitments under home equity lines of credit and other lines of credit to lend up to specified limits to customers. It is anticipated that



PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

20.    COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES, CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION

(continued)

commitment amounts will only be partially
drawn down based on overall customer usage patterns and, therefore, do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each credit decision on such commitments at least annually and has the ability to cancel or suspend such
lines at its option. The total commitments for home equity lines of credit and other lines of credit were $1,859 million, of which $818 million remains available at December 31, 2003.

The Company also has other commitments, which primarily include commitments to fund investments. These commitments amounted
to $2,964 million at December 31, 2003.

In connection with
certain acquisitions, the Company has agreed to pay additional consideration in future periods, based upon the attainment by the acquired entity of defined operating objectives. In accordance with GAAP, the Company does not accrue contingent
consideration obligations prior to the attainment of the objectives. At December 31, 2003, maximum potential future consideration pursuant to such arrangements, to be resolved over the following six years, is $269 million. Any such payments would
result in increases in intangible assets, including goodwill.

Certain contracts underwritten by the Company’s guaranteed products business include guarantees of principal related to financial assets owned by the guaranteed party. These contracts are accounted for as derivatives, at fair value, in
accordance with SFAS No. 133. At December 31, 2003, such contracts in force carried a total guaranteed value of $1,567 million.

A number of guarantees provided by the Company relate to real estate investments, in which the unconsolidated investor has borrowed funds, and the Company
has guaranteed their obligation to their lender. In some cases, the investor is an affiliate, and in other cases the unaffiliated investor purchases the real estate investment from the Company. The Company provides these guarantees to assist them in
obtaining financing for the transaction on more beneficial terms. The Company’s maximum potential exposure under these guarantees was $880 million at December 31, 2003. Any payments that may become required of the Company under these guarantees
would either first be reduced by proceeds received by the creditor on a sale of the assets, or would provide the Company with rights to obtain the assets. At December 31, 2003, no amounts were accrued as a result of the Company’s assessment
that it is unlikely payments will be required.

The Company is
subject to other financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements, including those related to businesses that have been sold. Some of these guarantees may extend far into the future, and are subject to caps aggregating to $36 million. In other
limited cases, the amount that can be claimed from the Company or the time in which these claims may be presented to the Company are not limited. At December 31, 2003, the Company has accrued liabilities of $11 million associated with all other
financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements, which does not include liabilities retained associated with sold businesses.

Contingencies

As discussed in Note 3, in the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company sold its property and casualty insurance companies that operate nationally in 48 states
outside of New Jersey, and the District of Columbia, to Liberty Mutual. In connection with that sale, the Company reinsured Liberty Mutual for certain losses including: any further adverse loss development on the stop-loss reinsurance agreement with
Everest Re Group, Ltd. (“Everest”) discussed in the next paragraph; any adverse loss development on losses occurring prior to the sale that arise from insurance contracts generated through certain “discontinued” distribution
channels or due to certain loss events including mold damage or the October 2003 California wild fires; stop-loss protection on losses occurring after the sale and arising from those same distribution channels of up to $95 million, in excess of
related premiums and other adjustments; and stop-loss protection on losses occurring prior to the sale and arising from most other business, up to 75% of the first $30 million of adverse loss development recorded through October 31, 2005. The
reinsurance covering the losses associated with the discontinued distribution channels will be settled based upon loss experience through December 31, 2008, with a provision that profits on the insurance business from these channels will be shared,
with Liberty Mutual receiving up to $20 million of the first $50 million. As of December 31, 2003, the Company has recorded a liability of $119 million representing its estimate of its obligations under these reinsurance contracts.

(continued)

On September 19, 2000,
the Company sold Gibraltar Casualty Company (“Gibraltar Casualty”), a commercial property and casualty insurer, to Everest. Upon closing of the sale, a subsidiary of the Company entered into a stop-loss reinsurance agreement with Everest
whereby the subsidiary reinsured Everest for up to 80% of the first $200 million of any adverse loss development in excess of Gibraltar Casualty’s carried reserves as of the closing of the sale to Everest. This subsidiary was subsequently sold
to Liberty Mutual, as part of the sale discussed in the preceding paragraph. The $106 million of reserves at the closing date of the sale to Liberty Mutual related to the reinsurance agreement with Everest remained the direct obligation of this
subsidiary. As a result, those reserves are no longer included on the Company’s balance sheet. The Company has reinsured Liberty Mutual with regard to any further adverse loss development on the stop-loss reinsurance agreement with Everest and
has recorded a liability for the remaining $54 million of this obligation as of December 31, 2003, which is included as part of its obligations under reinsurance contracts to Liberty Mutual disclosed in the preceding paragraph.

On an ongoing basis, the Company’s internal supervisory and control
functions review the quality of sales, marketing and other customer interface procedures and practices and may recommend modifications or enhancements. In certain cases, if appropriate, the Company may offer customers remediation and may incur
charges, including the cost of such remediation, administrative costs and regulatory fines.

It is possible that the results of operations or the cash flow of the Company in a particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected as a result of payments in connection with the matters discussed
above depending, in part, upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period. Management believes, however, that ultimate payments in connection with these matters, after consideration of applicable reserves, should not have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s financial position.

Litigation

The Company is subject to legal and regulatory
actions in the ordinary course of its businesses. Pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings relating to aspects of our businesses and operations that are specific to the Company and proceedings that are typical of the businesses in
which the Company operates, including in both cases businesses that have either been divested or placed in wind-down status. Some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants. In certain of these
matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages.

The Company has received formal requests for information from regulators and governmental authorities relating to the purchase and sale of mutual fund
shares and, in some cases, variable annuities. The regulators and authorities include, among others, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the NYSE, the NASD, the New Jersey Bureau of Securities, the State of New York Attorney General’s
Office, the United States Attorney, District of Massachusetts (“USAM”) and the Securities Division of Massachusetts (the “MSD”). The Company is cooperating with all such inquiries.

The MSD filed an administrative complaint against three former brokers and
two former managers of a branch office in Boston, MA (the “Boston Branch”) of the retail brokerage business formerly owned by Prudential Securities, Inc. (“PSI”), alleging violations of state securities laws. The Securities and
Exchange Commission has filed a similar civil action against five former brokers and one former manager of the Boston Branch in Massachusetts federal court. The Company is not a party to these actions. In addition, the Company has received subpoenas
from the USAM for documents pertaining to the purchase and sale of mutual fund shares and certain former brokers and their supervisors.

The MSD also filed an administrative complaint against PSI alleging that PSI knew or should have known about alleged deceptive market timing and late
trading in mutual funds in the Boston Branch, failed reasonably to supervise the conduct of the brokers in the Boston Branch and failed to implement controls designed to prevent and detect violations of Massachusetts securities law.

These matters could lead to proceedings that result in disgorgement, fines or
other sanctions. The Company is unable to estimate its ultimate exposure at this time.

20.    COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES, CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION

(continued)

The Company retained all
liabilities for the litigation associated with its discontinued healthcare business that existed at the date of closing with Aetna (August 6, 1999), or commenced within two years of that date, with respect to claims relating to events that occurred
prior to the closing date. This litigation includes purported class actions and individual suits involving various issues, including payment of claims, denial of benefits, vicarious liability for malpractice claims, and contract disputes with
provider groups and former policyholders. Some of the purported class actions challenge practices of the Company’s former managed care operations and assert nationwide classes. In October 2000, by Order of the Judicial Panel on Multi-district
Litigation, class actions brought by policyholders and physicians were consolidated for pre-trial purposes, along with lawsuits pending against other managed health care companies, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Florida in a consolidated proceeding captioned

In Re Managed Care Litigation

. The policyholder actions have been resolved. The class actions brought by the physicians allege, among other things, breach of contract, violations of ERISA,
violations of and conspiracy to violate RICO and industry-wide conspiracy to defraud physicians by failing to pay under provider agreements and by unlawfully coercing providers to enter into agreements with unfair and unreasonable terms. The
remedies sought include unspecified damages, restitution, disgorgement of profits, treble damages, punitive damages and injunctive relief. In September 2002, the court granted plaintiffs’ motion for certification of a nationwide class of
physicians. The Company and the other managed care defendants have appealed the certification to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. That appeal is pending.

A joint venture in which an affiliate of PSI is a participant brought an arbitration claim against Kyocera Corporation
(“Kyocera”) in 1986 alleging, among other things, claims of breach of contract relating to the manufacture and distribution of computer disk drives. The arbitration panel decided in favor of the claimants. In December 2003, Kyocera paid
$332 million to certain subsidiaries of the Company in settlement of the arbitration award rendered against Kyocera.

In 1999, a class action lawsuit,

Burns, et al. v. Prudential Securities Inc., et al

., was filed in the Marion County, Ohio Court of Common Pleas
against Jeffrey Pickett (a former PSI financial advisor) and PSI alleging that Pickett transferred, without authorization, his clients’ equity mutual funds into fixed income mutual funds in October 1998. The claims were based on theories of
conversion, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and negligent supervision. Compensatory and punitive damages in unspecified amounts were sought by plaintiffs. In October 2002, the case was tried and the jury returned a verdict against PSI
and Pickett for $11.7 million in compensatory damages and against PSI for $250 million in punitive damages. In July 2003, the court denied PSI’s motion to set aside or reduce the jury verdict, and sustained the judgment in the amount of $269
million including interest and attorneys fees. PSI has appealed.

In November 2003, an action was commenced in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York,

Enron Corp. v. J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc., et al

., against approximately 100 defendants, including the Company,
who invested in Enron’s commercial paper. The complaint alleges that Enron’s October 2001 prepayment of its commercial paper is a voidable preference under the bankruptcy laws and constitutes a fraudulent conveyance. The complaint alleges
that the Company received prepayments of approximately $100 million. All defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint.

The Company’s litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and given its complexity and scope, its outcome cannot be predicted. It is possible that
the results of operations or the cash flow of the Company in a particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of pending litigation and regulatory matters depending, in part, upon the results
of operations or cash flow for such period. Management believes, however, that the ultimate outcome of all pending litigation and regulatory matters, after consideration of applicable reserves, should not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial position.

The unaudited quarterly results of operations for the years ended December
31, 2003 and 2002 are summarized in the table below:

(a)

Quarterly earnings per share amounts may not add to the full year amounts due to the averaging of shares.

As discussed in Note 3, on July 1, 2003, the Company completed the combination of its retail securities brokerage and
clearing operations, with that of Wachovia, forming a joint venture in which the Company has a 38% ownership interest. The Company accounts for its ownership interest under the equity method of accounting; periods prior to July 1, 2003, continue to
reflect the results of the Company’s previously wholly-owned securities brokerage operations on a fully consolidated basis. Results for the fourth quarter of 2003 include the gain from the receipt by the Company of a $332 million settlement of
an arbitration award, as discussed in Note 20. Results for the second quarter of 2003 include a $455 million loss related to the disposition of the Company’s property and casualty insurance operations, as discussed in Note 3. Results for the
third quarter of 2002 include a $183 million benefit from the favorable resolution of a tax issue pertaining to the 1995 disposition of a subsidiary.

Notes to Supplemental Combining Financial Information

1.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The supplemental combining financial information presents the consolidated financial position and results of operations for Prudential Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) separately reporting the Financial
Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. The Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business are both fully integrated operations of the Company and are not separate legal entities. The supplemental combining financial
information presents the results of the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business as if they were separate reporting entities and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company has outstanding two classes of common stock. The Common Stock
reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Class B Stock reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business.

The Closed Block Business was established on the date of demutualization and includes the assets and liabilities of the Closed Block (see Note 8 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Closed Block). It also includes assets held outside the Closed Block necessary to meet insurance regulatory capital requirements related to products included within the Closed Block;
deferred policy acquisition costs related to the Closed Block policies; the principal amount of the IHC debt (as discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and related unamortized debt issuance costs and an interest rate swap
related to the IHC debt; and certain other related assets and liabilities. The Financial Services Businesses consist of the Insurance, Investment, and International Insurance and Investments divisions and Corporate and Other operations.

2.    ALLOCATION OF RESULTS

This supplemental combining financial information reflects the assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses directly attributable to the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, as well as allocations deemed reasonable by management in order to fairly present the financial position and results of
operations of each business on a stand alone basis. While management considers the allocations utilized to be reasonable, management has the discretion to make operational and financial decisions that may affect the allocation methods and resulting
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of each business. In addition, management has limited discretion over accounting policies and the appropriate allocation of earnings between the two businesses. The Company has agreements which provide
that, in most instances, the Company may not change the allocation methodology or accounting policies for the allocation of earnings between the Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business without the prior consent of the Class B Stock
investors or IHC debt bond insurer.

General corporate overhead
not directly attributable to a specific business that has been incurred in connection with the generation of the businesses’ revenues is generally allocated based on the historical general and administrative expenses of each business as a
percentage of the total for the Company.

Income taxes are
allocated between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business as if they were separate companies based on the taxable income or losses and other tax characterizations of each business. If a business generates benefits, such as
net operating losses, it is entitled to record such tax benefits to the extent they are expected to be utilized on a consolidated basis.

Holders of Common Stock have no interest in a legal entity representing the Financial Services Businesses; holders of the Class B Stock have no interest
in a legal entity representing the Closed Block Business and holders of each class of common stock are subject to all of the risks associated with an investment in the Company.

In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, holders of Common Stock and holders of Class B
Stock would be entitled to receive a proportionate share of the net assets of the Company that remain after paying all liabilities and the liquidation preferences of any preferred stock.

The results of the Financial Services Businesses are subject to certain risks pertaining to the Closed Block. These include
any expenses and liabilities from litigation affecting the Closed Block policies as well as the consequences of certain potential adverse tax determinations. In connection with the sale of the Class B Stock and IHC debt, the cost of indemnifying the
investors with respect to certain matters will be borne by the Financial Services Businesses.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

In order to ensure that the information we must disclose in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported on a timely basis, the Company’s management,

such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2003, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us (and our
consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in our periodic SEC filings. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2003, that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Regulation 14A within 120 days after December 31, 2003 (the “Proxy Statement”). Additional information called for by this item is contained in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K

The information called for by this item is hereby incorporated herein by reference to the sections entitled “Compensation of Directors,” “Committees of the Board of Directors,” “Compensation
of Executive Officers,” “Summary Compensation Table,” “Retirement Plans,” “Prudential Severance and Senior Executive Severance Plan; Change of Control Program,” “Long-Term Compensation Table” and
“Option Grant Table” in the Proxy Statement. Additional information called for by this Item is contained under Item 12 below of this Annual Report on form 10-K.



ITEM 12.    SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT

The following table provides information as of December 31, 2003, regarding securities issued to all of our employees under our equity compensation plans
that were in effect during fiscal 2003. All outstanding awards relate to our Common Stock. For additional information about our equity compensation plans see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form
10-K.

(1)

The equity compensation plan referred to is the 2002 Prudential Financial Stock Purchase Program for Eligible Employees of Prudential Securities Incorporated Participating in
Various Prudential Securities Incorporated Programs, which was adopted by the Prudential Securities Board of Directors in April 2002. (the “2002 MasterShare Conversion Program”) and for which 12,775,000 shares of restricted Common Stock
were registered on Form S-8 by the Company in May 2002. The 2002 MasterShare Conversion Program provided participants in various compensation programs sponsored by Prudential Securities the opportunity to exchange restricted property held under such
programs for shares of Prudential Financial restricted Common Stock. Upon the consummation of the Prudential Securities/Wachovia transaction, the 2002 MasterShare Conversion Program was suspended, and the majority of the unissued shares were
deregistered under a Post-Effective Amendment to Form S-8 effective March 28, 2003. Prudential Securities also registered in 2003 additional shares of Common Stock for a new program to be effective in 2003. However, as a result of the transaction,
no share exchanges were permitted, and the entire amount of shares registered under the 2003 program (6,000,000 shares) was also deregistered through a Post-Effective Amendment to Form S-8 on March 28, 2003.

(2)

All shares of Common Stock subject to awards under the Prudential Financial, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Omnibus Plan”) may be issued in the form of stock options,
restricted stock and units, and performance shares (as well as stock appreciation rights, long-term incentive payments and other awards provided for under the Plan). The Omnibus Plan does not, by its terms, allocate any number of shares to a
particular type of award.

(3)

100,000 shares of Common Stock were registered in connection with The Prudential Deferred Compensation Plan for Non Employee Directors (the “Director’s Deferred
Compensation Plan”) on Form S-8 on January 6, 2003. Participants in the Director’s Deferred Compensation Plan may receive shares of Common Stock as distributions from the Plan upon their retirement, upon termination of service with the
Board of Directors for reasons other than death or under certain other circumstances while serving as a member of the Board. The actual number of shares of Common Stock necessary to satisfy such distributions in the future may exceed 100,000 shares
(given the fluctuation of the value of the balances for participants in the Plan and the ability of participants to allocate deferral amounts to “Deferred Stock Units” under the Plan). In 2003, 12,419 shares of Common Stock were
distributed to former participants of the Director’s Deferred Compensation Plan upon their retirement from the Board of Directors, leaving a balance of 87,581 shares of Common Stock currently available for such distributions under the terms of
the outstanding registration. In the event that additional shares are required, the Company will register such shares on Form S-8 in the future.

The other information called for by this item is hereby incorporated herein by reference to the sections entitled “Voting Securities and Principal
Holders Thereof” in the Proxy Statement.
