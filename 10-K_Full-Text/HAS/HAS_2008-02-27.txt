Except as expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise
    requires, as used herein, “Hasbro”, the
    “Company”, “we”, or “us”, means
    Hasbro, Inc., a Rhode Island corporation organized on
    January 8, 1926, and its subsidiaries. Unless otherwise
    specifically indicated, all dollar or share amounts herein are
    expressed in thousands of dollars or shares, except for per

Overview

We are a worldwide leader in children’s and family leisure
    time and entertainment products and services, including the
    design, manufacture and marketing of games and toys.
    Internationally and in the United States, our widely recognized
    core brands such as PLAYSKOOL, TRANSFORMERS, MY LITTLE PONY,
    LITTLEST PET SHOP, TONKA, SUPER SOAKER, MILTON BRADLEY, PARKER
    BROTHERS, TIGER and WIZARDS OF THE COAST provide what we believe
    are the highest quality play experiences in the world. Our
    offerings encompass a broad variety of games, including
    traditional board, card, hand-held electronic, trading card,
    roleplaying, plug and play and DVD games, as well as electronic
    learning aids and puzzles. Toy offerings include boys’
    action figures, vehicles and playsets, girls’ toys,
    electronic toys, plush products, preschool toys and infant
    products, children’s consumer electronics, electronic
    interactive products, creative play and toy related specialty
    products. In addition, we license certain of our trademarks,
    characters and other property rights to third parties for use in
    connection with digital games, consumer promotions, and for the
    sale of non-competing toys and games and non-toy products.

Organizationally, our principal segments are North America and
    International. Both of these segments engage in the development,
    marketing and selling of various toy and game products as listed
    above. Our North American segment covers the United States,
    Canada and Mexico while the International segment primarily
    includes Europe, the Asia Pacific region and Latin and South
    America (excluding Mexico). Financial information with respect
    to our segments and geographic areas is included in note 15
    to our financial statements, which are included in Item 8
    of this

Form 10-K.

In addition, our Global Operations segment is responsible for
    arranging product manufacturing and sourcing for the North
    American and International segments and our other segment
    out-licenses our intellectual property to third parties on a
    worldwide basis.

North
    America

The North American segment’s strategy in 2007 continued to
    be based on growing core brands through innovation and
    reinvention, introducing new initiatives driven by consumer and
    marketplace insights and leveraging opportunistic toy and game
    lines and licenses. Major 2007 brands and products included
    TRANSFORMERS, LITTLEST PET SHOP, MARVEL products, PLAYSKOOL,
    STAR WARS, NERF, MONOPOLY, FURREAL FRIENDS, MAGIC: THE
    GATHERING, PLAY-DOH, BABY ALIVE and MY LITTLE PONY. In the North
    American segment, our products are organized into the following
    categories: (i) games and puzzles; (ii) boys’
    toys; (iii) girls’ toys; (iv) preschool toys;
    (v) tween toys; and (vi) other.

Our games and puzzles category includes several well known
    brands, including MILTON BRADLEY, PARKER BROTHERS, TIGER GAMES,
    AVALON HILL and WIZARDS OF THE COAST. The MILTON BRADLEY, PARKER
    BROTHERS, TIGER GAMES and AVALON HILL brand portfolios consist
    of a broad assortment of games for children, tweens, families
    and adults. Core game brands include MONOPOLY, BATTLESHIP, GAME
    OF LIFE, SCRABBLE, CHUTES AND LADDERS, CANDY LAND, TROUBLE,
    MOUSETRAP, OPERATION, HUNGRY HUNGRY HIPPOS, CONNECT FOUR,
    TWISTER, YAHTZEE, JENGA, SIMON, CLUE, SORRY!, RISK, BOGGLE and
    TRIVIAL PURSUIT, as well as a line of jigsaw puzzles for
    children and adults, including BIG BEN and CROXLEY, as well as
    the PUZZ-3D line. WIZARDS OF THE COAST offers a variety of
    trading card and roleplaying games, including MAGIC: THE



GATHERING and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. We seek to keep our
    core brands relevant through sustained marketing programs as
    well as by offering consumers new ways to experience them. In
    2008, we will seek to continue to expand our core brand
    portfolio by introducing a PLAYSKOOL line of games that will
    leverage our existing preschool consumer insights. In addition,
    we will seek to continue to incorporate technology into our
    existing game brands to align with current consumer interests.
    In 2007, the Company introduced the MONOPOLY ELECTRONIC BANKING
    edition, which allowed for faster, more intense game play. In
    2008, the Company plans to introduce a customizable version of
    TRIVIAL PURSUIT. In January of 2008, the Company acquired
    Cranium, Inc., which develops and markets a wide range of
    CRANIUM branded games and related products.

Our boys’ toys include a wide range of core brands such as
    G.I. JOE and TRANSFORMERS action figures and accessories as well
    as entertainment-based licensed products based on popular movie
    and television characters, such as STAR WARS and MARVEL toys and
    accessories. In the action figure area, a key part of our
    strategy focuses on the importance of reinforcing the storyline
    associated with these products through the use of media-based
    entertainment. In 2007, sales in our boys’ toys category
    benefited from major motion picture releases of SPIDER-MAN 3 in
    May of 2007 and TRANSFORMERS in July of 2007. In 2008,
    SPIDER-MAN and TRANSFORMERS products are expected to be
    supported by animated television series. The STAR WARS product
    line is expected to be supported in 2008 by the release of
    animated television programming as well as the release of an
    animated motion picture. In addition, we will be introducing
    products based on the expected major motion picture releases of
    IRONMAN and HULK, two properties available under our MARVEL
    license, and INDIANA JONES. In addition to marketing and
    developing action figures for traditional play, the Company also
    develops and markets products designed for collectors, which has
    been a key component of the success of the STAR WARS brand.

In our girls’ toys category, we seek to provide a
    traditional and wholesome play experience. Girls’ toys
    include LITTLEST PET SHOP, MY LITTLE PONY, FURREAL FRIENDS and
    BABY ALIVE brands. In 2008, we will seek to continue to grow and
    update the LITTLEST PET SHOP brand by introducing the VIRTUAL
    INTERACTIVE PET segment which includes a plush doll that will
    allow the consumer access to a website to digitally customize
    their pets as well as access to games and other features. We
    also plan to reintroduce a redesigned EASY-BAKE oven.

Our preschool toys category encompasses a range of products for
    infants and preschoolers in the various stages of development.
    Our preschool products include a portfolio of core brands
    marketed primarily under the PLAYSKOOL trademark. The PLAYSKOOL
    line includes such well-known products as MR. POTATO HEAD,
    WEEBLES, SIT ’N SPIN and GLOWORM, along with a successful
    line of infant toys including STEP START WALK N’ RIDE,
    2-IN-1 TUMMY TIME GYM and BUSY BALL POPPER. Through our
    AGES & STAGES system, we seek to provide consumer
    friendly information that assists parents in understanding the
    developmental milestones their children will encounter as well
    as the role each PLAYSKOOL product can play in helping children
    to achieve these developmental milestones. In addition, our
    preschool category also includes the TONKA line of trucks and
    interactive toys and the PLAY-DOH brand.

Our tweens toys category generally markets products under the
    TIGER ELECTRONICS and NERF brands and seeks to target those
    children who have outgrown traditional toys. The age group
    targeted by this category is generally 8 to 12 years old.
    In recent years, we have used our consumer insights and
    electronic innovation to develop a strong line of products
    focusing on this target audience. Our major tweens toys product
    lines in 2007 included NERF, I-DOG and the POWER TOUR GUITAR. As
    demonstrated through our I-DOG product, an interactive pet that
    acts as an accessory to an MP3 player, we seek to draw on the
    popularity of electronic trends in our tween product offerings.

International

In addition to our business in the United States, Mexico and
    Canada, in 2007 we operated in more than 20 other countries,
    selling a representative range of the toy and game products
    marketed in the North American segment as discussed above,
    together with some items that are sold only internationally. The
    major geographic regions included in the International segment
    are Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin and South America. In



addition to growing core brands and leveraging opportunistic toy
    lines and licenses, we seek to grow our international business
    by continuing to expand into Eastern Europe and emerging markets
    in Asia and Latin and South America. Key international brands
    for 2007 included TRANSFORMERS, LITTLEST PET SHOP, MONOPOLY,
    MARVEL, MY LITTLE PONY, and PLAYSKOOL.

Other
    Segments

In our Global Operations segment, we manufacture and source
    production of substantially all of our toy and game products.
    The Company owns and operates manufacturing facilities in East
    Longmeadow, Massachusetts and Waterford, Ireland. Sourcing of
    our other production is done through unrelated manufacturers in
    various Far East countries, principally China, using a Hong Kong
    based wholly-owned subsidiary operation for quality control and
    order coordination purposes. See “Manufacturing and
    Importing” below for more details concerning overseas
    manufacturing and sourcing.

Through our other segment we generate revenue through the
    out-licensing worldwide of certain of our intellectual
    properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising
    uses in businesses which do not compete directly with our own
    product offerings. During 2007, our Hasbro Products Group
    out-licensed our brands primarily in apparel, publishing, home
    goods and electronics, and certain brands in the digital area.
    One of the primary goals of our licensing segment is to further
    expand our brands into the digital world through strategic
    licenses. As an example, in 2007 the Company entered into a
    long-term strategic licensing alliance with Electronic Arts Inc.
    (“EA”), which provides EA with the exclusive worldwide
    rights to create digital games for all platforms, including
    mobile phones, personal computers, and game consoles such as
    XBOX, PLAYSTATION and WII, based on most of our toy and game
    intellectual properties. The first games generated under this
    strategic alliance are expected to be introduced in 2008.

Other
    Information

To further extend our range of products in the various segments
    of our business, we sell our toy and game products directly to
    retailers, primarily on a direct import basis from the Far East.
    These sales are reflected in the revenue of the related segment
    where the customer resides.

Certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale
    in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct
    business presence.

During the 2007 fiscal year, revenues generated from the sale of
    TRANSFORMERS products were approximately $482,000, which was
    12.6% of our consolidated net revenues in 2007. During the 2005
    fiscal year, revenues generated from the sale of STAR WARS
    products produced under our license with Lucas Licensing and
    Lucasfilm were approximately $494,000, which was 16% of our
    consolidated net revenues in 2005. No other line of products
    constituted 10% or more of our consolidated net revenues in 2007
    or 2005. No individual line of products accounted for 10% or
    more of our consolidated net revenues during our 2006 fiscal
    year.

Working
    Capital Requirements

Our working capital needs are primarily financed through cash
    generated from operations and, when necessary, proceeds from our
    accounts receivable securitization program and short-term
    borrowings. Our borrowings and the use of our accounts
    receivable program generally reach peak levels during the fourth
    quarter of each year. This corresponds to the time of year when
    our receivables also generally reach peak levels as part of the
    production and shipment of product in preparation for the
    holiday shipping season. The strategy of retailers has been to
    make a higher percentage of their purchases of toy and game
    products within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer
    buying season, which includes Christmas. We expect that
    retailers will continue to follow this strategy. Our historical
    revenue pattern is one in which the second half of the year is
    more significant to our overall business than the first half
    and, within the second half of the year, the fourth quarter is
    more predominant. In 2007, the second half of the year accounted
    for approximately 66% of full year revenues with the third and
    fourth quarters accounting for 32% and 34% of full year
    revenues, respectively. In years where the Company has products
    tied to a major motion picture release, such as in 2007



with the mid-year releases of SPIDER-MAN 3 and TRANSFORMERS and
    in 2005 with the mid-year release of STAR WARS III: REVENGE OF
    THE SITH, this concentration is not as pronounced due to the
    higher level of sales that occur around and just prior to the
    time of the motion picture theatrical release.

The toy and game business is also characterized by customer
    order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of
    differences each year in the degree of consumer acceptance of
    product lines, product availability, marketing strategies and
    inventory policies of retailers, the dates of theatrical
    releases of major motion pictures for which we have product
    licenses, and changes in overall economic conditions. As a
    result, comparisons of our unshipped orders on any date with
    those at the same date in a prior year are not necessarily
    indicative of our sales for that year. Moreover, quick response
    inventory management practices result in fewer orders being
    placed significantly in advance of shipment and more orders
    being placed for immediate delivery. Retailers are timing their
    orders so that they are being filled by suppliers, such as us,
    closer to the time of purchase by consumers. Unshipped orders at
    January 27, 2008 and January 28, 2007 were
    approximately $149,000 and $192,000, respectively. It is a
    general industry practice that orders are subject to amendment
    or cancellation by customers prior to shipment. The backlog of
    unshipped orders at any date in a given year can also be
    affected by programs that we may employ to incent customers to
    place orders and accept shipments early in the year. These
    programs follow general industry practices. The programs that we
    plan to employ to promote sales in 2008 are substantially the
    same as those we employed in 2007.

Historically, we commit to the majority of our inventory
    production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a
    given year prior to the peak third and fourth quarter retail
    selling season. Our accounts receivable increase during the
    third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases
    to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season. Due to
    the concentrated timeframe of this selling period, payments for
    these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in
    the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the
    subsequent year. The timing difference between expenses paid and
    revenues collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow
    varying amounts during the year. During 2007, we utilized cash
    from our operations, proceeds from our accounts receivable
    securitization program, and borrowings under our secured amended
    and restated revolving credit agreement as well as our
    uncommitted lines of credit to meet our cash flow requirements.
    In addition to the above sources of cash, in September 2007, we
    issued $350,000 of notes that are due in 2017 (the
    “Notes”). The proceeds from the Notes were primarily
    used to repay our short-term borrowings while the remainder of
    the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.

Royalties,
    Research and Development

Our success is dependent on innovation through the continuing
    development of new products and the redesign of existing
    products for continued market acceptance. In 2007, 2006, and
    2005, we spent $167,194, $171,358, and $150,586, respectively,
    on activities relating to the development, design and
    engineering of new products and their packaging (including
    products brought to us by independent designers) and on the
    improvement or modification of ongoing products. Much of this
    work is performed by our internal staff of designers, artists,
    model makers and engineers.

In addition to the design and development work performed by our
    own staff, we deal with a number of independent toy and game
    designers for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy
    and game manufacturers. Rights to such designs and ideas, when
    acquired by us, are usually exclusive and the agreements require
    us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item.
    These designer royalty agreements, in some cases, also provide
    for advance royalties and minimum guarantees.

We also produce a number of toys and games under trademarks and
    copyrights utilizing the names or likenesses of characters from
    movies, television shows and other entertainment media, for
    whose rights we compete with other toy and game manufacturers.
    Licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty
    on our net sales of the item. Licenses for the use of characters
    are generally exclusive for specific products or product lines
    in specified territories. In many instances, advance royalties
    and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements.
    In 2007, 2006, and 2005, we incurred $316,807, $169,731, and
    $247,283, respectively, of royalty expense. A portion of this
    expense relates to amounts paid in prior years as royalty
    advances. Our royalty expenses in any given year vary depending
    upon the timing of movie releases



and other entertainment. Royalty expense in 2007 and 2005 was
    more significant in those years due to the release of SPIDER-MAN
    3 and TRANSFORMERS in 2007 and STAR WARS EPISODE III: REVENGE OF
    THE SITH in 2005 and the corresponding increases in sales of the
    related products in those years.

Marketing
    and Sales

Our products are sold nationally and internationally to a broad
    spectrum of customers, including wholesalers, distributors,
    chain stores, discount stores, mail order houses, catalog
    stores, department stores and other traditional retailers, large
    and small, as well as internet-based

“e-tailers.”

Our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our
    products. Remaining sales are generated by independent
    distributors who sell our products, for the most part, in areas
    of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct
    presence. While we have thousands of customers, including over
    2,000 in the United States during 2007, there has been
    significant consolidation at the retail level over the last
    several years in our industry, which we expect to continue. As a
    result, the majority of our sales are to large chain stores,
    distributors and wholesalers. While the consolidation of
    customers provides us with certain benefits, such as potentially
    more efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of
    sales and distribution, this consolidation also creates
    additional risks to our business associated with a major
    customer having financial difficulties or reducing its business
    with us. In addition, customer concentration may decrease the
    prices we are able to obtain for some of our products and reduce
    the number of products we would otherwise be able to bring to
    market. During 2007, sales to our three largest customers,
    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Target Corporation and Toys “R”
    Us, Inc., represented 24%, 12% and 11%, respectively, of
    consolidated net revenues, and sales to our top five customers,
    including

Wal-Mart,

Target and Toys “R” Us, Inc., accounted for
    approximately 52% of our consolidated net revenues. In the North
    American segment, approximately 70% of the net revenues of the
    segment were derived from our top three customers.

We advertise many of our toy and game products extensively on
    television. Generally our advertising highlights selected items
    in our various product groups in a manner designed to promote
    the sale of not only the selected item, but also other items we
    offer in those product groups as well. We introduce many of our
    new products to major customers during the year prior to the
    year of introduction of such products for retail sale. In
    addition, we showcase many of our new products in New York City
    at the time of the American International Toy Fair in February,
    as well as at other international toy shows.

In 2007 we spent $434,742 on advertising, promotion and
    marketing programs compared to $368,996 in 2006 and $366,371 in
    2005.

Manufacturing
    and Importing

During 2007 substantially all of our products were manufactured
    in third party facilities in the Far East, primarily China, as
    well as in our two owned facilities located in East Longmeadow,
    Massachusetts and Waterford, Ireland.

Most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials
    such as plastic, paper and cardboard, although certain products
    also make use of electronic components. All of these materials
    are readily available but may be subject to significant
    fluctuations in price. We generally enter into agreements with
    suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish
    prices for that year. For this reason, we are generally
    insulated, in the short-term, from increases in the prices of
    raw materials. However, severe increases in the prices of any of
    these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers
    during the year. Our manufacturing processes and those of our
    vendors include injection molding, blow molding, spray painting,
    printing, box making and assembly. We purchase most of the
    components and accessories used in our toys and certain of the
    components used in our games, as well as some finished items,
    from manufacturers in the United States and in other countries.
    However, the countries of the Far East, and particularly the
    People’s Republic of China, constitute the largest
    manufacturing center of toys in the world and the substantial
    majority of our toy products are manufactured in China. The 1996
    implementation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
    reduced or eliminated customs duties on many of the products
    imported by us.



We believe that the manufacturing capacity of our third party
    manufacturers, together with our own facilities, as well as the
    supply of components, accessories and completed products which
    we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers, are adequate to
    meet the anticipated demand in 2008 for our products. Our
    reliance on designated external sources of manufacturing could
    be shifted, over a period of time, to alternative sources of
    supply for our products, should such changes be necessary or
    desirable. However, if we were to be prevented from obtaining
    products from a substantial number of our current Far East
    suppliers due to political, labor or other factors beyond our
    control, our operations and our ability to obtain products would
    be disrupted while alternative sources of product were secured.
    The imposition of trade sanctions by the United States or the
    European Union against a class of products imported by us from,
    or the loss of “normal trade relations” status by, the
    People’s Republic of China could significantly disrupt our
    operations and increase the cost of our products imported into
    the United States or Europe.

We purchase dies and molds from independent United States and
    international sources.

Competition

We are a worldwide leader in the design, manufacture and
    marketing of games and toys, but our business is highly
    competitive. We compete with several large toy and game
    companies in our product categories, as well as many smaller
    United States and international toy and game designers,
    manufacturers and marketers. Competition is based primarily on
    meeting consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality
    and play value of our products. To a lesser extent, competition
    is also based on product pricing.

In addition to contending with competition from other toy and
    game companies, in our business we must deal with the phenomena
    that many children have been moving away from traditional toys
    and games at a younger age. We refer to this as “children
    getting older younger.” As a result, our products not only
    compete with the offerings of other toy and game manufacturers,
    but we must compete, particularly in meeting the demands of
    older children, with the entertainment offerings of many other
    companies, such as makers of video games and consumer electronic
    products.

The volatility in consumer preferences with respect to family
    entertainment and low barriers to entry continually create new
    opportunities for existing competitors and

start-ups

to
    develop products which compete with our toy and game offerings.

Employees

At December 30, 2007, we employed approximately
    5,900 persons worldwide, approximately 3,300 of whom were
    located in the United States.

Trademarks,
    Copyrights and Patents

We seek to protect our products, for the most part, and in as
    many countries as practical, through registered trademarks,
    copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is
    available, cost effective, and meaningful. The loss of such
    rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result
    in significant harm to our business, although the loss of such
    protection for a number of significant items might have such an
    effect.

Government
    Regulation

Our toy and game products sold in the United States are subject
    to the provisions of The Consumer Product Safety Act (the
    “CPSA”), The Federal Hazardous Substances Act (the
    “FHSA”), The Flammable Fabrics Act (the
    “FFA”), and the regulations promulgated thereunder. In
    addition, certain of our products, such as the mixes for our
    EASY-BAKE ovens, are also subject to regulation by the Food and
    Drug Administration.

The CPSA empowers the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the
    “CPSC”) to take action against hazards presented by
    consumer products, including the formulation and implementation
    of regulations and uniform safety standards. The CPSC has the
    authority to seek to declare a product “a banned hazardous
    substance” under the CPSA and to ban it from commerce. The
    CPSC can file an action to seize and condemn



an “imminently hazardous consumer product” under the
    CPSA and may also order equitable remedies such as recall,
    replacement, repair or refund for the product. The FHSA provides
    for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that are
    banned.

Consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and
    cities within the United States and in Canada, Australia and
    Europe. We utilize laboratories that employ testing and other
    procedures intended to maintain compliance with the CPSA, the
    FHSA, the FFA, international standards, and our own standards.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that
    our products are or will be hazard free. Any material product
    recall could have an adverse effect on our results of operations
    or financial condition, depending on the product and scope of
    the recall, and could negatively affect sales of our other
    products as well.

The Children’s Television Act of 1990 and the rules
    promulgated thereunder by the United States Federal
    Communications Commission, as well as the laws of certain
    foreign countries, place limitations on television commercials
    during children’s programming.

We maintain programs to comply with various United States
    federal, state, local and international requirements relating to
    the environment, plant safety and other matters.

The
    volatility of consumer preferences, combined with the high level
    of competition and low barriers to entry in the family
    entertainment industry make it difficult to maintain the success
    of existing products and product lines or consistently introduce
    successful new products. In addition, an inability to develop
    and introduce planned new products and product lines in a timely
    and cost-effective manner may damage our business.

The family entertainment business is a fashion industry. Our
    success is critically dependent upon the consumer appeal of our
    products, principally games and toys. Our failure to
    successfully anticipate, identify and react to children’s
    interests and the current preferences in family entertainment
    could significantly lower sales of our products and harm our
    sales and profitability.

A decline in the popularity of our existing products and product
    lines, or the failure of our new products and product lines to
    achieve and sustain market acceptance with retailers and
    consumers, could significantly lower our sales and operating
    margins, which would in turn harm our profitability, business
    and financial condition. In our industry, it is important to
    identify and offer what are considered to be the “hot”
    toys and games on children’s “wish lists”. Our
    continued success will depend on our ability to develop, market
    and sell popular toys, games and children’s electronic
    products which are sought after by both children and their
    parents. We seek to achieve and maintain market popularity for
    our products through the redesign and extension of our existing
    family entertainment properties in ways we believe will capture
    evolving consumer interest and imagination and remain relevant
    in today’s world, and by developing, introducing and
    gaining customer interest for new family entertainment products.
    This process involves anticipating and extending successful play
    patterns and identifying entertainment concepts and properties
    that appeal to children’s imaginations. However, consumer
    preferences with respect to family entertainment are
    continuously changing and are difficult to anticipate. Evolving
    consumer tastes, coupled with an ever changing pipeline of
    entertainment properties and products which compete for consumer
    interest and acceptance, creates an environment in which
    products can be extremely popular during a certain period in
    time but then rapidly be replaced in consumer’s minds with
    other properties. As a result, individual family entertainment
    products and properties generally, and high technology products
    in particular, often have short consumer life cycles.

Not only must we address rapidly changing consumer tastes and
    interests but we face competitors who are also constantly
    monitoring consumer tastes, seeking ideas which will appeal to
    consumers and introducing new products that compete with our
    products for consumer purchasing. In addition to existing
    competitors, the barriers to entry for new participants in the
    family entertainment industry are low. New participants with a
    popular product idea or property can gain access to consumers
    and become a significant source of competition for our products.
    In some cases our competitors’ products may achieve greater
    market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce
    demand for our products.

The challenge of developing and offering products that are
    sought after by children is compounded by the trend of children
    “getting older younger”. By this we mean that children
    are losing interest in traditional toys and games at younger
    ages and, as a result, at younger and younger ages, our products
    compete with the offerings of video game suppliers, consumer
    electronics companies and other businesses outside of the
    traditional toy and game industry.

In addition to designing and developing products based on our
    own brands, we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and
    interests by producing products based on popular entertainment
    properties developed by other parties and licensed to us. The
    success of entertainment properties released theatrically for
    which we have a license, such as MARVEL or STAR WARS related
    products, can significantly affect our revenues and
    profitability. If we produce a line of products based on a movie
    or television series, the success of the movie or series has a
    critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the
    associated products we are offering. In addition, competition in
    our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen
    our ability to secure, maintain, and renew popular licenses to
    entertainment products on beneficial terms, if at all, and to
    attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design,
    develop and market successful products based on these
    properties. The loss of rights granted pursuant to any of our
    licensing agreements could harm our business and competitive
    position.



There is no guarantee that:

•

Any of our current products or product lines will continue to be
    popular;

•

Any property for which we have a significant license will
    achieve or sustain popularity;

•

Any new products or product lines we introduce will be
    considered interesting to consumers and achieve an adequate
    market acceptance;

•

Any new product’s life cycle will be sufficient to permit
    us to profitably recover development, manufacturing, marketing,
    royalties (including royalty advances and guarantees) and other
    costs of producing and selling the product; or

•

We will be able to manufacture, source and ship new or
    continuing products in a timely and cost-effective basis to meet
    constantly changing consumer demands, a risk that is heightened
    by our customers’ compressed shipping schedules and the
    seasonality of our business.

In developing new products and product lines, we have
    anticipated dates for the associated product introductions. When
    we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a
    particular product or product line at a certain time in the
    future those expectations are based on completing the associated
    development and implementation work in accordance with our
    currently anticipated development schedule. Unforeseen delays or
    difficulties in the development process, or significant
    increases in the planned cost of development, may cause the
    introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or,
    in some situations, may cause a product introduction to be
    discontinued. Similarly, the success of our products is often
    dependent on the timelines and effectiveness of related
    advertising and media efforts. Television programming, movie and
    DVD releases, comic book releases, and other media efforts are
    often critical in generating interest in our products. Not only
    our efforts, but the efforts of third parties, heavily impact
    the launch dates and success of these media efforts. When we say
    that products or brands will be supported by certain media
    releases, those statements are based on our current plans and
    expectations. Unforeseen factors may delay these media releases
    or even lead to their cancellation. Any delay or cancellation of
    planned product development work, introductions, or media
    support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our
    business.

Our
    business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results
    will depend, in large part, on our sales during the relatively
    brief holiday shopping season. This seasonality is exacerbated
    as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory
    levels through quick response inventory management
    techniques.

Sales of our family entertainment products at retail are
    extremely seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring
    during the period from September through December in
    anticipation of the holiday season, including Christmas. This
    seasonality has increased over time, as retailers become more
    efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick
    response inventory management techniques. These customers are
    timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers,
    such as us, closer to the time of purchase by consumers. For
    toys, games and other family entertainment products which we
    produce, a majority of retail sales for the entire year occur in
    the fourth quarter, close to the holiday season. As a
    consequence, the majority of our sales to our customers occur in
    the period from September through December, as our customers do
    not want to maintain large on-hand inventories throughout the
    year ahead of consumer demand. While these techniques reduce a
    retailer’s investment in inventory, they increase pressure
    on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a
    significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the
    supplier.

The limited inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or
    delay retail sales, resulting in lower revenues for us. If we or
    our customers determine that one of our products is more popular
    at retail than was originally anticipated, we may not have
    sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional product to
    fully capture consumer interest in the product. Additionally,
    the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter
    time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve
    tight and compressed shipping schedules, which also may reduce
    our sales and harm our financial performance. This seasonal
    pattern requires significant use of working capital, mainly to
    manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year
    prior to the holiday season, and requires accurate forecasting
    of demand for products during the holiday season



in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or
    producing excess inventory of products that are less popular
    with consumers. Our failure to accurately predict and respond to
    consumer demand, resulting in our underproducing popular items

and/or

overproducing less popular items, would reduce our total sales
    and harm our results of operations. In addition, as a result of
    the seasonal nature of our business, we would be significantly
    and adversely affected, in a manner disproportionate to the
    impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the
    year, by unforeseen events, such as a terrorist attack or
    economic shock, that harm the retail environment or consumer
    buying patterns during our key selling season, or by events,
    such as strikes or port delays, that interfere with the shipment
    of goods, particularly from the Far East, during the critical
    months leading up to the holiday purchasing season.

The
    consolidation of our retail customer base means that economic
    difficulties or changes in the purchasing policies of our major
    customers could have a significant impact on us.

We depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell
    the majority of our products. For the fiscal year ended
    December 30, 2007, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Target
    Corporation, and Toys “R” Us, Inc., accounted for
    approximately 24%, 12% and 11%, respectively, of our
    consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers,
    including Wal-Mart, Target and Toys “R” Us, in the
    aggregate accounted for approximately 52% of our consolidated
    net revenues. In the North American segment, approximately 70%
    of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top
    three customers. While the consolidation of our customer base
    may provide certain benefits to us, such as potentially more
    efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of
    sales and distribution, this consolidation also means that if
    one or more of our major customers were to experience
    difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us, cease doing
    business with us, significantly reduce the amount of their
    purchases from us or return substantial amounts of our products,
    it could harm our sales, profitability and financial condition.
    Increased concentration among our customers could also
    negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices
    for our products and could result in lower gross margins than
    would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation
    among our customers. In addition, the bankruptcy or other lack
    of success of one or more of our significant retail customers
    could negatively impact our revenues and bad debt expense.

We may
    not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed
    material has less market appeal than expected or if sales
    revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out
    the minimum guaranteed royalties.

An important part of our business involves obtaining licenses to
    produce products based on various entertainment properties and
    theatrical releases, such as those based upon MARVEL or STAR
    WARS characters. The license agreements we enter to obtain these
    rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that
    may be substantial, and in some cases may be greater than what
    we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales, which could
    result in write-offs of significant amounts which in turn would
    harm our results of operations. At December 30, 2007, we
    had $137,959 of prepaid royalties, $94,616 of which are included
    in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $43,343 of
    which are included in other assets. Under the terms of existing
    contracts as of December 30, 2007, we may be required to
    pay future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees
    totaling approximately $87,815. Acquiring or renewing licenses
    may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we
    consider to be too high to be profitable, which may result in
    losing licenses we currently hold when they become available for
    renewal, or missing business opportunities for new licenses.
    Additionally, as a licensee of entertainment based properties we
    have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will
    translate into successful toy or game products.

We anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie
    releases will make it increasingly difficult for us to
    profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment
    properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for
    these products in order to minimize their inventory risk.
    Furthermore, there can be no assurance that a successful brand
    will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales
    in the future, as new entertainment properties and competitive
    products are continually being introduced to the market. In the
    event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful
    entertainment licenses on advantageous terms, our revenues and
    profits may be harmed.



Our
    use of third-party manufacturers to produce the majority of our
    toy products, as well as certain other products, presents risks
    to our business.

We own and operate two game and puzzle manufacturing facilities,
    one in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts and the other in
    Waterford, Ireland. However, most of our toy products, in
    addition to certain other products, are manufactured by
    third-party manufacturers, most of whom are located in the
    People’s Republic of China. Although our external sources
    of manufacturing can be shifted, over a period of time, to
    alternative sources of supply, should such changes be necessary,
    if we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or
    components for a material portion of our product line due to
    political, labor or other factors beyond our control, our
    operations would be disrupted, potentially for a significant
    period of time, while alternative sources of supply were
    secured. This delay could significantly reduce our sales and
    profitability, and harm our business.

Given that the majority of our manufacturing is conducted by
    third-party manufacturers located in the People’s Republic
    of China, health conditions and other factors affecting social
    and economic activity in China and affecting the movement of
    people and products into and from China to our major markets,
    including North America and Europe, as well as increases in the
    costs of labor and other costs of doing business in China, could
    have a significant negative impact on our operations, revenues
    and earnings. Factors that could negatively affect our business
    include a potential significant revaluation of the Chinese yuan,
    which may result in an increase in the cost of producing
    products in China, increases in labor costs and difficulties in
    moving products manufactured in the Far East out of the Far East
    and through the ports on the western coast of
    North America, whether due to port congestion, labor
    disputes, product regulations and/or inspections or other
    factors. Also, the imposition of trade sanctions or other
    regulations by the United States or the European Union against
    products imported by us from, or the loss of “normal trade
    relations” status with, the People’s Republic of
    China, could significantly increase our cost of products
    imported into the United States or Europe and harm our business.
    Additionally, the suspension of the operations of a third party
    manufacturer by government inspectors in China could result in
    delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales.

We require our third-party manufacturers to comply with our
    Global Business Ethics Principles, which are designed to prevent
    products manufactured by or for us from being produced under
    inhumane or exploitive conditions. The Global Business Ethics
    Principles address a number of issues, including working hours
    and compensation, health and safety, and abuse and
    discrimination. In addition, Hasbro requires that our products
    supplied by third-party manufacturers be produced in compliance
    with all applicable laws and regulations, including consumer and
    product safety laws in the markets where those products are
    sold. Hasbro has the right, both directly and through the use of
    outside monitors, to monitor compliance by our third-party
    manufacturers with our Global Business Ethics Principles and
    other manufacturing requirements. In addition, we do quality
    assurance testing on our products, including products
    manufactured for us by third parties. Notwithstanding these
    requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with
    them, there is always a risk that one or more of our third-party
    manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we
    will not immediately discover such non-compliance. Any failure
    of our third-party manufacturers to comply with labor, consumer,
    product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing
    products for us could result in damage to our reputation, harm
    sales of our products and potentially create liability for us.

Our
    substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the
    United States subject us to risks associated with international
    operations.

We operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries
    outside the United States. For the year ended December 30,
    2007, our net revenues from international customers comprised
    approximately 42% of our total consolidated net revenues. We
    expect our sales to international customers to continue to
    account for a significant portion of our revenues. Additionally,
    as we discussed above, we utilize third-party manufacturers
    located principally in the Far East, to produce the majority of
    our products, and we have a manufacturing facility in Ireland.
    These sales and manufacturing operations are subject to the
    risks associated with international operations, including:

•

Currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations;

•

Limitations, including taxes, on the repatriation of earnings;



•

Political instability, civil unrest and economic instability;

•

Greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and
    weaker laws protecting such rights;

•

Complications in complying with different laws in varying
    jurisdictions, which laws may dictate that certain practices
    which are acceptable in some jurisdictions are not acceptable in
    others, and changes in governmental policies;

•

Natural disasters and the greater difficulty and expense in
    recovering therefrom;

•

Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country
    to another, including port congestion, strikes and other
    transportation delays and interruptions;

•

Changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing
    business internationally; and

•

The imposition of tariffs.

Because of the importance of our international sales and
    international sourcing of manufacturing to our business, our
    financial condition and results of operations could be
    significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to
    occur.

Market
    conditions, including commodity and fuel prices, public health
    conditions and other third party conduct could negatively impact
    our revenues, margins and our other business
    initiatives.

Economic and public health conditions, including factors that
    impact the strength of the retail market and retail demand, or
    our ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely and
    cost-effective manner, can have a significant impact on our
    business. The success of our family entertainment products is
    dependent on consumer purchasing of those products. Consumers
    may not purchase our products because the products do not
    capture consumer interest and imagination or because competitor
    family entertainment offerings are deemed more attractive. But
    consumer spending on our products can also be harmed by factors
    that negatively impact consumers’ budgets generally, and
    which are not due to our product offerings.

Significant increases in the costs of other products which are
    required by consumers, such as gasoline and home heating fuels,
    may reduce household spending on discretionary entertainment
    products we offer. In addition, weakened economic conditions,
    lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major
    markets may significantly reduce purchases of our products.
    Economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist
    attacks, wars and other conflicts, increases in critical
    commodity prices, or the prospect of such events. Such a
    weakened economic and business climate, as well as consumer
    uncertainty created by such a climate, could harm our sales and
    profitability.

Our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand
    for our products, but also on our ability to produce and sell
    those products at costs which allow for profitable sales. Rising
    fuel and raw material prices, for components such as resin used
    in plastics, increased transportation costs, and increased labor
    costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all
    may increase our costs for producing and transporting our
    products, which in turn may reduce our margins, reduce our
    profitability and harm our business.

Other conditions, such as the unavailability of electrical
    components, may impede our ability to manufacture, source and
    ship new and continuing products on a timely basis. Additional
    factors outside of our control could delay or increase the cost
    of implementing our business initiatives and product plans or
    alter our actions and reduce actual results. For example, work
    stoppages, slowdowns or strikes, a severe public health pandemic
    or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts, could
    impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product, resulting
    in increased costs

and/or

lost
    sales for our products.



Part
    of our strategy for remaining relevant to older children is to
    offer innovative children’s toy and game electronic
    products. The margins on many of these products are lower than
    more traditional toys and games and such products may have a
    shorter lifespan than more traditional toys and games. As a
    result, increasing sales of children’s toy and game
    electronic products may lower our overall operating margins and
    produce more volatility in our business.

As children have grown “older younger” and have become
    interested in more and more sophisticated and adult products,
    such as videogames and consumer electronics, at younger and
    younger ages, we have needed to work even harder to keep our
    products relevant for these consumers. One initiative we have
    been pursuing to capture the interest of older children is to
    offer innovative children’s electronic toys and games.
    Examples of such products in the last few years include
    VIDEONOW, CHATNOW, ZOOMBOX, our I-branded products such as I-DOG
    and I-CAT, and our FURREAL FRIENDS line of products, including
    BUTTERSCOTCH. These products, if successful, can be an effective
    way for us to connect with consumers and increase sales.
    However, children’s electronics, in addition to the risks
    associated with our other family entertainment products, also
    face certain additional risks.

Our costs for designing, developing and producing electronic
    products tend to be higher than for many of our other more
    traditional products, such as board games and action figures.
    The ability to recoup these higher costs through sufficient
    sales quantities and to reflect higher costs in higher prices is
    constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics. As a
    consequence, our margins on the sales of electronic products
    tend to be lower than for more traditional products and we can
    face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover
    our costs. In addition, the pace of change in product offerings
    and consumer tastes in the electronics area is potentially even
    greater than for our other products. This pace of change means
    that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain
    consumer interest may be even shorter.

As a
    manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational
    corporation, we are subject to various government regulations
    and may be subject to additional regulations in the future,
    violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise
    harm our business. In addition, we could be the subject of
    future product liability suits or product recalls, which could
    harm our business.

As a manufacturer of consumer products, we are subject to
    significant government regulations, including, in the United
    States, under The Consumer Products Safety Act, The Federal
    Hazardous Substances Act, and The Flammable Fabrics Act, as well
    as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our
    international markets. In addition, certain of our products are
    subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration or
    similar international authorities. While we take all the steps
    we believe are necessary to comply with these acts, there can be
    no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future.
    Failure to comply could result in sanctions which could have a
    negative impact on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations. We may also be subject to involuntary product
    recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall. While costs
    associated with product recalls have generally not been material
    to our business, the costs associated with future product
    recalls individually and in the aggregate in any given fiscal
    year, could be significant. In addition, any product recall,
    regardless of direct costs of the recall, may harm consumer
    perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our
    future sales and results of operations.

Governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we
    manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations
    relating to product safety and consumer protection in the
    future, and may also increase the penalties for failure to
    comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations.
    In addition, one or more of our customers might require changes
    in our products, such as the non-use of certain materials, in
    the future. Complying with any such additional regulations or
    requirements could impose increased costs on our business.
    Similarly, increased penalties for non-compliance could subject
    us to greater expense in the event any of our products were
    found to not comply with such regulations. Such increased costs
    or penalties could harm our business.

In addition to government regulation, products that have been or
    may be developed by us may expose us to potential liability from
    personal injury or property damage claims by the users of such
    products. There can



be no assurance that a claim will not be brought against us in
    the future. Any successful claim could significantly harm our
    business, financial condition and results of operations.

As a large, multinational corporation, we are subject to a host
    of governmental regulations throughout the world, including
    antitrust, customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott
    regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Our failure
    to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could
    subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that
    could harm our business and financial condition.

Our
    business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may
    not be able to protect such rights successfully. In addition, we
    have a material amount of acquired product rights which, if
    impaired, would result in a reduction of our
    income.

Our intellectual property, including our license agreements and
    other agreements that establish our ownership rights and
    maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property, are
    of great value. We rely on a combination of trade secret,
    copyright, trademark, patent and other proprietary rights laws
    to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related
    to our brands. From time to time, third parties have challenged,
    and may in the future try to challenge, our ownership of our
    intellectual property. In addition, our business is subject to
    the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or
    infringing on our intellectual property rights. We may need to
    resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property
    rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of
    resources. Our failure to protect our intellectual property
    rights could harm our business and competitive position. Much of
    our intellectual property has been internally developed and has
    no carrying value on our balance sheet. As of December 30,
    2007, we had approximately $486,232 of acquired product and
    licensing rights included in other assets on our balance sheet.
    Declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed
    products may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of
    the related assets and could result in an impairment charge.
    Reduction in our net income caused by impairment charges could
    harm our financial results.

We may
    not realize the anticipated benefits of future acquisitions or
    those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their
    realization.

Although we have not made any major acquisitions in the last few
    years, acquisitions have been a significant part of our
    historical growth and have enabled us to further broaden and
    diversify our product offerings. In making acquisitions, we
    target companies that we believe offer attractive family
    entertainment products. However, we cannot be certain that the
    products of companies we may acquire in the future will achieve
    or maintain popularity with consumers. In some cases, we expect
    that the integration of the product lines of the companies that
    we acquire into our operations will create production, marketing
    and other operating synergies which will produce greater revenue
    growth and profitability and, where applicable, cost savings,
    operating efficiencies and other advantages. However, we cannot
    be certain that these synergies, efficiencies and cost savings
    will be realized. Even if achieved, these benefits may be
    delayed or reduced in their realization. In other cases, we
    acquire companies that we believe have strong and creative
    management, in which case we plan to operate them more
    autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our
    operations. We cannot be certain that the key talented
    individuals at these companies will continue to work for us
    after the acquisition or that they will continue to develop
    popular and profitable products or services.

From
    time to time, we are involved in litigation, arbitration or
    regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which
    could entail significant expense.

As is the case with many large multinational corporations, we
    are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations,
    litigation and arbitration disputes. Because the outcome of
    litigation, arbitration and regulatory investigations is
    inherently difficult to predict, it is possible that the outcome
    of any of these matters could entail significant expense for us
    and harm our business. The fact that we operate in significant
    numbers of international markets also increases the risk that we
    may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply
    with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements.



We
    rely on external financing, including our credit facilities and
    accounts receivable securitization facility, to help fund our
    operations. If we were unable to obtain or service such
    financing, or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were
    too burdensome, our business would be harmed.

Due to the seasonal nature of our business, in order to meet our
    working capital needs, particularly those in the third and
    fourth quarters, we rely on our revolving credit facility and
    our other credit facilities for working capital. We currently
    have a five-year revolving credit agreement, which provides for
    a $300,000 committed revolving credit facility which provides
    the Company the ability to request increases in the committed
    facility in additional increments of $50,000, up to a total of
    $500,000. The credit agreement contains certain restrictive
    covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and
    certain other limitations typical of an investment grade
    facility. These restrictive covenants may limit our future
    actions, and financial, operating and strategic flexibility. In
    addition, our financial covenants were set at the time we
    entered into our credit facility. Our performance and financial
    condition may not meet our original expectations, causing us to
    fail to meet such financial covenants. Non-compliance with our
    debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize
    borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank
    lines, a circumstance which potentially could occur when
    operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings
    to enable us to continue to fund our operations.

As an additional source of working capital and liquidity, we
    currently have a $250,000 accounts receivable securitization
    program, which is increased to $300,000 for the period from
    fiscal October through fiscal January. Under this program, we
    sell on an ongoing basis, substantially all of our domestic
    U.S. dollar denominated trade accounts receivable to a
    bankruptcy remote special purpose entity. Under this facility,
    the special purpose entity is able to sell, on a revolving
    basis, undivided ownership interests in the eligible receivables
    to bank conduits. During the term of the facility, we must
    maintain certain performance ratios. If we fail to maintain
    these ratios, we could be prevented from accessing this
    cost-effective source of working capital and short-term
    financing.

We believe that our cash flow from operations, together with our
    cash on hand and access to existing credit facilities and our
    accounts receivable securitization facility, are adequate for
    current and planned needs in 2008. However, our actual
    experience may differ from these expectations. Factors that may
    lead to a difference include, but are not limited to, the
    matters discussed herein, as well as future events that might
    have the effect of reducing our available cash balance, such as
    unexpected material operating losses or increased capital or
    other expenditures, as well as increases in inventory or
    accounts receivable that are ineligible for sale under our
    securitization facility, or future events that may reduce or
    eliminate the availability of external financial resources.

We also may choose to finance our capital needs, from time to
    time, through the issuance of debt securities. Our ability to
    issue such securities on satisfactory terms, if at all, will
    depend on the state of our business and financial condition, any
    ratings issued by major credit rating agencies, market interest
    rates, and the overall condition of the financial and credit
    markets at the time of the offering. The condition of the credit
    markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the
    past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Variations in
    these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt
    securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order
    to sell new debt securities. The failure to receive financing on
    desirable terms, or at all, could damage our ability to support
    our future operations or capital needs or engage in other
    business activities.

As of December 30, 2007, we had $844,815 of total principal
    amount of indebtedness outstanding, of which $135,092 is due in
    July 2008. If we are unable to generate sufficient available
    cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to
    refinance such debt or face default. There is no guarantee that
    we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms, or at
    all. This total indebtedness includes $249,828 in aggregate
    principal amount of 2.75% senior convertible debentures
    that we issued in 2001. On December 1, 2011 and
    December 1, 2016, and upon the occurrence of certain
    fundamental corporate changes, holders of the 2.75% senior
    convertible debentures may require us to purchase their
    debentures. At that time, the purchase price may be paid in
    cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the two, at our
    discretion, provided



that we will pay accrued and unpaid interest in cash. We may not
    have sufficient cash at that time to make the required
    repurchases and may be required to settle in shares of common
    stock.

We
    have a material amount of goodwill which, if it becomes
    impaired, would result in a reduction in our net
    income.

Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition
    accounted for using the purchase method exceeds the fair value
    of the net assets we acquire. Current accounting standards
    require that goodwill no longer be amortized but instead be
    periodically evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of
    the reporting unit. At December 30, 2007, approximately
    $471,177 or 14.6%, of our total assets represented goodwill.
    Declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our
    reporting units, which could result in a write-down of our
    goodwill. Reductions in our net income caused by the write-down
    of goodwill could harm our results of operations.

Executive
    Summary

The Company earns revenue and generates cash through the sale of
    a variety of toy and game products, as well as through the
    out-licensing of its properties for use in connection with
    non-competing products offered by third parties. The Company
    sells its products both within the United States and in a number
    of international markets. The Company’s business is highly
    seasonal with a significant amount of revenues occurring in the
    second half of the year and within that half, the fourth
    quarter. In 2007, 66% of the Company’s net revenues were
    generated in the second half of the year with 34% of annual net
    revenues generated in the fourth quarter. In 2006 and 2005,
    percentages were 68% and 67% for the second half, respectively,
    and comparable at 35% for the fourth quarter. While many of the
    Company’s products are based on brands the Company owns or
    controls, the Company also offers products which are licensed
    from outside inventors. In addition, the Company licenses rights
    to produce products based on movie, television, music and other
    entertainment properties, such as MARVEL and STAR WARS
    properties.

The Company’s business is primarily separated into two
    business segments, North America and International. The North
    American segment develops, markets and sells both toy and game
    products in the U.S., Mexico and Canada. The International
    segment consists of the Company’s European, Asia Pacific
    and Latin America marketing operations. In addition to these two
    primary segments, the Company’s world-wide manufacturing
    and product sourcing operations are managed through its Global
    Operations segment. The Hasbro Products Group is responsible for
    the worldwide out-licensing of the Company’s intellectual
    properties and works closely with the North American and
    International segments on the development and out-licensing of
    the Company’s brands.

The Company’s focus remains on growing core owned and
    controlled brands, developing new and innovative products which
    respond to market insights and optimizing efficiencies within
    the Company to reduce costs, increase operating profits and
    strengthen its balance sheet. While the Company believes it has
    achieved a more sustainable revenue base by developing and
    maintaining its core brands and avoiding reliance on licensed
    entertainment properties, it continues to opportunistically
    enter into or leverage existing strategic licenses which
    complement its brands and key strengths. In 2007, the Company
    had significant sales of products related to the Company’s
    license with Marvel Entertainment, Inc. and Marvel Characters,
    Inc. (collectively “Marvel”), primarily due to the
    theatrical release of SPIDERMAN-3 in May of 2007. Given the
    strength of its core brands, the Company may also seek to drive
    product-related revenues by increasing the visibility of its
    core brands through entertainment-based theatrical venues. As an
    example of this, in July of 2007, the TRANSFORMERS motion
    picture was released and the Company developed and marketed
    products based on the motion picture. As a result of pairing
    this core brand with this type of entertainment, both the movie
    and the product line benefited. Net revenues during 2007 related
    to the TRANSFORMERS line of products totaled approximately
    $482,000, or 12.6% of consolidated net revenues.

The Company’s core brands represent Company-owned or
    Company–controlled brands, such as TRANSFORMERS, MY LITTLE
    PONY, MONOPOLY, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, PLAYSKOOL, G.I. JOE and
    TONKA, which have been successful over the long term. The
    Company has a large portfolio of owned and controlled brands,
    which can be introduced in new formats and platforms over time.
    These brands may also be further extended by pairing a licensed
    concept with a core brand. By focusing on core brands, the
    Company is working to build a more consistent revenue stream and
    basis for future growth. In 2007 the Company had strong sales of
    core brand products, namely TRANSFORMERS, LITTLEST PET SHOP, MY
    LITTLE PONY, PLAYSKOOL, MONOPOLY, NERF, and PLAY-DOH.



In addition to its focus on core brands, the Company’s
    strategy also involves trying to meet ever-changing consumer
    preferences by identifying and offering innovative products
    based on market opportunities and insights. The Company believes
    its strategy of focusing on the development of its core brands
    and continuing to identify innovative new products will help to
    prevent the Company from being dependent on the success of any
    one product line.

While the Company’s strategy has continued to focus on
    growing its core brands and developing innovative new products,
    it will continue to evaluate and enter into arrangements to
    license properties when the Company believes it is economically
    attractive. In 2006, the Company entered into a license with
    Marvel to produce toys and games based on Marvel’s
    portfolio of characters. The Company had significant sales of
    products related to this license during 2007, primarily due to
    the theatrical release of SPIDER-MAN 3 in May of 2007. The
    Company has also incurred royalties on products based on the
    theatrical release of TRANSFORMERS in July 2007. While gross
    profits of theatrical entertainment-based products are generally
    higher than many of the Company’s other products, sales
    from these products also incur royalty expenses payable to the
    licensor. Such royalties reduce the impact of these higher gross
    margins. In certain instances, such as with Lucasfilm’s
    STAR WARS, the Company may also incur amortization expense on
    property right-based assets acquired from the licensor of such
    properties, further impacting profit made on these products.

The Company’s long-term strategy also focuses on extending
    its brands further into the digital world. As part of this
    strategy, in August 2007, the Company announced a multi-year
    strategic agreement with Electronic Arts Inc. (“EA”).
    The agreement gives EA the exclusive worldwide rights, subject
    to existing limitations on the Company’s rights and certain
    other exclusions, to create digital games for all platforms,
    such as mobile phones, gaming consoles and personal computers,
    based on a broad spectrum of the Company’s intellectual
    properties, including MONOPOLY, SCRABBLE, YAHTZEE, NERF, TONKA
    and LITTLEST PET SHOP. As part of this agreement, the Company
    has also obtained the rights to create toys and non-digital
    games based on EA’s intellectual properties. The first
    games under this agreement are expected to launch in 2008.

While the Company remains committed to investing in the growth
    of its business, it continues to be focused on reducing fixed
    costs through efficiencies and on profit improvement. Over the
    last 5 years the Company has improved its operating margin
    from 7.8% in 2002 to 13.5% in 2007. The Company reviews it
    operations on an ongoing basis and seeks to reduce its cost
    structure in an efficient manner. In 2006 the Company announced
    a reduction of its manufacturing activity in Ireland and
    transition of the manufacture of certain products to the
    Company’s suppliers in China, and recently the Company
    announced a restructuring of its games manufacturing facility in
    the U.S. that is also expected to result in work practice
    efficiencies and cost reductions. The Company is also investing
    to grow its business in emerging international markets and will
    continue to evaluate strategic alliances and acquisitions which
    may complement its current product offerings or allow it entry
    into an area which is adjacent to and complementary to the toy
    and game business. For example, in January of 2008, the Company
    acquired Cranium, Inc., which develops and markets a wide range
    of CRANIUM branded games and related products. In 2008, the
    Company expects to leverage revenue to offset the impact of
    these investments on its operating margins.

In recent years, the Company has been seeking to return excess
    cash to its shareholders through share repurchases and
    dividends. As part of this initiative, over the last three
    years, the Company’s Board of Directors (the
    “Board”) has adopted three repurchase authorizations
    with a cumulative authorized repurchase amount of $1,200,000.
    After fully exhausting the prior two authorizations, the third
    authorization was passed on August 2, 2007 for $500,000.
    During the third and fourth quarters of 2007, $390,399 of common
    stock was repurchased under this authorization. For the years
    ended 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company invested $587,004,
    $456,744 and $48,030, respectively, in the repurchase of 20,795,
    22,767 and 2,386 shares, respectively, in the open market.
    Also, in May of 2007, the Company paid $200,000 in cash to
    repurchase exercisable warrants to purchase 15,750 shares
    of the Company’s common stock. Subsequent to
    December 30, 2007, the Board approved an additional
    $500,000 share repurchase authorization. The Company
    intends to opportunistically repurchase shares in the future
    subject to market conditions. In addition, in February 2008, the
    Company announced an increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.20
    per share. This was the fifth consecutive year that the Board
    has increased the dividend.

Results
    of Operations

The fiscal years ended December 30, 2007 and
    December 25, 2005 were fifty-two week periods while the
    fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 was a fifty-three week
    period.

Net earnings for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2007
    were $333,003, or $1.97 per diluted share. This compares to net
    earnings for fiscal 2006 and 2005 of $230,055 and $212,075, or
    $1.29 and $1.09 per diluted share, respectively.

Net earnings includes non-operating (income) expense related to
    the change in fair value of certain warrants required to be
    classified as a liability of $44,370 in 2007, $31,770 in 2006,
    and $(2,080) in 2005. These warrants were repurchased during May
    2007. Net earnings for 2007 also includes a favorable tax
    adjustment of $29,619, or $0.17 per diluted share, related to
    the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits.

Net earnings for 2005 include income tax expense of
    approximately $25,800 related to the Company’s repatriation
    of approximately $547,000 of foreign earnings in the fourth
    quarter of 2005 pursuant to the special incentive provided by
    the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

On December 26, 2005, the first day of fiscal 2006, the
    Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment”
    (“SFAS 123R”), which required that the Company
    measure all stock-based compensation awards using a fair value
    method and record such expense in its financial statements. The
    Company adopted this statement using the modified prospective
    method. Under this adoption method, the Company is recording
    expense related to stock option awards that were unvested as of
    the date of adoption as well as all awards made after the date
    of adoption. Accordingly, 2005 net earnings do not include
    expense related to stock options.

Consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 30,
    2007 were $3,837,557 compared to $3,151,481 in 2006 and
    $3,087,627 in 2005. Most of the Company’s net revenues and
    operating profits were derived from its two principal segments:
    North America and International, which are discussed in detail
    below. Consolidated net revenues were positively impacted by
    foreign currency translation in the amount of $94,500



in 2007 and $27,800 in 2006 as the result of the overall weaker
    U.S. dollar in each of those years. The following table
    presents net revenues and operating profit data for the
    Company’s two principal segments for 2007, 2006 and 2005.
    The operating profit for 2005 for each of these segments has
    been adjusted to include the impact of expense related to stock
    options as disclosed under SFAS 123, consistent with the
    Company’s management reporting. See notes 1 and 15 to
    the consolidated financial statements for further details.

North
    America

North American segment net revenues for the year ended
    December 30, 2007 increased 15% to $2,460,016 from
    $2,130,290 in 2006. The impact of foreign currency translation
    on North American segment net revenues in 2007 was favorable,
    primarily due to the strength of the Mexican peso and Canadian
    dollar, and increased net revenues by approximately $4,800. The
    increase was due primarily to increased revenues in the
    boys’ toys category driven by sales of MARVEL and
    TRANSFORMERS products due to the theatrical releases of
    SPIDER-MAN 3 in May 2007 and TRANSFORMERS in July 2007. Although
    STAR WARS product sales declined in 2007 from 2006, sales of
    these products have continued to be a significant contributor to
    boys’ toys revenues in 2007. Revenues in the girls’
    toys category increased as a result of higher sales of LITTLEST
    PET SHOP and FURREAL FRIENDS products as well as higher revenues
    from the BABY ALIVE line which was reintroduced in the second
    quarter of 2006. To a lesser extent, revenues in the girls’
    toys category were positively impacted by increased shipments of
    MY LITTLE PONY products. Girls’ toys revenues were
    negatively impacted by decreased sales of EASY-BAKE oven
    products due to the recall of the product in July of 2007.
    Revenues from the preschool category were flat for 2007. Revenue
    from games and puzzles decreased slightly due to lower revenues
    from trading card and plug and play games partially offset by
    increased sales of traditional board games. Revenues from the
    tweens category decreased as a result of lower sales of
    electronic products such as VIDEONOW, ZOOMBOX and I-DOG
    partially offset by increased sales of NERF products. Revenues
    in 2007 were also positively impacted by increased sales of
    TOOTH TUNES.

North American operating profit increased to $318,737 in 2007
    from $275,959 in 2006. Operating profit in 2007 was positively
    impacted by approximately $1,500 due to the translation of
    foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. The increase in
    operating profit is primarily the result of higher gross profits
    resulting from the higher revenues discussed above. Although
    North American gross profit increased as a result of higher
    revenues, this increase in gross profit was negatively impacted
    by approximately $10,400 of charges recorded in the second
    quarter of 2007 related to the July 2007 EASY-BAKE oven recall.
    The increase in gross profit was also partially offset by higher
    royalty expense as the result of the increased sales of MARVEL
    and TRANSFORMERS movie-related products. Operating profit was
    also impacted by higher advertising expense as well as higher
    selling and distribution costs related to the increased sales
    volume. In addition, North American operating profit included
    increased investment spending in an online initiative of the
    Company’s Wizards of the Coast operation.

North American segment net revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 increased 4% to $2,130,290 from
    $2,038,556 in 2005. The impact of foreign currency translation
    on North American segment net revenues in 2006 was favorable and
    increased net revenues by approximately $3,200. Anticipated
    decreased revenues of STAR WARS products were more than offset
    primarily by increased sales of LITTLEST PET SHOP, PLAYSKOOL,
    NERF, I-DOG and MONOPOLY products, as well as revenues from the
    successful reintroduction of BABY ALIVE. Revenues in 2006 were
    also positively impacted, to a lesser extent, by increased sales
    of PLAY-DOH and TRANSFORMERS products. STAR WARS revenues were
    significant in 2005 due to the



theatrical and DVD releases of STAR WARS EPISODE III: REVENGE OF
    THE SITH and remained strong in 2006.

North American segment operating profit increased to $275,959 in
    2006 from $165,676 in 2005. The increase in operating profit was
    primarily due to increased gross profit as a result of the
    increased sales in 2006 as well as decreases in royalty and
    amortization expense principally due to the decrease in sales of
    STAR WARS products. Operating profit for the North American
    segment was negatively impacted by higher research and product
    development costs due to higher investments in the PLAYSKOOL
    line and costs related to MARVEL products introduced in 2007.
    North American operating profit was negatively impacted in 2005
    by a loss of approximately $23,000 in the electronic games
    category, which included charges associated with inventory
    obsolescence and customer allowances related to plug and play
    games.

International

International segment net revenues for the year ended
    December 30, 2007 increased by 33% to $1,278,589 from
    $959,319 in 2006. In 2007, net revenues were positively impacted
    by currency translation of approximately $88,500 as a result of
    a weaker U.S. dollar. Although international revenues
    increased in all categories, the largest increase in net
    revenues was in the boys’ toys category. As in the North
    American segment, this increase was driven by higher sales of
    TRANSFORMERS products resulting from the theatrical release of
    the TRANSFORMERS movie in most countries in July of 2007 and
    MARVEL products resulting from the theatrical release of
    SPIDER-MAN 3 in May of 2007. Increased revenues in the
    girls’ toys category were principally the result of
    increased sales of LITTLEST PET SHOP products, and to a lesser
    extent, MY LITTLE PONY products. Revenues in the preschool
    category were higher in 2007 based on increased sales of
    PLAYSKOOL products, partially due to strong revenues of IN THE
    NIGHT GARDEN in the United Kingdom. Revenues in the games and
    puzzles category increased primarily due to increased sales of
    MONOPOLY. Revenues from the tweens category increased primarily
    as a result of sales of the POWER TOUR GUITAR which was
    introduced in 2007.

International segment operating profit increased 75% to $158,846
    in 2007 from $90,893 in 2006. Operating profit for the segment
    in 2007 was positively impacted by approximately $10,400 due to
    the translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar.
    The remaining increase in operating profit is due to the higher
    revenues discussed above. The increased gross profit as a result
    of the higher revenues was partially offset by higher royalty
    expense due to higher sales of MARVEL and TRANSFORMERS products
    as well as higher advertising and selling, distribution and
    administration expenses.

International segment net revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 decreased by 3% to $959,319 from $988,591
    in 2005. In 2006 net revenues were positively impacted by
    currency translation by approximately $24,300 as a result of a
    weaker U.S. dollar. The decrease in net revenues was
    primarily the result of decreased sales of STAR WARS products in
    2006 as well as decreased sales of FURBY and DUEL MASTERS
    products. These decreases were partially offset by increased
    revenues from LITTLEST PET SHOP, PLAYSKOOL and MONOPOLY
    products. To a lesser extent, 2006 net revenues were also
    positively impacted by increased sales of MY LITTLE PONY,
    TRANSFORMERS and PLAY-DOH products as well as the reintroduction
    of the BABY ALIVE doll.

International segment operating profit decreased 15% to $90,893
    in 2006 from $106,435 in 2005. Operating profit for the segment
    in 2006 was positively impacted by approximately $4,900 due to
    the translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar.
    The decrease in operating profit was the result of decreased
    gross profit primarily as a result of the decrease in net
    revenues, partially offset by decreases in royalties and
    amortization expense as a result of the decrease in sales of
    STAR WARS products.

Gross
    Profit

The Company’s gross profit margin increased to 58.9% for
    the year ended December 30, 2007 from 58.6% in 2006. This
    increase is due to changes in product mix, primarily the
    positive impact of higher sales of licensed products. Although
    licensed products generally carry a higher gross margin, the
    increased gross margin is largely offset by higher royalty
    expense associated with these products. Gross profit in 2007 was



also negatively impacted by approximately $10,400 in charges
    related to the recall of the Company’s EASY-BAKE oven
    product and by a charge of approximately $10,000 related to a
    restructuring and related reduction in work force at the
    Company’s manufacturing facility in East Longmeadow,
    Massachusetts. This charge consisted primarily of severance
    costs.

The Company’s gross profit margin was 58.6% for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 compared to 58.3% in 2005. The
    increase was due to increased revenues from certain core brand
    products that have higher gross margins, such as LITTLEST PET
    SHOP products and traditional board games, such as MONOPOLY.
    Gross profit in 2006 was negatively impacted by a charge of
    approximately $10,300 related to the Company’s decision to
    transfer certain manufacturing activities from its Ireland
    manufacturing facility to its suppliers in China. Gross margin
    in 2005 was also negatively impacted by inventory obsolescence
    and customer allowances on plug and play games.

Amortization expense continued to decrease in 2007 to $67,716
    from $78,934 in 2006 and $102,035 in 2005. A portion of
    amortization expense relates to licensing rights and is based on
    expected sales of products related to those licensing rights.
    The decrease in amortization expense in 2007 and 2006 primarily
    relates to decreased amortization of the product rights related
    to STAR WARS.

Royalty expense increased to $316,807 or 8.2% of net revenues in
    2007 compared to $169,731 or 5.4% of net revenues in 2006. This
    increase is primarily due to increased sales of
    entertainment-based products, primarily MARVEL and TRANSFORMERS
    movie-related products due to the theatrical releases of

SPIDER-MAN

    and TRANSFORMERS in 2007. Royalty expense decreased to $169,731
    or 5.4% of net revenues in 2006 compared to $247,283 or 8.0% of
    net revenues in 2005. This decrease primarily relates to the
    decrease in sales of STAR WARS products in 2006 from 2005.

Research and product development expense decreased in 2007 to
    $167,194 or 4.4% of net revenues from $171,358 or 5.4% of net
    revenues in 2006. This decrease reflects higher investments in
    the prior year, primarily related to the MARVEL product lines.
    Research and product development expense increased in 2006 to
    $171,358 or 5.4% of net revenues from $150,586 or 4.9% of net
    revenues in 2005. This increase was the result of development
    expenses related to the MARVEL line of products as well as
    increased investment in the PLAYSKOOL line.

Advertising expense increased in dollars to $434,742 in 2007
    from $368,996 in 2006, but decreased as a percentage of revenues
    to 11.3% from 11.7% in 2006. The decrease as a percentage of
    revenues primarily relates to the mix of sales in 2007, which
    included increased sales of entertainment-based products, which
    require lower amounts of advertising and promotion. Revenues
    related to entertainment-based properties have increased in 2007
    with the release of the SPIDER-MAN 3 and TRANSFORMERS movies.
    The increase in dollars is primarily due to continued investment
    in our PLAYSKOOL line as well as other core brands, and to a
    lesser extent, the impact of foreign exchange. Advertising
    expense in 2006 was $368,996 or 11.7% of net revenues which was
    consistent with the 2005 expense of $366,371 or 11.8% of net
    revenues.

Selling, distribution and administration expenses increased in
    dollars to $755,127 from $682,214 in 2006 but decreased as a
    percentage of revenues to 19.7% from 21.7% in 2006. The increase
    in dollars reflects higher variable selling and distribution
    costs resulting from higher revenues in 2007, as well as higher



incentive compensation provisions, the impact of foreign
    currency, and general inflationary increases. The decrease as a
    percentage of revenues reflects the fixed nature of certain of
    these expenses. Selling, distribution and administration
    expenses were $682,214 or 21.7% of net revenues in 2006 compared
    to $624,560 or 20.2% in 2005. Approximately $20,000 of this
    increase related to the Company’s adoption of
    SFAS 123R in 2006 which required that the Company measure
    all stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method
    and record such expense in its financial statements. The
    remainder of the increase primarily related to increased sales
    and marketing expense in 2006 associated with the higher level
    of sales and increased bonus and incentive provisions due to the
    strong performance of the Company in 2006.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense increased to $34,618 in 2007 from $27,521 in
    2006. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result
    of higher average borrowings in 2007. In September 2007, the
    Company issued $350,000 of Notes that are due in 2017. The
    majority of the proceeds from the issuance of these Notes were
    used to repay short-term debt resulting from increased
    repurchases of common stock as well as the repurchase of the
    Lucas warrants for $200,000.

Interest expense decreased to $27,521 in 2006 from $30,537 in
    2005. The decrease in interest expense mainly reflected the
    reduction in the Company’s long-term debt over that period.
    The Company repurchased or repaid principal amounts of long-term
    debt of $32,743 in 2006 and $93,303 in 2005.

Interest
    Income

Interest income was $29,973 in 2007 compared to $27,609 in 2006
    and $24,157 in 2005. Interest income includes $5,200 in 2006
    related to a long-term deposit that was refunded during 2006 and
    approximately $4,100 in 2005 related to an IRS settlement. The
    increase in interest income in 2007 primarily reflects higher
    average rates of return in 2007. To a lesser extent, the
    increase reflects higher average invested balances in 2007.
    During a portion of 2007 and 2006, the Company invested excess
    cash in auction rate securities, which generated a higher rate
    of return and contributed to the increases in interest income in
    2007 and 2006. The Company had no investments in auction rate
    securities at December 30, 2007.

Other
    (Income) Expense, Net

Other (income) expense, net of $52,323 in 2007 compares to
    $34,977 in 2006 and $(6,772) in 2005. The major component of
    other (income) expense is non-cash (income) expense related to
    the change in fair value of certain warrants required to be
    classified as a liability. These warrants were required to be
    adjusted to their fair value each quarter through earnings. For
    2007, 2006 and 2005, expense (income) related to the change in
    fair value of these warrants was $44,370, $31,770 and $(2,080),
    respectively. In May 2007, the Company exercised the call option
    on these warrants and repurchased the warrants for $200,000 in
    cash, which approximated fair value at that date. As these
    warrants have been repurchased there will be no further fair
    value adjustments.

In addition to the above, other (income) expense, net in 2006
    also included $2,629 representing a write-down of the value of
    common stock of Infogrames, held by the Company as an
    available-for-sale investment. This write-down resulted from an
    other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of this
    investment.

Income
    Taxes

Income tax expense totaled 28.0% of pretax earnings in 2007
    compared with 32.6% in 2006 and 31.8% in 2005. Income tax
    expense for 2007 is net of a benefit of $29,999 of discrete tax
    events, primarily relating to the recognition of previously
    unrecognized tax benefits. Income tax expense for 2006 includes
    a charge of approximately $7,800 of discrete tax events,
    primarily relating to the settlement of various tax exams in
    multiple jurisdictions. Income tax expense for 2005 includes a
    charge of approximately $25,800 related to the repatriation of
    $547,000 of foreign earnings pursuant to the special incentive
    provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Income tax
    expense for 2005 was also reduced by approximately $4,000, due
    primarily to the settlement of an Internal Revenue Service
    examination of tax years ending in December 2001. Absent



these items, potential interest and penalties in 2007 related to
    uncertain tax positions, and the effect of the adjustment of
    certain warrants to their fair value, which has no tax effect,
    the 2007 effective tax rate would have been 30.5% compared to
    27.6% in 2006 and 24.9% in 2005. The increase in the adjusted
    rate to 30.5% in 2007 compared to 27.6% in 2006 primarily
    reflects the decision to repatriate a portion of 2007
    international earnings to the U.S. The increase in the
    adjusted rate to 27.6% in 2006 from 24.9% in 2005 was the result
    of higher earnings in jurisdictions with higher statutory tax
    rates.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The Company has historically generated a significant amount of
    cash from operations. In 2007, the Company primarily funded its
    operations and liquidity needs through cash flows from
    operations, and, when needed, proceeds from its accounts
    receivable securitization program and borrowings under its
    unsecured credit facilities. In September 2007 the Company
    issued $350,000 in principal amount of notes that are due in
    2017 (the “Notes”). The proceeds from the sale of the
    Notes were primarily used to repay the Company’s short-term
    borrowings while the remainder of the proceeds were used for
    general corporate purposes. During 2008, the Company expects to
    continue to fund its working capital needs primarily through
    cash flows from operations and, when needed, using proceeds from
    its accounts receivable securitization program and borrowings
    under its available lines of credit. The Company believes that
    the funds available to it, including cash expected to be
    generated from operations and funds available through its
    accounts receivable securitization program and other available
    lines of credit are adequate to meet its working capital needs
    for 2008.

At December 30, 2007, cash and cash equivalents, net of
    short-term borrowings, were $764,257 compared to $704,818 and
    $927,592 at December 30, 2006 and December 25, 2005,
    respectively. Hasbro generated $601,794, $320,647, and $496,624
    of cash from its operating activities in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The higher cash flows from operations in 2007
    compared to 2006 were primarily the result of increased earnings
    as well as the mix of products in 2007 net revenues. Net
    earnings in 2007 included increased non-cash royalty expenses
    primarily as a result of increased revenues from MARVEL
    products. The royalty expense related to revenues from MARVEL
    products in 2007 was paid in 2006. Similarly, the higher cash
    flows from operations in 2005 compared to 2006 was primarily due
    to the mix of products in 2005 net revenues. Net earnings
    in 2005 included increased non-cash royalty expenses primarily
    as a result of increased STAR WARS revenues. Increased royalty
    expense in 2005 related to revenues from STAR WARS products,
    most of which had been paid in prior years. In 2007, 2006 and
    2005, operating cash flows were impacted by royalty advances
    paid of $70,000, $105,000 and $35,000 related to MARVEL in 2007
    and 2006 and STAR WARS in 2005, respectively.

Accounts receivable increased to $654,789 at December 30,
    2007 from $556,287 at December 31, 2006. The increase in
    accounts receivable is primarily the result of higher sales
    volume in 2007. Fourth quarter days sales outstanding remained
    consistent at 45 days in both 2007 and 2006 compared to
    44 days in 2005. The increase in days sales outstanding
    from 2005 primarily reflects increases in international accounts
    receivable due to the weaker U.S. dollar in 2006 and 2007.
    The December 30, 2007 accounts receivable balance includes
    an increase of approximately $31,100 related to the currency
    impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. The Company has a
    revolving accounts receivable securitization facility whereby
    the Company is able to sell undivided fractional ownership
    interests in qualifying accounts receivable on an ongoing basis.
    At December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, there was
    $250,000 sold at each period-end under this program.

Inventories increased to $259,081 at December 30, 2007 from
    $203,337 at December 31, 2006. The increase in inventory
    reflects the growth of the Company’s business in 2007. In
    addition, inventories increased approximately $9,400 due to the
    weaker U.S. dollar in 2007. The increase in inventory to
    $203,337 at December 31, 2006 from $179,398 at
    December 25, 2005 represents higher levels of inventory at
    December 31, 2006 due to anticipated sales of MARVEL
    products in early 2007. In addition, inventories increased
    approximately $6,100 due to the weaker U.S. dollar in 2006.

Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased to $199,912
    at December 30, 2007 from $243,291 at December 31,
    2006. This decrease is primarily due to utilization of MARVEL
    and Lucas royalty advances. Generally when the Company enters
    into a licensing agreement for entertainment-based properties,
    an advance



royalty payment is required at the inception of the agreement.
    This payment is then recognized in the consolidated statement of
    operations as the related sales are made. With respect to the
    MARVEL and STAR WARS licenses, the Company had prepaid royalties
    recorded in both current and non-current assets. Each reporting
    period, the Company reflects as current prepaid assets the
    amount of royalties it expects to reflect in the statement of
    operations in the upcoming twelve months. The decrease in
    prepaid expenses and other current assets also reflects a
    decrease in deferred tax assets. Prepaid expenses and other
    current assets increased to $243,291 in 2006 from $185,297 in
    2005. This increase was primarily due to a royalty advance paid
    to MARVEL in 2006, of which approximately $87,400 was recorded
    in prepaid expenses and $12,930 was shown in other assets at
    December 31, 2006.

Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased to $742,122 at
    December 30, 2007 from $895,311 at December 31, 2006.
    The decrease is primarily due to the Company exercising its call
    option related to warrants required to be classified as a
    liability and repurchasing these warrants for $200,000 in cash
    in the second quarter of 2007. At December 30, 2006, these
    warrants had a fair value of $155,630. The decrease is also a
    result of the reclassification of the liabilities related to
    uncertain tax positions as a result of the adoption of FASB
    Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes” at the beginning of 2007. These decreases
    were partially offset by increases in accrued royalties
    primarily due to the significant sales of TRANSFORMERS
    movie-related products, accrued advertising due to higher levels
    of advertising expense in the fourth quarter of 2007, as well as
    higher accounts payable due to higher levels of inventory and
    expenses as of December 30, 2007. Accounts payable and
    accrued expenses increased to $895,311 at December 31, 2006
    from $863,280 at December 25, 2005. Of this increase,
    $31,770 related to the increase in fair value of the Lucas
    warrants that the Company was required to record as liabilities
    under SFAS 150. As a result of SFAS 150, the Company
    classified these warrants containing a put option as a current
    liability and adjusted the amount of this liability to its fair
    value on a periodic basis. Increases from higher accrued bonus
    and incentive payments as a result of the Company’s strong
    performance in 2006 were offset by decreases in other accrued
    amounts, principally accrued royalties.

Cash flows from investing activities were a net utilization of
    $112,465, $83,604, and $120,671 in 2007, 2006, and 2005,
    respectively. In July 2007, with the exception of rights to
    DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, the Company reacquired the
    remaining digital gaming rights for its owned or controlled
    properties held by Infogrames Entertainment SA (Infogrames). The
    acquisition price of $19,000 included $18,000 in cash and $1,000
    of non-cash consideration in the form of the return of
    39 shares of preferred stock held by the Company in a
    subsidiary of Infogrames. During 2005, the Company expended
    $65,000 to reacquire the digital gaming rights for certain of
    its owned or controlled properties from Infogrames. The rights
    repurchased in 2007 and 2005 were previously held by Infogrames
    on an exclusive basis as a result of a licensing agreement
    entered into during 2000. In addition, in 2005 the Company
    expended $14,179 to purchase the assets of Wrebbit Inc., a
    Montreal-based creator and manufacturer of innovative puzzles.
    The Company made no acquisitions in 2006. In 2005, the Company
    also had proceeds from the sales of property, plant and
    equipment of $33,083. These proceeds were primarily from the
    sale of the Company’s former manufacturing facility in
    Spain. During 2007, the Company expended approximately $92,000
    on additions to its property, plant and equipment compared to
    $82,000 during 2006 and $71,000 during 2005. Of these amounts,
    61% in 2007, 63% in 2006, and 61% in 2005 were for purchases of
    tools, dies and molds related to the Company’s products. In
    2008, the Company expects capital expenditures to increase and
    be in the range of $100,000 to $115,000. During the three years
    ended December 30, 2007, depreciation and amortization of
    plant and equipment was $88,804, $67,773, and $78,097,
    respectively.

The Company commits to inventory production, advertising and
    marketing expenditures prior to the peak third and fourth
    quarter retail selling season. Accounts receivable increase
    during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their
    purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday
    season. Due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling
    period, payments for these accounts receivable are generally not
    due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of
    the subsequent year. This timing difference between expenditures
    and cash collections on accounts receivable made it necessary
    for the Company to borrow varying amounts during the year.
    During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company primarily utilized cash
    from operations and its accounts receivable securitization
    program to fund its operations.



The Company is party to an accounts receivable securitization
    program whereby the Company sells, on an ongoing basis,
    substantially all of its U.S. trade accounts receivable to
    a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, Hasbro Receivables
    Funding, LLC (“HRF”). HRF is consolidated with the
    Company for financial reporting purposes. The securitization
    program then allows HRF to sell, on a revolving basis, an
    undivided fractional ownership interest of up to $250,000 in the
    eligible receivables it holds to certain bank conduits. During
    the period from the first day of the October fiscal month
    through the last day of the following January fiscal month, this
    limit is increased to $300,000. The program provides the Company
    with a cost-effective source of working capital. Based on the
    amount of eligible accounts receivable as of December 30,
    2007, the Company had $266,550 available to sell under this
    program of which $250,000 was utilized.

The Company has a revolving credit agreement (the
    “Agreement”) which provides it with a $300,000
    committed borrowing facility. The Company has the ability to
    request increases in the committed facility in additional
    increments of at least $50,000, up to a total committed facility
    of $500,000. The Agreement contains certain financial covenants
    setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain
    other limitations typical of an investment grade facility,
    including with respect to liens, mergers and incurrence of
    indebtedness. The Company was in compliance with all covenants
    as of and for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2007. The
    Company had no borrowings outstanding under its committed
    revolving credit facility at December 30, 2007. The Company
    also has other uncommitted lines from various banks, of which
    approximately $37,833 was utilized at December 30, 2007.
    Amounts available and unused under the committed line at
    December 30, 2007 were approximately $298,200.

Net cash utilized by financing activities was $433,917 in 2007.
    Of this amount, $584,349, which includes transaction costs, was
    used to repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock. In
    August 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
    the repurchase of an additional $500,000 in common stock after
    two previous authorizations dated May 2005 and July 2006 of
    $350,000 each were fully utilized. During 2007, the Company
    repurchased 20,795 shares at an average price of $28.20. In
    addition, the Company purchased certain warrants in May 2007 for
    $200,000 in accordance with the terms of the call provision of
    the amended Lucas warrant agreement. Dividends paid were $94,097
    in 2007 reflecting the increase in the Company’s quarterly
    dividend rate to $0.16 per share in 2007 compared to $0.12 per
    share in 2006. These uses of cash were partially offset by net
    proceeds of $346,009 from the issuance of $350,000 of Notes that
    are due in 2017. The proceeds from the Notes were primarily used
    to repay short-term borrowings. The uses of cash were also
    partially offset by cash receipts of $82,661 from the exercise
    of employee stock options.

Net cash utilized by financing activities was $467,279 in 2006.
    Of this amount, $456,744, which includes transaction costs, was
    used to repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock. In
    July 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of $350,000 in common stock subsequent to the full
    utilization of the Board of Director’s May 2005
    authorization of $350,000. During 2006, the Company repurchased
    22,767 shares at an average price of $20.03. In addition,
    $32,743 was used to repay long-term debt. Dividends paid were
    $75,282 in 2006 reflecting the increase in the Company’s
    quarterly dividend rate to $0.12 per share in 2006 compared to
    $0.09 per share in 2005. These uses of cash were partially
    offset by cash receipts of $86,257 from the exercise of employee
    stock options.

Net cash utilized by financing activities was $158,641 in 2005.
    This amount included repayments in principal amount of long-term
    debt totaling $93,303. These amounts primarily related to
    $71,970 of bonds that matured in November of 2005. The remaining
    amount related to repayment of long-term debt associated with
    the Company’s former manufacturing facility in Spain.
    Dividends paid increased to $58,901 as a result of the increase
    of the quarterly dividend rate to $0.09 in 2005 from $0.06. In
    2005, the Company repurchased 2,386 of its common shares on the
    open market at an average price of $20.10 under the Board of
    Director’s May 2005 authorization. The total cost of
    these repurchases, including transaction costs, was $48,030. The
    Company received $45,278 in 2005 in proceeds from the exercise
    of employee stock options.

At December 30, 2007, the Company has outstanding $249,828
    in principal amount of senior convertible debentures due 2021.
    The senior convertible debentures bear interest at 2.75%, which
    could be subject to an upward adjustment in the rate, not to
    exceed 11%, should the price of the Company’s stock trade
    at or below $9.72 per share for 20 of the 30 trading days
    preceding the fifth day prior to an interest payment date. This



contingent interest feature represents a derivative instrument
    that is recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value, with
    changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations.
    If the closing price of the Company’s stock exceeds $23.76
    for at least 20 trading days, within the 30 consecutive trading
    day period ending on the last trading day of the calendar
    quarter, or upon other specified events, the debentures will be
    convertible at an initial conversion price of $21.60 in the next
    calendar quarter. At December 30, 2006, March 31,
    2007, June 30, 2007 and September 30, 2007 this
    conversion feature was met and the debentures were convertible
    throughout 2007. During 2007, $168 of these debentures were
    converted and 8 shares were issued. At December 30,
    2007, this conversion feature was met again and the bonds are
    convertible through March 31, 2008 at which time the
    requirements of the conversion feature will be reevaluated. In
    addition, if the closing price of the Company’s stock
    exceeds $27.00 for at least 20 trading days in any 30 day
    period, the Company has the right to call the debentures by
    giving notice to the holders of the debentures. During a
    prescribed notice period, the holders of the debentures have the
    right to convert their debentures in accordance with the
    conversion terms described above. The holders of these
    debentures may also put the notes back to Hasbro in December
    2011 and December 2016 at the original principal amount. At that
    time, the purchase price may be paid in cash, shares of common
    stock or a combination of the two, at the Company’s
    discretion. While the Company’s current intent is to settle
    in cash any puts exercised, there can be no guarantee that the
    Company will have the funds necessary to settle this obligation
    in cash. On December 1, 2005, the holders of these
    debentures had the option to put these notes back to Hasbro. On
    that date, the Company redeemed $4 of these notes in cash.

The $350,000 Notes due in 2017 bear interest at a rate of 6.30%,
    which may be adjusted upward in the event that the
    Company’s credit rating from Moody’s Investor
    Services, Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings
    Services or Fitch Ratings is decreased two levels below the
    Company’s credit ratings on the date of issuance of the
    Notes. On the date of issuance and throughout the remainder of
    2007, the Company’s ratings from Moody’s Investor
    Services, Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings
    Services and Fitch Ratings were BBB, Baa2 and BBB, respectively.
    The interest rate adjustment is dependent on the degree of
    decrease of the Company’s ratings and could range from
    0.25% to a maximum of 2%. The Company may redeem the Notes at
    its option at the greater of the principal amount of the Notes
    or the present value of the remaining scheduled payments
    discounted using the effective interest rate on applicable
    U.S. Treasury bills at the time of repurchase.

The Company has remaining principal amounts of long-term debt at
    December 30, 2007 of approximately $844,815. As detailed
    below in Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments,
    this debt is due at varying times from 2008 through 2028. In
    addition, the Company is committed to guaranteed royalty and
    other contractual payments of approximately $18,354 in 2008. The
    Company also had letters of credit and other similar instruments
    of approximately $70,000 and purchase commitments of $249,883
    outstanding at December 30, 2007. The Company believes that
    cash from operations, including the securitization facility,
    and, if necessary, its line of credit, will allow the Company to
    meet these and other obligations listed.

In August 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
    the repurchase of up to $500,000 in common stock after two
    previous authorizations dated May 2005 and July 2006 of $350,000
    each were fully utilized. Purchases of the Company’s common
    stock may be made from time to time, subject to market
    conditions, and may be made in the open market or through
    privately negotiated transactions. The Company has no obligation
    to repurchase shares under the authorization and the timing,
    actual number, and the value of the shares which are repurchased
    will depend on a number of factors, including the price of the
    Company’s common stock. The Company may suspend or
    discontinue repurchases of its stock at any time and there is no
    expiration date for such repurchases. In 2007, the Company
    repurchased 20,795 shares at an average price of $28.20.
    The total cost of these repurchases, including transaction
    costs, was $587,004. On February 7, 2008 the Board of
    Directors approved an additional $500,000 share repurchase
    authorization. On that date, approximately $48,300 remained
    under the August 2007 repurchase authorization.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates

The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. As such, management is required to
    make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it
    believes are reasonable based on information available. These



estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets
    and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods
    presented. The significant accounting policies which management
    believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and
    evaluating the Company’s reported financial results include
    sales allowances, recoverability of goodwill and intangible
    assets, recoverability of royalty advances and commitments,
    pension costs and obligations, stock-based compensation, and
    income taxes.

Sales
    Allowances

Sales allowances for customer promotions, discounts and returns
    are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue
    is recognized. Revenue from product sales is recognized upon
    passing of title to the customer, generally at the time of
    shipment. Revenue from product sales, less related sales
    allowances, is added to royalty revenue and reflected as net
    revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. The
    Company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance
    programs with customers. These allowances primarily relate to
    fixed programs, which the customer earns based on purchases of
    Company products during the year. Discounts are recorded as a
    reduction of related revenue at the time of sale. While many of
    the allowances are based on fixed amounts, certain of the
    allowances, such as the returns allowance, are based on market
    data, historical trends and information from customers and are
    therefore subject to estimation. For its allowance programs that
    are not fixed, such as returns, the Company estimates these
    amounts using a combination of historical experience and current
    market conditions. These estimates are reviewed periodically
    against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that
    time as an increase or decrease to net revenues. During 2007,
    there have been no material adjustments to the Company’s
    estimates.

Recoverability
    of Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite
    lives are tested for impairment at least annually. If an event
    occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying
    value may not be recoverable, the Company will perform an
    interim test at that time. The impairment test begins by
    allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable
    reporting units. Goodwill is then tested using a two step
    process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the
    reporting unit using an income approach, which looks to the
    present value of expected future cash flows.

The first step is a screen for potential impairment while the
    second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an
    indication from the first step that one exists. Intangible
    assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by
    comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value
    which is also calculated using an income approach. The
    Company’s annual impairment test was performed in the
    fourth quarter of 2007 and no impairment was indicated. The
    estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments
    and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the
    respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those
    revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in
    anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a
    change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge.
    The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the
    selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different
    assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash
    flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment
    charge. At December 30, 2007, the Company has goodwill and
    intangible assets with indefinite lives of $546,915 recorded on
    the balance sheet.

Intangible assets, other than those with indefinite lives, are
    amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for
    indications of impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Recoverability of the value of these intangible
    assets is measured by a comparison of the assets’ carrying
    value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected
    to be generated by the asset. If such assets were considered to
    be impaired, the impairment would be measured by the amount by
    which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value
    based on estimated future discounted cash flows. The estimation
    of future cash flows requires significant judgments and
    estimates with respect to future revenues related to the
    respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those
    revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in
    anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a
    change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge.
    The estimation of discounted cash flows also



requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use
    of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated
    discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related
    impairment charge. Intangible assets covered under this policy
    were $410,494 at December 30, 2007. During 2007, there were
    no impairment charges related to these intangible assets.

Recoverability
    of Royalty Advances and Commitments

The recoverability of royalty advances and contractual
    obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is
    assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the
    estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow
    projections to be derived from the related product. If sales
    forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do
    not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty
    or, if the Company decides to discontinue a product line with
    royalty advances or commitments, a charge to royalty expense to
    write-off the remaining minimum guaranty is required. The
    preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for
    these products requires judgments and estimates. Actual revenues
    and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of
    anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products
    could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of
    remaining minimum guaranteed royalties. At December 30,
    2007, the Company had $137,959 of prepaid royalties, $94,616 of
    which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets
    and $43,343 which are included in other assets.

Pension
    Costs and Obligations

The Company, except for certain international subsidiaries, has
    pension plans covering substantially all of its full-time
    employees. Pension expense is based on actuarial computations of
    current and future benefits using estimates for expected return
    on assets, expected compensation increases, and applicable
    discount rates.

The estimates for the Company’s U.S. plans are
    established at the Company’s measurement date. Prior to
    2007, the Company used September 30 as its measurement date to
    measure the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish
    the expense for the upcoming year. In accordance with the
    provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined
    Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans”,
    (“SFAS No. 158”) which the Company adopted
    in December of 2006, the Company changed its measurement date in
    2007 to its fiscal year-end date. In accordance with this, the
    liabilities and assets of the plans were remeasured as of
    December 31, 2006. See note 11 to the consolidated
    financial statements for the impact of this remeasurement.

The Company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted
    average rate based on historical market data for the investment
    classes of assets held by the plan, the allocation of plan
    assets among those investment classes, and the current economic
    environment. Based on this information, the Company’s
    estimate of expected return on U.S. plan assets was 8.75%
    in 2007, 2006 and 2005. A decrease in the estimate used for
    expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense,
    while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension
    expense. A decrease of 0.25% in the estimate of expected return
    on plan assets would have increased 2007 pension expense for
    U.S. plans by approximately $660.

Expected compensation increases are estimated using a
    combination of historical and expected compensation increases.
    Based on this analysis, the Company’s estimate of expected
    long-term compensation increases for its U.S. plans was
    4.0% in 2007, 2006 and 2005. Increases in estimated compensation
    increases would result in higher pension expense while decreases
    would lower pension expense.

Discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the
    measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments
    currently available and expected to be available during the
    period to maturity of the pension benefits. Based on this
    long-term corporate bond yield at December 30, 2007, the
    Company’s measurement date for its pension assets and
    liabilities, the Company’s discount rate for its
    U.S. plans used for the calculation of 2007 pension expense
    averaged 5.83% compared to a rate of 5.50% used in the
    calculation of 2006 pension expense and 5.75% used in the
    calculation of 2005 pension expense. A decrease in the discount
    rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase
    in the discount rate would decrease pension expense. A decrease
    of 0.25% in the Company’s discount rate would have
    increased 2007 pension expense and the 2007 projected benefit
    obligation by approximately $744 and $7,779, respectively.



In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 87, “Employers Accounting for Pensions”,
    actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are
    accumulated and, if outside a certain corridor, amortized over
    future periods and, therefore generally affect recognized
    expense in future periods. At December 30, 2007, the
    Company’s U.S. plans had unrecognized actuarial losses
    of $19,158 included in accumulated other comprehensive income
    related to its defined benefit pension plans. Pension plan
    assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the
    measurement date. Changes in the fair market value of plan
    assets may impact the amount of future pension expense. During
    2007 there were not significant declines in the fair value of
    pension plan assets. As of December 30, 2007, the Company
    froze benefits under its largest pension plans in the U.S., with
    no future benefits accruing to employees. The Company will
    continue to pay benefits under the plan consistent with the
    provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit freeze.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company has a stock-based compensation plan for employees
    and non-employee members of the Company’s Board of
    Directors. Under this plan, the Company may grant stock options
    at or above the fair market value of the Company’s stock,
    as well as restricted stock, restricted stock units and
    contingent stock performance awards. On December 26, 2005,
    the first day of fiscal 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS 123R, which requires the Company to measure all
    stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and
    record such expense in its consolidated financial statements.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value
    stock options that are granted under these plans. The
    Black-Scholes method includes four significant assumptions:
    (1) expected term of the options, (2) risk-free
    interest rate, (3) expected dividend yield, and
    (4) expected stock price volatility. For the Company’s
    2007 and 2006 stock option grants, the weighted average expected
    term was approximately 5 years. This amount is based on a
    review of employees’ exercise history relating to stock
    options as well as the contractual term of the option. The
    weighted average risk-free interest rates used for 2007 and 2006
    stock option grants were 4.79% and 4.98%, respectively. This
    estimate was based on the interest rate available on
    U.S. treasury securities with durations that approximate
    the expected term of the option. The weighted average expected
    dividend yields used for the 2007 and 2006 stock option grants
    were 1.97% and 2.55%, respectively, which is based on the
    Company’s current annual dividend amount divided by the
    stock price on the date of the grant. The weighted average
    expected stock price volatilities used for 2007 and 2006 stock
    option grants were 22% and 24%, respectively. These amounts were
    derived using a combination of current and historical implied
    price volatility. Implied price volatility represents the
    volatility implied in publicly traded options on the
    Company’s stock, which the Company believes represents the
    expected future volatility of the Company’s stock price.
    The Company believes that since this is a market-based estimate,
    it provides a better estimate of expected future volatility as
    compared to based only on historical volatility.

In 2007 and 2006, as part of its employee stock-based
    compensation plan, the Company issued contingent stock
    performance awards, which provide the recipients with the
    ability to earn shares of the Company’s common stock based
    on the Company’s achievement of stated cumulative diluted
    earnings per share and cumulative net revenue targets over the
    three fiscal years ended December 2009 for the 2007 award,
    and over a ten quarter period beginning July 3, 2006 and
    ending December 2008 for the 2006 award. Each award has a
    target number of shares of common stock associated with such
    award which may be earned by the recipient if the Company
    achieves the stated diluted earnings per share and net revenue
    targets. These awards are valued based on the fair market value
    of the Company’s stock on the date of the grant. The
    measurement of the expense related to this award is based on the
    Company’s current estimate of revenues and diluted earnings
    per share over the performance period. Changes in these
    estimates may impact the expense recognized related to these
    awards.

Income
    Taxes

The Company’s annual tax rate is based on its income,
    statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in
    the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant
    judgment and estimates are required to determine the
    Company’s annual tax rate and in evaluating its tax
    positions. Despite the Company’s belief that its tax return
    positions are fully supportable, these positions are subject to
    challenge and estimated liabilities



are established in the event that these positions are challenged
    and the Company is not successful in defending these challenges.
    These estimated liabilities are adjusted, as well as the related
    interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as
    the progress of a tax audit.

An estimated effective tax rate is applied to the Company’s
    quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant
    unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the Company’s
    quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item
    is separately calculated and recorded at the time. Changes in
    the Company’s estimated effective tax rate during 2007 were
    primarily due to changes in its estimate of earnings by tax
    jurisdiction, as well as the Company’s decision to
    repatriate a portion of 2007 international earnings to the
    U.S. In addition, changes in judgment related to tax
    positions taken in a prior fiscal year, or tax costs or benefits
    from a resolution of such positions would be recorded entirely
    in the interim period the judgment changes or resolution occurs.
    During 2007, the Company recorded a total benefit of $29,999
    related to discrete tax events primarily related to the
    recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and related
    reversal of interest.

In certain cases, tax law requires items to be included in the
    Company’s tax returns at a different time than when these
    items are recognized on the financial statements or at a
    different amount than that which is recognized on the financial
    statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as
    expenses that are not deductible on the Company’s tax
    returns, while other differences are temporary and will reverse
    over time, such as depreciation expense. These differences that
    will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and
    liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Deferred tax
    assets represent credits or deductions that have been reflected
    on the financial statements but have not yet been reflected in
    the Company’s income tax returns. Valuation allowances are
    established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is
    determined that the Company will have insufficient future
    taxable income, including capital gains, to fully realize the
    future credits, deductions or capital losses. Deferred tax
    liabilities represent expenses recognized on the Company’s
    tax return that have not yet been recognized in the
    Company’s financial statements or income recognized in the
    financial statements that has not yet been recognized on the
    Company’s tax return. During 2007, the Mexican Government
    instituted a tax structure which will result in companies paying
    the higher of an income-based tax or an alternative flat tax
    commencing in 2008. Should the Company be subject to the
    alternative flat tax, it would be required to review whether its
    net deferred tax assets would be realized. As the Company
    believes that it will be subject to the income-based tax in
    2008, it believes that the net deferred tax assets related to
    the Mexican tax jurisdiction will be realizable. Should the
    facts and circumstances change, the Company may be required to
    reevaluate deferred tax assets related to its Mexican
    operations, which may result in additional tax expense.

Contractual
    Obligations and Commercial Commitments

In the normal course of its business, the Company enters into
    contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under
    license, which may require the payment of minimum guarantees, as
    well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and
    equipment. In addition, the Company has $844,815 in principal
    amount of long-term debt outstanding at December 30, 2007,
    excluding fair value adjustments. Future payments required under
    these and other obligations as of December 30, 2007 are as
    follows:

At December 30, 2007, the Company has a liability,
    including potential interest and penalties, of $70,571 for
    uncertain tax positions that have been taken or expected to be
    taken in a tax return. The Company does not know the ultimate
    resolution of these liabilities and as such, does not know the
    ultimate timing of payments related to this liability.

Included in the Thereafter column above is $249,828 in principal
    amount of senior convertible debt due 2021. The holders of these
    debentures may put the notes back to the Company in December
    2011 and December 2016 at the principal amount. At that time,
    the purchase price may be paid in cash, shares of common stock
    or a combination of the two. In addition, at December 30,
    2007, these debentures may be converted to shares at an initial
    conversion price of $21.60 per share through March 31,
    2008, at which time the requirements of the contingent
    conversion feature will be reevaluated. If the Company’s
    stock exceeds $23.76 for at least 20 trading days, within the 30
    consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of
    a calendar quarter, or upon other specified events, the
    debentures will be convertible at the initial conversion price
    of $21.60.

The Company’s agreement with MARVEL provides for minimum
    guaranteed royalty payments and requires the Company to make
    minimum expenditures on marketing and promotional activities.
    The future minimum contractual payments include future
    guaranteed contractual royalty payments of $35,000 payable to
    MARVEL in 2010 that are contingent upon the theatrical release
    of SPIDER-MAN 4.

In addition, the Company expects to make contributions totaling
    approximately $9,200 to its pension plans in 2008. The Company
    also has letters of credit and related instruments of
    approximately $70,000 at December 30, 2007.

Financial
    Risk Management

The Company is exposed to market risks attributable to
    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the
    result of sourcing products priced in U.S. dollars, Hong
    Kong dollars and Euros while marketing those products in more
    than twenty currencies. Results of operations may be affected
    primarily by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, Hong
    Kong dollar, Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and Mexican
    peso and, to a lesser extent, currencies in Latin American and
    Asia Pacific countries.

To manage this exposure, the Company has hedged a portion of its
    forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange
    forward contracts. The Company estimates that a hypothetical
    immediate 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against
    foreign currencies could result in an approximate $52,400
    decrease in the fair value of these instruments. A decrease in
    the fair value of these instruments would be substantially
    offset by decreases in the related forecasted foreign currency
    transaction.

The Company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with
    respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short-term
    borrowing positions in currencies other than the
    U.S. dollar. The Company believes, however, that the
    on-going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its
    financial condition. In addition, the Company’s revenues
    and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by
    changes in foreign currency rates. From time to time, affiliates
    of the Company may make or receive intercompany loans in
    currencies other than their functional currency. The Company
    manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using
    foreign exchange contracts. The Company reflects all derivatives
    at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance
    sheet. The Company does not speculate in foreign currency
    exchange contracts. At December 30, 2007, these contracts
    had unrealized losses of $10,437, of which $6,679 are recorded
    in accrued liabilities and $3,758 recorded in other liabilities.
    Included in accumulated other comprehensive income at
    December 30, 2007 are deferred losses of $11,080, net of
    tax.

At December 30, 2007, the Company had fixed rate long-term
    debt, excluding fair value adjustments, of $844,815. At
    December 30, 2007, the Company had fixed-for-floating
    interest rate swaps with notional amounts of $75,000. The
    interest rate swaps are designed to adjust a portion of the
    Company’s debt subject to a fixed interest rate. The
    interest rate swaps are matched with specific long-term debt
    issues and are designated and effective as hedges of the change
    in the fair value of the associated debt. Changes in fair value
    of these contracts are wholly offset in earnings by changes in
    the fair value of the related long-term debt. At



December 30, 2007, these contracts had a fair value of
    $256, which was included in other current assets, with a
    corresponding fair value adjustment to increase the current
    portion of long-term debt. Changes in interest rates affect the
    fair value of fixed rate debt not hedged by interest rate swap
    agreements while affecting the earnings and cash flows of the
    long-term debt hedged by the interest rate swaps. The Company
    estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point decrease or
    increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair
    value of this long-term debt by approximately $39,500 or
    $35,400, respectively. A hypothetical one percentage point
    change in interest rates would increase or decrease 2008 pretax
    earnings and cash flows by $379 and $379, respectively.

The
    Economy and Inflation

The principal market for the Company’s products is the
    retail sector. Revenues from the Company’s top 5 customers,
    all retailers, accounted for approximately 52%, 53%, and 53% of
    its consolidated net revenues in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. In the past three years certain customers in the
    retail sector have experienced economic difficulty. The Company
    monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts
    credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate.

The Company’s revenue pattern continues to show the second
    half of the year to be more significant to its overall business
    for the full year. In 2007, approximately 66% of the
    Company’s full year net revenues were recognized in the
    second half of the year. Although the Company expects that this
    concentration will continue, particularly as more of its
    business has shifted to larger customers with order patterns
    concentrated in the second half of the year, this concentration
    may be less in years where the Company has products related to a
    major motion picture release that occurs in the first half of
    the year. In 2007, the Company had products related to two major
    motion picture releases, SPIDER-MAN 3 in May of 2007 and
    TRANSFORMERS in July of 2007. The concentration of sales in the
    second half of the year increases the risk of
    (a) underproduction of popular items,
    (b) overproduction of less popular items, and
    (c) failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping
    schedules. The business of the Company is characterized by
    customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely
    because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a
    product line, product availability, marketing strategies,
    inventory levels, policies of retailers and differences in
    overall economic conditions. The trend of larger retailers has
    been to maintain lower inventories throughout the year and
    purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the
    fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season, which includes
    Christmas.

Quick response inventory management practices being used by
    retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate
    delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of
    shipment. Retailers are timing their orders so that they are
    being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by
    consumers. To the extent that retailers do not sell as much of
    their year-end inventory purchases during this holiday selling
    season as they had anticipated, their demand for additional
    product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed,
    thus negatively impacting the Company’s revenues. In
    addition, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the
    Company’s significant retailers could negatively impact the
    Company’s future revenues.

The effect of inflation on the Company’s operations during
    2007 was not significant and the Company will continue its
    policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices, accordingly.

Other
    Information

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements”, (“SFAS No. 157”) which
    defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 is applicable for the Company as of
    December 31, 2007, the first day of fiscal 2008. The FASB
    issued FASB Staff Position

FAS 157-b,

“Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157”, which
    deferred the effective date of the Statement for certain
    nonfinancial assets and liabilities until fiscal 2009. The
    Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157
    to have a material impact on its consolidated balance sheet and
    results of operations.



In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 159, “The Fair Value Option
    for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”
    (“SFAS No. 159”). SFAS No. 159
    permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments
    and certain other items at fair value and establishes
    presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate
    comparisons between entities that choose different measurement
    attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities.
    SFAS No. 159 is effective for the Company beginning
    January 1, 2008. The Company does not expect the adoption
    of SFAS No. 159 to have a material impact on its
    consolidated balance sheet and results of operations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 141 (Revised 2007), “Business
    Combinations”, (“SFAS 141R), which makes certain
    modifications to the accounting for business combinations. These
    changes include (1) the requirement for an acquirer to
    recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their
    fair value on the acquisition date; (2) the requirement for
    an acquirer to recognize assets or liabilities arising from
    contingencies at fair value as of that acquisition date; and
    (3) the requirement that an acquirer expense all
    acquisition related costs. This Statement is required to be
    applied prospectively to business combinations for which the
    acquisition date is on or after the beginning of fiscal 2009.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 160, “Noncontrolling
    Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements”,
    (“SFAS 160”) which requires noncontrolling
    (minority) interests in subsidiaries to be initially measured at
    fair value and presented as a separate component of
    shareholders’ equity. Current practice is to present
    noncontrolling interests as a liability or other item outside of
    equity. This Statement is required to be applied prospectively
    after the beginning of fiscal 2009, although the presentation

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
    Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Hasbro, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Hasbro, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 30, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006, and the related consolidated statements
    of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for
    each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended
    December 30, 2007. These consolidated financial statements
    are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
    financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Hasbro, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
    December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, and the
    results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
    fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 30,
    2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles.

As discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial
    statements, on January 1, 2007 the Company adopted
    Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.” As
    discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial
    statements, during the first quarter of 2006, the Company
    adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment”. As discussed
    in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, during
    the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans”.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Hasbro, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 30, 2007, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO), and our report dated February 26, 2008, expressed
    an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

(Thousands of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

(1)

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Hasbro, Inc. and all majority-owned subsidiaries
    (“Hasbro” or the “Company”). Investments
    representing 20% to 50% ownership interest in other companies
    are accounted for using the equity method. The Company had no
    equity method investments at December 30, 2007 that were
    material to the consolidated financial statements. All
    significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
    eliminated.

Preparation
    of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
    notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the 2006 and 2005 consolidated financial
    statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2007
    presentation.

Fiscal
    Year

Hasbro’s fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in December.
    The fiscal years ended December 30, 2007 and
    December 25, 2005 were fifty-two week periods while the
    fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 was a fifty-three week
    period.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and highly
    liquid investments purchased with a maturity to the Company of
    three months or less.

Marketable
    Securities

Marketable securities are comprised of investments in
    publicly-traded securities, classified as available-for-sale,
    and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses,
    net of tax, reported as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive earnings (“AOCE”) within
    shareholders’ equity until realized. Unrealized losses are
    evaluated to determine the nature of the losses. If the losses
    are determined to be other than temporary, the basis of the
    security is adjusted and the loss is recognized in earnings at
    that time. These securities are included in other assets in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Accounts
    Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Credit is granted to customers predominantly on an unsecured
    basis. Credit limits and payment terms are established based on
    extensive evaluations made on an ongoing basis throughout the
    fiscal year with regard to the financial performance, cash
    generation, financing availability and liquidity status of each
    customer. The majority of customers are reviewed at least
    annually; more frequent reviews are performed based on the
    customer’s financial condition and the level of credit
    being extended. For customers on credit who are experiencing
    financial difficulties, management performs additional financial
    analyses before shipping orders. The Company uses a variety of
    financial transactions based on availability and cost, to
    increase the collectibility of certain of its accounts,
    including letters of credit, credit insurance, factoring with
    unrelated third parties, and requiring cash in advance of
    shipping.



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts at the
    time revenue is recognized based on management’s assessment
    of the business environment, customers’ financial
    condition, historical collection experience, accounts receivable
    aging and customer disputes. When a significant event occurs,
    such as a bankruptcy filing by a specific customer, and on a
    quarterly basis, the allowance is reviewed for adequacy and the
    balance or accrual rate is adjusted to reflect current risk
    prospects.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out) or market. Based upon a consideration of quantities
    on hand, actual and projected sales volume, anticipated product
    selling price and product lines planned to be discontinued,
    slow-moving and obsolete inventory is written down to its
    estimated net realizable value.

At December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, finished
    goods comprised 91% and 92% of inventories, respectively.

Long-Lived
    Assets

The Company’s long-lived assets consist of property, plant
    and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
    lives as well as other intangible assets the Company considers
    to have a defined life.

Goodwill results from acquisitions the Company has made over
    time. Substantially all of the other intangibles consist of the
    cost of acquired product rights. In establishing the value of
    such rights, the Company considers existing trademarks,
    copyrights, patents, license agreements and other
    product-related rights. These rights were valued at their
    acquisition date based on the anticipated future cash flows from
    the underlying product line. The Company has certain intangible
    assets related to the Tonka and Milton Bradley acquisitions that
    have an indefinite life.

Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives
    are not amortized and are tested for impairment at least
    annually. The annual test begins with goodwill and all
    intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units.
    Goodwill is then tested using a two-step process that begins
    with an estimation of fair value of the reporting unit using an
    income approach, which looks to the present value of expected
    future cash flows. The first step is a screen for potential
    impairment while the second step measures the amount of
    impairment if there is an indication from the first step that
    one exists. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested
    annually for impairment by comparing their carrying value to
    their estimated fair value, also calculated using the present
    value of expected future cash flows.

The remaining intangibles having defined lives are being
    amortized over periods ranging from five to twenty-five years,
    primarily using the straight-line method. At December 30,
    2007, approximately 8% of other intangibles relate to rights
    acquired in connection with a major motion picture entertainment
    property and are being amortized over the contract life, in
    proportion to projected sales of the licensed products during
    the same period.

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less
    accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and
    amortization are computed using accelerated and straight-line
    methods to amortize the cost of property, plant and equipment
    over their estimated useful lives. The principal lives, in
    years, used in determining depreciation rates of various assets
    are: land improvements 15 to 19, buildings and improvements 15
    to 25 and machinery and equipment 3 to 12. Tools, dies and molds
    are amortized over a three-year period or their useful lives,
    whichever is less, using an accelerated method. The Company
    generally owns all tools, dies and molds related to its products.



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

The Company reviews property, plant and equipment and other
    intangibles with defined lives for impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the
    carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future
    undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or
    asset group. If such assets were considered to be impaired, the
    impairment to be recognized would be measured by the amount by
    which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value.
    Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or
    appraised values, depending on the nature of the assets. Assets
    to be disposed of are carried at the lower of the net book value
    or their estimated fair value less disposal costs.

Financial
    Instruments

Hasbro’s financial instruments include cash and cash
    equivalents, accounts receivable, marketable securities, short-
    and long-term borrowings, accounts payable and accrued
    liabilities. At December 30, 2007, the carrying cost of
    these instruments approximated their fair value, with the
    exception of the Company’s contingent convertible
    debentures due 2021. At December 30, 2007, these debentures
    had a carrying value of $249,828 and an approximate fair value
    of $321,496. The Company’s financial instruments also
    include foreign currency forwards (see note 13) as
    well as interest rate swap agreements (see note 7). At
    December 30, 2007, the carrying value of these instruments
    was their fair value based on quoted or publicly available
    market information.

Securitization
    and Transfer of Financial Instruments

Hasbro has an agreement that allows the Company to sell, on an
    ongoing basis, an undivided fractional ownership interest in
    certain of its trade accounts receivable through a revolving
    securitization arrangement. The Company retains servicing
    responsibilities for, as well as a subordinate interest in the
    transferred receivables. Hasbro accounts for the securitization
    of trade accounts receivable as a sale in accordance with
    SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and
    Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of
    Liabilities” (“SFAS 140”). As a result, the
    related receivables are removed from the consolidated balance
    sheet.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue from product sales is recognized upon the passing of
    title to the customer, generally at the time of shipment.
    Provisions for discounts, rebates and returns are made when the
    related revenues are recognized. The Company bases its estimates
    for discounts, rebates and returns on agreed customer terms and
    historical experience.

The Company enters into arrangements licensing its brand names
    on specifically approved products. The licensees pay the Company
    royalties as products are sold, in some cases subject to annual
    minimum guaranteed amounts. Royalty revenues are recognized as
    they are reported as earned and payment becomes assured, over
    the life of the agreement. Revenue from product sales less
    related provisions for discounts, rebates and returns, as well
    as royalty revenues comprise net revenues in the consolidated
    statements of operations.

Royalties

The Company enters into license agreements with inventors,
    designers and others for the use of intellectual properties in
    its products. These agreements may call for payment in advance
    or future payment for minimum guaranteed amounts. Amounts paid
    in advance are recorded as an asset and charged to expense as
    revenue from the related products is recognized. If all or a
    portion of the minimum guaranteed amounts appear not to be
    recoverable through future use of the rights obtained under
    license, the nonrecoverable portion of the guaranty is charged
    to expense at that time.

Advertising

Production costs of commercials and programming are charged to
    operations in the fiscal year during which the production is
    first aired. The costs of other advertising, promotion and
    marketing programs are charged to operations in the fiscal year
    incurred.

Shipping
    and Handling

Hasbro expenses costs related to the shipment and handling of
    goods to customers as incurred. For 2007, 2006, and 2005, these
    costs were $167,868, $145,729 and $144,953, respectively, and
    are included in selling, distribution and administration
    expenses.

Operating
    Leases

Hasbro records lease expense in such a manner as to recognize
    this expense on a straight-line basis inclusive of rent
    concessions and rent increases. Reimbursements from lessors for
    leasehold improvements are deferred and recognized as a
    reduction to lease expense over the lease term.

Income
    Taxes

Hasbro uses the asset and liability approach for financial
    accounting and reporting of income taxes. Deferred income taxes
    have not been provided on the majority of undistributed earnings
    of international subsidiaries as the majority of such earnings
    are indefinitely reinvested by the Company.

On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation
    No. 48 (“FIN 48”), which applies to all tax
    positions accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”.
    FIN 48 prescribes a two step process for the measurement of
    uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to
    be taken in a tax return. The first step is a determination of
    whether the tax position should be recognized in the financial
    statements. The second step determines the measurement of the
    tax position. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
    derecognition of such tax positions, classification, potential
    interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and
    disclosure. The Company records potential interest and penalties
    on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.
    See note 8 for further information regarding the adoption
    of FIN 48.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into
    U.S. dollars at period-end rates, and revenues, costs and
    expenses are translated at weighted average rates during each
    reporting period. Earnings include gains or losses resulting
    from foreign currency transactions and, when required,
    translation gains and losses resulting from the use of the
    U.S. dollar as the functional currency in highly
    inflationary economies. Other gains and losses resulting from
    translation of financial statements are a component of other
    comprehensive earnings.

Pension
    Plans, Postretirement and Postemployment
    Benefits

Hasbro, except for certain international subsidiaries, has
    pension plans covering substantially all of its full-time
    employees. Pension expense is based on actuarial computations of
    current and future benefits. In December 2006, the Company
    adopted the recognition provisions of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans” (“SFAS 158”), which amends
    SFAS 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). In 2007, the Company adopted
    the measurement date provisions of SFAS 158, which required
    the Company to change the measurement date of certain of its
    defined benefit plans to the Company’s fiscal year-end
    date. Previously, the measurement date for certain of



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

the Company’s defined benefit plans was September 30.
    See notes 2 and 11 for the impact of adopting of this
    statement.

The Company’s policy is to fund amounts which are required
    by applicable regulations and which are tax deductible. In 2008,
    the Company expects to contribute approximately $9,200 to its
    pension plans. The estimated amounts of future payments to be
    made under other retirement programs are being accrued currently
    over the period of active employment and are also included in
    pension expense.

Hasbro has a contributory postretirement health and life
    insurance plan covering substantially all employees who retire
    under any of its United States defined benefit pension plans and
    meet certain age and length of service requirements. It also has
    several plans covering certain groups of employees, which may
    provide benefits to such employees following their period of
    employment but prior to their retirement. The Company measures
    the costs of these obligations based on actuarial computations.

Risk
    Management Contracts

Hasbro uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the
    impact of adverse currency rate fluctuations on firmly committed
    and projected future foreign currency transactions. These
    over-the-counter contracts, which hedge future purchases of
    inventory and other cross-border currency requirements not
    denominated in the functional currency of the unit, are
    primarily denominated in United States and Hong Kong dollars,
    Euros and United Kingdom pound sterling and are entered into
    with counterparties who are major financial institutions. The
    Company believes that any default by a counterparty would not
    have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the
    Company. Hasbro does not enter into derivative financial
    instruments for speculative purposes.

At the inception of the contracts, Hasbro designates its
    derivatives as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The
    Company formally documents all relationships between hedging
    instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management
    objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge
    transactions. All hedges designated as cash flow hedges are
    linked to forecasted transactions and the Company assesses, both
    at the inception of the hedge and on an on-going basis, the
    effectiveness of the derivatives used in hedging transactions in
    offsetting changes in the cash flows of the forecasted
    transaction. The ineffective portion of a hedging derivative, if
    any, is immediately recognized in the consolidated statements of
    operations.

The Company records all derivatives, such as foreign currency
    exchange contracts, on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes
    in the derivative fair values that are designated effective and
    qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred and recorded as a
    component of AOCE until the hedged transactions occur and are
    then recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.
    The Company’s foreign currency contracts hedging
    anticipated cash flows are designated as cash flow hedges. When
    it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a
    hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively.
    Any gain or loss deferred through that date remains in AOCE
    until the forecasted transaction occurs, at which time it is
    reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations. To
    the extent the transaction is no longer deemed probable of
    occurring, hedge accounting treatment is discontinued and
    amounts deferred would be reclassified to the consolidated
    statements of operations. In the event hedge accounting
    requirements are not met, gains and losses on such instruments
    are included currently in the consolidated statements of
    operations. The Company uses derivatives to economically hedge
    intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies. Due to the
    short-term nature of the derivative contracts involved, the
    Company does not use hedge accounting for these contracts.

The Company also uses interest rate swap agreements to adjust
    the amount of long-term debt subject to fixed interest rates.
    The interest rate swaps are matched with specific long-term debt
    obligations and are designated and effective as fair value
    hedges of the change in fair value of those debt obligations.
    These



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

agreements are recorded at their fair value as an asset or
    liability. Gains and losses on these contracts are included
    currently in the consolidated statements of operations and are
    wholly offset by changes in the fair value of the related
    long-term debt. These hedges are considered to be perfectly
    effective under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities,” as amended by Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 138 (collectively
    “SFAS 133”). The interest rate swap contracts are
    with major financial institutions in order to minimize
    counterparty credit risk. The Company believes that any default
    by a counterparty would not have a material adverse effect on
    the financial condition of the Company.

Accounting
    for Stock-Based Compensation

At December 30, 2007, the Company had stock-based employee
    compensation plans and plans for non-employee members of the
    Company’s Board of Directors, which are described more
    fully in note 10. Effective December 26, 2005, the
    first day of fiscal 2006, the Company adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),
    “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123R”),
    which amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123, as amended by No. 148, and Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, “Statement of
    Cash Flows” (collectively “SFAS 123”). The
    Company adopted SFAS 123R under the modified prospective
    basis as defined in the statement. In 2006, the Company recorded
    stock option expense based on all unvested stock options as of
    the adoption date as well as all stock-based compensation awards
    granted subsequent to the adoption date. See footnote 10 for
    further information related to the adoption of this statement.
    Prior to 2006, as permitted by SFAS 123, Hasbro accounted
    for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles
    of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
    “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”, and
    related interpretations. As required by the Company’s
    existing stock plans, stock options are granted at or above the
    fair market value of the Company’s common stock and,
    accordingly, no compensation expense was recognized for these
    grants in the consolidated statements of operations prior to
    fiscal 2006. Had compensation expense been recorded under the
    fair value method as set forth in the provisions of
    SFAS 123 for stock options awarded, the Company’s
    2005 net earnings would have decreased by $15,078 to
    $196,997 and basic and diluted EPS would have been $1.10 and
    $1.01, respectively.

Net
    Earnings Per Common Share

Basic net earnings per share is computed by dividing net
    earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding
    for the year. Diluted net earnings per share is similar except
    that the weighted average number of shares outstanding is
    increased by dilutive securities, and net earnings are adjusted
    for certain amounts related to dilutive securities. Dilutive
    securities include shares issuable under convertible debt, as
    well as shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and
    warrants for which market price exceeds exercise price, less
    shares which could have been purchased by the Company with the
    related proceeds. Dilutive securities may also include shares
    potentially issuable to settle liabilities. Options and warrants
    totaling 3,250, 5,148 and 6,018 for 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted
    earnings per share because to include them would have been
    antidilutive.

04-8,

“The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on
    Diluted Earnings per Share”, the net earnings per share
    calculations for the three years ended December 30, 2007
    include adjustments to add back to earnings the interest
    expense, net of tax, incurred on the Company’s Senior
    Convertible Debentures due 2021, as well as to add back to
    outstanding shares the amount of shares potentially issuable as
    if the contingent conversion features were met. See note 7
    for further information on the contingent conversion feature.

Certain warrants containing a put feature that may be settled in
    cash or common stock were required to be accounted for as a
    liability at fair value. These warrants were repurchased by the
    Company in May of 2007. Prior to their repurchase, the Company
    was required to assess if these warrants, classified as a
    liability, had a more dilutive impact on earnings per share when
    treated as an equity contract. For the years ended
    December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, the warrants
    had a more dilutive impact on earnings per share assuming they
    were treated as a liability and no adjustments to net earnings
    or equivalent shares was required. For the year ended
    December 25, 2005, the warrants had a more dilutive impact
    on earnings per share assuming they were treated as an equity
    contract. Accordingly for 2005, the numerator includes an
    adjustment to net earnings for the income included therein
    related to the fair market value adjustment and the denominator
    includes an adjustment for the shares issuable as of that date.

Reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive earnings
    to earnings in 2007, 2006 and 2005 were net of related income
    taxes of $1,412, $85, and $89, respectively. The
    reclassification adjustment for 2007 includes a realized gain of
    $(664) on the sale of available-for-sale securities and
    amortization, net of tax, of unrecognized pension and
    postretirement amounts of $2,099. The reclassification
    adjustment for 2006 includes an impairment charge relating to
    other than temporary decreases in the value of the
    Company’s

available-for-sale

securities. In accordance with Hasbro’s marketable
    securities accounting policy, as the result of the decline in
    the fair value of the Company’s investment in Infogrames
    Entertainment SA common stock, the Company adjusted the basis of
    this investment and recorded a pretax charge to earnings in the
    amount of $2,629 in 2006. The remainder of the reclassification
    adjustments in 2007 and 2006, as well as the 2005
    reclassification adjustment, include net losses on cash flow
    hedging derivatives for which the related transaction has
    impacted earnings and was reflected in cost of sales.

The related tax benefit (expense) of other comprehensive
    earnings items was $16,064, $273, and $3,960 for the years 2007,
    2006, and 2005, respectively.

In the first quarter of 2007, in accordance with
    SFAS No. 158, the Company changed its measurement date
    for certain of its defined benefit pension plans and its
    postretirement plan from September 30 to the Company’s
    fiscal year-end date. As a result of this change, the assets and
    liabilities of these plans were remeasured as of
    December 31, 2006, the 2006 fiscal year end date of the
    Company. This remeasurement resulted in an adjustment to
    accumulated other comprehensive earnings of $7,779 net of
    taxes of $4,765, during the first quarter of 2007.

At December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the recognition
    provisions of SFAS 158, which required the Company to
    recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and
    postretirement plans as an asset or liability in its statement
    of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded
    status in the year in which the changes occur through
    comprehensive income. The adoption of this statement resulted in
    an adjustment of $(26,750) to accumulated other comprehensive
    income at December 31, 2006.

Goodwill
    and Intangibles

Goodwill and certain intangible assets relating to rights
    obtained in the Company’s acquisition of
    Milton Bradley in 1984 and Tonka in 1991 are not amortized.
    These rights were determined to have indefinite lives and total
    approximately $75,700. The Company’s other intangible
    assets are amortized over their remaining useful lives, and
    accumulated amortization of these other intangibles is reflected
    in other intangibles, net in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheets.

The Company performs an annual impairment test for goodwill and
    intangible assets with indefinite lives. This annual impairment
    test is performed in the fourth quarter of the Company’s
    fiscal year. In addition, if an event occurs or circumstances
    change that indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable, the Company will perform an interim impairment test
    at that time. For the three fiscal years ended December 30,
    2007, no such events occurred. The Company completed its annual
    impairment tests in the fourth quarters of 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    which indicated that there was no impairment.

A portion of the Company’s goodwill and other intangible
    assets reside in the Corporate segment of the business. For
    purposes of testing pursuant to Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets”, these assets are allocated to the
    reporting units within the Company’s operating

In July 2007, with the exception of rights to
    DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, the Company reacquired the
    remaining digital gaming rights for its owned or controlled
    properties held by Infogrames Entertainment SA (Infogrames). The
    acquisition price of $19,000 included $18,000 in cash and $1,000
    of non-cash consideration in the form of the return of
    39 shares of preferred stock held by the Company in a
    subsidiary of Infogrames. These rights were previously held by
    Infogrames on an exclusive basis as a result of a license
    agreement. The consideration to reacquire these rights, which
    represents fair value, is included as a component of other
    intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheet and is being
    amortized over a period of approximately 5 years.

The Company will continue to incur amortization expense related
    to the use of acquired and licensed rights to produce various
    products. The amortization of these product rights will
    fluctuate depending on related projected revenues during an
    annual period, as well as rights reaching the end of their
    useful lives. The Company currently estimates continuing
    amortization expense for the next five years to be approximately:

    purchase price, which may be subject to further adjustment,
    totaled approximately $69,000.

Financing
    Arrangements

Short-Term
    Borrowings

At December 30, 2007, Hasbro had available an unsecured
    committed line and unsecured uncommitted lines of credit from
    various banks approximating $300,000 and $194,100, respectively.
    All of the short-term borrowings outstanding at the end of 2007,
    and a significant portion of the short-term borrowings
    outstanding at the end of 2006, represent borrowings made under,
    or supported by, these lines of credit. The weighted average
    interest rates of the outstanding borrowings as of
    December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006 were 5.5% and
    4.7%, respectively. The Company had no borrowings outstanding
    under its committed line of credit at December 30, 2007.
    During 2007, Hasbro’s working capital needs were fulfilled
    by cash generated from operations, the Company’s accounts
    receivable securitization program, and borrowings under lines of
    credit. Borrowings under the lines of credit were on terms and
    at interest rates generally extended to companies of comparable
    creditworthiness.

The unsecured committed line (the “Agreement”)
    provides the Company with a $300,000 committed borrowing
    facility through June 2011. The Company has the ability to
    request increases in the committed facility in additional
    increments of at least $50,000, up to a total committed facility
    of $500,000. The Agreement contains certain financial covenants
    setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain
    other limitations typical of an investment grade facility,
    including with respect to liens, mergers and incurrence of
    indebtedness. The Company was in compliance with all covenants
    as of and for the year ended December 30, 2007.

The Company pays a commitment fee (0.10% as of December 30,
    2007) based on the unused portion of the facility and
    interest equal to LIBOR or Prime plus a spread on borrowings
    under the facility. The commitment fee and the amount of the
    spread to LIBOR or Prime both vary based on the Company’s
    long-term debt ratings and the Company’s leverage. At
    December 30, 2007, the interest rate under the facility was
    equal to LIBOR plus 0.50% or Prime.

Securitization

The Company is party to a receivable securitization program
    whereby the Company sells, on an ongoing basis, substantially
    all of its U.S. trade accounts receivable to a
    bankruptcy-remote, special purpose subsidiary, Hasbro
    Receivables Funding, LLC (HRF), which is wholly-owned and
    consolidated by the Company. HRF will, subject to certain
    conditions, sell, from time to time on a revolving basis, an
    undivided fractional ownership interest in up to $250,000 of
    eligible domestic receivables to various multi-party commercial
    paper conduits supported by a committed liquidity facility.
    During the period from the first day of October fiscal month
    through the last day of the following January fiscal month, this
    limit is increased to $300,000. Under the terms of the
    agreement, new receivables are added to the pool as collections
    reduce previously held receivables. The Company expects to
    service, administer, and collect the receivables on behalf of
    HRF and the conduits. The net proceeds of sale will be less than
    the face amount of accounts receivable sold by an amount that
    approximates the purchaser’s financing costs.

The receivables facility contains certain restrictions on the
    Company and HRF that are customary for facilities of this type.
    The commitments under the facility are subject to termination
    prior to their term upon the occurrence of certain events,
    including payment defaults, breach of covenants, breach of
    representations or warranties, bankruptcy, and failure of the
    receivables to satisfy certain performance criteria.

As of December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006 the
    utilization of the receivables facility was $250,000. As of
    December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006 the Company
    had an additional $16,550 and $50,000, respectively, available
    to sell under the facility. The transactions are accounted for
    as sales under SFAS 140. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the
    loss on the sale of the receivables totaled $7,982, $2,241 and
    $6,925, respectively, which is recorded in selling, distribution
    and administration expenses in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of operations. The discount on interests sold is
    approximately equal to the interest rate paid by the conduits to
    the holders of the commercial paper plus other fees. The
    discount rate as of December 30, 2007 was approximately
    5.78%.

Upon sale to the conduits, HRF continues to hold a subordinated
    retained interest in the receivables. The subordinated interest
    in receivables is recorded at fair value, which is determined
    based on the present value of future expected cash flows
    estimated using management’s best estimates of credit
    losses and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved.
    Due to the short-term nature of trade receivables, the carrying
    amount, less allowances, approximates fair value. Variations in
    the credit and discount assumptions would not significantly
    impact fair value.

The Company had a warrant amendment agreement with Lucasfilm
    Ltd. and Lucas Licensing Ltd. (together “Lucas”) that
    provided the Company with a call option through October 13,
    2016 to purchase the warrants from Lucas for a price to be paid
    at the Company’s election of either $200,000 in cash or the
    equivalent of $220,000 in shares of the Company’s common
    stock, such stock being valued at the time of the exercise of
    the option. Also, the warrant amendment agreement provided Lucas
    with a put option through January 2008 to sell all of these
    warrants to the Company for a price to be paid at the
    Company’s election of either $100,000 in cash or the
    equivalent of $110,000 in shares of the Company’s common
    stock, such stock being valued at the time of the exercise of
    the option. In May 2007 the Company exercised its call option to
    repurchase all of the outstanding warrants for the
    Company’s common stock held by Lucas and paid $200,000 in
    cash and repurchased the warrants. At the time of the call Lucas
    held exercisable warrants to purchase an aggregate of
    15,750 shares of the Company’s common stock.

Prior to exercising the call option, the Company adjusted these
    warrants to their fair value through earnings at the end of each
    reporting period. During 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded
    other expense of $44,370 and $31,770, respectively, and during
    2005 the Company recorded other income of $(2,080) to adjust the
    warrants to their fair value. These amounts are included in
    other (income) expense, net in the consolidated statement of
    operations. There was no tax benefit or expense associated with
    these fair value adjustments.

In September 2007 the Company issued $350,000 of notes that are
    due in 2017 (the “Notes”). The Notes bear interest at
    a rate of 6.30%, which may be adjusted upward in the event that
    the Company’s credit rating from Moody’s Investor
    Services, Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings
    Services or Fitch Ratings is decreased two levels below the
    Company’s credit ratings on the date of issuance of the
    Notes. From the date of issuance through December 30, 2007,
    the Company’s ratings from Moody’s Investor Services,
    Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and
    Fitch Ratings were BBB, Baa2 and BBB, respectively. The interest
    rate adjustment is dependent on the degree of decrease of the
    Company’s ratings and could range from 0.25% to a maximum
    of 2%. The Company may redeem the Notes at its option at the
    greater of the principal amount of the Notes or the present
    value of the remaining scheduled payments discounted using the
    effective interest rate on applicable U.S. Treasury bills
    at the time of repurchase.

The Company currently has $249,828 outstanding in principal
    amount of contingent convertible debentures due 2021. These
    debentures bear interest at 2.75%, which could be subject to an
    upward adjustment depending on the price of the Company’s
    stock. If the closing price of the Company’s stock exceeds
    $23.76 for at least 20 trading days, within the 30 consecutive
    trading day period ending on the last trading day of the
    calendar quarter, the holders have the right to convert the
    notes to shares of the Company’s common stock at the
    initial conversion price of $21.60 in the next calendar quarter.
    At December 30, 2007, this contingent conversion feature
    was met and the debentures are convertible through
    March 31, 2008, at which time the requirements of the
    contingent conversion feature will be reevaluated. In addition,
    if the closing price of the Company’s stock exceeds $27.00
    for at least 20 trading days in any thirty day period, the
    Company has the right to call the debentures by giving notice to
    the holders of the debentures. During a



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

prescribed notice period, the holders of the debentures have the
    right to convert their debentures in accordance with the
    conversion terms described above. The holders of these
    debentures may also put the notes back to Hasbro in December
    2011 and December 2016. At these times, the purchase price may
    be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the
    two, at the discretion of the Company.

In 2006, the Company repaid in principal amount $32,743 of
    8.50% notes due in March 2006.

The Company is a party to interest rate swap agreements in order
    to adjust the amount of total debt that is subject to fixed
    interest rates. The interest rate swaps are matched with
    specific long-term debt obligations and accounted for as fair
    value hedges of those debt obligations. At December 30,
    2007, these interest rate swaps had a total notional amount of
    $75,000 with maturities in 2008. In each of the contracts, the
    Company receives payments based upon a fixed interest rate that
    matches the interest rate of the debt being hedged and makes
    payments based upon a floating rate based on LIBOR. These
    contracts are designated and effective as hedges of the change
    in the fair value of the associated debt. At December 30,
    2007, these contracts had unrealized gains of $256, which were
    included in other current assets, with a corresponding fair
    value adjustment to increase the current portion of long-term
    debt.

During 2007, the Company designated $90,000 of current year
    international net earnings that will not be indefinitely
    reinvested outside of the U.S. The incremental income tax
    on this amount, representing the difference between the
    U.S. federal income tax rate and the income tax rates in
    the applicable international jurisdictions, is a component of
    deferred income tax expense.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
    (the “Act”) was signed into law. The Act created a
    one-time incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate
    undistributed earnings from their international subsidiaries by
    providing an 85% dividends-received deduction for certain
    international earnings. The deduction was available to
    corporations during the tax year that includes October 22,
    2004 or in the immediately subsequent tax year. In the fourth
    quarter of 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors approved
    a plan to repatriate approximately $547,000 in foreign earnings,
    which was completed in December 2005. The tax expense related to
    this repatriation was $25,844.

Hasbro has a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets at
    December 30, 2007 of $36,254, which is an increase of
    $8,446 from $27,808 at December 31, 2006. The valuation
    allowance pertains to United States and International loss
    carryforwards, some of which have no expiration and others that
    would expire beginning in 2008. The increase in the valuation
    allowance is primarily attributable to the additional deferred
    tax assets related to potential capital losses. If the operating
    loss carryforwards are fully realized, $158 will reduce goodwill
    and the balance will reduce future income tax expense.

Based on Hasbro’s history of taxable income and the
    anticipation of sufficient taxable income in years when the
    temporary differences are expected to become tax deductions, it
    believes that it will realize the benefit of the deferred tax
    assets, net of the existing valuation allowance.

Deferred income taxes of $53,040 and $83,854 at the end of 2007
    and 2006, respectively, are included as a component of prepaid
    expenses and other current assets, and $45,855 and $66,276,
    respectively, are included as a component of other assets. At
    the same dates, deferred income taxes of $81 and $122,
    respectively, are included as a component of accrued
    liabilities, and $1,683 and $1,839, respectively, are included
    as a component of other liabilities.

On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FIN 48, which
    applies to all tax positions accounted for under Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting
    for Income Taxes”. FIN 48 prescribes a two step
    process for the measurement of uncertain tax positions that have
    been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return. The
    first step is a determination of whether the tax position should
    be recognized in the



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

financial statements. The second step determines the measurement
    of the tax position. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
    derecognition of such tax positions, classification, potential
    interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and
    disclosure. The adoption of FIN 48 resulted in a $88,798
    decrease in current liabilities, a $85,773 increase in long-term
    liabilities, a $5,333 increase to the long-term deferred tax
    assets and a $8,358 increase to retained earnings.

A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding
    potential interest and penalties, for the fiscal year ended
    December 30, 2007 is as follows:

If the $58,855 is recognized, approximately $51,500 would
    decrease the effective tax rate in the period in which each of
    the benefits is recognized. Of the remaining amount, $5,700
    would reduce intangible assets while the remainder would be
    offset by the reversal of related deferred tax assets.

During 2007, the Company recognized $4,628 of potential interest
    and penalties, which are included as a component of income tax
    in the accompanying statement of operations. At
    December 30, 2007, the Company had accrued potential
    interest and penalties of $12,020.

The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the
    United States and various state and international jurisdictions.
    In the normal course of business, the Company is regularly
    audited by U.S. federal, state and local and international
    tax authorities in various tax jurisdictions. The Company is no
    longer subject to U.S. federal tax examinations for years
    before 2004. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer
    subject to U.S. state or local and

non-U.S. income

tax examinations by tax authorities in its major jurisdictions
    for years before 2002. Of the $27,321 of decreases related to
    expirations of statutes of limitations noted above, $26,982
    relates to the recently completed examinations of the 2002 and
    2003 U.S. federal income tax returns. Including the
    reversal of $7,710 of potential interest, the Company recognized
    $34,692 of previously unrecognized tax benefits during 2007,
    primarily related to the deductibility of certain expenses and
    tax treatment of certain subsidiary and other transactions. Of
    this amount, $29,619 was recorded as a reduction of income tax
    expense, $2,932 was recorded as a reduction of deferred tax
    assets, and $2,141 was recorded as a decrease to other
    intangibles.

The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has recently commenced an
    examination related to the 2004 and 2005 U.S. federal
    income tax returns. The Company is also under income tax
    examination in Mexico and in several other state and foreign
    jurisdictions. The ultimate resolution of the U.S. and
    Mexican examinations, including matters that may be resolved
    within the next twelve months, is not yet determinable. Upon the
    settlements of other examinations in various tax jurisdictions
    and the expiration of several statutes of limitation, the
    Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the
    unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest may
    decrease by up to approximately $3,500 in the next
    12 months.

The cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of Hasbro’s
    international subsidiaries held for reinvestment is
    approximately $744,000 at December 30, 2007. In the event
    that all international undistributed earnings were remitted to
    the United States, the amount of incremental taxes would be
    approximately $154,000.

Capital
    Stock

Preference
    Share Purchase Rights

Hasbro maintains a Preference Share Purchase Rights Plan (the
    “Rights Plan”). Under the terms of the Rights Plan,
    each share of common stock is accompanied by a Preference Share
    Purchase Right (“Right”). Each Right is only
    exercisable under certain circumstances and, until exercisable,
    the Rights are not transferable apart from Hasbro’s common
    stock. When exercisable, each Right will entitle its holder to
    purchase until June 30, 2009, in certain merger or other
    business combination or recapitalization transactions, at the
    Right’s then current exercise price, a number of the
    acquiring company’s or Hasbro’s, as the case may be,
    common shares having a market value at that time of twice the
    Right’s exercise price. Under certain circumstances, the
    Company may substitute cash, other assets, equity securities or
    debt securities for the common stock. At the option of the Board
    of Directors of Hasbro (“the Board”), the rightholder
    may, under certain circumstances, receive shares of
    Hasbro’s stock in exchange for Rights.

Prior to the acquisition by a person or group of beneficial
    ownership of a certain percentage of Hasbro’s common stock,
    the Rights are redeemable for $0.01 per Right. The Rights Plan
    contains certain exceptions with respect to the Hassenfeld
    family and related entities.

Common
    Stock

In August 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
    the repurchase of up to $500,000 in common stock after two
    previous authorizations dated May 2005 and July 2006 of $350,000
    each were fully utilized. Purchases of the Company’s common
    stock may be made from time to time, subject to market
    conditions, and may be made in the open market or through
    privately negotiated transactions. The Company has no obligation
    to repurchase shares under the authorization and the timing,
    actual number, and the value of the shares which are repurchased
    will depend on a number of factors, including the price of the
    Company’s common stock. This authorization replaces all
    prior authorizations. In 2007, the Company repurchased
    20,795 shares at an average price of $28.20. The total cost
    of these repurchases, including transaction costs, was $587,004.
    At December 30, 2007, $109,601 remained under this
    authorization.

Subsequent to December 30, 2007, the Company’s Board
    of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional
    $500,000 in common stock.

Stock
    Options, Other Stock Awards and Warrants

Hasbro has reserved 21,997 shares of its common stock for
    issuance upon exercise of options and the grant of other awards
    granted or to be granted under stock incentive plans for
    employees and for non-employee members of the Board of Directors
    (collectively, the “plans”). These options generally
    vest in equal annual amounts over three to five years. The plans
    provide that options be granted at exercise prices not less than
    fair market value on the date the option is granted and options
    are adjusted for such changes as stock splits and stock
    dividends. Generally, options are exercisable for periods of no
    more than ten years after date of grant. Certain of the plans
    permit the granting of awards in the form of stock options,
    stock appreciation rights, stock awards and cash awards in
    addition to options. Upon exercise in the case of stock options,
    grant in the case of restricted stock or vesting in the case of
    performance based contingent stock grants, shares are issued out
    of available treasury shares.

The Company on occasion will issue restricted stock and grant
    deferred restricted stock units to certain key employees. In
    2007 and 2006, the Company issued restricted stock and
    restricted stock units of 12 and 20 shares, respectively.
    No restricted stock or deferred restricted stock awards were
    granted in 2005. These shares or units are nontransferable and
    subject to forfeiture for periods prescribed by the Company.
    These awards are valued at the market value at the date of grant
    and are subsequently amortized over the periods

during which the restrictions lapse, generally 3 years.
    Compensation expense recognized relating to the outstanding
    restricted stock and deferred restricted stock was $183, $158,
    and $74 in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. At
    December 30, 2007, the amount of total unrecognized
    compensation cost related to restricted stock is $431 and the
    weighted average period over which this will be expensed is
    25 months.

In 2007 and 2006, as part of its annual equity grant to
    executive officers and certain other employees, the
    Company’s Board of Directors approved the issuance of
    contingent stock performance awards (the “Stock Performance
    Awards”). These awards provide the recipients with the
    ability to earn shares of the Company’s Common Stock based
    on the Company’s achievement of stated cumulative diluted
    earnings per share and cumulative net revenue targets over the
    three fiscal years ended December 2009 for the 2007 award, and
    over a ten quarter period beginning July 3, 2006 and ending
    December 2008 for the 2006 award. Each Stock Performance Award
    has a target number of shares of Common Stock associated with
    such award which may be earned by the recipient if the Company
    achieves the stated diluted earnings per share and revenue
    targets. The ultimate amount of the award may vary, depending on
    actual results, from 0% to 125% of the target number of shares.
    The Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of
    Directors has discretionary power to reduce the amount of the
    award regardless of whether the stated targets are met. If the
    Company achieves 100% of the stated targets, it would expect to
    issue 1,194 shares under these awards.

Information with respect to Stock Performance Awards for 2007
    and 2006 is as follows, assuming the Company achieves 100% of
    the stated targets:

During 2007 and 2006, the Company recognized $11,122 and $2,390,
    respectively, of expense relating to these awards. If minimum
    targets, as detailed under the award, are not met, no additional
    compensation cost will be recognized and any previously
    recognized compensation cost will be reversed. These awards were
    valued at the market value at the dates of grant and are being
    amortized over the three fiscal years ending December 2009
    and over the 10 quarter period from July 3, 2006 through
    December 2008 for the 2007 and 2006 awards, respectively.
    At December 30, 2007, the amount of total unrecognized
    compensation cost related to these awards is approximately
    $16,664 and the weighted average period over which this will be
    expensed is 19.42 months.

Prior to fiscal 2006, Hasbro used the intrinsic-value method of
    accounting for stock options granted to employees and
    non-employee members of the Board of Directors. Effective
    December 26, 2005, the first day of fiscal 2006, the
    Company adopted SFAS 123R under the modified prospective
    transition method as defined in the statement. Under this
    adoption method, the Company recorded stock option expense in
    2006 based on all unvested stock options as of the adoption date
    and any stock option awards made subsequent to the adoption
    date. Stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-line
    basis over the requisite service period of the award. In
    accordance with the modified prospective transition method, the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements for prior years
    have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the
    impact of SFAS 123R.

    and 4.37 years, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value
    of the options outstanding and exercisable at December 30,
    2007 was $81,670 and $64,205, respectively.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model in

The intrinsic values, which represent the difference between the
    fair market value on the date of exercise and the exercise price
    of the option, of the options exercised in fiscal 2007, 2006 and
    2005 were $54,629, $46,684 and $16,898, respectively.

At December 30, 2007, the amount of total unrecognized
    compensation cost related to stock options is $18,221 and the
    weighted average period over which this will be expensed is
    23.69 months.

In 2007 and 2006, the Company granted 31 and 52 shares of
    common stock, respectively, to its non-employee members of its
    Board of Directors. Of these shares, the receipt of
    19 shares from the 2007 grant and 43 shares from the
    2006 grant have been deferred to the date upon which the
    respective director ceases to be a member of the Company’s
    Board of Directors. These awards were valued at the market value
    at the date of grant and vested upon grant. In connection with
    this grant, compensation cost of $990 was recorded in both 2007
    and 2006.

In 2007 certain warrants previously issued by the Company
    allowing for the purchase of 1,700 shares of the
    Company’s common stock, with a weighted average exercise
    price of approximately $16.99, were exercised. The holder of the
    warrants elected to settle the warrants through a non-cash net
    share settlement, resulting in the issuance of 779 shares.
    If the holder had not elected net share settlement, the Company
    would have received cash proceeds from the exercise totaling
    $28,888 and would have been required to issue 1,700 shares.

In addition, during 2007 the Company exercised its call option
    to repurchase warrants which allowed for the purchase of an
    aggregate of 15,750 shares of the Company’s common
    stock. See note 6 for further discussion.

Pension,
    Postretirement and Postemployment Benefits

Pension
    and Postretirement Benefits

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employer’s
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans”, (“SFAS No. 158”) which amends
    Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, 88,
    106 and 132R. Under SFAS No. 158, the Company is
    required to recognize on its balance sheet actuarial gains and
    losses and prior service costs that have not yet been included
    in income as an adjustment of equity through other comprehensive
    income with a corresponding adjustment to prepaid pension
    expense or the accrued pension liability. In addition, within
    two years of adoption, the measurement date for plan assets and
    liabilities would be required to be the Company’s fiscal
    year end. The recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158
    were effective for the Company in the fourth quarter of 2006.
    The effect of this statement in 2006 on the Company’s
    defined benefit pension and postretirement plans was an increase
    in accrued pension liability of $36,287, a decrease in
    intangible assets of $3,108, an increase in deferred tax assets
    of $12,645 and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive
    income, net of tax, of $26,750.

In accordance with SFAS No. 158, effective
    January 1, 2007, the Company elected to change the
    measurement date of certain of its defined benefit pension plans
    and the Company’s other postretirement plan from September
    30 to the Company’s fiscal year-end date, which was
    December 30, 2007. As a result of this election, the assets
    and liabilities of these plans were remeasured as of
    December 31, 2006. The remeasurement of the assets and
    liabilities resulted in an increase in the projected benefit
    obligation of $536 and an increase in the fair value of plan
    assets of $10,872. The impact of this accounting change was a
    reduction of retained earnings of $2,143, an increase to
    accumulated other comprehensive earnings of $7,779, a decrease
    in long-term accrued pension expense of $3,619, an increase in
    prepaid pension expense of $5,482, and a decrease in long-term
    deferred tax assets of $3,465.

Expense related to the Company’s defined benefit and
    defined contribution plans for 2007, 2006 and 2005 were
    approximately $25,900, $31,100, and $28,800, respectively. Of
    these amounts, $13,400, $15,400 and $13,900 related to defined
    contribution plans in the United States and certain
    international affiliates. The remainder of the expense relates
    to defined benefit plans discussed below.

United
    States Plans

Substantially all United States employees are covered under at
    least one of several non-contributory defined benefit pension
    plans maintained by the Company. Benefits under the two major
    plans which principally cover non-union employees, are based
    primarily on salary and years of service. One of these major
    plans is funded. Benefits under the remaining plans are based
    primarily on fixed amounts for specified years of service. Of
    these remaining plans, the plan covering union employees is also
    funded.

In 2007, for the two major plans covering its non-union
    employees, the Company froze benefits being accrued effective
    December 30, 2007. In connection with this, the Company
    recognized a reduction of its projected benefit obligation as a
    result of this curtailment of $18,499 and recorded a curtailment
    loss of $908. The pension benefit will be replaced by additional
    employer contributions to the Company’s defined
    contribution plan beginning in 2008.

At December 30, 2007, the measurement date, the fair value
    of the plan assets of the funded plans were in excess of those
    plans’ benefit obligations while the unfunded plans of the
    Company had an aggregate accumulated and projected benefit
    obligation of $45,052. At September 30, 2006, all
    individual plans had projected and accumulated benefit
    obligations in excess of the fair value of each plan’s
    assets.

Hasbro also provides certain postretirement health care and life
    insurance benefits to eligible employees who retire and have
    either attained age 65 with 5 years of service or
    age 55 with 10 years of service. The cost of providing
    these benefits on behalf of employees who retired prior to 1993
    is and will continue to be substantially borne by the Company.
    The cost of providing benefits on behalf of substantially all
    employees who retire after 1992 is borne by the employee. The
    plan is not funded. As noted above, in 2007, the Company adopted
    the measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158.

Reconciliations of the beginning and ending balances for the
    year ended December 30, 2007, the transition period related
    to the change in measurement date referred to above, and for the
    year ended December 31, 2006 for the projected benefit
    obligation and the fair value of plan assets are included below.

Hasbro’s two major funded plans (the “Plans”) are
    defined benefit pension plans intended to provide retirement
    benefits to participants in accordance with the benefit
    structure established by Hasbro, Inc. The Plans’ investment
    managers, who exercise full investment discretion within
    guidelines outlined in the Plans’ Investment Policy, are
    charged with managing the assets with the care, skill, prudence
    and diligence that a prudent investment professional in similar
    circumstance would exercise. Investment practices, at a minimum,
    must comply with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
    (ERISA) and any other applicable laws and regulations.

The Plans’ asset allocations are structured to meet a
    long-term targeted total return consistent with the ongoing
    nature of the Plans’ liabilities. The shared long-term
    total return goal, presently 8.75%, includes income plus
    realized and unrealized gains

and/or

losses on the Plans’ assets. Utilizing generally accepted
    diversification techniques, the Plans’ assets, in aggregate
    and at the individual portfolio level, are invested so that the
    total portfolio risk exposure and risk-adjusted returns best
    meet the Plans’ long-term liabilities to employees. In
    2007, the Company reevaluated its investment strategy and, as a
    result, decided to change the asset allocation in order to more
    closely align changes in the value of plan assets with changes
    in the value of plan liabilities. This change in strategy
    resulted in a transfer of assets into alternative investments
    designed to achieve a modest absolute return in addition to the
    return on an underlying asset class such as bond or equity
    indices. These alternative investments may use derivatives to
    gain market returns in an efficient and timely manner; however
    derivatives are not used to leverage the portfolio beyond the
    market value of the underlying assets. These alternative
    investments are included in other equity and fixed income at
    December 30, 2007. Plan asset allocations are reviewed at
    least quarterly and rebalanced to achieve target allocation
    among the asset categories when necessary.

The Plans’ investment managers are provided specific
    guidelines under which they are to invest the assets assigned to
    them. In general, investment managers are expected to remain
    fully invested in their asset class

with further limitations of risk as related to investments in a
    single security, portfolio turnover and credit quality.

With the exception of the alternative investment strategy
    mentioned above, the Plans’ Investment Policy restricts the
    use of derivatives associated with leverage or speculation. In
    addition, the Investment Policy also restricts investments in
    securities issued by Hasbro, Inc. except through index-related
    strategies (e.g. an S&P 500 Index Fund)

and/or

commingled funds. In addition, unless specifically approved by
    the Investment Committee (which is comprised of members of
    management, established by the Board to manage and control
    pension plan assets), certain securities, strategies, and
    investments are ineligible for inclusion within the Plans.

As noted above, in 2007, the Company adopted the measurement
    date provision of SFAS 158 and, accordingly, measured its
    liabilities and related assets at December 30. Prior to
    this, the Company measured its liabilities and related assets at
    September 30. The discount rates used in the pension
    calculation were also used for the postretirement calculation.

Hasbro works with external benefit investment specialists to
    assist in the development of the long-term rate of return
    assumptions used to model and determine the overall asset
    allocation. Forecast returns are based on the combination of
    historical returns, current market conditions and a forecast for
    the capital markets for the next 5-7 years. Approximately
    75% of the return assumption is based on the historical
    information and 25% is based on current or forward-looking
    information. All asset class assumptions are within certain
    bands around the long-term historical averages. Correlations are
    based primarily on historical return patterns.

    obligation at December 30, 2007 and the aggregate of the
    benefits earned during the period and the interest cost would
    have each increased by approximately 5%.

International
    Plans

Pension coverage for employees of Hasbro’s international
    subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate,
    through separate defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
    At December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, the
    defined benefit plans had total projected benefit obligations of
    $72,359 and $73,333, respectively, and fair values of plan
    assets of $55,881 and $55,429, respectively. Substantially all
    of the plan assets are invested in equity and fixed income
    securities. The pension expense related to these plans was
    $3,937, $3,702, and $3,073 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

In fiscal 2008, the Company expects amortization of $120 of
    prior service costs, $25 of unrecognized net losses and $52 of
    unrecognized transition obligation to be included as a component
    of net periodic benefit cost.

Expected benefit payments under the international defined
    benefit pension plans for the five years subsequent to 2007 and
    in the aggregate for the five years thereafter are as follows:
    2008: $1,115; 2009: $1,244; 2010: $1,482; 2011: $1,635; 2012:
    $2,398; and 2013 through 2017: $16,091.

Postemployment
    Benefits

Hasbro has several plans covering certain groups of employees,
    which may provide benefits to such employees following their
    period of active employment but prior to their retirement. These
    plans include certain severance plans which provide benefits to
    employees involuntarily terminated and certain plans which
    continue the Company’s health and life insurance
    contributions for employees who have left Hasbro’s employ
    under terms of its long-term disability plan.

Leases

Hasbro occupies certain offices and uses certain equipment under
    various operating lease arrangements. The rent expense under
    such arrangements, net of sublease income which is not material,
    for 2007, 2006, and 2005 amounted to $36,897, $34,603, and
    $35,570, respectively.

Minimum rentals, net of minimum sublease income, which is not
    material, under long-term operating leases for the five years
    subsequent to 2007 and in the aggregate thereafter are as
    follows: 2008: $27,236; 2009: $21,650; 2010: $10,828; 2011:
    $9,793; 2012: $7,262; and thereafter: $16,165.

All leases expire prior to the end of 2018. Real estate taxes,
    insurance and maintenance expenses are generally obligations of
    the Company. It is expected that in the normal course of
    business, leases that expire will be renewed or replaced by
    leases on other properties; thus, it is anticipated that future
    minimum lease commitments will not be less than the amounts
    shown for 2007.

In addition, Hasbro leases certain facilities which, as a result
    of restructurings, are no longer in use. Future costs relating
    to such facilities were accrued as a component of the original
    charge and are not included in minimum rental amounts above.

(13)

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Hasbro uses foreign currency forwards to reduce the impact of
    currency rate fluctuations on firmly committed and projected
    future foreign currency transactions. These instruments hedge
    anticipated inventory purchases and other cross-border
    transactions through 2010. At December 30, 2007, these
    contracts had unrealized losses of $10,437, of which $6,679 are
    recorded in accrued liabilities and $3,758 are recorded in other
    liabilities.

During 2007, 2006, and 2005, the Company reclassified net
    losses, net of tax, from other comprehensive income to earnings
    of $6,887, $1,448, and $2,005, respectively, which included
    gains (losses) of $(37), $(68), and $509, respectively, as the
    result of ineffectiveness.

The remaining balance in AOCE at December 30, 2007 of
    $11,080 represents a net unrealized loss on foreign currency
    contracts relating to hedges of inventory purchased during the
    fourth quarter of 2007 or forecasted to be purchased during 2008
    through 2010 and intercompany expenses and royalty payments
    expected to be paid or received during 2008 through 2010. These
    amounts will be transferred to the consolidated statement of
    operations upon the sale of the related inventory and receipt or
    payment of the related royalties and expenses. Of the amount
    included in AOCE at December 30, 2007, the Company expects
    approximately $7,100 to be reclassified to the consolidated
    statement of operations within the next 12 months.

The Company also enters into derivative instruments to offset
    changes in the fair value of intercompany loans due to the
    impact of foreign currency changes. The Company recorded a net
    loss on these instruments to other (income) expense, net of
    $2,098, $5,501, and $60,014 in 2007, 2006, and 2005,
    respectively, relating to the change in fair value of such
    derivatives, substantially offsetting gains from the change in
    fair value of intercompany loans to which the contracts relate
    included in other (income) expense, net.

(14)

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Hasbro had unused open letters of credit and related instruments
    of approximately $70,000 and $71,000 at December 30, 2007
    and December 31, 2006, respectively.

The Company enters into license agreements with inventors,
    designers and others for the use of intellectual properties in
    its products. Certain of these agreements contain provisions for
    the payment of guaranteed or minimum royalty amounts.
    Additionally, the Company has a long-term commitment related to



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

promotional and marketing activities at a U.S. based theme
    park. Under terms of existing agreements as of December 30,
    2007, Hasbro may, provided the other party meets their
    contractual commitment, be required to pay amounts as follows:
    2008: $18,354; 2009: $19,691; 2010: $44,645; and 2011: $5,125.

In addition to the above commitments, certain of the above
    contracts impose minimum marketing commitments on the Company.

The Company has $94,616 of prepaid royalties included as a
    component of prepaid expenses and other current assets in the
    balance sheet. The long-term portion of advances paid of $43,343
    is included in other assets. Advanced royalties paid and
    guaranteed or minimum royalties to be paid relate to anticipated
    revenues in the years 2008 through 2018.

At December 30, 2007, the Company had approximately
    $249,883 in outstanding purchase commitments.

Hasbro is party to certain legal proceedings, none of which,
    individually or in the aggregate, is deemed to be material to
    the financial condition of the Company.

(15)

Segment
    Reporting

Segment
    and Geographic Information

The Company has two main operating segments, North America and
    International. In addition, the Company has two other segments,
    Global Operations and an other segment that licenses out certain
    toy and game properties.

The North American segment includes the development, marketing
    and selling of boys’ action figures, vehicles and playsets,
    girls’ toys, electronic toys and games, plush products,
    preschool toys and infant products, electronic interactive
    products, tween electronic products, toy-related specialty
    products, traditional board games and puzzles, DVD- based games,
    fiction books, and trading card and role-playing games within
    the United States, Canada and Mexico. Within the International
    segment, the Company develops, markets and sells both toy and
    certain game products in non-North American markets, primarily
    the European, Asia Pacific, and Latin and South American
    regions. The Global Operations segment is responsible for
    manufacturing and sourcing finished product for the
    Company’s North American and International segments. The
    Company’s other segment licenses out certain toy and game
    properties.

Segment performance is measured at the operating profit level.
    Included in Corporate and eliminations are certain corporate
    expenses, the elimination of intersegment transactions and
    certain assets benefiting more than one segment. Intersegment
    sales and transfers are reflected in management reports at
    amounts approximating cost. Certain shared costs are allocated
    to segments based upon foreign exchange rates fixed at the
    beginning of the year, with adjustment to actual foreign
    exchange rates included in Corporate and eliminations.

In 2006 the Company adopted SFAS 123R, which requires the
    Company to record expense related to stock options in its
    consolidated financial statements. Consistent with
    management’s approach in evaluating segment results, the
    2005 segment operating profit (loss) has been adjusted to
    include stock-based compensation as disclosed under
    SFAS 123. The amount of 2005 stock option expense is
    subtracted from the total segment operating profit (loss) in
    order to reconcile to the operating profit in the consolidated
    financial statements.

With the exception of the treatment of stock-based compensation
    expense for 2005 management financial statements, the accounting
    policies of the segments are the same as those referenced in
    Note 1.

Results shown for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 are not
    necessarily those which would be achieved were each segment an
    unaffiliated business enterprise.

option compensation in 2006 related to unvested options as of
    that date as well as grants made in 2006. The Company did not
    restate any of the prior years but has adjusted the operating
    profit (loss) of each of its segments for 2005 to reflect
    compensation for that period based on the Company’s 2005
    pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123. As such, the above
    amounts represent the removal of the amounts included in the
    segment disclosures to reconcile to the 2005 reported
    consolidated operating profit for 2005. The $23,044 of 2005 pro

    North America, $4,309 to International, $1,774 to Global
    Operations and $1,544 to Other Segment.

During the 2007 fiscal year, revenues generated from the sale of
    TRANSFORMERS products accounted for 12.6% of consolidated net
    revenues. During 2005, revenues from STAR WARS related products
    accounted for 16% of consolidated net revenues. No other
    individual product lines accounted for 10% or more of
    consolidated net revenues in 2007 or 2005. No individual product
    lines accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net revenues
    during 2006.

Information as to Hasbro’s operations in different
    geographical areas is presented below on the basis the Company
    uses to manage its business. Net revenues are categorized based

Other
    Information

Hasbro markets its products primarily to customers in the retail
    sector. Although the Company closely monitors the
    creditworthiness of its customers, adjusting credit policies and
    limits as deemed appropriate, a



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

substantial portion of its customers’ ability to discharge
    amounts owed is generally dependent upon the overall retail
    economic environment.

Sales to the Company’s three largest customers, Wal-Mart
    Stores, Inc., Target Corporation and Toys “R” Us,
    Inc., amounted to 24%, 12% and 11%, respectively, of
    consolidated net revenues during 2007, 24%, 13% and 11% during
    2006 and 24%, 12% and 12% during 2005. These net revenues were
    primarily related to the North American segment.

Hasbro purchases certain components used in its manufacturing
    process and certain finished products from manufacturers in the
    Far East. The Company’s reliance on external sources of
    manufacturing can be shifted, over a period of time, to
    alternative sources of supply for products it sells, should such
    changes be necessary. However, if the Company were prevented
    from obtaining products from a substantial number of its current
    Far East suppliers due to political, labor or other factors
    beyond its control, the Company’s operations would be
    disrupted, potentially for a significant period of time, while
    alternative sources of product were secured. The imposition of
    trade sanctions by the United States or the European Union
    against a class of products imported by Hasbro from, or the loss
    of “normal trade relations” status by, the
    People’s Republic of China could significantly increase the
    cost of the Company’s products imported into the United
    States or Europe.

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as
    defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
    “Exchange Act”), that are designed to ensure that
    information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
    reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
    Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is
    accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,
    including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding

    under the supervision and with the participation of the

    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s

    procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls
    and procedures were effective.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting, as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

promulgated under the Exchange Act. Hasbro’s internal
    control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance
    regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
    preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
    Hasbro’s management assessed the effectiveness of its
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 30, 2007. In making its assessment, Hasbro’s
    management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (“COSO”) in “Internal Control-Integrated
    Framework”. Based on this assessment, Hasbro’s
    management concluded that, as of December 30, 2007, its
    internal control over financial reporting is effective based on
    those criteria. Hasbro’s independent registered public
    accounting firm has issued an audit report on internal control
    over financial reporting, which appears below.



Report
    of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Hasbro, Inc.:

We have audited Hasbro, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 30, 2007, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Hasbro, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 30, 2007, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Hasbro, Inc. and subsidiaries as
    of December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations,
    shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal
    years in the three-year period ended December 30, 2007, and
    our report dated February 26, 2008 expressed an unqualified
    opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
    Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Hasbro, Inc.:

Under date of February 26, 2008, we reported on the
    consolidated balance sheets of Hasbro, Inc. and subsidiaries as
    of December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations,
    shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal
    years in the three-year period ended December 30, 2007,
    which are included in the

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 30, 2007. Our report refers to
    a change in accounting for uncertain tax positions in 2007 and
    to a change in the accounting for pensions and other
    postretirement benefits other than pensions and to a change in
    the accounting for share-based payments in 2006. In connection
    with our audits of the aforementioned consolidated financial
    statements, we also audited the related consolidated financial
    statement schedule of Valuation and Qualifying Accounts in the

Form 10-K.

This financial statement schedule is the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on this financial statement schedule based on our audits.

In our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.
