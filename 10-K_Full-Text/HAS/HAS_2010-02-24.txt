Business

General
    Development and Description of Business and Business
    Segments

Except as expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise
    requires, as used herein, “Hasbro”, the
    “Company”, “we”, or “us”, means
    Hasbro, Inc., a Rhode Island corporation organized on
    January 8, 1926, and its subsidiaries. Unless otherwise
    specifically indicated, all dollar or share amounts herein are
    expressed in thousands of dollars or shares, except for per
    share amounts.

Overview

We are a worldwide leader in children’s and family leisure
    time products and services with a broad portfolio of brands and
    entertainment properties. As a brand-driven, consumer-focused
    global company, Hasbro brings to market a wide range of toys,
    games and licensed products, from traditional to high-tech and
    digital, under well-known brand names such as TRANSFORMERS,
    PLAYSKOOL, NERF, LITTLEST PET SHOP, MY LITTLE PONY, G.I. JOE,
    TONKA, MILTON BRADLEY, PARKER BROTHERS, CRANIUM and WIZARDS OF
    THE COAST. Our offerings encompass a broad variety of games,
    including traditional board, card, hand-held electronic, trading
    card, role-playing and DVD games, as well as electronic learning
    aids and puzzles. Toy offerings include boys’ action
    figures, vehicles and playsets, girls’ toys, electronic
    toys, plush products, preschool toys and infant products,
    electronic interactive products, creative play and toy related
    specialty products. In addition, we license certain of our
    trademarks, characters and other property rights to third
    parties for use in connection with digital gaming, consumer
    promotions, and for the sale of non-competing toys and games and
    non-toy products. We also seek to expand awareness of our brands
    through immersive entertainment experiences, including
    television and movies. In 2009 we purchased a 50% interest in a
    joint venture with Discovery Communications, Inc.
    (“Discovery”). This joint venture operates a
    television network in the United States dedicated to
    high-quality children’s and family entertainment and
    educational programming.

Product
    Categories

We market our brands under the following primary product
    categories: (1) boys’ toys; (2) games and
    puzzles; (3) girls’ toys; and (4) preschool toys.
    Descriptions of these product categories are as follows:

Our boys’ toys category includes a wide range of core brand
    offerings such as TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE action figures and
    accessories, NERF sports and action products, as well as
    entertainment-based licensed products based on popular movie,
    television and comic book characters, such as STAR WARS and
    MARVEL toys and accessories. In the action figure area, a key
    part of our strategy focuses on the importance of reinforcing
    the storyline associated with these products through the use of
    media-based entertainment. In 2009, sales in our boys’ toys
    category also benefited from major motion picture releases of

TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN

and

G.I. JOE: THE
    RISE OF COBRA

. In addition, STAR WARS, SPIDER-MAN and
    TRANSFORMERS products were each supported by animated television
    series. In 2010, the major motion picture

IRON MAN 2

is
    expected to be released based on the MARVEL character. In
    addition to marketing and developing action figures and
    accessories for traditional play, the Company also develops and
    markets products designed for collectors, which has been a key
    component of the success of the STAR WARS brand. Other key
    boys’ brands include TONKA and SUPERSOAKER.

Our games and puzzles category includes several well known
    brands, including MILTON BRADLEY, PARKER BROTHERS, TRIVIAL
    PURSUIT, CRANIUM, AVALON HILL and WIZARDS OF THE COAST. These
    brand portfolios consist of a broad assortment of games for
    children, tweens, families and adults. Core game brands include
    MONOPOLY, BATTLESHIP, GAME OF LIFE, SCRABBLE, CHUTES AND
    LADDERS, CANDY LAND, TROUBLE, MOUSETRAP, OPERATION, HUNGRY
    HUNGRY HIPPOS, CONNECT FOUR, TWISTER, YAHTZEE, CRANIUM, JENGA,
    SIMON, CLUE, SORRY!, RISK, BOGGLE, TRIVIAL PURSUIT, GUESS WHO?
    and BOP IT!, as well as a line of puzzles for children and
    adults, including the BIG BEN and CROXLEY lines of puzzles.
    WIZARDS OF THE COAST offers trading card and



role-playing games, including MAGIC: THE GATHERING, DUEL MASTERS
    and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. We seek to keep our game
    brands relevant through sustained marketing programs, such as
    FAMILY GAME NIGHT, as well as by offering consumers new ways to
    experience these brands.

In our girls’ toys category, we seek to provide a
    traditional and wholesome play experience. Girls’ toy
    brands include LITTLEST PET SHOP, MY LITTLE PONY, FURREAL
    FRIENDS, BABY ALIVE and STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE. In 2010, we will
    seek to expand the MY LITTLE PONY brand through television
    programming.

Our preschool toys category encompasses a range of products for
    infants and preschoolers in the various stages of development.
    Our preschool products include a portfolio of core brands
    marketed primarily under the PLAYSKOOL trademark. The PLAYSKOOL
    line includes such well-known products as MR. POTATO HEAD,
    WEEBLES, SIT ’N SPIN and GLOWORM, along with a successful
    line of infant toys including STEP START WALK N’ RIDE,
    2-IN-1 TUMMY TIME GYM and BUSY BALL POPPER. Through our
    preschool marketing programs, we seek to provide consumer
    friendly information that assists parents in understanding the
    developmental milestones their children will encounter as well
    as the role each PLAYSKOOL product can play in helping children
    to achieve these developmental milestones. In addition, our
    preschool category also includes certain TONKA lines of trucks
    and interactive toys and the PLAY-DOH brand. We recently entered
    into a ten-year agreement with Sesame Workshop that provides us
    with the licensed rights to produce products based upon the
    SESAME STREET portfolio of characters, including ELMO, BIG BIRD,
    and COOKIE MONSTER, among others, commencing in 2011.

Segments

Organizationally, our three principal segments are U.S. and
    Canada, International and Entertainment and Licensing. The
    U.S. and Canada and International segments engage in the
    marketing and selling of various toy and game products as listed
    above. Our toy, game and puzzle products are developed by a
    global development group. We also have a global marketing
    function which establishes brand direction and assists the
    segments in establishing certain local marketing programs. The
    costs of these groups are allocated to the principal segments.
    Our U.S. and Canada segment covers the United States and
    Canada while the International segment primarily includes
    Europe, the Asia Pacific region and Latin and South America. The
    Entertainment and Licensing segment engages in the out-licensing
    of our trademarks, characters and other brand and intellectual
    property rights to third parties for non-competing products and
    also conducts our movie, television and online entertainment
    operations. In addition, our Global Operations segment is
    responsible for arranging product manufacturing and sourcing for
    the U.S. and Canada and International segments. Financial
    information with respect to our segments and geographic areas is
    included in note 17 to our consolidated financial
    statements, which are included in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

The Company’s strategy is focused around re-imagining,
    re-inventing, and re-igniting its brands globally through the
    development and marketing of innovative toy and game products,
    providing immersive entertainment experiences for our consumers,
    and expansion of our brands into other consumer products. The
    following is a discussion of each segment.

U.S.
    and Canada

This segment engages in the marketing and sale of our product
    categories in the United States and Canada. The U.S. and
    Canada segment’s strategy is based on promoting our brands
    through innovation and reinvention of toys and games. This is
    accomplished through introducing new initiatives driven by
    consumer and marketplace insights and leveraging opportunistic
    toy and game lines and licenses. This strategy leverages off of
    efforts to increase consumer awareness of the Company’s
    core brands through entertainment experiences such as motion
    pictures, television and publishing. Major 2009 brands and
    products included TRANSFORMERS, LITTLEST PET SHOP, STAR WARS,
    NERF, MONOPOLY, PLAYSKOOL, PLAY-DOH, MARVEL products, MAGIC: THE
    GATHERING, G.I. JOE, MY LITTLE PONY and FURREAL FRIENDS.



International

The International segment engages in the marketing and sale of
    our product categories to retailers and wholesalers in most
    countries in Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin and South America
    and through distributors in those countries where we have no
    direct presence. In addition to growing core brands and
    leveraging opportunistic toy lines and licenses, we seek to grow
    our international business by continuing to expand into Eastern
    Europe and emerging markets in Asia and Latin and South America.
    In recent years, we expanded our operations in Brazil, China,
    Russia, the Czech Republic, Romania and Korea. We will continue
    to expand operations in emerging markets in future years through
    the establishment of subsidiaries or increased involvement with
    our existing distributors. Key international brands for 2009
    included TRANSFORMERS, LITTLEST PET SHOP, MONOPOLY, TRIVIAL
    PURSUIT, STAR WARS, PLAYSKOOL and MY LITTLE PONY.

Entertainment
    and Licensing

Our Entertainment and Licensing segment includes our lifestyle
    licensing, digital licensing, movie, television and online
    entertainment operations. Our lifestyle licensing category seeks
    to promote our brands through the out-licensing of our
    intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and
    merchandising uses in businesses which do not compete directly
    with our own product offerings, such as apparel, publishing,
    home goods and electronics.

Our digital licensing category seeks to promote our brands
    through the out-licensing of our intellectual properties in the
    digital area, such as for applications on mobile phones,
    personal computers, and video game consoles. This is primarily
    done through our long-term strategic alliance with Electronic
    Arts Inc. (“EA”), which provides EA with the exclusive
    worldwide rights to create digital games for all of these major
    platforms based on most of our toy and game intellectual
    properties.

As noted above, in 2009, we purchased a 50% interest in a joint
    venture with Discovery that operates a television network in the
    United States. This network is dedicated to providing
    high-quality children’s and family entertainment and
    educational programming. The network is expected to have
    approximately 60 million subscribers at relaunch. The
    rebranded network, THE HUB, is expected to launch in the fall of
    2010. To support this venture, we established a virtual
    television studio that will produce programming for the network
    as well as distribute this programming internationally. The
    programming will primarily be based on our brands, but will also
    include third-party branded content. The studio will have a
    coordinated development process that aligns with the network.

In addition to the above, we also seek to promote and leverage
    our brands through major motion pictures. In 2009,

TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN

and

G.I. JOE: THE
    RISE OF COBRA

were released based on our brands. We also
    have a long-term strategic relationship with Universal Pictures
    to produce at least three motion pictures based on certain of
    our core brands, with an option to produce two additional
    movies. The first movie under this relationship is expected to
    be released in 2012.

Promotion of our brands through major motion pictures and
    television programming provides our consumers with the ability
    to experience our brands in a different format which we believe
    can result in increased product sales, royalty revenues, and
    overall brand awareness. To a lesser extent, we can also earn
    revenue from our participation in the financial results of
    motion pictures and related DVD releases and through the
    distribution of television programming. Revenue from product
    sales is a component of the U.S. and Canada and International
    segments, while royalty revenues, including revenues earned from
    movies and television programming, is included in the
    Entertainment and Licensing segment.

Global
    Operations

In our Global Operations segment, we manufacture and source
    production of substantially all of our toy and game products.
    The Company owns and operates manufacturing facilities in East
    Longmeadow, Massachusetts and Waterford, Ireland. Sourcing of
    our other production is done through unrelated manufacturers in
    various Far East countries, principally China, using a Hong Kong
    based wholly-owned subsidiary



operation for quality control and order coordination purposes.
    See “Manufacturing and Importing” below for more
    details concerning overseas manufacturing and sourcing.

Other
    Information

To further extend our range of products in the various segments
    of our business, we sell a portion of our toy and game products
    directly to retailers, on a direct import basis from the Far
    East. These sales are reflected in the revenue of the related
    segment where the customer resides.

Certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale
    in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct
    business presence.

During the 2009 and 2007 fiscal years, revenues generated from
    TRANSFORMERS products were approximately $592,000 and $482,000,
    respectively, which was 14.5% and 12.6%, respectively, of our
    consolidated net revenues in those years. No other line of
    products constituted 10% or more of our consolidated net
    revenues in 2009 or 2007. No individual line of products
    accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net revenues
    during our 2008 fiscal year.

Working
    Capital Requirements

Our working capital needs are primarily financed through cash
    generated from operations and, when necessary, proceeds from
    short-term borrowings and our accounts receivable securitization
    program. Our borrowings and the use of our accounts receivable
    securitization program generally reach peak levels during the
    third quarter of each year. This corresponds to the time of year
    when our receivables also generally reach peak levels as part of
    the production and shipment of product in preparation for the
    holiday season. The strategy of retailers has generally been to
    make a higher percentage of their purchases of toy and game
    products within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer
    buying season, which includes Christmas. We expect that
    retailers will continue to follow this strategy. Our historical
    revenue pattern is one in which the second half of the year is
    more significant to our overall business than the first half
    and, within the second half of the year, the fourth quarter is
    generally more predominant. In 2009, the second half of the year
    accounted for approximately 65% of full year revenues with the
    third and fourth quarters accounting for 31% and 34% of full
    year revenues, respectively. In years where the Company has
    products tied to a major motion picture release, such as in 2009
    with the mid-year releases of

TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE
    FALLEN

,

G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA

and

X-MEN
    ORIGINS: WOLVERINE

, and in 2008 with the mid-year releases
    of

IRON MAN

,

THE INCREDIBLE HULK

and

INDIANA
    JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL

, this
    concentration of revenue late in the year may not be as
    pronounced due to the higher level of sales that occur around
    and just prior to the time of the motion picture theatrical
    release.

The toy and game business is also characterized by customer
    order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of
    differences each year in the degree of consumer acceptance of
    product lines, product availability, marketing strategies and
    inventory policies of retailers, the dates of theatrical
    releases of major motion pictures for which we have product
    licenses, and changes in overall economic conditions. As a
    result, comparisons of our unshipped orders on any date with
    those at the same date in a prior year are not necessarily
    indicative of our sales for that year. Moreover, quick response
    inventory management practices result in fewer orders being
    placed significantly in advance of shipment and more orders
    being placed for immediate delivery. Retailers are timing their
    orders so that they are being filled by suppliers, such as us,
    closer to the time of purchase by consumers. Unshipped orders at
    January 24, 2010 and January 25, 2009 were
    approximately $195,000 and $108,000, respectively. It is a
    general industry practice that orders are subject to amendment
    or cancellation by customers prior to shipment. The backlog of
    unshipped orders at any date in a given year can also be
    affected by programs that we may employ to incent customers to
    place orders and accept shipments early in the year. These
    programs follow general industry practices. The types of
    programs that we plan to employ to promote sales in 2010 are
    substantially the same as those we employed in 2009.

Historically, we commit to the majority of our inventory
    production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a
    given year prior to the peak third and fourth quarter retail
    selling season. Our accounts receivable increase during the
    third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases
    to meet expected



consumer demand in the holiday season. Due to the concentrated
    timeframe of this selling period, payments for these accounts
    receivable are generally not due until later in the fourth
    quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year.
    The timing difference between expenses paid and revenues
    collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow varying
    amounts during the year. During 2009, we utilized cash from our
    operations, borrowings under our revolving credit agreement as
    well as our uncommitted lines of credit, and proceeds from our
    accounts receivable securitization program to meet our cash flow
    requirements.

Royalties,
    Research and Development

Our success is dependent on innovation, including both the
    continuing development of new products and the redesign of
    existing products for continued market acceptance. Our toy, game
    and puzzle products are developed by a global development group
    and the costs of this group are allocated to the selling
    entities which comprise our principal operating segments. In
    2009, 2008, and 2007, we spent $181,195, $191,424 and $167,194,
    respectively, on activities relating to the development, design
    and engineering of new products and their packaging (including
    products brought to us by independent designers) and on the
    improvement or modification of ongoing products. Much of this
    work is performed by our internal staff of designers, artists,
    model makers and engineers.

In addition to the design and development work performed by our
    own staff, we deal with a number of independent toy and game
    designers for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy
    and game manufacturers. Rights to such designs and ideas, when
    acquired by us, are usually exclusive and the agreements require
    us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item.
    These designer royalty agreements, in some cases, also provide
    for advance royalties and minimum guarantees.

We also produce a number of toys and games under trademarks and
    copyrights utilizing the names or likenesses of characters from
    movies, television shows and other entertainment media, for
    whose rights we compete with other toy and game manufacturers.
    Licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty
    on our net sales of the item. Licenses for the use of characters
    are generally exclusive for specific products or product lines
    in specified territories. In many instances, advance royalties
    and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements.
    In 2009, 2008, and 2007, we incurred $330,651, $312,986 and
    $316,807, respectively, of royalty expense. A portion of this
    expense relates to amounts paid in prior years as royalty
    advances. Our royalty expenses in any given year vary depending
    upon the timing of movie releases and other entertainment.

Marketing
    and Sales

As we are focused on re-imagining, re-inventing and re-igniting
    our many brands on a consistent global basis, we have a global
    marketing function which establishes brand direction and
    messaging, as well as assists the selling entities in
    establishing certain local marketing programs. The costs of this
    group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our
    principal operating segments. Our products are sold nationally
    and internationally to a broad spectrum of customers, including
    wholesalers, distributors, chain stores, discount stores, mail
    order houses, catalog stores, department stores and other
    traditional retailers, large and small, as well as
    internet-based

“e-tailers.”

Our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our
    products. Remaining sales are generated by independent
    distributors who sell our products, for the most part, in areas
    of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct
    presence. While we have thousands of customers, there has been
    significant consolidation at the retail level over the last
    several years in our industry. As a result, the majority of our
    sales are to large chain stores, distributors and wholesalers.
    While the consolidation of customers provides us with certain
    benefits, such as potentially more efficient product
    distribution and other decreased costs of sales and
    distribution, this consolidation also creates additional risks
    to our business associated with a major customer having
    financial difficulties or reducing its business with us. In
    addition, customer concentration may decrease the prices we are
    able to obtain for some of our products and reduce the number of
    products we would otherwise be able to bring to market. During
    2009, net revenues from our three largest customers, Wal-Mart
    Stores, Inc., Target Corporation and Toys “R” Us,
    Inc., represented 25%, 13% and 11%, respectively, of
    consolidated net revenues, and sales to our top five customers,
    including Wal-Mart,



Target and Toys “R” Us, Inc., accounted for
    approximately 54% of our consolidated net revenues. In the
    U.S. and Canada segment, approximately 74% of our net
    revenues were derived from our top three customers.

We advertise many of our toy and game products extensively on
    television. Generally our advertising highlights selected items
    in our various product groups in a manner designed to promote
    the sale of not only the selected item, but also other items we
    offer in those product groups as well. We introduce many of our
    new products to major customers during the year prior to the
    year of introduction of such products for retail sale. In
    addition, we showcase certain of our new products in New York
    City at the time of the American International Toy Fair in
    February, as well as at other international toy shows. In 2009
    we spent $412,580 on advertising, promotion and marketing
    programs compared to $454,612 in 2008 and $434,742 in 2007.

Manufacturing
    and Importing

During 2009 substantially all of our products were manufactured
    in third party facilities in the Far East, primarily China, as
    well as in our two owned facilities located in East Longmeadow,
    Massachusetts and Waterford, Ireland.

Most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials
    such as plastic, paper and cardboard, although certain products
    also make use of electronic components. All of these materials
    are readily available but may be subject to significant
    fluctuations in price. There are certain chemicals (including
    phthalates and BPA) that national, state and local governments
    have restricted or are seeking to restrict or limit the use of;
    however, we do not believe these restrictions will materially
    impact our business. We generally enter into agreements with
    suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish
    prices for that year. However, significant volatility in the
    prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with
    our suppliers during the year. Our manufacturing processes and
    those of our vendors include injection molding, blow molding,
    spray painting, printing, box making and assembly. We purchase
    most of the components and accessories used in our toys and
    certain of the components used in our games, as well as some
    finished items, from manufacturers in the United States and in
    other countries. However, the countries of the Far East, and
    particularly the People’s Republic of China, constitute the
    largest manufacturing center of toys in the world and the
    substantial majority of our toy products are manufactured in
    China. The 1996 implementation of the General Agreement on
    Tariffs and Trade reduced or eliminated customs duties on many
    of the products imported by us.

We believe that the manufacturing capacity of our third party
    manufacturers, together with our own facilities, as well as the
    supply of components, accessories and completed products which
    we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers, are adequate to
    meet the anticipated demand in 2010 for our products. Our
    reliance on designated external sources of manufacturing could
    be shifted, over a period of time, to alternative sources of
    supply for our products, should such changes be necessary or
    desirable. However, if we were to be prevented from obtaining
    products from a substantial number of our current Far East
    suppliers due to political, labor or other factors beyond our
    control, our operations and our ability to obtain products would
    be severely disrupted while alternative sources of product were
    secured. The imposition of trade sanctions by the United States
    or the European Union against a class of products imported by us
    from, or the loss of “normal trade relations” status
    by, the People’s Republic of China, or other factors which
    increase the cost of manufacturing in China, such as higher
    Chinese labor costs or an appreciation in the yuan, could
    significantly disrupt our operations

and/or

significantly increase the cost of the products which are
    manufactured in China and imported into other markets.

We purchase dies and molds from independent United States and
    international sources.

Competition

We are a worldwide leader in the design, manufacture and
    marketing of games and toys, but our business is highly
    competitive. We compete with several large toy and game
    companies in our product categories, as well as many smaller
    United States and international toy and game designers,
    manufacturers and marketers. We also compete with companies that
    offer branded entertainment focused on children and their
    families.



Competition is based primarily on meeting consumer entertainment
    preferences and on the quality and play value of our products.
    To a lesser extent, competition is also based on product pricing.

In addition to contending with competition from other toy and
    game companies, in our business we must deal with the phenomenon
    that many children have been moving away from traditional toys
    and games at a younger age and the array of products and
    entertainment offerings competing for the attention of children
    has expanded. We refer to this as “children getting older
    younger.” As a result, our products not only compete with
    the offerings of other toy and game manufacturers, but we must
    compete, particularly in meeting the demands of older children,
    with the entertainment offerings of many other companies, such
    as makers of video games and consumer electronic products.

The volatility in consumer preferences with respect to family
    entertainment and low barriers to entry continually creates new
    opportunities for existing competitors and

start-ups

to
    develop products which compete with our toy and game offerings.

Employees

At December 27, 2009, we employed approximately
    5,800 persons worldwide, approximately 3,100 of whom were
    located in the United States.

Trademarks,
    Copyrights and Patents

We seek to protect our products, for the most part, and in as
    many countries as practical, through registered trademarks,
    copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is
    available, cost effective, and meaningful. The loss of such
    rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result
    in significant harm to our business, although the loss of such
    protection for a number of significant items might have such an
    effect.

Government
    Regulation

Our toy and game products sold in the United States are subject
    to the provisions of The Consumer Product Safety Act, as amended
    by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, (as
    amended, the “CPSA”), The Federal Hazardous Substances
    Act (the “FHSA”), The Flammable Fabrics Act (the
    “FFA”), and the regulations promulgated thereunder. In
    addition, certain of our products, such as the mixes for our
    EASY-BAKE ovens, are also subject to regulation by the Food and
    Drug Administration.

The CPSA empowers the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the
    “CPSC”) to take action against hazards presented by
    consumer products, including the formulation and implementation
    of regulations and uniform safety standards. The CPSC has the
    authority to seek to declare a product “a banned hazardous
    substance” under the CPSA and to ban it from commerce. The
    CPSC can file an action to seize and condemn an “imminently
    hazardous consumer product” under the CPSA and may also
    order equitable remedies such as recall, replacement, repair or
    refund for the product. The FHSA provides for the repurchase by
    the manufacturer of articles that are banned.

Consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and
    cities within the United States and in certain foreign markets
    such as Canada, Australia and Europe. We utilize laboratories
    that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain
    compliance with the CPSA, the FHSA, the FFA, other applicable
    domestic and international product standards, and our own
    standards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no
    assurance that our products are or will be hazard free. Any
    material product recall or other safety issue impacting our
    product could have an adverse effect on our results of
    operations or financial condition, depending on the product and
    scope of the recall, and could negatively affect sales of our
    other products as well.

The Children’s Television Act of 1990 and the rules
    promulgated thereunder by the United States Federal
    Communications Commission, as well as the laws of certain
    foreign countries, also place limitations on television
    commercials during children’s programming.



We maintain programs to comply with various United States
    federal, state, local and international requirements relating to
    the environment, plant safety and other matters.

or in our annual report to shareholders to reflect events or
    circumstances occurring after the date of the filing of this
    report. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all dollar or
    share amounts herein are expressed in thousands of dollars or
    shares, except for per share amounts.

The
    volatility of ever-evolving consumer preferences, combined with
    the high level of competition and low barriers to entry in the
    family entertainment industry, make it difficult to maintain and
    build upon the success of existing products and product lines or
    introduce successful new products. In addition, an inability to
    develop and introduce planned new products and product lines in
    a timely and cost-effective manner may damage our
    business.

The family entertainment business is a fashion industry and
    evolves quickly. Our success is critically dependent upon the
    consumer appeal of our products. Our failure to successfully
    anticipate, identify and react to children’s interests and
    the current preferences in family entertainment could
    significantly lower sales of our products and harm our business
    and profitability.

A decline in the popularity of our existing products and product
    lines, or the failure of our new products and product lines to
    achieve and sustain interest from retailers and consumers, could
    significantly lower our revenues and operating margins, which
    would in turn harm our profitability, business and financial
    condition. In our industry, it is critical to identify and offer
    what are considered to be the next “hot” toys and
    games on children’s “wish lists” and to
    effectively anticipate children’s evolving entertainment
    interests. Our continued



success will depend on our ability to develop, market and sell
    popular toys, games and other entertainment offerings, and
    license our brands for products which are sought after by both
    children and their parents. We seek to achieve and maintain
    market popularity for our products through the continued
    re-imagination, re-invigoration and extension of our existing
    family entertainment properties in ways we believe will capture
    evolving consumer interest and imagination, offer immersive
    brand experiences and remain relevant in today’s world, and
    by developing, introducing and gaining customer interest for new
    family entertainment products. This process involves
    anticipating and extending successful play patterns, offering
    continual product innovation and identifying entertainment
    concepts and properties that appeal to children’s
    imaginations. However, consumer preferences with respect to
    family entertainment are continuously changing and are difficult
    to anticipate. Evolving consumer tastes, coupled with an ever
    changing pipeline of entertainment properties and products which
    compete for consumer interest and acceptance, create an
    environment in which some products can fail to achieve consumer
    acceptance, and other products can be extremely popular during a
    certain period in time but then rapidly be replaced in
    consumer’s minds with other properties. As a result,
    individual family entertainment products and properties often
    have short consumer life cycles.

Not only must we address rapidly changing consumer tastes and
    interests but we face competitors who are also constantly
    monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes, seeking
    ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new
    products that compete with our products for consumer purchasing.
    In addition to existing competitors, the barriers to entry for
    new participants in the family entertainment industry are low.
    New participants with a popular product idea or entertainment
    property can gain access to consumers and become a significant
    source of competition for our products. In some cases our
    competitors’ products may achieve greater market acceptance
    than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products.

The challenge of developing and offering products that are
    sought after by children is compounded by the trend of children
    “getting older younger”. By this we mean that children
    are expanding their interests beyond traditional toys and games
    to a wider array of entertainment products at younger ages and,
    as a result, at younger and younger ages, our products compete
    with the offerings of video game suppliers, consumer electronics
    companies and other businesses outside of the traditional toy
    and game industry.

There is no guarantee that:

•

Any of our current products or product lines will continue to be
    popular;

•

Any property for which we have a significant license will
    achieve or sustain popularity;

•

Any new products or product lines we introduce will be
    considered interesting to consumers and achieve an adequate
    market acceptance;

•

Any new product’s life cycle will be sufficient to permit
    us to profitably recover development, manufacturing, marketing,
    royalties (including royalty advances and guarantees) and other
    costs of producing, marketing and selling the product; or

•

We will be able to manufacture, source and ship new or
    continuing products in a timely and cost-effective basis to meet
    constantly changing consumer demands, a risk that is heightened
    by our customers’ compressed shipping schedules and the
    seasonality of our business.

In developing new products and product lines, we have
    anticipated dates for the associated product introductions. When
    we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a
    particular product or product line at a certain time in the
    future those expectations are based on completing the associated
    development and implementation work in accordance with our
    currently anticipated development schedule. Unforeseen delays or
    difficulties in the development process, or significant
    increases in the planned cost of development, may cause the
    introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or,
    in some situations, may cause a product introduction to be
    discontinued.



Delays
    or increased costs associated with the development and offering
    of entertainment media based upon or related to our brands, or
    lack of sufficient consumer interest in such entertainment
    media, can harm our business.

As part of our strategy of offering immersive brand experiences,
    we look to offer consumers the ability to enjoy our brands in as
    many different forms and formats as possible. Entertainment
    media, in forms such as motion pictures and television, can
    provide popular platforms for consumers to experience our brands
    and the success of such media efforts can significantly impact
    demand for our products and our financial success.

The success of our products is often dependent on the timelines
    and effectiveness of media efforts. Television programming,
    movie and DVD releases, comic book releases, and other media
    efforts are often critical in generating interest in our
    products and brands. Not only our efforts, but the efforts of
    third parties, heavily impact the launch dates and success of
    these media efforts. When we say that products or brands will be
    supported by certain media releases, those statements are based
    on our current plans and expectations. Unforeseen factors may
    delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation.
    Any delay or cancellation of planned product development work,
    introductions, or media support may decrease the number of
    products we sell and harm our business.

Similarly, if our and our partners’ media efforts fail to
    garner sufficient consumer interest and acceptance, our revenues
    and the financial return from such efforts will be harmed. In
    2009 we entered into a joint venture with Discovery
    Communications, Inc. (“Discovery”). Through that joint
    venture, we are currently working with Discovery to offer a
    children’s and family entertainment channel called THE HUB,
    which is scheduled to debut in the fall of 2010. In connection
    with this joint venture effort, we are also building a virtual
    studio, called Hasbro Studios, which will develop and produce
    entertainment media based on our brands. Lack of consumer
    interest in and acceptance of THE HUB, programming appearing on
    THE HUB, other programming developed by Hasbro Studios, and
    products related to that programming could significantly harm
    our business. Similarly, our business could be harmed by greater
    than expected costs, or unexpected delays or difficulties,
    associated with the introduction of the rebranded joint venture
    network, the development of Hasbro Studios and the creation of
    new content based on our brands to appear on the joint venture
    network and elsewhere.

At December 27, 2009, $371,783, or 9.5%, of our total
    assets represented our investment in the Discovery joint
    venture. If the launch of the rebranded television channel is
    not successful, or if there are subsequent declines in the
    success or profitability of the channel, then our investment may
    become impaired, which could result in a write-down through net
    earnings.

Economic
    downturns which negatively impact the retail and credit markets,
    or which otherwise damage the financial health of our retail
    customers and consumers, can harm our business and financial
    performance.

The success of our family entertainment products and our
    financial performance is dependent on consumer purchases of our
    products. Consumers may not purchase our products because the
    products do not capture consumer interest and imagination, or
    because competitor family entertainment offerings are deemed
    more attractive. But consumer spending on our products can also
    be harmed by factors that negatively impact consumers’
    budgets generally, and which are not due to our product
    offerings.

Recessions and other economic downturns, or disruptions in
    credit markets, in the markets in which we operate can result in
    lower levels of economic activity, lower employment levels, less
    consumer disposable income, and lower consumer confidence. Any
    of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on
    the purchase of our products. This in turn can reduce our
    revenues and harm our financial performance.

In addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our
    products during times of economic difficulty, in an effort to
    maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price
    of our products, increase our promotional spending, or take
    other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our
    products. Those steps may lower our net revenues, decrease our
    operating margins, increase our costs

and/or

lower
    our profitability.



Other
    economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we
    operate, including rising commodity and fuel prices, higher
    labor costs, increased transportation costs, outbreaks of public
    health pandemics or other diseases, or third party conduct could
    negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products,
    and lower our revenues, margins and profitability.

Various economic and public health conditions can impact our
    ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely and
    cost-effective manner, or can otherwise have a significant
    negative impact on our business.

Significant increases in the costs of other products which are
    required by consumers, such as gasoline, home heating fuels, or
    groceries, may reduce household spending on the discretionary
    entertainment products we offer. As we discussed above, weakened
    economic conditions, lowered employment levels or recessions in
    any of our major markets may significantly reduce consumer
    purchases of our products. Economic conditions may also be
    negatively impacted by terrorist attacks, wars and other
    conflicts, increases in critical commodity prices, or the
    prospect of such events. Such a weakened economic and business
    climate, as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a
    climate, could harm our revenues and profitability.

Our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand
    for our products, but also on our ability to produce and sell
    those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit.
    Rising fuel and raw material prices, for paperboard and other
    components such as resin used in plastics, increased
    transportation costs, and increased labor costs in the markets
    in which our products are manufactured all may increase the
    costs we incur to produce and transport our products, which in
    turn may reduce our margins, reduce our profitability and harm
    our business.

Other conditions, such as the unavailability of electrical
    components, may impede our ability to manufacture, source and
    ship new and continuing products on a timely basis. Additional
    factors outside of our control could further delay our products
    or increase the cost we pay to produce such products. For
    example, work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes, an outbreak of a
    severe public health pandemic, or the occurrence or threat of
    wars or other conflicts, all could impact our ability to
    manufacture or deliver product. Any of these factors could
    result in product delays, increased costs

and/or

lost
    sales for our products.

We may
    not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed
    material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from
    the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum
    guaranteed royalties.

In addition to designing and developing products based on our
    own brands, we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and
    interests by producing products based on popular entertainment
    properties developed by other parties and licensed to us. The
    success of entertainment properties for which we have a license,
    such as MARVEL or STAR WARS related products, can significantly
    affect our revenues and profitability. If we produce a line of
    products based on a movie or television series, the success of
    the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of
    consumer interest in the associated products we are offering. In
    addition, competition in our industry for access to
    entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure,
    maintain, and renew popular licenses to entertainment products
    on beneficial terms, if at all, and to attract and retain the
    talented employees necessary to design, develop and market
    successful products based on these properties. The loss of
    rights granted pursuant to any of our licensing agreements could
    harm our business and competitive position.

The license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually
    require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be
    substantial, and in some cases may be greater than what we are
    ultimately able to recoup from actual sales, which could result
    in write-offs of significant amounts which in turn would harm
    our results of operations. At December 27, 2009, we had
    $120,115 of prepaid royalties, $43,115 of which are included in
    prepaid expenses and other current assets and $77,000 of which
    are included in other assets. Under the terms of existing
    contracts as of December 27, 2009, we may be required to
    pay future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees
    totaling approximately $331,491. Acquiring or renewing licenses
    may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we
    consider to be too high to be profitable, which may result in
    losing licenses we currently hold when they become available for
    renewal, or missing



business opportunities for new licenses. Additionally, as a
    licensee of entertainment based properties we have no guaranty
    that a particular property or brand will translate into
    successful toy or game products.

We anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie
    releases may make it increasingly difficult for us to profitably
    sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may
    lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in
    order to minimize their inventory risk. Furthermore, there can
    be no assurance that a successful brand will continue to be
    successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future, as
    new entertainment properties and competitive products are
    continually being introduced to the market. In the event that we
    are not able to acquire or maintain successful entertainment
    licenses on advantageous terms, our revenues and profits may be
    harmed.

Our
    business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results
    will depend, in large part, on our sales during the relatively
    brief holiday shopping season. This seasonality is exacerbated
    by retailers’ quick response inventory management
    techniques.

Sales of our family entertainment products at retail are
    extremely seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring
    during the period from September through December in
    anticipation of the holiday season, including Christmas. This
    seasonality has increased over time, as retailers become more
    efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick
    response inventory management techniques. Customers are timing
    their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers, such as
    us, closer to the time of purchase by consumers. For toys, games
    and other family entertainment products which we produce, a
    majority of retail sales for the entire year occur in the fourth
    quarter, close to the holiday season. As a consequence, the
    majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period from
    September through December, as our customers do not want to
    maintain large on-hand inventories throughout the year ahead of
    consumer demand. While these techniques reduce a retailer’s
    investment in inventory, they increase pressure on suppliers
    like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant
    portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier.

The limited inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or
    delay retail sales, resulting in lower revenues for us. If we or
    our customers determine that one of our products is more popular
    at retail than was originally anticipated, we may not have
    sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional product to
    fully capture consumer interest in the product. Additionally,
    the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter
    time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve
    tight and compressed shipping schedules, which also may reduce
    our sales and harm our financial performance. This seasonal
    pattern requires significant use of working capital, mainly to
    manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year
    prior to the holiday season, and requires accurate forecasting
    of demand for products during the holiday season in order to
    avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing
    excess inventory of products that are less popular with
    consumers. Our failure to accurately predict and respond to
    consumer demand, resulting in our underproducing popular items

and/or

overproducing less popular items, would reduce our total sales
    and harm our results of operations. In addition, as a result of
    the seasonal nature of our business, we would be significantly
    and adversely affected, in a manner disproportionate to the
    impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the
    year, by unforeseen events, such as a terrorist attack or
    economic shock, that harm the retail environment or consumer
    buying patterns during our key selling season, or by events,
    such as strikes or port delays, that interfere with the shipment
    of goods, particularly from the Far East, during the critical
    months leading up to the holiday purchasing season.

Our
    substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the
    United States subject us to risks associated with international
    operations. Among these risks is the fact that fluctuations in
    foreign exchange rates can significantly impact our financial
    performance.

We operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries
    outside the United States. For the year ended December 27,
    2009, our net revenues from international customers comprised
    approximately 42% of our total consolidated net revenues. We
    expect our sales to international customers to continue to
    account for a significant portion of our revenues. In fact, over
    time, we expect our international sales and operations to grow
    both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overall
    business as one of our key business strategies is to increase
    our presence in emerging and underserved markets. Additionally,
    as we discuss below, we utilize



third-party manufacturers located principally in the Far East,
    to produce the majority of our products, and we have a
    manufacturing facility in Ireland. These sales and manufacturing
    operations, including operations in emerging markets that we
    have entered, may enter, or may increase our presence in, are
    subject to the risks associated with international operations,
    including:

•

Currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations;

•

Limitations, including taxes, on the repatriation of earnings;

•

Political instability, civil unrest and economic instability;

•

Greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and
    weaker laws protecting such rights;

•

Complications in complying with different laws in varying
    jurisdictions and changes in governmental policies;

•

Natural disasters and the greater difficulty and expense in
    recovering therefrom;

•

Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country
    to another, including port congestion, strikes and other
    transportation delays and interruptions;

•

Changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing
    business internationally; and

•

The imposition of tariffs.

Because of the importance of our international sales and
    international sourcing of manufacturing to our business, our
    financial condition and results of operations could be
    significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to
    occur.

If the exchange rate between the United States dollar and a
    local currency for an international market in which we have
    significant sales or operations changes, our financial results,
    reported in U.S. dollars, may be meaningfully impacted even
    if our business in the local currency is not significantly
    affected. As an example, if the dollar appreciates 10% relative
    to a local currency for an international market in which we had
    $200 million of net sales, the dollar value of those sales,
    as they are translated into U.S. dollars, would decrease by
    $20 million in our consolidated financial results. As such,
    we would recognize a $20 million decrease in our net
    revenues, even if the actual level of sales in the foreign
    market had not changed. Similarly, our expenses in foreign
    markets can be significantly impacted, in U.S. dollar
    terms, by exchange rates, meaning the profitability of our
    business in U.S. dollar terms can be significantly harmed
    by exchange rate movements.

The
    concentration of our retail customer base means that economic
    difficulties or changes in the purchasing policies of our major
    customers could have a significant impact on us.

We depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell
    the majority of our products. For the fiscal year ended
    December 27, 2009, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Target
    Corporation, and Toys “R” Us, Inc., accounted for
    approximately 25%, 13% and 11%, respectively, of our
    consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers,
    including Wal-Mart, Target and Toys “R” Us, in the
    aggregate accounted for approximately 54% of our consolidated
    net revenues. In the U.S. and Canada segment, approximately
    74% of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top
    three customers. While the consolidation of our customer base
    may provide certain benefits to us, such as potentially more
    efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of
    sales and distribution, this consolidation also means that if
    one or more of our major customers were to experience
    difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us, cease doing
    business with us, significantly reduce the amount of their
    purchases from us or return substantial amounts of our products,
    it could significantly harm our sales, profitability and
    financial condition. Increased concentration among our customers
    could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher
    sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross
    margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less
    consolidation among our customers. In addition, the bankruptcy
    or other lack of success of one or more of our significant
    retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and result
    in higher bad debt expense.



Our
    use of third-party manufacturers to produce the majority of our
    toy products, as well as certain other products, presents risks
    to our business.

We own and operate two game and puzzle manufacturing facilities,
    one in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts and the other in
    Waterford, Ireland. However, most of our toy products, in
    addition to certain other products, are manufactured by
    third-party manufacturers, most of whom are located in the
    People’s Republic of China. Although our external sources
    of manufacturing can be shifted, over a period of time, to
    alternative sources of supply, should such changes be necessary,
    if we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or
    components for a material portion of our product line due to
    political, labor or other factors beyond our control, including
    natural disasters or pandemics, our operations would be
    disrupted, potentially for a significant period of time, while
    alternative sources of supply were secured. This delay could
    significantly reduce our revenues and profitability, and harm
    our business.

Given that the majority of our manufacturing is conducted by
    third-party manufacturers located in the People’s Republic
    of China, health conditions and other factors affecting social
    and economic activity in China and affecting the movement of
    people and products into and from China to our major markets,
    including North America and Europe, as well as increases in the
    costs of labor and other costs of doing business in China, could
    have a significant negative impact on our operations, revenues
    and earnings. Factors that could negatively affect our business
    include a potential significant revaluation of the Chinese yuan,
    which may result in an increase in the cost of producing
    products in China, increases in labor costs and difficulties in
    moving products manufactured in China out of Asia and through
    the ports on the western coast of North America, whether due to
    port congestion, labor disputes, product regulations

and/or

inspections or other factors, and natural disasters or health
    pandemics impacting China. Also, the imposition of trade
    sanctions or other regulations by the United States or the
    European Union against products imported by us from, or the loss
    of “normal trade relations” status with, the
    People’s Republic of China, could significantly increase
    our cost of products imported into the United States or Europe
    and harm our business. Additionally, the suspension of the
    operations of a third party manufacturer by government
    inspectors in China could result in delays to us in obtaining
    product and may harm sales.

We require our third-party manufacturers to comply with our
    Global Business Ethics Principles, which are designed to prevent
    products manufactured by or for us from being produced under
    inhumane or exploitive conditions. The Global Business Ethics
    Principles address a number of issues, including working hours
    and compensation, health and safety, and abuse and
    discrimination. In addition, Hasbro requires that our products
    supplied by third-party manufacturers be produced in compliance
    with all applicable laws and regulations, including consumer and
    product safety laws in the markets where those products are
    sold. Hasbro has the right, both directly and through the use of
    outside monitors, to monitor compliance by our third-party
    manufacturers with our Global Business Ethics Principles and
    other manufacturing requirements. In addition, we do quality
    assurance testing on our products, including products
    manufactured for us by third parties. Notwithstanding these
    requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with
    them, there is always a risk that one or more of our third-party
    manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we
    will not immediately discover such non-compliance. Any failure
    of our third-party manufacturers to comply with labor, consumer,
    product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing
    products for us could result in damage to our reputation, harm
    sales of our products and potentially create liability for us.

Part
    of our strategy for remaining relevant to children is to offer
    innovative children’s toy and game electronic products. The
    margins on many of these products are lower than more
    traditional toys and games and such products may have a shorter
    lifespan than more traditional toys and games. As a result,
    sales of children’s toy and game electronic products may
    lower our overall operating margins and produce more volatility
    in our business.

As children have grown “older younger” and have
    otherwise become interested in more and more sophisticated and
    adult products, such as videogames and consumer electronics, at
    younger and younger ages, we have sought to keep our products
    relevant for these consumers. One initiative we have pursued to
    capture the interest of children is to offer innovative
    children’s electronic toys and games. Examples of such
    products in the last few years include our I-branded products
    such as I-DOG and I-CAT, and our FURREAL FRIENDS



line of products, including BUTTERSCOTCH PONY, BISCUIT MY
    LOVIN’ PUP and KOTA. These products, if successful, can be
    an effective way for us to connect with consumers and increase
    sales. However, children’s electronics, in addition to the
    risks associated with our other family entertainment products,
    also face certain additional risks.

Our costs for designing, developing and producing electronic
    products tend to be higher than for many of our other more
    traditional products, such as board games and action figures.
    The ability to recoup these higher costs through sufficient
    sales quantities and to reflect higher costs in higher prices is
    constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and
    entertainment products, and can be further constrained by
    difficult economic conditions. As a consequence, our margins on
    the sales of electronic products tend to be lower than for more
    traditional products and we can face increased risk of not
    achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs. In addition,
    the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in
    the electronics area is potentially even greater than for our
    other products. This pace of change means that the window in
    which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may
    be even shorter than traditional toys and games.

We
    rely on external financing, including our credit facilities and
    accounts receivable securitization facility, to help fund our
    operations. If we were unable to obtain or service such
    financing, or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were
    too burdensome, our business would be harmed.

Due to the seasonal nature of our business, in order to meet our
    working capital needs, particularly those in the third and
    fourth quarters, we rely on our revolving credit facility and
    our other credit facilities for working capital. We currently
    have a revolving credit agreement that expires in 2011, which
    provides for a $300,000 committed revolving credit facility
    which provides the Company the ability to request increases in
    the committed facility in additional increments of $50,000,
    subject to lender agreement, up to a total of $500,000. The
    credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting
    forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other
    limitations typical of an investment grade facility. These
    restrictive covenants may limit our future actions, and
    financial, operating and strategic flexibility. In addition, our
    financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our
    credit facility. Our performance and financial condition may not
    meet our original expectations, causing us to fail to meet such
    financial covenants. Non-compliance with our debt covenants
    could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our
    revolving credit facility and other bank lines, a circumstance
    which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would
    most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue
    to fund our operations.

As an additional source of working capital and liquidity, we
    currently have a $250,000 accounts receivable securitization
    program. Under this program, we sell on an ongoing basis,
    substantially all of our domestic U.S. dollar denominated
    trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote special purpose
    entity. Under this facility, the special purpose entity is able
    to sell, on a revolving basis, undivided ownership interests in
    the eligible receivables to bank conduits. During the term of
    the facility, we must maintain certain performance ratios. If we
    fail to maintain these ratios, we could be prevented from
    accessing this cost-effective source of working capital and
    short-term financing. Additionally, changes in financial
    reporting, regulatory or other requirements which went into
    effect in 2010 or may occur in the future may significantly
    increase the cost of our accounts receivable securitization
    facility, which could make use of such a facility uneconomical.

We believe that our cash flow from operations, together with our
    cash on hand and access to existing credit facilities and our
    accounts receivable securitization facility, are adequate for
    current and planned needs in 2010. However, our actual
    experience may differ from these expectations. Factors that may
    lead to a difference include, but are not limited to, the
    matters discussed herein, as well as future events that might
    have the effect of reducing our available cash balance, such as
    unexpected material operating losses or increased capital or
    other expenditures, as well as increases in inventory or
    accounts receivable that are ineligible for sale under our
    securitization facility, regulatory or accounting changes which
    make accounts receivable securitization facilities more
    expensive or otherwise less desirable as sources of working
    capital funding, or other future events that may reduce or
    eliminate the availability of external financial resources.

Not only may our individual financial performance impact our
    ability to access sources of external financing, but significant
    disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our
    ability to obtain financing.



Although we believe the risk of nonperformance by the
    counterparties to our financial facilities is not significant,
    in times of severe economic downturn

and/or

distress in the credit markets, it is possible that one or more
    sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to
    provide funding to us. In such a situation, it may be that we
    would be unable to access funding under our existing credit
    facilities, and it might not be possible to find alternative
    sources of funding.

We also may choose to finance our capital needs, from time to
    time, through the issuance of debt securities. Our ability to
    issue such securities on satisfactory terms, if at all, will
    depend on the state of our business and financial condition, any
    ratings issued by major credit rating agencies, market interest
    rates, and the overall condition of the financial and credit
    markets at the time of the offering. The condition of the credit
    markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated
    significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the
    future. Variations in these factors could make it difficult for
    us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher
    interest rates in order to sell new debt securities. The failure
    to receive financing on desirable terms, or at all, could damage
    our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or
    engage in other business activities.

As of December 27, 2009, we had $1,134,723 of total
    principal amount of indebtedness outstanding. If we are unable
    to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our
    outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face
    default. There is no guarantee that we would be able to
    refinance debt on favorable terms, or at all. This total
    indebtedness includes $249,828 in aggregate principal amount of
    2.75% senior convertible debentures that we issued in 2001.
    On December 1, 2011 and December 1, 2016, and upon the
    occurrence of certain fundamental corporate changes, holders of
    the 2.75% senior convertible debentures may require us to
    purchase their debentures. At that time, the purchase price may
    be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the
    two, at our discretion, provided that we will pay accrued and
    unpaid interest in cash. We may not have sufficient cash at that
    time to make the required repurchases and may be required to
    settle in shares of common stock.

As a
    manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational
    corporation, we are subject to various government regulations
    and may be subject to additional regulations in the future,
    violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise
    harm our business. In addition, we could be the subject of
    future product liability suits or product recalls, which could
    harm our business.

As a manufacturer of consumer products, we are subject to
    significant government regulations, including, in the United
    States, under The Consumer Products Safety Act, The Federal
    Hazardous Substances Act, and The Flammable Fabrics Act, as well
    as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our
    international markets. In addition, certain of our products are
    subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration or
    similar international authorities. While we take all the steps
    we believe are necessary to comply with these acts, there can be
    no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future.
    Failure to comply could result in sanctions which could have a
    negative impact on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations. We may also be subject to involuntary product
    recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall. While costs
    associated with product recalls have generally not been material
    to our business, the costs associated with future product
    recalls individually and in the aggregate in any given fiscal
    year, could be significant. In addition, any product recall,
    regardless of direct costs of the recall, may harm consumer
    perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our
    future revenues and results of operations.

Governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we
    manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations
    relating to product safety and consumer protection in the
    future, and may also increase the penalties for failure to
    comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations.
    In addition, one or more of our customers might require changes
    in our products, such as the non-use of certain materials, in
    the future. Complying with any such additional regulations or
    requirements could impose increased costs on our business.
    Similarly, increased penalties for non-compliance could subject
    us to greater expense in the event any of our products were
    found to not comply with such regulations. Such increased costs
    or penalties could harm our business.



In addition to government regulation, products that have been or
    may be developed by us may expose us to potential liability from
    personal injury or property damage claims by the users of such
    products. There can be no assurance that a claim will not be
    brought against us in the future. Any successful claim could
    significantly harm our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

As a large, multinational corporation, we are subject to a host
    of governmental regulations throughout the world, including
    antitrust, customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott
    regulations, environmental regulations and the Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act. Complying with these regulations imposes costs on
    us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to
    successfully comply with any such legal requirements could
    subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that
    could further harm our business and financial condition.

Our
    business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may
    not be able to protect such rights successfully. In addition, we
    have a material amount of acquired product rights which, if
    impaired, would result in a reduction of our net
    earnings.

Our intellectual property, including our license agreements and
    other agreements that establish our ownership rights and
    maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property, are
    of great value. We rely on a combination of trade secret,
    copyright, trademark, patent and other proprietary rights laws
    to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related
    to our brands. From time to time, third parties have challenged,
    and may in the future try to challenge, our ownership of our
    intellectual property. In addition, our business is subject to
    the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or
    infringing on our intellectual property rights. We may need to
    resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property
    rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of
    resources. Our failure to protect our intellectual property
    rights could harm our business and competitive position. Much of
    our intellectual property has been internally developed and has
    no carrying value on our balance sheet. However, as of
    December 27, 2009, we had $554,567 of acquired product and
    licensing rights included in other assets on our balance sheet.
    Declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed
    products may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of
    the related assets and could result in an impairment charge.
    Reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could
    harm our financial results.

We may
    not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or
    investments in joint ventures, or those benefits may be delayed
    or reduced in their realization.

Acquisitions have been a significant part of our historical
    growth and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify our
    product offerings. In making acquisitions, we target companies
    that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products
    or the ability for us to leverage our entertainment offerings.
    In the case of our joint venture with Discovery Communications,
    Inc., we looked to partner with a company that has shown the
    ability to establish and operate compelling entertainment
    channels. However, we cannot be certain that the products of
    companies we may acquire, or acquire an interest in, in the
    future will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers or
    that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to
    more effectively market our products. In some cases, we expect
    that the integration of the companies that we acquire into our
    operations will create production, marketing and other operating
    synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and
    profitability and, where applicable, cost savings, operating
    efficiencies and other advantages. However, we cannot be certain
    that these synergies, efficiencies and cost savings will be
    realized. Even if achieved, these benefits may be delayed or
    reduced in their realization. In other cases, we acquire
    companies that we believe have strong and creative management,
    in which case we plan to operate them more autonomously rather
    than fully integrating them into our operations. We cannot be
    certain that the key talented individuals at these companies
    will continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they
    will develop popular and profitable products or services in the
    future.

From
    time to time, we are involved in litigation, arbitration or
    regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which
    could entail significant expense.

As is the case with many large multinational corporations, we
    are subject, from time to time, to regulatory investigations,
    litigation and arbitration disputes. Because the outcome of
    litigation, arbitration and regulatory



investigations is inherently difficult to predict, it is
    possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail
    significant expense for us and harm our business. The fact that
    we operate in significant numbers of international markets also
    increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory
    exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying
    legal and regulatory requirements.

We
    have a material amount of goodwill which, if it becomes
    impaired, would result in a reduction in our net
    earnings.

Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition
    exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire. Goodwill is
    not amortized and is required to be periodically evaluated for
    impairment. At December 27, 2009, $475,931, or 12.2%, of
    our total assets represented goodwill. Declines in our
    profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units,
    which could result in a write-down of our goodwill. Reductions
    in our net earnings caused by the write-down of goodwill or our
    investment in the joint venture could harm our results of
    operations.

Properties

Hasbro owns its corporate headquarters in Pawtucket, Rhode
    Island consisting of approximately 343,000 square feet,
    which is used in the U.S. and Canada, Global Operations and
    Entertainment and Licensing segments as well as for corporate
    functions. The Company also owns an adjacent building consisting
    of approximately 23,000 square feet that is used in the
    corporate function. In addition, the Company leases a building
    in East Providence, Rhode Island consisting of approximately
    120,000 square feet that is used in the corporate function
    as well as in the Global Operations and Entertainment and
    Licensing segments. In addition to the above facilities, the
    Company also leases office space consisting of approximately
    95,400 square feet in Renton, Washington as well as
    warehouse space aggregating approximately 1,939,000 square
    feet in Georgia, California, Texas and Quebec that are also used
    in the U.S. and Canada segment.

The Company owns manufacturing plants in East Longmeadow,
    Massachusetts and Waterford, Ireland. The East Longmeadow plant
    consists of approximately 1,148,000 square feet and is used
    in the U.S. and Canada and Global Operations segments. The
    Waterford plant consists of approximately 244,000 square
    feet and is used in our Global Operations segment. The Global
    Operations segment also leases an aggregate of
    87,900 square feet of office and warehouse space in Hong
    Kong used in this segment as well as approximately
    52,300 square feet of office space leased in China.

In the International segment, the Company leases or owns
    property in over 25 countries. The primary locations in the
    International segment are in the United Kingdom, Mexico,
    Germany, France, Spain, Australia and Brazil, all of which are
    comprised of both office and warehouse space.

The above properties consist, in general, of brick, cinder block
    or concrete block buildings which the Company believes are in
    good condition and well maintained.

The Company believes that its facilities are adequate for its
    needs. The Company believes that, should it not be able to renew
    any of the leases related to its leased facilities, it could
    secure similar substitute properties without a material adverse
    impact on its operations.

Legal
    Proceedings

The Company has outstanding tax assessments from the Mexican tax
    authorities relating to the years 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and
    2004. These tax assessments, which total approximately
    $130 million in aggregate (including interest, penalties,
    and inflation updates), are based on transfer pricing issues
    between the Company’s subsidiaries with respect to the
    Company’s operations in Mexico. The Company has filed suit
    in the Federal Tribunal of Fiscal and Administrative Justice in
    Mexico challenging the 2000 through 2003 assessments. The
    Company filed the suit related to the 2000 and 2001 assessments
    in May 2009; the 2002



assessment in June 2008; and the 2003 assessment in
    March 2009. The Company is challenging the 2004 assessment
    through administrative appeals. The Company expects to be
    successful in sustaining its positions for all of these years.
    However, in order to challenge the outstanding tax assessments
    related to 2000 through 2003, as is usual and customary in
    Mexico in these matters, the Company was required to either make
    a deposit or post a bond in the full amount of the assessments.
    The Company elected to post bonds and accordingly, as of
    December 27, 2009, bonds totaling approximately
    $105 million (at year-end 2009 exchange rates) have been
    posted related to the 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 assessments.
    These bonds guarantee the full amounts of the related
    outstanding tax assessments in the event the Company is not
    successful in its challenge to them. The Company does not
    currently expect that it will be required to make a deposit or
    post a bond related to the 2004 assessment.

We are currently party to certain other legal proceedings, none
    of which we believe to be material to our business or financial
    condition.

Executive
    Summary

The Company earns revenue and generates cash through the sale of
    a variety of toy and game products, as well as through the
    out-licensing of rights for use of its properties in connection
    with non-competing products, including digital games, offered by
    third parties. The Company sells its products both within the
    United States and in a number of international markets. The
    Company’s business is highly seasonal with a significant
    amount of revenues occurring in the second half of the year. In
    2009, 2008 and 2007, the second half of the year accounted for
    65%, 63% and 66% of the Company’s net revenues,
    respectively. While many of the Company’s products are
    based on brands the Company owns or controls, the Company also
    offers products which are based on licensed rights from outside
    inventors. In addition, the Company licenses rights to produce
    products based on movie, television, music and other
    entertainment properties owned by third parties, such as the
    MARVEL and STAR WARS properties.

The Company’s business is separated into three principal
    business segments, U.S. and Canada, International and
    Entertainment and Licensing. The U.S. and Canada segment
    develops, markets and sells both toy and game products in the
    U.S. and Canada. The International segment consists of the
    Company’s European, Asia Pacific and Latin and South
    American marketing and sales operations. The Company’s
    Entertainment and Licensing segment includes the Company’s
    lifestyle licensing, digital gaming, movie, television and
    online entertainment operations. In addition to these three
    primary segments, the Company’s world-wide manufacturing
    and product sourcing operations are managed through its Global
    Operations segment.

The Company seeks to make its brands relevant in all areas
    important to its consumers. Brand awareness is amplified through
    immersive traditional play, digital applications, publishing and
    lifestyle licensing and entertainment experiences presented for
    the consumers’ enjoyment. The Company’s focus remains
    on growing core owned and controlled brands, developing new and
    innovative products which respond to market insights, offering
    immersive entertainment experiences which allow consumers to
    experience the Company’s brands across different forms and
    formats, and optimizing efficiencies within the Company to
    reduce costs, increase operating profits and maintain a strong
    balance sheet. The Company’s core brands represent
    Company-owned or Company-controlled brands, such as
    TRANSFORMERS, MY LITTLE PONY, LITTLEST PET SHOP, MONOPOLY,
    MAGIC: THE GATHERING, PLAYSKOOL, G.I. JOE, NERF and TONKA, which
    have been successful over the long term. The Company has a large
    portfolio of owned and controlled brands, which can be
    introduced in new formats and platforms over time. These brands
    may also be further extended by pairing a licensed concept with
    a core brand. By focusing on core brands, the Company is working
    to build a more consistent revenue stream and basis for future
    growth, and to leverage profitability. During 2009 the Company
    had strong revenues from core brands, namely TRANSFORMERS,
    LITTLEST PET SHOP, NERF, MONOPOLY, PLAYSKOOL, PLAY-DOH, MAGIC:
    THE GATHERING and G.I. JOE. The Company’s strategy of
    re-imagining, re-inventing and re-igniting its brands has been
    instrumental to achieving its overall long-term growth
    objectives.

The Company also seeks to drive revenues by increasing the
    visibility of its core brands through entertainment. As an
    example of this, in June of 2009, the

TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE
    OF THE FALLEN

motion picture was released as a sequel to the
    2007 motion picture

TRANSFORMERS

. In addition, in August
    2009, the motion picture

G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA

was
    released. The Company developed and



marketed product lines based on these motion pictures. As a
    result of pairing these core brands with motion picture
    entertainment, both the movies and the product lines benefited.
    In addition, the Company has entered into a strategic
    relationship with Universal Pictures to produce at least three
    motion pictures based on certain of Hasbro’s core brands,
    with the potential for production of two additional pictures.
    The first movie is expected to be released in 2012. As part of
    its strategy, in addition to using theatrical entertainment, the
    Company continues to seek opportunities to use other
    entertainment outlets and forms of entertainment as a way to
    build awareness of its brands which has proved instrumental to
    achieving its overall long-term growth objectives.

In April 2009 the Company announced the entry into an agreement
    to form a joint venture with Discovery Communications, Inc.
    (“Discovery”) to create a television network in the
    United States dedicated to high-quality children’s and
    family entertainment and educational programming. The
    transaction closed in May 2009. Programming on the network will
    include content based on Hasbro’s brands, Discovery’s
    library of children’s educational programming, as well as
    programming developed by third parties. The Company expects the
    rebranded network, THE HUB, to debut in late fall of 2010 and
    believes that it will reach approximately 60 million homes
    in the U.S. at that time, with programming targeted to
    children 14 years of age and under. The Company believes
    that this effort will support its strategy of growing its core
    brands well beyond traditional toys and games and to provide
    immersive entertainment experiences for consumers of all ages in
    any form or format. In connection with this transaction, the
    Company has begun building an internal creative group that will
    be responsible for the creation and development of television
    programming based on Hasbro’s brands. The Company expects
    to incur a certain level of investment spending leading up to
    the debut of the rebranded channel, as well as costs in 2010 and
    beyond related to the production of television programming.

While the Company believes it has built a more sustainable
    revenue base by developing and maintaining its core brands and
    avoiding reliance on licensed entertainment properties, it
    continues to opportunistically enter into or leverage existing
    strategic licenses which complement its brands and key
    strengths. The Company’s primary licenses include its
    agreements with Marvel Characters B.V. (“Marvel”);
    Lucas Licensing, Ltd. (“Lucas”), related to the STAR
    WARS brand; and Sesame Workshop, related to the Sesame Street
    brand of characters. The majority of product offerings under the
    Sesame Workshop license will commence in 2011. In 2009 and 2008,
    the Company had significant sales of products related to the
    Company’s license with Marvel, primarily due to the movie
    releases of

IRON MAN

in May 2008,

THE INCREDIBLE HULK

in June 2008 and

X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE

in May
    2009. In addition, the Company had significant sales in 2008 of
    products related to the movie release of

STAR WARS: CLONE
    WARS

in August 2008 as well as sales from the movie release
    of

INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL

in
    May 2008. During 2009 the Company has also had a high level of
    revenues from products related to television programming based
    on SPIDER-MAN and STAR WARS.

While gross profits of theatrical entertainment-based products
    are generally higher than many of the Company’s other
    products, sales from these products, including our owned or
    controlled brands based on a movie release, also incur royalty
    expense. Such royalties reduce the impact of these higher gross
    margins. In certain instances, such as with Lucasfilm’s
    STAR WARS, the Company may also incur amortization expense on
    property right-based assets acquired from the licensor of such
    properties, further impacting profits earned on these products.

The Company’s long-term strategy also focuses on extending
    its brands further into the digital world. As part of this
    strategy, the Company entered into a multi-year strategic
    agreement with Electronic Arts Inc. (“EA”) in 2007.
    The agreement gives EA the exclusive worldwide rights, subject
    to existing limitations on the Company’s rights and certain
    other exclusions, to create digital games for all platforms,
    such as mobile phones, gaming consoles and personal computers,
    based on a broad spectrum of the Company’s intellectual
    properties, including MONOPOLY, SCRABBLE, YAHTZEE, NERF, TONKA,
    G.I. JOE and LITTLEST PET SHOP. A number of products under this
    agreement have been released in 2008 and 2009 and the line will
    continue to be updated and expanded in 2010.

The Company is also investing to grow its business in emerging
    markets. During the last two years, the Company expanded its
    operations in China, Brazil, Russia, Korea, Romania and the
    Czech Republic. In



addition, the Company is seeking to grow its business in
    entertainment and digital gaming, and will continue to evaluate
    strategic alliances and acquisitions which may complement its
    current product offerings, allow it entry into an area which is
    adjacent to or complementary to the toy and game business, or
    allow it to further develop awareness of its brands and expand
    the ability of consumers to experience its brands in different
    forms of media. In addition to the Discovery joint venture
    discussed above, another example of this includes the
    acquisition of Cranium, Inc., a developer and marketer of
    CRANIUM branded games and related products, in 2008. In
    addition, in the second quarter of 2008, the Company acquired
    the rights to TRIVIAL PURSUIT, a brand which the Company had
    previously licensed on a long-term basis. Ownership of the
    rights will allow the Company to further leverage the brand in
    different media. In 2009, the Company continued to expand its
    brand portfolio through several smaller brand acquisitions that
    it believes will be complementary to its core brands.

While the Company remains committed to investing in the growth
    of its business, it also continues to be focused on reducing
    fixed costs through efficiencies and on profit improvement. Over
    the last 7 years the Company has improved its full year
    operating margin from 7.8% in 2002 to 14.5% in 2009. The Company
    reviews its operations on an ongoing basis and seeks to reduce
    the cost structure of its underlying business and promote
    efficiency.

In recent years, the Company has been seeking to return excess
    cash to its shareholders through share repurchases and
    dividends. As part of this initiative, over the last five years,
    the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”)
    has adopted four successive share repurchase authorizations with
    a cumulative authorized repurchase amount of $1,700,000. After
    fully exhausting the prior three authorizations, the fourth
    authorization was approved on February 7, 2008 for
    $500,000. For the years ended 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company
    spent $90,994, $357,589 and $587,004, respectively, to
    repurchase 3,172, 11,736 and 20,795 shares, respectively,
    in the open market. Also in 2007, the Company paid $200,000 in
    cash to repurchase exercisable warrants for 15,750 shares
    of the Company’s common stock. The Company intends to, at
    its discretion, opportunistically repurchase shares in the
    future subject to market conditions. At December 27, 2009,
    the Company had $161,434 remaining under the February 2008
    authorization. In addition, in February 2010 the Company
    announced an increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.25 per
    share.

During 2009, the Company operated in an environment of both a
    stronger U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies
    compared to 2008 as well as weakened overall economic
    conditions. Accordingly, the Company has sought to mitigate the
    impact of these conditions by instituting a variety of cost
    control initiatives. As of December 27, 2009 the Company
    had $636,045 in cash and cash equivalents and had available
    capacity, if needed, under its revolving credit agreement and
    accounts receivable securitization program. In connection with
    the announcement of a joint venture agreement with Discovery in
    April 2009, the Company made a $300,000 cash payment to purchase
    its 50% share of the joint venture. The Company funded its
    investment through the issuance of debt with a principal amount
    of $425,000 in May 2009. The Company believes that the funds
    available to it, including cash expected to be generated from
    operations and funds available through its available lines of
    credit, accounts receivable securitization program and other
    borrowing facilities are adequate to meet its working capital
    needs for 2010.

Results
    of Operations

Each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended
    December 27, 2009 were fifty-two week periods.

Net earnings for the fiscal year ended December 27, 2009
    were $374,930, or $2.48 per diluted share. This compares to net
    earnings for fiscal 2008 and 2007 of $306,766 and $333,003, or
    $2.00 and $1.97 per diluted share, respectively.

Net earnings for 2009 include dilution from the Company’s
    investment in the joint venture with Discovery and its issuance
    of $425,000 of long-term debt, both of which closed in May 2009,
    as well as the

start-up

of
    the Company’s internal television studio. Net earnings for
    2007 includes non-operating expense related to the change in
    fair value of certain warrants required to be classified as a
    liability of $44,370. These warrants were repurchased during May
    2007. Net earnings for 2007 also includes a favorable tax
    adjustment of $29,619 related to the recognition of certain
    previously unrecognized tax benefits.

In January 2008, the Company acquired Cranium, Inc.
    (“Cranium”). The results of operations for 2008
    include the operations of Cranium from the acquisition closing
    date of January 25, 2008.

Consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 27,
    2009 were $4,067,947 compared to $4,021,520 in 2008 and
    $3,837,557 in 2007. Most of the Company’s net revenues and
    operating profits were derived from its three principal
    segments: the U.S. and Canada segment, the International
    segment and the Entertainment and Licensing segment, which are
    discussed in detail below. Consolidated net revenues in 2009
    were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation of
    approximately $65,200 as a result of the stronger
    U.S. dollar in 2009 as compared to 2008. Consolidated net
    revenues in 2008 were also negatively impacted by foreign
    currency translation of approximately $10,300 as a result of the
    stronger U.S. dollar in 2008 as compared to 2007.

U.S.
    and Canada

U.S. and Canada segment net revenues for the year ended
    December 27, 2009 increased 2% to $2,447,943 from
    $2,406,745 in 2008. The increase in net revenues in 2009 was
    primarily due to increased revenues in the boys’ toys
    category, primarily as a result of increased sales of
    TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE products due to the theatrical
    releases of

TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN

in June
    2009 and

G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA

in August 2009, as
    well as increased sales of NERF products. Increased sales in the
    boys’ toys category were partially offset by decreased
    sales of STAR WARS, MARVEL and INDIANA JONES products. The
    increase in U.S. and Canada segment net revenues for 2009
    was also due to increased revenues in the preschool category
    primarily resulting from higher sales of TONKA and PLAY-DOH
    products, partially offset by decreased sales of PLAYSKOOL
    products. Revenues from sales of PLAYSKOOL products declined
    primarily as a result of decreased sales of ROSE PETAL COTTAGE
    products which are no longer in the Company’s product line.
    Revenues from the girls’ toys category decreased primarily
    as a result of lower sales of BABY ALIVE and I-DOG products,
    partially offset by sales of STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE products which
    were reintroduced to the Company’s line in the second
    quarter of 2009. Although revenues from LITTLEST PET SHOP
    products decreased slightly in 2009, sales of these products
    remained a significant contributor to U.S. and Canada
    segment net revenues in 2009. Net revenues in the games and
    puzzles category decreased slightly in 2009, primarily due to
    decreased sales of traditional board games, partially offset by
    increased revenues from sales of MAGIC: THE GATHERING trading
    cards. Net revenues in 2009 were also negatively impacted by
    decreased sales of TOOTH TUNES products, which have been
    discontinued in the Company’s product line.

U.S. and Canada operating profit increased to $380,580 in
    2009 from $283,152 in 2008. Operating profit in 2009 was
    positively impacted by approximately $3,100 due to the
    translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar.
    U.S. and Canada gross profit increased in 2009 primarily as
    a result of the increased revenues discussed above, lower
    obsolescence charges, and a change in the mix of products sold,
    primarily due to increased sales of entertainment-based products
    in 2009 as compared to 2008. The increase in operating profit
    for 2009 also reflects decreased selling, distribution and
    administration expenses which primarily reflect lower shipping
    and distribution costs as well as decreased marketing and sales
    expenses. In addition, operating profit increased as a result of
    decreased advertising expense.

U.S. and Canada segment net revenues for the year ended
    December 28, 2008 increased 5% to $2,406,745 from
    $2,293,742 in 2007. The impact of foreign currency translation
    on U.S. and Canada segment net revenues in 2008 was
    unfavorable and decreased net revenues by approximately $3,100.
    The increase in net revenues in 2008 was primarily due to higher
    revenues in the boys’ toys category, driven by increased
    sales of STAR WARS and NERF products and sales of INDIANA JONES
    products. Although revenues from TRANSFORMERS and MARVEL
    products decreased in 2008 compared to 2007, as a result of the
    significant sales recognized in the prior year due to the
    theatrical releases of

TRANSFORMERS

in July 2007 and

SPIDER-MAN 3

in May 2007, these lines remained
    significant contributors to U.S. and Canada segment net
    revenues in 2008. The overall increase in segment net revenues
    for 2008 was also due to increased revenues in



the games and puzzles category as a result of increased sales of
    DUEL MASTERS and TRIVIAL PURSUIT games and the impact of the
    acquisition of Cranium, partially offset by decreased revenues
    from plug and play games, as well as increased sales of products
    in the preschool category. Revenues from the girls’ toys
    category decreased primarily as a result of decreased sales of
    I-DOG, and to a lesser extent, decreased revenues from MY LITTLE
    PONY, FURREAL FRIENDS, and LITTLEST PET SHOP. Although revenues
    from LITTLEST PET SHOP decreased slightly in 2008, sales of
    these products remained a significant contributor to
    U.S. and Canada segment net revenues in 2008. Decreases in
    girls’ toys net revenues were partially offset by increased
    sales as a result of the reintroduction of EASY-BAKE oven.
    Revenues in 2008 were also negatively impacted by decreased
    sales of TOOTH TUNES and POWER TOUR GUITAR, which are no longer
    in the Company’s product line.

U.S. and Canada operating profit decreased to $283,152 in
    2008 from $287,800 in 2007. Operating profit in 2008 was
    negatively impacted by approximately $1,100 due to the
    translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar.
    U.S. and Canada segment gross profits increased in dollars
    but decreased as a percentage of net revenues in 2008 primarily
    as a result of the increased promotional programs implemented by
    the Company in the fourth quarter of 2008, including the
    provision of sales allowances and markdowns, to address the weak
    retail environment. The increase in gross profit in dollars was
    more than offset by increased product development and sales and
    marketing expenses related to investments the Company made in
    both core brands and its digital initiative related to its
    Wizards of the Coast subsidiary; increased amortization as a
    result of the acquisition of Cranium and the purchase of
    intellectual property rights related to TRIVIAL PURSUIT;
    increased royalty expense; and increased shipping and
    distribution costs, reflecting higher sales volume and higher
    transportation costs.

International

International segment net revenues for the year ended
    December 27, 2009 decreased by 3% to $1,459,476 from
    $1,499,334 in 2008. In 2009, net revenues were negatively
    impacted by currency translation of approximately $64,500 as a
    result of a stronger U.S. dollar. Excluding the unfavorable
    impact of foreign exchange, International segment net revenues
    increased 2% in local currency in 2009. The increase in local
    currency net revenues was driven by increased sales in the
    boys’ toys category, primarily as a result of increased
    sales of TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE products, as well as
    increased sales of NERF products. Increases in boys’ toys
    net revenues were partially offset by lower revenues from
    MARVEL, ACTION MAN, INDIANA JONES and STAR WARS products. Net
    revenues in the girls’ toys category decreased primarily as
    a result of decreased sales of MY LITTLE PONY and FURREAL
    FRIENDS products, partially offset by increased sales of
    LITTLEST PET SHOP products and sales of STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE
    products, which were reintroduced to the Company’s line in
    the second quarter of 2009. Net revenues in the preschool
    category decreased primarily as a result of decreased revenues
    from sales of IN THE NIGHT GARDEN and PLAYSKOOL products,
    partially offset by increased revenues from sales of PLAY-DOH
    products. Net revenues in the games and puzzles category
    decreased slightly as a result of decreased sales of board
    games. Net revenues in 2009 were also negatively impacted by
    decreased sales of TOOTH TUNES products, which have been
    discontinued in the Company’s product line.

International segment operating profit decreased 2% to $162,159
    in 2009 from $165,186 in 2008. Operating profit for the
    International segment in 2009 was positively impacted by
    approximately $9,500 due to the translation of foreign
    currencies to the U.S. dollar. Increased local currency
    gross profit in 2009 as a result of the increased net revenues
    discussed above was more than offset by increased operating
    expenses, including the impact of our investments in opening
    offices in emerging international markets. In addition,
    International segment operating profit in 2008 was positively
    impacted by the recognition of a pension surplus in the United
    Kingdom of approximately $6,000.

International segment net revenues for the year ended
    December 28, 2008 increased by 4% to $1,499,334 from
    $1,444,863 in 2007. In 2008 net revenues were negatively
    impacted by currency translation of approximately $7,400 as a
    result of a stronger U.S. dollar. The increase in net
    revenues was primarily the result of increased product sales in
    the girls’ toys and preschool categories primarily relating
    to LITTLEST PET SHOP in the girls’ toys category and IN THE
    NIGHT GARDEN and PLAYSKOOL products in the



preschool category. Net revenues in the games and puzzles
    category decreased primarily as a result of decreased revenues
    from MAGIC: THE GATHERING products, TRIVIAL PURSUIT products and
    MONOPOLY products. Net revenues in the boys’ toys category
    decreased primarily as a result of decreased sales of MARVEL and
    TRANSFORMERS products, however, both product lines continued to
    be significant contributors to International segment net
    revenues in 2008. Decreased net revenues in the boys’ toys
    category were partially offset by increased sales of STAR WARS
    and NERF products and sales of INDIANA JONES products.
    International segment net revenues in 2008 were also negatively
    impacted by decreased sales of POWER TOUR GUITAR, which was no
    longer in the Company’s product line.

International segment operating profit decreased 13% to $165,186
    in 2008 from $189,783 in 2007. Operating profit for the
    International segment in 2008 was negatively impacted by
    approximately $4,400 due to the translation of foreign
    currencies to the U.S. dollar. The decrease in
    International segment operating profit also reflects promotional
    programs implemented by the Company in the fourth quarter of
    2008 in response to weakened retail conditions; increased
    advertising expense; and increased investments in emerging
    markets; partially offset by lower royalty expense as a result
    of lower sales of entertainment-based products. In addition,
    International segment operating profit in 2008 was positively
    impacted by the recognition of a pension surplus in the United
    Kingdom.

Entertainment
    and Licensing

During the second quarter of 2009, the Company changed the name
    of its Other segment to the Entertainment and Licensing segment.
    This segment includes the Company’s lifestyle licensing,
    digital gaming, movie, television and online entertainment
    operations. The Entertainment and Licensing segment’s net
    revenues for the year ended December 27, 2009 increased 44%
    to $155,013 from $107,929 for the year ended December 28,
    2008. The increase was primarily due to higher lifestyle and
    digital gaming licensing revenues, primarily relating to
    TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE licensed products.

Entertainment and Licensing segment operating profit increased
    28% to $65,572 in 2009 from $51,035 in 2008. Operating profit
    increased as a result of the higher revenues discussed above,
    partially offset by increased selling, distribution and
    administrative expenses which included approximately $7,200 in
    transaction costs related to the Company’s investment in
    the joint venture with Discovery,

start-up

costs associated with the Company’s television studio, as
    well as increased intangible amortization and royalty expense.
    While the Discovery joint venture is a component of our
    television operations, the Company’s 50% share in the
    earnings from the joint venture are included in other (income)
    expense and therefore are not a component of operating profit of
    the segment.

The Entertainment and Licensing segment’s net revenues for
    the year ended December 28, 2008 increased 24% to $107,929
    from $87,245 for the year ended December 30, 2007. The
    increase reflects licensing revenues related to the
    Company’s partnership with EA to develop digital games
    based on the Company’s intellectual property. EA began
    introducing products based on the Company’s intellectual
    property in 2008. The increase in revenues from the introduction
    of these products offset decreases in lifestyle licensing
    revenues as a result of the significant licensing revenues in
    2007 related to the

TRANSFORMERS

motion picture.

Entertainment and Licensing segment operating profit increased
    31% to $51,035 in 2008 from $38,881 in 2007. Operating profit
    for 2008 increased as a result of the higher revenues discussed
    above, partially offset by increased selling, distribution and
    administrative expenses.

Gross
    Profit

The Company’s gross profit margin increased to 58.8% for
    the year ended December 27, 2009 from 57.9% in 2008. The
    increase was partially due to a change in the mix of revenues
    reflecting higher licensing revenues in 2009. In addition, the
    increased gross profit reflects a change in product mix
    primarily due to increased sales of entertainment-based products
    in 2009 as compared to 2008. While gross profits of theatrical
    entertainment-based products are generally higher than many of
    the Company’s other products, sales from these products,
    including Company owned or controlled brands based on a movie
    release, also incur royalty expense. Such royalties reduce the
    benefit of these higher gross margins. Gross profits in 2009
    were also



positively impacted by lower obsolescence charges. In addition,
    gross profit in 2008 was negatively impacted by the incremental
    promotional programs discussed below.

The Company’s gross profit margin decreased to 57.9% for
    the year ended December 28, 2008 from 58.9% in 2007. The
    decrease was primarily due to incremental promotional programs,
    including sales allowances and markdowns, implemented in the
    fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the weak retail
    environment, as well as changes in product mix. Decreases in
    gross profit as the result of input cost inflation were
    partially offset by cost savings initiatives and an increase in
    pricing of certain of the Company’s products. Gross profit
    in 2007 was also negatively impacted by approximately $10,400 in
    charges related to the recall of the Company’s EASY-BAKE
    oven product and by a charge of approximately $10,000 related to
    a restructuring and related reduction in work force at the
    Company’s manufacturing facility in East Longmeadow,
    Massachusetts.

Expenses

The Company’s operating expenses, stated as percentages of
    net revenues, are illustrated below for the three fiscal years
    ended December 27, 2009:




Amortization

Amortization expense increased to $85,029 or 2.1% of net
    revenues in 2009 compared to $78,265 or 1.9% of net revenues in
    2008. The increase is primarily a result of accelerated
    amortization related to a write-down of the carrying value of
    certain property rights. Amortization expense increased to
    $78,265 or 1.9% of net revenues in 2008 compared to $67,716 or
    1.8% of net revenues in 2007. The increase was primarily the
    result of the acquisition of Cranium in January 2008 and the
    purchase of the intellectual property rights related to TRIVIAL
    PURSUIT in the second quarter of 2008. Property rights of
    $68,500 and $80,800 were recorded as a result of the Cranium
    acquisition and the purchase of TRIVIAL PURSUIT, respectively,
    and are each being amortized over fifteen years. The Company
    expects amortization expense to decrease in 2010 primarily as a
    result of the property rights related to Wizards of the Coast
    becoming fully amortized in the fourth quarter of 2009.
    Accordingly, based on the Company’s current property
    rights, the Company expects amortization expense to be
    approximately $49,000 in 2010.

Royalty expense increased to $330,651 or 8.1% of net revenues in
    2009 compared to $312,986 or 7.8% of net revenues in 2008. The
    increase in royalty expense is primarily the result of increased
    sales of entertainment-driven products, including TRANSFORMERS
    and G.I. JOE, partially offset by the impact of foreign
    exchange. Royalty expense decreased to $312,986 or 7.8% of net
    revenues in 2008 compared to $316,807 or 8.2% of net revenues in
    2007. The decrease in royalty expense was primarily the result
    of the impact of foreign exchange. Absent this foreign exchange
    impact, royalty expense decreased slightly as the result of
    slightly lower sales of entertainment-based products.

Research and product development expense decreased in 2009 to
    $181,195 or 4.5% of net revenues from $191,424 or 4.8% of net
    revenues in 2008. The decrease in 2009 primarily reflects an
    effort to reduce the Company’s overall SKU count and make
    research and development spending more efficient as part of the
    Company’s ongoing cost control efforts. Research and
    product development expense increased in 2008 to $191,424 or
    4.8% of net revenues from $167,194 or 4.4% of net revenues in
    2007. The increase in 2008 reflected higher investments in the
    Company’s core brands, increased expenditures relating to
    the Company’s digital initiatives, as well as additional
    expenses as a result of the Company’s Cranium acquisition.
    The Company expects research and product development expense to
    increase in 2010, primarily as a result of costs associated with
    the development of products related to the Company’s
    agreement with Sesame Workshop as well as other
    entertainment-related properties.



Advertising expense decreased to $412,580 or 10.1% of net
    revenues in 2009 compared to $454,612 or 11.3% of net revenues
    in 2008. In years in which the Company has significant sales of
    products related to major motion picture releases, such as in
    2009, advertising expense as a percentage of revenue is
    generally lower, as such products do not require the same level
    of advertising that the Company spends on non-entertainment
    based products. The decrease in advertising expense in 2009 also
    reflects lower advertisement placement costs as well as the
    impact of foreign exchange. Advertising expense increased in
    dollars to $454,612 in 2008 from $434,742 in 2007, but remained
    flat as a percentage of net revenues at 11.3%. The increase in
    dollars was primarily the result of higher spending to increase
    awareness of the Company’s brands.

Selling, distribution and administration expenses decreased to
    $793,558 or 19.5% of net revenues in 2009, compared to $797,209
    or 19.8% of net revenues in 2008. Absent the impact of foreign
    exchange, selling, distribution and administration expenses
    increased in 2009. Included in selling, distribution and
    administration expenses in 2009 were approximately $7,200 in
    transaction costs related to the Company’s purchase of a
    50% interest in the joint venture with Discovery. The increase
    in selling, distribution and administration expense in 2009 also
    reflects higher incentive compensation expense as well as costs
    related to the start up of the Company’s television studio
    and continued investments in emerging markets. Selling,
    distribution and administration expense in 2009 was also
    positively impacted by lower shipping and distribution costs in
    2009. In addition, selling, distribution and administration
    expenses in 2008 were positively impacted by the recognition of
    a pension surplus in the United Kingdom of approximately $6,000.
    Selling, distribution and administration expenses increased to
    $797,209 or 19.8% of net revenues in 2008, compared to $755,127
    or 19.7% of net revenues in 2007. The increase reflected
    increased sales and marketing expenses to support the growth in
    the business; increased investment in the expansion into
    emerging markets, including Brazil, China, Russia, the Czech
    Republic and Korea; increased investment in the Company’s
    digital and entertainment strategies; and increased shipping and
    distribution costs associated with both increased sales volume
    and higher transportation costs.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense increased to $61,603 in 2009 from $47,143 in
    2008. The increase in interest expense reflects both higher
    outstanding borrowings and a higher average borrowing rate as a
    result of the issuance of $425,000 of notes in May 2009. The
    proceeds from the issuance of notes in May 2009 were primarily
    used to purchase a 50% interest in the joint venture with
    Discovery. Interest expense in 2009 also includes approximately
    $4,000 in costs related to a short-term borrowing facility
    commitment the Company entered into in April 2009 in connection
    with the Company’s anticipated investment in the joint
    venture with Discovery. In addition, interest expense in 2009
    includes amounts related to the Company’s tax sharing
    agreement with Discovery.

Interest expense increased to $47,143 in 2008 from $34,618 in
    2007. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result
    of higher average borrowings in 2008 primarily as a result of
    the issuance of $350,000 of notes in September 2007, partially
    offset by the repayment of $135,092 of notes in July 2008. The
    increase in the average borrowing rate for 2008 from the
    issuance of long-term debt in 2007 was more than offset by
    decreases in the average borrowing rate on short-term debt in
    2008 as well as the repayment of 6.15% notes in July 2008.

Interest
    Income

Interest income was $2,858 in 2009 compared to $17,654 in 2008.
    The decrease in interest income was primarily the result of
    lower returns on invested cash as well as lower average invested
    cash balances. Interest income was $17,654 in 2008 compared to
    $29,973 in 2007. The decrease in interest income in 2008 from
    2007 was primarily the result of lower returns on invested cash.
    In addition, during a portion of 2007, the Company invested
    excess cash in auction rate securities, which generated a higher
    rate of return and contributed to the higher level of interest
    income in 2007.



Other
    (Income) Expense, Net

Other (income) expense, net of $156 in 2009 compares to $23,752
    in 2008. Other (income) expense, net in 2009 includes income of
    $(3,856) representing the Company’s 50% share in the
    earnings of the joint venture with Discovery. The remainder of
    the change in other (income) expense in 2009 as compared to 2008
    primarily reflects the impact of foreign exchange gains and
    losses.

Other (income) expense, net of $23,752 in 2008 compares to
    $52,323 in 2007. In 2007 the major component of other (income)
    expense related to the change in fair value of the Lucas
    warrants, which were required to be classified as a liability.
    These warrants were required to be adjusted to their fair value
    each quarter through earnings. In May 2007, the Company
    exercised the call option on these warrants and repurchased them
    for $200,000 in cash, which approximated fair value at that
    date. As these warrants were repurchased in 2007, there was no
    fair value adjustment in 2008. For 2007, expense related to the
    change in fair value of these warrants was $44,370. Absent the
    impact of the fair value adjustments, increased expense in 2008
    primarily relates to increased foreign exchange losses arising
    from the impact of the large downward movement in foreign
    exchange rates, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2008, on

non-U.S. denominated

intercompany balances.

Income
    Taxes

Income tax expense totaled 29.2% of pretax earnings in 2009
    compared with 30.4% in 2008 and 28.0% in 2007. Income tax
    expense for 2009 is net of a benefit of approximately $2,300 of
    discrete tax events, primarily related to the expiration of
    state statutes and settlement of various tax examinations in
    multiple jurisdictions. Income tax expense for 2008 is net of a
    benefit of approximately $10,200 related to discrete tax events,
    primarily comprised of a benefit from the repatriation of
    certain foreign earnings, as well as the settlement of various
    tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. Income tax expense
    for 2007 was net of a benefit of $29,999 related to discrete tax
    events, primarily relating to the recognition of previously
    unrecognized tax benefits. Absent these items and potential
    interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in
    2009, 2008 and 2007, the effective tax rates would have been
    29.0%, 32.8% and 30.5%, respectively. The decrease in the
    adjusted tax rate from 32.8% in 2008 compared to 29.0% in 2009
    primarily reflects the decision to provide for the repatriation
    of a portion of 2008 international earnings to the U.S. The
    increase in the adjusted rate to 32.8% in 2008 from 30.5% in
    2007 primarily reflects the change in the mix of where the
    Company earned its profits.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The Company has historically generated a significant amount of
    cash from operations. In 2009, the Company funded its operations
    and liquidity needs primarily through cash flows from
    operations, and, when needed, using borrowings under its
    available lines of credit and proceeds from its accounts
    receivable securitization program. During 2010, the Company
    expects to continue to fund its working capital needs primarily
    through cash flows from operations and, when needed, using
    borrowings under its available lines of credit and proceeds from
    its accounts receivable securitization program. The Company
    believes that the funds available to it, including cash expected
    to be generated from operations and funds available through its
    available lines of credit and accounts receivable securitization
    program are adequate to meet its working capital needs for 2010,
    however, unexpected events or circumstances such as material
    operating losses or increased capital or other expenditures may
    reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial
    resources. In addition, significant disruptions to credit
    markets may also reduce or eliminate the availability of
    external financial resources. Although we believe the risk of
    nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial facilities
    is not significant, in times of severe economic downturn in the
    credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of
    external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding
    to us.

At December 27, 2009, cash and cash equivalents, net of
    short-term borrowings, were $621,932 compared to $622,804 and
    $764,257 at December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007,
    respectively. Hasbro generated $265,623, $593,185 and $601,794
    of cash from its operating activities in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The decrease in 2009 operating cash flows as
    compared to 2008 primarily reflects an increase in accounts



receivable, primarily as a result of the Company’s decision
    not to utilize its securitization program at December 27,
    2009. At December 28, 2008, $250,000 was utilized under the
    program. In 2009, operating cash flows were also impacted by
    increased royalty payments, including a $50,000 guaranteed
    royalty payment to Marvel related to the extension of the
    current agreement and a $25,000 guaranteed royalty payment to
    the Discovery joint venture. Further, the decrease in inventory
    had a positive impact on 2009 operating cash flows. In 2007
    operating cash flows were impacted by royalty advances paid of
    $70,000 related to the Marvel license. In addition,
    2007 net earnings included non-cash expense of $44,370
    related to the fair value adjustment of the Lucas warrants that
    were repurchased in May of 2007. The remaining decrease in 2008
    operating cash flows was due to decreased net earnings in 2008
    compared to 2007.

Accounts receivable increased to $1,038,802 at December 27,
    2009 from $611,766 at December 28, 2008. The accounts
    receivable balance at December 27, 2009 includes an
    increase of approximately $33,200 as a result of a weaker
    U.S. dollar at December 27, 2009 as compared to
    December 28, 2008. Absent the effect of foreign exchange,
    the increase in accounts receivable primarily reflects the
    utilization of the Company’s securitization program at
    December 28, 2008 of $250,000. At December 27, 2009,
    based on the Company’s cash position and liquidity needs,
    there was no utilization of the securitization program. The
    increase in accounts receivable also reflects higher sales, and
    the timing of those sales, in the fourth quarter of 2009 as
    compared to 2008. Accounts receivable decreased to $611,766 at
    December 28, 2008 from $654,789 at December 30, 2007.
    The accounts receivable balance at December 28, 2008
    includes a decrease of approximately $61,100 as a result of the
    stronger U.S. dollar in 2008 as compared to 2007. Absent
    the impact of foreign exchange, accounts receivable increased
    slightly. Fourth quarter days sales outstanding were
    68 days in 2009 and 45 days in both 2008 and 2007.
    Absent the impact of securitization, days sales outstanding
    would have been 63 days in 2008 and 2007.

Inventories decreased to $207,895 at December 27, 2009
    compared to $300,463 at December 28, 2008. The decrease
    primarily reflects higher inventory levels at December 28,
    2008 due to decreased sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 as
    well as increased sales in the fourth quarter of 2009.
    Inventories increased to $300,463 at December 28, 2008 from
    $259,081 at December 30, 2007. The increase was primarily
    related to lower revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a
    result of the weak retail environment and, to a lesser extent,
    inventory balances related to newly opened operations in
    emerging markets. The December 28, 2008 inventory balance
    includes a decrease of approximately $20,900 as a result of the
    currency impact of the stronger U.S. dollar at
    December 28, 2008 compared to December 30, 2007.

Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased to $162,290
    at December 27, 2009 from $171,387 at December 28,
    2008. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the value
    of the Company’s foreign currency contracts as a result of
    the weakening U.S. dollar, partially offset by purchases of
    short-term investments of $18,000 in 2009, which are reflected
    as an investing activity in the accompanying consolidated
    statement of cash flows. Prepaid expenses and other current
    assets decreased to $171,387 at December 28, 2008 from
    $199,912 at December 30, 2007. This decrease was primarily
    due to utilization of a portion of the Marvel and the remainder
    of the Lucas prepaid royalty advances. Generally, when the
    Company enters into a licensing agreement for
    entertainment-based properties, an advance royalty payment is
    required at the inception of the agreement. This payment is then
    recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as the
    related sales are made. At December 28, 2008, the Company
    had prepaid royalties related to the Marvel license in both
    current and non-current assets. Each reporting period, the
    Company reflects as current prepaid expense the amount of
    royalties it expects to reflect in the statement of operations
    in the upcoming twelve months. The decrease in prepaid expenses
    and other current assets in 2008 was partially offset by an
    increase in the value of the Company’s foreign currency
    contracts as a result of the strengthened U.S. dollar at
    December 28, 2008.

Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to $801,775 at
    December 27, 2009 from $792,306 at December 28, 2008.
    The accounts payable and accrued expenses balance at
    December 27, 2009 includes an increase of approximately
    $17,700 as a result of a weaker U.S. dollar at
    December 27, 2009 as compared to December 28, 2008.
    Absent the impact of foreign exchange, accounts payable and
    accrued expenses decreased approximately $8,300. Decreases in
    accounts payable and accrued expenses in 2009 primarily relate
    to decreased accrued pension benefits, as well as lower accounts
    payable. These decreases were partially offset



by higher accrued payroll and management incentives at
    December 27, 2009. Accounts payable and accrued expenses
    increased to $792,306 at December 28, 2008 from $742,122 at
    December 30, 2007. The increase was primarily the result of
    increased accrued royalties as a result of the utilization of
    the remainder of the Lucas prepaid royalty advance in the third
    quarter of 2008 as well as increased accrued pension primarily
    due to decreases in the Plans’ asset values in 2008. The
    December 28, 2008 accounts payable and accrued expenses
    balance also included a decrease of approximately $64,300 as a
    result of the currency impact of the stronger U.S. dollar
    in 2008 compared to 2007.

Cash flows from investing activities were a net utilization of
    $497,509, $271,920 and $112,465 in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The 2009 utilization includes the Company’s
    $300,000 payment to Discovery for its 50% interest in the joint
    venture, a payment of $45,000 to Lucas to extend the term of the
    license agreement related to the STAR WARS brand and
    approximately $26,500 used to acquire certain other intellectual
    properties. The 2008 utilization includes the Company’s
    purchase of the intellectual property rights related to the
    TRIVIAL PURSUIT brand for a total cost of $80,800 as well as
    $65,153 in cash, net of cash acquired, used to acquire Cranium
    in January 2008. In 2007 the Company reacquired the remaining
    digital gaming rights for its owned or controlled properties
    held by Infogrames Entertainment SA (Infogrames), with the
    exception of rights to DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, for an
    acquisition price of $19,000 which included $18,000 in cash and
    $1,000 of non-cash consideration in the form of the return of
    preferred stock held by the Company in a subsidiary of
    Infogrames. During 2009, the Company expended approximately
    $104,000 on additions to its property, plant and equipment
    compared to $117,000 during 2008 and $92,000 during 2007. Of
    these amounts, 58% in 2009, 56% in 2008 and 61% in 2007 were for
    purchases of tools, dies and molds related to the Company’s
    products. In 2010, the Company expects capital expenditures to
    increase and be in the range of $120,000 to $140,000. During the
    three years ended December 27, 2009, depreciation of plant
    and equipment was $95,934, $87,873 and $88,804, respectively.

The Company commits to inventory production, advertising and
    marketing expenditures prior to the peak third and fourth
    quarter retail selling season. Accounts receivable increase
    during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their
    purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday
    season. Due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling
    period, payments for these accounts receivable are generally not
    due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of
    the subsequent year. This timing difference between expenditures
    and cash collections on accounts receivable makes it necessary
    for the Company to borrow higher amounts during the latter part
    of the year. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company primarily
    utilized cash from operations, borrowings under its available
    lines of credit and its accounts receivable securitization
    program to fund its operations.

The Company is party to an accounts receivable securitization
    program whereby the Company sells, on an ongoing basis,
    substantially all of its U.S. trade accounts receivable to
    a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, Hasbro Receivables
    Funding, LLC (“HRF”). HRF is consolidated with the
    Company for financial reporting purposes. The securitization
    program then allows HRF to sell, on a revolving basis, an
    undivided fractional ownership interest of up to $250,000 in the
    eligible receivables it holds to certain bank conduits. During
    the period from the first day of the October fiscal month
    through the last day of the following January fiscal month, this
    limit previously was increased to $300,000. The program provides
    the Company with a source of working capital. Based on the
    amount of eligible accounts receivable as of December 27,
    2009, the Company had availability under this program to sell
    $300,000, of which no amounts were utilized. In 2010, the
    facility was amended to extend the agreement through January
    2011. Pursuant to this amendment, the limit will be $250,000 for
    the extension period.

The Company has a revolving credit agreement (the
    “Agreement”) which provides it with a $300,000
    committed borrowing facility. The Company has the ability to
    request increases in the committed facility in additional
    increments of at least $50,000, subject to lender agreement, up
    to a total committed facility of $500,000. The Agreement
    contains certain financial covenants setting forth leverage and
    coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of
    an investment grade facility, including with respect to liens,
    mergers and incurrence of indebtedness. The Company was in
    compliance with all covenants as of and for the fiscal year
    ended December 27, 2009. The Company had no borrowings
    outstanding under its committed revolving credit facility at
    December 27, 2009. However, letters of credit outstanding
    under this facility as of



December 27, 2009 were approximately $1,400. Amounts
    available and unused under the committed line at
    December 27, 2009 were approximately $298,600. The Company
    also has other uncommitted lines from various banks, of which
    approximately $42,100 was utilized at December 27, 2009. Of
    the amount utilized under the uncommitted lines, approximately
    $13,500 and $28,600 represent outstanding borrowings and letters
    of credit, respectively.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $236,779 in 2009.
    Of this amount, $421,309 reflects net proceeds from the issuance
    of long-term notes in May 2009. In addition, cash receipts from
    the exercise of employee stock options in 2009 were $9,193.
    These sources of cash were partially offset by $88,112, which
    includes transaction costs, used to repurchase shares of the
    Company’s common stock. During 2009, the Company
    repurchased 3,172 shares at an average price per share of
    $28.67. At December 27, 2009, $161,434 remained under the
    February 2008 authorization. Dividends paid were $111,458 in
    2009 compared to $107,065 in 2008.

Net cash utilized by financing activities was $457,391 in 2008.
    Of this amount, $360,244, which includes transaction costs, was
    used to repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock. In
    February 2008 the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
    the repurchase of an additional $500,000 in common stock after
    three previous authorizations dated May 2005, July 2006 and
    August 2007 with a cumulative authorized repurchase amount of
    $1,200,000 were fully utilized. During 2008, the Company
    repurchased 11,736 shares at an average price per share of
    $30.44. Dividends paid were $107,065 in 2008 compared to $94,097
    in 2007, reflecting the increase in the Company’s quarterly
    dividend rate to $0.20 per share in 2008 from $0.16 per share in
    2007, and net of the effect of decreased shares outstanding in
    2008 as a result of the share repurchases. In addition, $135,092
    was used to repay long-term debt. These uses of cash were
    partially offset by cash receipts of $120,895 from the exercise
    of employee stock options.

Net cash utilized by financing activities was $433,917 in 2007.
    Of this amount, $584,349, which includes transaction costs, was
    used to repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock.
    During 2007, the Company repurchased 20,795 shares at an
    average price per share of $28.20. In addition, the Company
    purchased certain warrants in May 2007 for $200,000 in
    accordance with the terms of the call provision of the amended
    Lucas warrant agreement. Dividends paid were $94,097 in 2007.
    These uses of cash were partially offset by net proceeds of
    $346,009 from the issuance of $350,000 of notes that are due in
    2017. The proceeds from the notes were primarily used to repay
    short-term borrowings. The uses of cash were also partially
    offset by cash receipts of $82,661 from the exercise of employee
    stock options.

At December 27, 2009, the Company has outstanding $249,828
    in principal amount of senior convertible debentures due 2021.
    The senior convertible debentures bear interest at 2.75%, which
    could be subject to an upward adjustment in the rate, not to
    exceed 11%, should the price of the Company’s common stock
    trade at or below $9.72 per share for 20 of the 30 trading days
    preceding the fifth day prior to an interest payment date. This
    contingent interest feature represents a derivative instrument
    that is recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value, with
    changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations.
    If the closing price of the Company’s common stock exceeds
    $23.76 for at least 20 trading days, within the 30 consecutive
    trading day period ending on the last trading day of the
    calendar quarter, or upon other specified events, the debentures
    will be convertible at an initial conversion price of $21.60 in
    the next calendar quarter. At December 31, 2008 and each of
    the calendar quarters in 2009 this conversion feature was met
    and the debentures were convertible throughout 2009. There were
    no debentures converted during 2009. At December 31, 2009,
    this conversion feature was met again and the bonds are
    convertible through March 31, 2010 at which time the
    requirements of the conversion feature will be reevaluated. In
    addition, if the closing price of the Company’s common
    stock exceeds $27.00 for at least 20 trading days in any
    30 day period, the Company has the right to call the
    debentures by giving notice to the holders of the debentures.
    During a prescribed notice period, the holders of the debentures
    have the right to convert their debentures in accordance with
    the conversion terms described above. At certain times during
    2009, based on the Company’s common stock price, the
    Company had the right to call the debentures under this
    provision. As of December 27, 2009, the Company had the
    right to call the debentures. The Company believes a call would
    result in conversion by the holders of the debentures and
    issuance of the shares, thereby increasing the number of shares
    outstanding. Historically, based on the Company’s targeted
    capital structure and the low cost of the debentures, when the
    debentures have been



callable the Company has believed that it was more economically
    beneficial for it to not exercise its right to call the
    debentures. Currently, this economic benefit includes a lower
    cash cost of paying interest on the debentures than the Company
    would pay in dividends on the incremental number of shares that
    would be outstanding. The Company will continue to assess, at
    times when it is available, the desirability of exercising the
    call option in the future based on the then existing economic
    circumstances and the Company’s business objectives. The
    holders of these debentures may also put the notes back to
    Hasbro in December 2011 and December 2016 at the original
    principal amount. At that time, the purchase price may be paid
    in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the two, at
    the Company’s discretion. While the Company’s current
    intent is to settle in cash any puts exercised, there can be no
    guarantee that the Company will have the funds necessary to
    settle this obligation in cash.

The $350,000 notes due in 2017 bear interest at a rate of 6.30%,
    which may be adjusted upward in the event that the
    Company’s credit rating from Moody’s Investor
    Services, Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings
    Services or Fitch Ratings is decreased two levels below the
    Company’s credit ratings on September 17, 2007, the
    date of issuance of the notes. On the date of issuance, the
    Company’s ratings from Moody’s Investor Services,
    Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and
    Fitch Ratings were Baa2, BBB and BBB, respectively. There were
    no changes to the Company’s credit ratings from
    Moody’s Investor Services, Inc. or Standard &
    Poor’s Rating Services from the date of issuance through
    December 27, 2009. In March 2009, Fitch Ratings upgraded
    the Company’s credit rating to BBB+. The interest rate
    adjustment is dependent on the degree of decrease of the
    Company’s ratings and could range from 0.25% to a maximum
    of 2.00%. The Company may redeem the notes at its option at the
    greater of the principal amount of the notes or the present
    value of the remaining scheduled payments discounted using the
    effective interest rate on applicable U.S. Treasury bills
    at the time of repurchase.

The $425,000 notes due in 2014 bear interest at a rate of
    6.125%, which may be adjusted upward in the event that the
    Company’s credit rating from Moody’s Investor
    Services, Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings
    Services or Fitch Ratings is reduced to Ba1, BB+, or BB+,
    respectively, or below. From the date of issuance, May 13,
    2009, through December 27, 2009, the Company’s ratings
    from Moody’s Investor Services, Inc., Standard &
    Poor’s Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings were Baa2, BBB,
    and BBB+, respectively. The interest rate adjustment is
    dependent on the degree of decrease of the Company’s
    ratings and could range from 0.25% to a maximum of 2.00%. The
    Company may redeem the notes at its option at the greater of the
    principal amount of the notes or the present value of the
    remaining scheduled payments discounted using the effective
    interest rate on applicable U.S. Treasury bills at the time
    of repurchase.

Including the debentures and notes described above, the Company
    has remaining principal amounts of long-term debt at
    December 27, 2009 of approximately $1,134,723 due at
    varying times from 2014 through 2028. The Company also had
    letters of credit and other similar instruments of approximately
    $135,277 and purchase commitments of $251,917 outstanding at
    December 27, 2009. Letters of credit and similar
    instruments include $105,335 related to the defense of tax
    assessments in Mexico. These assessments relate to transfer
    pricing that the Company is defending and expects to be
    successful in sustaining its position. In addition, the Company
    is committed to guaranteed royalty and other contractual
    payments of approximately $32,761 in 2010.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates

The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. As such, management is required to
    make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it
    believes are reasonable based on information available. These
    estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets
    and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods
    presented. The significant accounting policies which management
    believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and
    evaluating the Company’s reported financial results include
    sales allowances, recoverability of goodwill and intangible
    assets, recoverability of royalty advances and commitments,
    pension costs and obligations, stock-based compensation and
    income taxes.



Sales
    Allowances

Sales allowances for customer promotions, discounts and returns
    are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue
    is recognized. Revenue from product sales is recognized upon
    passing of title to the customer, generally at the time of
    shipment. Revenue from product sales, less related sales
    allowances, is added to royalty revenue and reflected as net
    revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. The
    Company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance
    programs with customers. These allowances primarily relate to
    fixed programs, which the customer earns based on purchases of
    Company products during the year. Discounts and allowances are
    recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale.
    While many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts, certain
    of the allowances, such as the returns allowance, are based on
    market data, historical trends and information from customers
    and are therefore subject to estimation.

For its allowance programs that are not fixed, such as returns,
    the Company estimates these amounts using a combination of
    historical experience and current market conditions. These
    estimates are reviewed periodically against actual results and
    any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or
    decrease to net revenues. During 2009, there have been no
    material adjustments to the Company’s estimates made in
    prior years.

Recoverability
    of Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite
    lives are tested for impairment at least annually. If an event
    occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying
    value may not be recoverable, the Company will perform an
    interim test at that time. The impairment test begins by
    allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable
    reporting units. Goodwill is then tested using a two step
    process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the
    reporting unit using an income approach, which looks to the
    present value of expected future cash flows.

The first step is a screen for potential impairment while the
    second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an
    indication from the first step that one exists. Intangible
    assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by
    comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value
    which is also calculated using an income approach. The
    Company’s annual goodwill impairment test was performed in
    the fourth quarter of 2009 and the estimated fair value of the
    Company’s reporting units with allocated goodwill were
    substantially in excess of their carrying value. Accordingly, no
    impairment was indicated. The Company’s annual impairment
    tests related to intangible assets with indefinite lives were
    also performed in the fourth quarter of 2009 and no impairments
    were indicated. The estimation of future cash flows requires
    significant judgments and estimates with respect to future
    revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash
    outlays related to those revenues. Actual revenues and related
    cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash
    flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in
    an impairment charge. The estimation of discounted cash flows
    also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The
    use of different assumptions would increase or decrease
    estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease
    the related impairment charge. At December 27, 2009, the
    Company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives
    of $551,669 recorded on the balance sheet.

Intangible assets, other than those with indefinite lives, are
    amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for
    indications of impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Recoverability of the value of these intangible
    assets is measured by a comparison of the assets’ carrying
    value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected
    to be generated by the asset. If such assets were considered to
    be impaired, the impairment would be measured by the amount by
    which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value
    based on estimated future discounted cash flows. The estimation
    of future cash flows requires significant judgments and
    estimates with respect to future revenues related to the
    respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those
    revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in
    anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a
    change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge.
    The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the
    selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different
    assumptions would increase or



decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or
    decrease the related impairment charge. Intangible assets
    covered under this policy were $478,829 at December 27,
    2009. During 2009, the Company wrote down certain intangible
    assets by approximately $6,700 to reflect revised expectations
    for the related product lines.

Recoverability
    of Royalty Advances and Commitments

The Company’s ability to earn-out royalty advances and
    contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed
    royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum
    guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related
    cash flow projections to be derived from the related product. If
    sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular
    product do not support the recoverability of the remaining
    minimum guaranty or, if the Company decides to discontinue a
    product line with royalty advances or commitments, a charge to
    royalty expense to write-off the non-recoverable minimum
    guaranty is required. The preparation of revenue forecasts and
    related cash flows for these products requires judgments and
    estimates. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in
    the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to
    these products could result in a change to the assessment of
    recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties. At
    December 27, 2009, the Company had $120,115 of prepaid
    royalties, $43,115 of which are included in prepaid expenses and
    other current assets and $77,000 of which are included in other
    assets.

Pension
    Costs and Obligations

Pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current
    and future benefits using estimates for expected return on
    assets and applicable discount rates. At the end of 2007 the
    Company froze benefits under its two largest pension plans in
    the U.S., with no future benefits accruing to employees. The
    Company will continue to pay benefits under the plan consistent
    with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit
    freeze. The estimates for the Company’s U.S. plans are
    established at the Company’s measurement date. The Company
    uses its fiscal year-end date as its measurement date to measure
    the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the
    expense for the upcoming year.

The Company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted
    average rate based on historical market data for the investment
    classes of assets held by the plan, the allocation of plan
    assets among those investment classes, and the current economic
    environment. Based on this information, the Company’s
    estimate of expected return on U.S. plan assets used in the
    calculation of 2009 pension expense for the U.S. plans was
    8.50%. A decrease in the estimate used for expected return on
    plan assets would increase pension expense, while an increase in
    this estimate would decrease pension expense. A decrease of
    0.25% in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would
    have increased 2009 pension expense for U.S. plans by
    approximately $560.

Discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the
    measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments
    currently available and expected to be available during the
    period to maturity of the pension benefits. The Company’s
    discount rate for its U.S. plans used for the calculation
    of 2009 pension expense averaged 6.20%. A decrease in the
    discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an
    increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense. A
    decrease of 0.25% in the Company’s discount rate would have
    increased 2009 pension expense and the 2009 projected benefit
    obligation by approximately $343 and $8,711, respectively.

Actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are
    accumulated and, if outside a certain corridor, amortized over
    future periods and, therefore affect recognized expense in
    future periods. At December 27, 2009, the Company’s
    U.S. plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of $81,323
    included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings related to
    its defined benefit pension plans compared to $87,906 at
    December 28, 2008. The decrease primarily reflects
    amortization of these actuarial losses in 2009. Pension plan
    assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the
    measurement date. These changes in the fair market value of plan
    assets impact the amount of future pension expense due to
    amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses or gains.



Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company has a stock-based compensation plan for employees
    and non-employee members of the Company’s Board of
    Directors. Under this plan, the Company may grant stock options
    at or above the fair market value of the Company’s stock,
    as well as restricted stock, restricted stock units and
    contingent stock performance awards. The Company measures all
    stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and
    records such expense in its consolidated financial statements.
    Total stock-based compensation expense recognized for the years
    ended December 27, 2009, December 28, 2008 and
    December 30, 2007 was $29,912, $35,221 and $29,402,
    respectively. As of December 27, 2009, total unrecognized
    stock-based compensation cost was approximately $31,684.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value
    stock options that are granted under these plans. The
    Black-Scholes method includes four significant assumptions:
    (1) expected term of the options, (2) risk-free
    interest rate, (3) expected dividend yield, and
    (4) expected stock price volatility. The weighted average
    expected terms used were approximately 4 years for the 2009
    grant and approximately 5 years for the 2008 and 2007 stock
    option grants. These amounts are based on a review of
    employees’ exercise history relating to stock options as
    well as the contractual term of the option. The weighted average
    risk-free interest rates used for 2009, 2008 and 2007 stock
    option grants were 1.87%, 2.71% and 4.79%, respectively. This
    estimate was based on the interest rate available on
    U.S. treasury securities with durations that approximate
    the expected term of the option. The weighted average expected
    dividend yields used for the 2009, 2008 and 2007 stock option
    grants were 3.52%, 2.95% and 1.97%, respectively, which is based
    on the Company’s current annual dividend amount divided by
    the stock price on the date of the grant. The weighted average
    expected stock price volatilities used were 36% for the 2009
    stock option grant and 22% for the 2008 and 2007 stock option
    grants. These amounts were derived using a combination of
    historical price volatility and current implied price
    volatility. Implied price volatility reflects the volatility
    implied in publicly traded options on the Company’s common
    stock, which the Company believes represents the expected future
    volatility of the Company’s stock price. The Company
    believes that since this is a market-based estimate, it provides
    a better estimate of expected future volatility as compared to
    based only on historical volatility. The increase in the stock
    volatility assumption in 2009 reflects the increase in stock
    market volatility at the time of the Company’s 2009 grant.

In 2009, 2008 and 2007, as part of its employee stock-based
    compensation plan, the Company issued contingent stock
    performance awards, which provide the recipients with the
    ability to earn shares of the Company’s common stock based
    on the Company’s achievement of stated cumulative diluted
    earnings per share and cumulative net revenue targets over the
    three fiscal years ended December 2011, December 2010 and
    December 2009 for the 2009, 2008 and 2007 awards, respectively.
    Each award has a target number of shares of common stock
    associated with such award which may be earned by the recipient
    if the Company achieves the stated diluted earnings per share
    and net revenue targets. These awards are valued based on the
    fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date
    of the grant and expensed over the performance period. The
    measurement of the expense related to this award is based on the
    Company’s current estimate of net revenues and diluted
    earnings per share over the performance period. Changes in these
    estimates may impact the expense recognized related to these
    awards.

Income
    Taxes

The Company’s annual income tax rate is based on its
    income, statutory tax rates, changes in prior tax positions and
    tax planning opportunities available in the various
    jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment and
    estimates are required to determine the Company’s annual
    tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions. Despite the
    Company’s belief that its tax return positions are fully
    supportable, these positions are subject to challenge and
    estimated liabilities are established in the event that these
    positions are challenged and the Company is not successful in
    defending these challenges. These estimated liabilities are
    adjusted, as well as the related interest, in light of changing
    facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit.

An estimated effective income tax rate is applied to the
    Company’s quarterly operating results. In the event there
    is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the
    Company’s quarterly operating



results, the tax attributable to that item is separately
    calculated and recorded at the time. Changes in the
    Company’s estimated effective income tax rate during 2009
    were primarily due to changes in its estimate of earnings by tax
    jurisdiction. In addition, changes in judgment regarding likely
    outcomes related to tax positions taken in a prior fiscal year,
    or tax costs or benefits from a resolution of such positions
    would be recorded entirely in the interim period the judgment
    changes or resolution occurs. During 2009, the Company recorded
    a total benefit of approximately $2,300 related to discrete tax
    events primarily related to expiration of state statutes and
    settlement of various tax examinations.

In certain cases, tax law requires items to be included in the
    Company’s income tax returns at a different time than when
    these items are recognized on the financial statements or at a
    different amount than that which is recognized on the financial
    statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as
    expenses that are not deductible on the Company’s tax
    returns, while other differences are temporary and will reverse
    over time, such as depreciation expense. These differences that
    will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and
    liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Deferred tax
    assets represent credits or deductions that have been reflected
    in the financial statements but have not yet been reflected in
    the Company’s income tax returns. Valuation allowances are
    established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is
    determined that the Company will have insufficient future
    taxable income, including capital gains, to fully realize the
    future credits, deductions or capital losses. Deferred tax
    liabilities represent expenses recognized on the Company’s
    income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the
    Company’s financial statements or income recognized in the
    financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the
    Company’s income tax return. In 2007, the Mexican
    government instituted a tax structure which results in companies
    paying the higher of an income-based tax or an alternative flat
    tax commencing in 2008. Should the Company be subject to the
    alternative flat tax, it would be required to review whether its
    net deferred tax assets would be realized. As the Company
    believes that it will continue to be subject to the income-based
    tax in 2010, it believes that the net deferred tax assets
    related to the Mexican tax jurisdiction will be realizable.
    Should the facts and circumstances change, the Company may be
    required to reevaluate deferred tax assets related to its
    Mexican operations, which may result in additional tax expense.

Contractual
    Obligations and Commercial Commitments

In the normal course of its business, the Company enters into
    contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under
    license, which may require the payment of minimum guarantees, as
    well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and
    equipment. In addition, the Company has $1,134,723 in principal
    amount of long-term debt outstanding at December 27, 2009.
    Future payments required under these and other obligations as of
    December 27, 2009 are as follows:

The Company has a liability at December 27, 2009, including
    potential interest and penalties, of $115,795 for uncertain tax
    positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in
    various income tax returns. The Company does not know the
    ultimate resolution of these uncertain tax positions and as
    such, does not know the ultimate timing of payments related to
    this liability. Accordingly, these amounts are not included in
    the table above.



In connection with the Company’s agreement to form a joint
    venture with Discovery, the Company is obligated to make future
    payments to Discovery under a tax sharing agreement. These
    payments are contingent upon the Company having sufficient
    taxable income to realize the expected tax deductions of certain
    amounts related to the joint venture. Accordingly, estimates of
    these amounts are included in the table above.

Included in the Thereafter column above is $249,828 in principal
    amount of senior convertible debt due 2021. The holders of these
    debentures may put the notes back to the Company in December
    2011 and December 2016 at the principal amount. At that time,
    the purchase price may be paid in cash, shares of common stock
    or a combination of the two. In addition, at December 27,
    2009, these debentures may be converted to shares at an initial
    conversion price of $21.60 per share through March 31,
    2010, at which time the requirements of the contingent
    conversion feature will be reevaluated. If the closing price of
    the Company’s common stock exceeds $23.76 for at least 20
    trading days within the 30 consecutive trading day period ending
    on the last trading day of a calendar quarter, or upon other
    specified events, the debentures will be convertible at the
    initial conversion price of $21.60.

The Company’s agreement with Marvel provides for minimum
    guaranteed royalty payments and requires the Company to make
    minimum expenditures on marketing and promotional activities.
    The future minimum contractual payments in the table above
    include future guaranteed contractual royalty payments of
    $35,000 payable to Marvel that are contingent upon the
    theatrical release of

SPIDER-MAN 4

which the Company
    currently expects to be paid in 2012. In addition, in connection
    with the extension of the Marvel license in 2009, the Company
    may be subject to additional royalty guarantees totaling
    $140,000 that are not included in the table above and that may
    be payable during the next five to six years contingent upon the
    quantity and types of theatrical movie releases.

In addition to the amounts included in the table above, the
    Company expects to make contributions totaling approximately
    $5,100 related to its unfunded U.S. and other International
    pension plans in 2010. The Company also has letters of credit
    and related instruments of approximately $135,277 at
    December 27, 2009.

The Company believes that cash from operations and funds
    available through its lines of credit and accounts receivable
    securitization program will allow the Company to meet these and
    other obligations described above.

Financial
    Risk Management

The Company is exposed to market risks attributable to
    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the
    result of sourcing products priced in U.S. dollars, Hong
    Kong dollars and Euros while marketing those products in more
    than twenty currencies. Results of operations may be affected
    primarily by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, Hong
    Kong dollar, Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and Mexican
    peso and, to a lesser extent, currencies in Latin American and
    Asia Pacific countries.

To manage this exposure, the Company has hedged a portion of its
    forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange
    forward contracts. The Company estimates that a hypothetical
    immediate 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against
    foreign currencies could result in an approximate $44,200
    decrease in the fair value of these instruments. A decrease in
    the fair value of these instruments would be substantially
    offset by decreases in the related forecasted foreign currency
    transactions.

The Company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with
    respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short-term
    borrowing positions in currencies other than the
    U.S. dollar. The Company believes, however, that the
    on-going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its
    financial condition. In addition, the Company’s revenues
    and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by
    changes in foreign currency rates. A significant change in
    foreign exchange rates can materially impact the Company’s
    revenues and earnings due to translation of foreign-denominated
    revenues and expenses. The Company does not hedge against
    translation impacts of foreign exchange. From time to time,
    affiliates of the Company may make or receive intercompany loans
    in currencies other than their functional currency. The Company
    manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using
    foreign exchange contracts.



The Company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an
    asset or liability on the balance sheet. The Company does not
    speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts. At
    December 27, 2009, these contracts had unrealized gains of
    $22,548, of which $8,839 are recorded in prepaid expenses and
    other current assets and $13,709 are recorded in other assets.
    Included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at
    December 27, 2009 are deferred gains of $20,410, net of
    tax, related to these derivatives.

At December 27, 2009, the Company had fixed rate long-term
    debt, excluding fair value adjustments, of $1,134,723. During
    the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company entered into several
    interest rate swap agreements, with a total notional amount of
    $400,000, to adjust the amount of long-term debt subject to
    fixed interest rates. The interest rate swaps are matched with
    specific long-term debt issues and are designated and effective
    as hedges of the change in the fair value of the associated
    debt. Changes in fair value of these contracts are wholly offset
    in earnings by changes in the fair value of the related
    long-term debt. At December 27, 2009, the fair value of
    these contracts was a liability of $2,725, which is included in
    other liabilities, with a corresponding fair value adjustment to
    decrease long-term debt. Changes in interest rates affect the
    fair value of fixed rate debt not hedged by interest rate swap
    agreements while affecting the earnings and cash flows of the
    long-term debt hedged by the interest rate swaps. The Company
    estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point decrease or
    increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair
    value of this long-term debt by approximately $55,100 or
    $50,800, respectively. A hypothetical one-quarter percentage
    point change in interest rates would increase or decrease both
    2009 pretax earnings and cash flows by $189.

The
    Economy and Inflation

The principal market for the Company’s products is the
    retail sector. Revenues from the Company’s top five
    customers, all retailers, accounted for approximately 54% of its
    consolidated net revenues in 2009 and 52% of its consolidated
    net revenues in 2008 and 2007. In the past three years certain
    customers in the retail sector have experienced economic
    difficulty. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its
    customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems
    appropriate.

The Company’s revenue pattern continues to show the second
    half of the year to be more significant to its overall business
    for the full year. In 2009, approximately 65% of the
    Company’s full year net revenues were recognized in the
    second half of the year. Although the Company expects that this
    concentration will continue, particularly as more of its
    business has shifted to larger customers with order patterns
    concentrated in the second half of the year, this concentration
    may be less in years where the Company has products related to a
    major motion picture release that occurs in the first half of
    the year. In 2009 the Company had products related to the
    mid-year major motion picture releases of

TRANSFORMERS:
    REVENGE OF THE FALLEN

,

G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA

and

X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE

. In 2008 the Company had
    products related to the mid-year major motion picture releases
    of

IRON MAN

,

THE INCREDIBLE HULK

and

INDIANA
    JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL

. The
    concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases
    the risk of (a) underproduction of popular items,
    (b) overproduction of less popular items, and
    (c) failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping
    schedules. The business of the Company is characterized by
    customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely
    because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a
    product line, product availability, marketing strategies,
    inventory levels, policies of retailers and differences in
    overall economic conditions. The trend of larger retailers has
    been to maintain lower inventories throughout the year and
    purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the
    fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season, which includes
    Christmas.

Quick response inventory management practices being used by
    retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate
    delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of
    shipment. Retailers are timing their orders so that they are
    being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by
    consumers. To the extent that retailers do not sell as much of
    their year-end inventory purchases during this holiday selling
    season as they had anticipated, their demand for additional
    product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed,
    thus negatively impacting the Company’s future revenues. In
    addition, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the
    Company’s significant retailers could negatively impact the
    Company’s future revenues.



The effect of inflation on the Company’s operations during
    2009 was not significant and the Company will continue its
    policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices, accordingly.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2009 the FASB revised accounting standards related to
    the transfer of financial assets. These revisions seek to
    improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and
    comparability of the information that a reporting entity
    provides in its financial statements about a transfer of
    financial assets; the effects of a transfer on its financial
    position, financial performance, and cash flows; and a
    transferor’s continuing involvement, if any, in transferred
    financial assets. These revisions also eliminate the concept of
    a qualifying special-purpose entity, and require such entities
    to be evaluated for consolidation in accordance with the
    applicable consolidation guidance. The requirements of these
    revised accounting standards are effective for fiscal years and
    interim periods beginning after November 15, 2009. As a
    result of the adoption of these new accounting standards in
    2010, the Company will account for all sales of accounts
    receivable under its securitization facility in 2010 as
    collateralized borrowings. The accounts receivable balances will
    remain on the Company’s balance sheet and proceeds from the
    sales of the receivables will be recorded as short-term debt.

In June 2009 the FASB amended accounting standards related to
    the consolidation of variable interest entities. These
    amendments require an enterprise to perform an analysis to
    determine whether the enterprise’s variable interest or
    interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable
    interest entity. The analysis identifies the primary beneficiary
    of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both
    (i) the power to direct the activities of a variable
    interest entity that most significantly impact the entity’s
    economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb
    losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to
    the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits
    from the entity that could potentially be significant to the
    variable interest entity. The amended standards also require
    ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary
    beneficiary of a variable interest entity. At December 27,
    2009, the Company has an ownership interest in one variable
    interest entity, the joint venture with Discovery. See the
    relevant discussion in note 5 to the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements. Other than as discussed in
    note 5, the Company does not expect the adoption of the
    amended standards to have a material impact on its consolidated
    balance sheet or results of operations.

Other
    Information

The Company is not aware of any material amounts of potential
    exposure relating to environmental matters and does not believe
    its environmental compliance costs or liabilities to be material
    to its operating results or financial position.

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Hasbro, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Hasbro, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 27, 2009 and
    December 28, 2008, and the related consolidated statements
    of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for
    each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended
    December 27, 2009. These consolidated financial statements
    are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
    financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Hasbro, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
    December 27, 2009 and December 28, 2008, and the
    results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
    fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 27,
    2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Hasbro, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 27, 2009, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO), and our report dated February 24, 2010 expressed an
    unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.

HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

(1)

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Hasbro, Inc. and all majority-owned subsidiaries
    (“Hasbro” or the “Company”). Investments
    representing 20% to 50% ownership interest in other companies
    are accounted for using the equity method. Prior to 2009 the
    Company had no equity method investments that were material to
    the consolidated financial statements. During the year ended
    December 27, 2009 the Company purchased a 50% interest in a
    joint venture with Discovery Communications, Inc. that is
    accounted for under the equity method. See note 5 for
    additional information. All significant intercompany balances
    and transactions have been eliminated.

Preparation
    of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
    notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fiscal
    Year

Hasbro’s fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in December.
    Each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended
    December 27, 2009 were fifty-two week periods.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and highly
    liquid investments purchased with a maturity to the Company of
    three months or less.

Marketable
    Securities

Marketable securities consist of investments in publicly-traded
    securities as well as investments in private investment funds.
    These investments are classified as

available-for-sale

and recorded at fair value. For publicly traded securities,
    which are included in other assets on the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheet, unrealized gains or losses, net of
    tax, are reported as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive earnings (“AOCE”) within
    shareholders’ equity until realized. Unrealized losses are
    evaluated to determine the nature of the losses. If the losses
    are determined to be other than temporary, the basis of the
    security is adjusted and the loss is recognized in earnings at
    that time. For investments in private funds, which are included
    in prepaid and other current assets on the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheet, the Company has selected the fair
    value option which requires the Company to record the unrealized
    gains and losses on these investments in the consolidated
    statements of operations at the time they occur.

Accounts
    Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Credit is granted to customers predominantly on an unsecured
    basis. Credit limits and payment terms are established based on
    extensive evaluations made on an ongoing basis throughout the
    fiscal year with regard to the financial performance, cash
    generation, financing availability and liquidity status of each
    customer. The majority of customers are formally reviewed at
    least annually; more frequent reviews are performed based on the
    customer’s financial condition and the level of credit
    being extended. For customers on credit who are experiencing
    financial difficulties, management performs additional financial
    analyses before shipping orders. The Company uses a variety of
    financial transactions based on availability and cost, to
    increase the collectibility of certain of its accounts,
    including letters of credit, credit insurance, factoring with
    unrelated third parties, and requiring cash in advance of
    shipping.



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts at the
    time revenue is recognized based on management’s assessment
    of the business environment, customers’ financial
    condition, historical collection experience, accounts receivable
    aging and customer disputes. When a significant event occurs,
    such as a bankruptcy filing by a specific customer, and on a
    quarterly basis, the allowance is reviewed for adequacy and the
    balance is adjusted to reflect current risk assessments.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out) or market. Based upon a consideration of quantities
    on hand, actual and projected sales volume, anticipated product
    selling price and product lines planned to be discontinued,
    slow-moving and obsolete inventory is written down to its
    estimated net realizable value.

At both December 27, 2009 and December 28, 2008,
    finished goods comprised 93% of inventories.

Equity
    Method Investments

For the Company’s equity method investments, only the
    Company’s investment in and amounts due to and from the
    equity method investments are included on the consolidated
    balance sheet and only the Company’s share of the equity
    method investments’ earnings (losses) is included on the
    consolidated statement of operations. Dividends, cash
    distributions, loans or other cash received from the equity
    method investments, additional cash investments, loan repayments
    or other cash paid to the investee are included in the
    consolidated statement of cash flows.

The Company reviews its investments in equity method investments
    for impairment on a periodic basis. If it has been determined
    that the equity investment is less than its related fair value
    and that this decline is

other-than-temporary,

the carrying value of the investment is adjusted downward to
    reflect these declines in value. The Company has one equity
    method investment that is material to the consolidated financial
    statements, its 50% interest in a joint venture with Discovery
    Communications, Inc. See note 5 for additional information.

Long-Lived
    Assets

The Company’s long-lived assets consist of property, plant
    and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
    lives as well as other intangible assets the Company considers
    to have a defined life.

Goodwill results from acquisitions the Company has made over
    time. Substantially all of the other intangibles consist of the
    cost of acquired product rights. In establishing the value of
    such rights, the Company considers existing trademarks,
    copyrights, patents, license agreements and other
    product-related rights. These rights were valued on their
    acquisition date based on the anticipated future cash flows from
    the underlying product line. The Company has certain intangible
    assets related to the Tonka and Milton Bradley acquisitions that
    have an indefinite life.

Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives
    are not amortized and are tested for impairment at least
    annually. The annual test begins with goodwill and all
    intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units.
    Goodwill is then tested using a two-step process that begins
    with an estimation of fair value of the reporting unit using an
    income approach, which looks to the present value of expected
    future cash flows. The first step is a screen for potential
    impairment while the second step measures the amount of
    impairment if there is an indication from the first step that
    one exists. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested
    annually for impairment by comparing their carrying value to
    their estimated fair value, also calculated using the present
    value of expected future cash flows.



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

The remaining intangibles having defined lives are being
    amortized over periods ranging from five to twenty-five years,
    primarily using the straight-line method. At December 27,
    2009, approximately 14% of other intangibles relate to rights
    acquired in connection with a major entertainment property and
    are being amortized in proportion to projected sales of the
    licensed products over the contract life.

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less
    accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using
    accelerated and straight-line methods to depreciate the cost of
    property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives.
    The principal lives, in years, used in determining depreciation
    rates of various assets are: land improvements 15 to 19,
    buildings and improvements 15 to 25 and machinery and equipment
    3 to 12. Depreciation expense is classified in the statement of
    operations based on the nature of the property and equipment
    being depreciated. Tools, dies and molds are depreciated over a
    three-year period or their useful lives, whichever is less,
    using an accelerated method. The Company generally owns all
    tools, dies and molds related to its products.

The Company reviews property, plant and equipment and other
    intangibles with defined lives for impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the
    carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future
    undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or
    asset group. If such assets were considered to be impaired, the
    impairment to be recognized would be measured by the amount by
    which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value.
    Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or
    appraised values, depending on the nature of the assets. Assets
    to be disposed of are carried at the lower of the net book value
    or their estimated fair value less disposal costs.

Financial
    Instruments

Hasbro’s financial instruments include cash and cash
    equivalents, accounts receivable, short-term borrowings,
    accounts payable and accrued liabilities. At December 27,
    2009, the carrying cost of these instruments approximated their
    fair value. The Company’s financial instruments at
    December 27, 2009 also include long-term borrowings (see
    note 8 for carrying cost and related fair values) as well
    as certain assets and liabilities measured at fair value (see
    notes 8, 11 and 15).

Securitization
    and Transfer of Financial Instruments

Hasbro has an agreement that allows the Company to sell, on an
    ongoing basis, an undivided fractional ownership interest in
    certain of its trade accounts receivable through a revolving
    securitization arrangement. The Company retains servicing
    responsibilities for, as well as a subordinate interest in, the
    transferred receivables. In 2009 and prior, Hasbro accounted for
    the securitization of trade accounts receivable as a sale in
    accordance with then current accounting standards. As a result,
    the related receivables were removed from the consolidated
    balance sheet.

In 2010, the Company adopted the revised accounting standards
    related to the transfer of financial assets. As a result of the
    adoption of these standards, the Company will be required to
    account for the sale of the receivables under the securitization
    facility as a secured borrowing. The receivables sold will
    continue to be included in accounts receivable until collection.
    The proceeds from utilization of the facility will be recorded
    as short-term debt.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue from product sales is recognized upon the passing of
    title to the customer, generally at the time of shipment.
    Provisions for discounts, rebates and returns are made when the
    related revenues are recognized.



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

The Company bases its estimates for discounts, rebates and
    returns on agreed customer terms and historical experience.

The Company enters into arrangements licensing its brand names
    on specifically approved products. The licensees pay the Company
    royalties as products are sold, in some cases subject to minimum
    guaranteed amounts. Royalty revenues are recognized as they are
    reported as earned and payment becomes assured, over the life of
    the agreement. Revenue from product sales less related
    provisions for discounts, rebates and returns, as well as
    royalty revenues comprise net revenues in the consolidated
    statements of operations.

Royalties

The Company enters into license agreements with inventors,
    designers and others for the use of intellectual properties in
    its products. These agreements may call for payment in advance
    or future payment of minimum guaranteed amounts. Amounts paid in
    advance are recorded as an asset and charged to expense as
    revenue from the related products is recognized. If all or a
    portion of the minimum guaranteed amounts appear not to be
    recoverable through future use of the rights obtained under
    license, the non-recoverable portion of the guaranty is charged
    to expense at that time.

Advertising

Production costs of commercials are charged to operations in the
    fiscal year during which the production is first aired. The
    costs of other advertising, promotion and marketing programs are
    charged to operations in the fiscal year incurred.

Film
    and Programming Costs

In 2009, the Company incurred certain costs to commence the
    production of films and television programming. These costs are
    capitalized by the Company as they are incurred and will be
    amortized based on the proportion of the film’s or
    program’s revenues recognized for such period to the
    estimated remaining ultimate revenues related to the film or
    program. These costs are reported at the lower of cost, less
    accumulated amortization, or fair value, and reviewed for
    impairment annually or when an event occurs that indicates that
    an impairment may exist. At December 27, 2009, the Company
    had approximately $5,300 of such costs recorded in other assets.
    There was no amortization or impairment of such costs in 2009.

Shipping
    and Handling

Hasbro expenses costs related to the shipment and handling of
    goods to customers as incurred. For 2009, 2008, and 2007, these
    costs were $155,496, $178,738 and $167,868, respectively, and
    are included in selling, distribution and administration
    expenses.

Operating
    Leases

Hasbro records lease expense in such a manner as to recognize
    this expense on a straight-line basis inclusive of rent
    concessions and rent increases. Reimbursements from lessors for
    leasehold improvements are deferred and recognized as a
    reduction to lease expense over the lease term.

Income
    Taxes

Hasbro uses the asset and liability approach for financial
    accounting and reporting of income taxes. Deferred income taxes
    have not been provided on the majority of undistributed earnings
    of international subsidiaries as the majority of such earnings
    are indefinitely reinvested by the Company.



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

(Thousands

The Company uses a two step process for the measurement of
    uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to
    be taken in a tax return. The first step is a determination of
    whether the tax position should be recognized in the financial
    statements. The second step determines the measurement of the
    tax position. The Company records potential interest and
    penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income
    tax expense.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into
    U.S. dollars at period-end rates, and revenues, costs and
    expenses are translated at weighted average rates during each
    reporting period. Earnings include gains or losses resulting
    from foreign currency transactions and, when required,
    translation gains and losses resulting from the use of the
    U.S. dollar as the functional currency in highly
    inflationary economies. Other gains and losses resulting from
    translation of financial statements are a component of other
    comprehensive earnings.

Pension
    Plans, Postretirement and Postemployment
    Benefits

Pension expense and related amounts in the consolidated balance
    sheet are based on actuarial computations of current and future
    benefits. The Company’s policy is to fund amounts which are
    required by applicable regulations and which are tax deductible.
    In 2010, the Company expects to contribute approximately $5,100
    to its pension plans. The estimated amounts of future payments
    to be made under other retirement programs are being accrued
    currently over the period of active employment and are also
    included in pension expense.

Hasbro has a contributory postretirement health and life
    insurance plan covering substantially all employees who retire
    under any of its United States defined benefit pension plans and
    meet certain age and length of service requirements. The cost of
    providing these benefits on behalf of employees who retired
    prior to 1993 is and will continue to be substantially borne by
    the Company. The cost of providing benefits on behalf of
    substantially all employees who retire after 1992 is borne by
    the employee. It also has several plans covering certain groups
    of employees, which may provide benefits to such employees
    following their period of employment but prior to their
    retirement. The Company measures the costs of these obligations
    based on actuarial computations.

Risk
    Management Contracts

Hasbro uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the
    impact of currency rate fluctuations on firmly committed and
    projected future foreign currency transactions. These

over-the-counter

contracts, which hedge future purchases of inventory and other
    cross-border currency requirements not denominated in the
    functional currency of the business unit, are primarily
    denominated in United States and Hong Kong dollars, Euros and
    United Kingdom pound sterling and are entered into with a number
    of counterparties, all of which are major financial
    institutions. The Company believes that a default by a
    counterparty would not have a material adverse effect on the
    financial condition of the Company. Hasbro does not enter into
    derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

At the inception of the contracts, Hasbro designates its
    derivatives as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The
    Company formally documents all relationships between hedging
    instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management
    objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge
    transactions. All hedges designated as cash flow hedges are
    linked to forecasted transactions and the Company assesses, both
    at the inception of the hedge and on an on-going basis, the
    effectiveness of the derivatives used in hedging transactions in
    offsetting changes in the cash flows of the forecasted
    transaction. The ineffective portion of a hedging derivative, if
    any, is immediately recognized in the consolidated statements of
    operations.



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

The Company records all derivatives, such as foreign currency
    exchange contracts, on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes
    in the derivative fair values that are designated effective and
    qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred and recorded as a
    component of AOCE until the hedged transactions occur and are
    then recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.
    The Company’s foreign currency contracts hedging
    anticipated cash flows are designated as cash flow hedges. When
    it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a
    hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively.
    Any gain or loss deferred through that date remains in AOCE
    until the forecasted transaction occurs, at which time it is
    reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations. To
    the extent the transaction is no longer deemed probable of
    occurring, hedge accounting treatment is discontinued and
    amounts deferred would be reclassified to the consolidated
    statements of operations. In the event hedge accounting
    requirements are not met, gains and losses on such instruments
    are included currently in the consolidated statements of
    operations. The Company uses derivatives to economically hedge
    intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies. Due to the
    short-term nature of the derivative contracts involved, the
    Company does not use hedge accounting for these contracts.

The Company also uses interest rate swap agreements to adjust
    the amount of long-term debt subject to fixed interest rates.
    The interest rate swaps are matched with specific fixed rate
    long-term debt obligations and are designated as fair value
    hedges of the change in fair value of the related debt
    obligations. These agreements are recorded at their fair value
    as an asset or liability. Gains and losses on these contracts
    are included in the consolidated statements of operations and
    are wholly offset by changes in the fair value of the related
    long-term debt. These hedges are considered to be perfectly
    effective under current accounting guidance. The interest rate
    swap contracts are with a number of major financial institutions
    in order to minimize counterparty credit risk. The Company
    believes that it is unlikely that any of its counterparties will
    be unable to perform under the terms of the contracts.

Accounting
    for Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has a stock-based employee compensation plan for
    employees and non-employee members of the Company’s Board
    of Directors. Under this plan the Company may grant stock
    options at or above the fair market value of the Company’s
    stock, as well as restricted stock, restricted stock units and
    contingent stock performance awards. All awards are measured at
    fair value at the date of the grant and amortized as expense on
    a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the
    award. For awards contingent upon Company performance, the
    measurement of the expense for these awards is based on the
    Company’s current estimate of its performance over the
    performance period. See note 12 for further discussion.

Net
    Earnings Per Common Share

Basic net earnings per share is computed by dividing net
    earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding
    for the year. Diluted net earnings per share is similar except
    that the weighted average number of shares outstanding is
    increased by dilutive securities, and net earnings are adjusted
    for certain amounts related to dilutive securities. Dilutive
    securities include shares issuable under convertible debt, as
    well as shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and
    warrants for which the market price exceeds the exercise price,
    less shares which could have been purchased by the Company with
    the related proceeds. Dilutive securities during 2007 also may
    have included shares potentially issuable to settle liabilities.
    Options totaling 5,784, 3,491 and 3,250 for 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted
    earnings per share because to include them would have been
    antidilutive.

The net earnings per share calculations for each of the three
    years ended December 27, 2009 include adjustments to add
    back to earnings the interest expense, net of tax, incurred on
    the Company’s senior convertible debentures due 2021, as
    well as to add back to outstanding shares the amount of shares
    potentially issuable under the contingent conversion feature of
    these debentures. See note 8 for further information on the
    contingent conversion feature.

Certain warrants containing a put feature that could be settled
    in cash or common stock were required to be accounted for as a
    liability at fair value. These warrants were repurchased by the
    Company in May of 2007. Prior to their repurchase, the Company
    was required to assess if these warrants, classified as a
    liability, had a more dilutive impact on earnings per share when
    treated as an equity contract. For the year ended
    December 30, 2007 the warrants had a more dilutive impact
    on earnings per share assuming they were treated as a liability
    and no adjustment to net earnings or equivalent shares was
    required.

Subsequent
    Events

In May 2009, the Financial Accounting Standard Board
    (“FASB”) established general standards of accounting
    for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet
    date but before financial statements are issued or are available
    to be issued. These standards require the disclosure of the date
    through which subsequent events have been evaluated and whether
    that date is the date the financial statements were issued or
    were available to be issued. The adoption did not have an impact
    on the Company’s statements of operations or statement of
    financial position. The Company has evaluated all subsequent
    events that occurred through February 24, 2010, the date
    the financial statements were issued.

In 2009, 2008 and 2007, net gains (losses) on cash flow hedging
    activities reclassified to earnings, net of tax, included gains
    (losses) of $(679), $1,292 and $(37), respectively, as a result
    of hedge ineffectiveness.

The related tax benefit (expense) of other comprehensive
    earnings items was $1,322, $16,022, and $(16,064) for the years
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Income tax expense (benefit)
    related to reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive
    earnings of $(331), $763 and $1,412 in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, were included in these amounts.

At December 27, 2009, the Company had remaining deferred
    gains on hedging instruments, net of tax, of $20,410 in AOCE.
    These instruments hedge inventory purchased during the fourth
    quarter of 2009 or forecasted to be purchased during 2010 and
    2011 and intercompany expenses and royalty payments expected to
    be paid or received during 2010 and 2011. These amounts will be
    reclassified into the consolidated statement of operations upon
    the sale of the related inventory or receipt or payment of the
    related royalties and expenses. Of the amount included in AOCE
    at December 27, 2009, the Company expects approximately
    $7,600 to be reclassified to the consolidated statement of
    operations within the next 12 months. However, the amount
    ultimately realized in earnings is dependent on the fair value
    of the contracts on the settlement dates.

In the first quarter of 2007, the Company changed its
    measurement date for certain of its defined benefit pension
    plans and its postretirement plan from September 30 to the
    Company’s fiscal year-end date. As a result of this change,
    the assets and liabilities of these plans were remeasured as of
    December 31, 2006, the 2006 fiscal year-end date of the
    Company. This remeasurement resulted in an adjustment to
    accumulated other comprehensive earnings of $7,779, net of taxes
    of $4,765, during the first quarter of 2007.

Goodwill
    and Intangibles

Goodwill and certain intangible assets relating to rights
    obtained in the Company’s acquisition of Milton Bradley in
    1984 and Tonka in 1991 are not amortized. These rights were
    determined to have indefinite lives and total approximately
    $75,700. The Company’s other intangible assets are
    amortized over their remaining useful lives, and accumulated
    amortization of these other intangibles is reflected in other
    intangibles, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

The Company performs an annual impairment test on goodwill and
    intangible assets with indefinite lives. This annual impairment
    test is performed in the fourth quarter of the Company’s
    fiscal year. In addition, if an event occurs or circumstances
    change that indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable, the Company will perform an interim impairment test
    at that time. For the three fiscal years ended December 27,
    2009, no such events occurred. The Company completed its annual
    impairment tests in the fourth quarters of 2009, 2008 and 2007
    and had no impairment charges.

A portion of the Company’s goodwill and other intangible
    assets reside in the Corporate segment of the business. For
    purposes of impairment testing, these assets are allocated to
    the reporting units within the

In January 2008 the Company acquired Cranium, Inc.
    (“Cranium”), a developer and marketer of
    children’s and adult board games, in order to supplement
    its existing game portfolio, for a total cost of approximately
    $68,000. Based on the allocation of the purchase price, property
    rights related to acquired product lines of approximately
    $68,500 were recorded as intangible assets in connection with
    the acquisition. These property rights are being amortized over
    a fifteen year estimated useful life. Goodwill of $8,822 was
    also recorded as a result of the transaction. The consolidated
    statement of operations of the Company for 2008 includes the
    operations of Cranium from the closing date of January 25,
    2008.

In May 2009 the Company amended its license agreement with Lucas
    Licensing, Ltd. (“Lucas”) related to the STAR WARS
    brand. The amendment included the extension of the term of the
    license for an additional two years, from the end of 2018 to the
    end of 2020. In connection with the extension of the license
    rights, $45,000 was recorded as an intangible asset during 2009
    and will be amortized over the term of the extension. The
    amendment also provided for the settlement of certain royalty
    audit issues, primarily related to contractual interpretations
    associated with the computation of royalties dating back to
    1999, and the clarification of certain terms and interpretations
    of the agreement on a prospective basis through the end of the
    term, including the scope of licensed rights to future developed
    properties by Lucas.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company purchased all
    of the intellectual property rights related to the TRIVIAL
    PURSUIT brand from Horn Abbot Ltd. and Horn Abbot International
    Limited (together the

“Seller”) for a total cost of approximately $80,800.
    Previous to this asset purchase, the Company licensed these
    rights from the Seller. The cost was recorded as property rights
    and included in other intangibles. These property rights are
    being amortized over a fifteen year estimated useful life.

The Company will continue to incur amortization expense related
    to the use of acquired and licensed rights to produce various
    products. The amortization of these product rights will
    fluctuate depending on related projected revenues during an
    annual period, as well as rights reaching the end of their
    useful lives. The Company currently estimates continuing
    amortization expense related to the above intangible assets for
    the next five years to be approximately:

Equity
    Method Investment

During 2009, the Company entered into an agreement to form a
    joint venture with Discovery Communications, Inc.
    (“Discovery”) to create a television network in the
    United States dedicated to high-quality children’s and
    family entertainment and educational programming. The
    transaction closed in May 2009 with the Company’s purchase
    of a 50% interest in the joint venture, DHJV Company LLC
    (“DHJV”), which owns the DISCOVERY KIDS network in the
    United States. The Company purchased its 50% share in DHJV for a
    payment of $300,000 and certain future payments based on the
    value of certain tax benefits expected to be received by the
    Company. The present value of the expected future payments at
    the acquisition date totaled approximately $67,900 and was
    recorded as a component of the Company’s investment in the
    joint venture. The balance of the associated liability,
    including imputed interest, was $71,234 at December 27,
    2009 and is included as a component of other liabilities in the
    accompanying balance sheet.

Voting control of the joint venture is shared


/


between the Company and Discovery. However, the Company believes
    that the joint venture qualifies as a variable interest entity
    pursuant to current accounting standards, and that it qualifies
    as the primary beneficiary, which would result in the Company
    consolidating the joint venture. In June 2009, the FASB revised
    the accounting guidance related to variable interest entity
    consolidation. The revised guidance is effective for the Company
    at the beginning of fiscal 2010. Under the revised guidance, the
    Company has determined that it does not meet the control
    requirements to consolidate the joint venture, and would be
    required to deconsolidate DHJV and utilize the equity method to
    account for its investment at the adoption date. The Company has
    elected to use the equity method in 2009 for financial statement
    presentation of the joint venture as it has determined that the
    difference between using consolidation and the equity method in
    2009 is not material to the overall presentation of the
    financial statements. Additionally, there is no impact on net
    earnings or earnings per share. The Company’s share in the
    earnings of the joint venture for the year ended
    December 27, 2009 totaled $3,856 of income and is included
    as a component of other (income) expense in the accompanying
    consolidated statements of operations.

The Company has entered into a license agreement with the joint
    venture that will require the payment of royalties by the
    Company to the joint venture based on a percentage of revenue
    derived from products related to television shows broadcast by
    the joint venture. The license agreement includes a minimum
    royalty guarantee of $125,000, payable in 5 annual installments
    of $25,000 per year, commencing in 2009, which can be earned out
    over approximately a

10-year

period. During 2009, the Company paid the first annual
    installment of $25,000, which is included in other assets on the
    consolidated balance sheet at December 27, 2009. The
    Company and the joint venture are also parties to an agreement
    under which the Company will



HASBRO,

provide the joint venture with an exclusive first look in the
    U.S. to license certain types of programming developed by
    the Company based on its intellectual property. In the event the
    joint venture licenses the programming from the Company to air
    on the network, the joint venture is required to pay the Company
    a license fee.

The assets of the joint venture at inception consisted of
    goodwill and intangibles which were measured at fair value at
    inception. Intangible assets are primarily comprised of cable
    affiliate relationships, which are being amortized on a straight
    line basis over 30 years, and programming costs, which are
    being amortized primarily over 4 years on an accelerated
    basis. Hasbro’s share of the assets underlying its
    investment at inception totaled $142,577 of goodwill, $211,850
    of cable affiliate relationships, $12,400 of programming costs,
    and $1,100 of other intangibles. Amortization of the intangible
    assets is recorded in the results of the joint venture and,
    accordingly, the Company’s share is included in its share
    of the joint venture earnings which is a component of other
    (income) expense. As of December 27, 2009, the
    Company’s interest in the joint venture totaled $371,783
    and is a component of other assets.

As of December 27, 2009, DHJV had current assets of
    $51,674, non-current assets of $696,842 and current liabilities
    of $27,209. Net income of the joint venture for the period from
    inception to December 27, 2009 was $7,711.

Financing
    Arrangements

Short-Term
    Borrowings

At December 27, 2009, Hasbro had available an unsecured
    committed line and unsecured uncommitted lines of credit from
    various banks approximating $300,000 and $184,300, respectively.
    A significant portion of the short-term borrowings outstanding
    at the end of 2009 and 2008 represent borrowings made under, or
    supported by, these lines of credit. The weighted average
    interest rates of the outstanding borrowings as of
    December 27, 2009 and December 28, 2008 were 1.23% and
    10.7%, respectively. Borrowings under the lines of credit were
    made by certain international affiliates of the Company on terms
    and at interest rates generally extended to companies of
    comparable creditworthiness in those markets. The Company had no
    borrowings outstanding under its committed line of credit at
    December 27, 2009. During 2009, Hasbro’s working
    capital needs were fulfilled by cash generated from operations,
    borrowings under lines of credit, and the Company’s
    accounts receivable securitization program.

The unsecured committed line (the “Agreement”)
    provides the Company with a $300,000 committed borrowing
    facility through June 2011. The Company has the ability to
    request increases in the committed facility in additional
    increments of at least $50,000, subject to lender agreement, up
    to a total committed facility of $500,000. The Agreement
    contains certain financial covenants setting forth leverage and
    coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of
    an investment grade facility, including with respect to liens,
    mergers and incurrence of indebtedness. The Company was in
    compliance with all covenants as of and for the year ended
    December 27, 2009.

The Company pays a commitment fee (0.09% as of December 27,
    2009) based on the unused portion of the facility and
    interest equal to LIBOR or Prime plus a spread on borrowings
    under the facility. The commitment fee and the amount of the
    spread to LIBOR or Prime both vary based on the Company’s
    long-term debt ratings and the Company’s leverage. At
    December 27, 2009, the interest rate under the facility was
    equal to LIBOR plus 0.40% or Prime.

Securitization

The Company is party to an accounts receivable securitization
    program whereby the Company sells, on an ongoing basis,
    substantially all of its U.S. trade accounts receivable to
    a bankruptcy-remote, special

purpose subsidiary, Hasbro Receivables Funding, LLC (HRF), which
    is wholly-owned and consolidated by the Company. HRF will,
    subject to certain conditions, sell, from time to time on a
    revolving basis, an undivided fractional ownership interest in
    up to $250,000 of eligible domestic receivables to various
    multi-party commercial paper conduits supported by a committed
    liquidity facility. During the period from the first day of the
    October fiscal month through the last day of the following
    January fiscal month, this limit increased to $300,000.
    Subsequent to December 27, 2009, in January 2010, the
    agreement was amended on a prospective basis to eliminate the
    additional $50,000 available from the first day of the October
    fiscal month through the last day of the following January
    fiscal month. Under the terms of the agreement, new receivables
    are added to the pool as collections reduce previously held
    receivables. The Company expects to service, administer, and
    collect the receivables on behalf of HRF and the conduits. The
    net proceeds of sale will be less than the face amount of
    accounts receivable sold by an amount that approximates a
    financing cost.

The receivables facility contains certain restrictions on the
    Company and HRF that are customary for facilities of this type.
    The commitments under the facility are subject to termination
    prior to their term upon the occurrence of certain events,
    including payment defaults, breach of covenants, breach of
    representations or warranties, bankruptcy, and failure of the
    receivables to satisfy certain performance criteria.

As of December 27, 2009, there were no amounts utilized
    under the receivables facility. At December 28, 2008 the
    utilization of the receivables facility was $250,000. As of
    December 27, 2009 the Company had $300,000 available to
    sell under the facility. The transactions are accounted for as
    sales under current accounting guidance. During 2009, 2008 and
    2007, the loss on the sale of receivables totaled $2,514, $5,302
    and $7,982, respectively, which is recorded in selling,
    distribution and administration expenses in the accompanying
    consolidated statements of operations. The discount on interests
    sold is approximately equal to the interest rate paid by the
    conduits to the holders of the commercial paper plus other fees.
    The discount rate as of December 27, 2009 was approximately
    1.03%.

Upon sale to the conduits, HRF continues to hold a subordinated
    retained interest in the receivables. The subordinated interest
    in receivables is recorded at fair value, which is determined
    based on the present value of future expected cash flows
    estimated using management’s best estimates of credit
    losses and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved.
    Due to the short-term nature of trade receivables, the carrying
    amount, less allowances, approximates fair value. Variations in
    the credit and discount assumptions generally do not
    significantly impact fair value.

In 2010, the Company adopted revised accounting standards
    related to the transfer of financial assets. As a result of the
    adoption of these standards, the Company will be required to
    account for the sale of the receivables under the securitization
    facility as a secured borrowing. The receivables sold will
    continue to be included in accounts receivable until collection.
    The proceeds from utilization of the facility will be recorded
    as short-term debt.

In May 2009 the Company issued $425,000 of Notes that are due in
    2014 (the “Notes”). The Notes bear interest at a rate
    of 6.125%, which may be adjusted upward in the event that the
    Company’s credit rating from Moody’s Investor
    Services, Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings
    Services or Fitch Ratings is reduced to Ba1, BB+, or BB+,
    respectively, or below. On the date the Notes were issued, the
    Company’s ratings from Moody’s Investor Services,
    Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and
    Fitch Ratings were Baa2, BBB and BBB+, respectively. The
    interest rate adjustment is dependent on the degree of decrease
    of the Company’s ratings and could range from 0.25% to a
    maximum of 2.00%. The Company may redeem the Notes at its option
    at the greater of the principal amount of the Notes or the
    present value of the remaining scheduled payments discounted
    using the effective interest rate on applicable
    U.S. Treasury bills at the time of repurchase.

In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company entered into a series
    of interest rate swap agreements to adjust the amount of debt
    that is subject to fixed interest rates. The interest rate swaps
    are matched with the 6.125% Notes Due 2014 and accounted
    for as fair value hedges of those notes. The interest rate swaps
    have a total notional amount of $400,000 with maturities in
    2014. In each of the contracts, the Company receives payments
    based upon a fixed interest rate of 6.125%, which matches the
    interest rate of the notes being hedged, and makes payments
    based upon a floating rate based on Libor. These contracts are
    designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair
    value of the associated debt. At December 27, 2009, the
    fair value of these contracts was a liability of $2,725 which is
    recorded in other liabilities with a corresponding fair value
    adjustment to decrease long-term debt. The Company recorded a
    loss of $2,725 on these instruments in other (income) expense,
    net for the year ended December 27, 2009, relating to the
    change in fair value of such derivatives, wholly offsetting
    gains from the change in fair value of the associated long-term
    debt.

In 2008 the Company repaid $135,092 of 6.15% notes due in
    July 2008.

The Company currently has $249,828 outstanding in principal
    amount of contingent convertible debentures due 2021. These
    debentures bear interest at 2.75%, which could be subject to an
    upward adjustment depending on the price of the Company’s
    common stock. If the closing price of the Company’s common
    stock exceeds $23.76 for at least 20 trading days, within the 30
    consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of
    the calendar quarter, the holders have the right to convert the
    notes to shares of the Company’s common stock at the
    initial conversion price of $21.60 in the next calendar quarter.
    At December 31, 2009, this contingent conversion feature
    was met and the debentures are convertible through
    March 31, 2010, at which time the requirements of the
    contingent conversion feature will be reevaluated. In addition,
    if the closing price of the Company’s common stock exceeds
    $27.00 for at least 20 trading days in any thirty day period,
    the Company has the right to call the debentures by giving
    notice to the holders of the debentures. During a prescribed
    notice period, the holders of the debentures have the right to
    convert their debentures in accordance with the conversion terms
    described above. At certain times during the year, based

    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

on the Company’s common stock price, the Company had the
    right to call the debentures under this provision. As of
    December 27, 2009, the Company had the right to call the
    debentures. The holders of these debentures may also put the
    notes back to Hasbro in December 2011 and December 2016. At
    these times, the purchase price may be paid in cash, shares of
    common stock or a combination of the two, at the discretion of
    the Company.

At December 27, 2009, as detailed above, the Company’s
    6.125% Notes mature in 2014. All of the Company’s
    other long-term borrowings have contractual maturities that
    occur subsequent to 2014.

At December 27, 2009, the fair values of the
    6.125% Notes, 6.30% Notes, 2.75% Convertible
    Debentures and the 6.60% Debentures were approximately
    $465,545, $375,585, $373,515 and $110,697, respectively. At
    December 28, 2008, the fair values of the 6.30% Notes,
    2.75% Convertible Debentures and the 6.60% Debentures
    were approximately $335,000, $334,200 and $100,300,
    respectively. The fair value of the convertible debt is based on
    an average of the prices of trades occurring around the balance
    sheet date. The fair values of the Company’s other
    long-term borrowings are measured using a combination of broker
    quotations when available and discounted future cash flows. The
    fair value of the interest rate swaps are measured based on the
    present value of future cash flows using the swap curve as of
    the date of valuation.

During 2009 the Company indefinitely reinvested all current year

    of the international net earnings during those years that will
    not be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. The
    incremental income tax on these amounts, representing the
    difference between the U.S. federal income tax rate and the
    income tax rates in the applicable international jurisdictions,
    is a component of deferred income tax expense.

Hasbro has a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets
    at December 27, 2009 of $11,641, which is a decrease of
    $114 from $11,755 at December 28, 2008. The valuation
    allowance pertains to certain United States and International
    loss carryforwards, some of which have no expiration and others
    that would expire beginning in 2010.

Based on Hasbro’s history of taxable income and the
    anticipation of sufficient taxable income in years when the
    temporary differences are expected to become tax deductions, the
    Company believes that it will realize the benefit of the
    deferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation allowance.

Deferred income taxes of $54,321 and $53,285 at the end of 2009
    and 2008, respectively, are included as a component of prepaid
    expenses and other current assets, and $31,537 and $53,031,
    respectively, are included as a component of other assets. At
    the same dates, deferred income taxes of $1,456 and $4,245,
    respectively, are included as a component of accrued
    liabilities, and $5,305 and $6,054, respectively, are included
    as a component of other liabilities.

On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the revised
    accounting standard related to uncertain tax positions. The
    revised standard prescribes a two step process for the
    measurement of uncertain tax positions that have been taken or
    are expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is a
    determination of whether the tax position should be recognized
    in the financial statements. The second step determines the
    measurement of the tax position. The revised standard also
    provides guidance on derecognition of such tax positions,



HASBRO,

classification, potential interest and penalties, accounting in
    interim periods and disclosure. The adoption of the revised
    standard resulted in a decrease of $88,798 to current
    liabilities, an increase of $85,773 to long-term liabilities, an
    increase of $5,333 to the long-term deferred tax assets and an
    increase of $8,358 to retained earnings.

A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding
    potential interest and penalties, for the fiscal years ended
    December 27, 2009, December 28, 2008 and
    December 30, 2007 is as follows:

If the $97,857 balance as of December 27, 2009 is
    recognized, approximately $70,000 would decrease the effective
    tax rate in the period in which each of the benefits is
    recognized. The remaining amount would be offset by the reversal
    of related deferred tax assets.

During 2009, 2008 and 2007 the Company recognized $3,405, $3,357
    and $4,628, respectively, of potential interest and penalties,
    which are included as a component of income taxes in the
    accompanying consolidated statement of operations. At
    December 27, 2009, December 28, 2008 and
    December 30, 2007, the Company had accrued potential
    interest and penalties of $17,938, $13,660 and $12,020,
    respectively.

The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the
    United States and various state and international jurisdictions.
    In the normal course of business, the Company is regularly
    audited by U.S. federal, state and local and international
    tax authorities in various tax jurisdictions. The Company is no
    longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for
    years before 2004. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer
    subject to U.S. state or local and

non-U.S. income

tax examinations by tax authorities in its major jurisdictions
    for years before 2004.

The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has commenced an
    examination related to the 2006 and 2007 U.S. federal
    income tax returns. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has
    recently completed an examination related to the 2004 and 2005
    U.S. federal income tax returns at the field agent level,
    subject to review by the Joint Committee on Taxation. The
    Company is also under income tax examination in several
    U.S. state and local and

non-U.S. jurisdictions.

In connection with the Mexican tax examinations for the years
    2000 to 2004, the Company has received tax assessments totaling
    approximately $130,000, which include interest, penalties and
    inflation updates, related to transfer pricing which the Company
    is vigorously defending. In order to continue the process of
    defending its position, the Company was required to guarantee
    the amount of the assessments for the years 2000 to 2003, as is
    usual and customary in Mexico with respect to these matters.
    Accordingly, as of December 27, 2009, bonds totaling
    approximately $105,000 (at year-end 2009 exchange rates) have
    been provided to the Mexican government related to the 2000 to
    2003 assessments, allowing the Company to defend its positions.
    The Company currently does not expect to be required to
    guarantee the amount of the 2004 assessment. The Company expects
    to be successful in sustaining its position with respect to
    these assessments as well as similar positions that may be taken
    by the Mexican tax authorities for periods subsequent to 2004.

The Company believes it is reasonably possible that certain tax
    examinations and statutes of limitations may be concluded and
    will expire within the next 12 months, and that
    unrecognized tax benefits, excluding potential interest and
    penalties, may decrease by up to approximately $24,000, of which
    approximately $14,000 would be recorded as a tax benefit in the
    statement of operations. In addition, approximately $4,000 of
    potential interest and penalties related to these amounts would
    also be recorded as a tax benefit in the statement of
    operations. These unrecognized tax benefits primarily relate to
    both the timing and the nature of the deductibility of certain
    expenses, as well as the tax treatment of certain subsidiary and
    other transactions.

The cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of Hasbro’s
    international subsidiaries held for indefinite reinvestment is
    approximately $914,000 at December 27, 2009. In the event
    that all international undistributed earnings were remitted to
    the United States, the amount of incremental taxes would be
    approximately $216,000.

Capital
    Stock

In February 2008 the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $500,000 in common stock
    after three previous authorizations dated May 2005, July 2006
    and August 2007 with a cumulative authorized repurchase amount
    of $1,200,000 were fully utilized. Purchases of the
    Company’s common stock may be made from time to time,
    subject to market conditions, and may be made in the open market
    or through privately negotiated transactions. The Company has no
    obligation to repurchase shares under the authorization and the
    timing, actual number, and the value of the shares which are
    repurchased will depend on a number of factors, including the
    price of the Company’s common stock. In 2009, the Company
    repurchased 3,172 shares at an average price of $28.67. The
    total cost of these repurchases, including transaction costs,
    was $90,994. At December 27, 2009, $161,434 remained under
    this authorization.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The Company measures certain assets at fair value in accordance
    with current accounting standards. The fair value hierarchy
    consists of three levels: Level 1 fair values are
    valuations based on quoted market prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability
    to access; Level 2 fair values are those valuations based
    on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted
    prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are
    observable or can be corroborated by observable data for
    substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and
    Level 3 fair values are valuations based on inputs that are
    supported by little or no market activity and that are
    significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
    Certain aspects of fair value accounting standards were not
    required to be adopted for certain non-financial assets and
    liabilities until the first day of fiscal 2009 and, as such,
    were adopted by the Company in the first quarter of 2009. The
    adoption of these provisions did not have an impact on the
    Company’s consolidated statements of operations or balance
    sheets.

Current accounting standards permit entities to choose to
    measure many financial instruments and certain other items at
    fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure
    requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities
    that choose different measurement attributes for similar assets
    and liabilities. During 2009 the Company elected the fair value
    option for certain investments purchased during the year. At
    December 27, 2009, these investments totaled $21,108 and
    are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the
    consolidated balance sheet. The Company recorded net gains of
    $1,019 on these investments in other (income) expense, net for
    the year ended December 27, 2009, relating to the change in
    fair value of such investments.

For a portion of the Company’s

available-for-sale

securities, the Company is able to obtain quoted prices from
    stock exchanges to measure the fair value of these securities.
    Certain other

available-for-sale

securities held by the Company are valued at the net asset value
    which is quoted on a private market that is not active; however,
    the unit price is predominantly based on underlying investments
    which are traded on an active market. The Company’s
    derivatives consist primarily of foreign currency forward
    contracts. The Company uses current forward rates of the
    respective foreign currencies to measure the fair value of these
    contracts. The Company’s derivatives also include interest
    rate swaps used to adjust the amount of long-term debt subject
    to fixed interest rates. The fair values of the interest rate
    swaps are measured based on the present value of future cash
    flows using the swap curve as of the valuation date. The
    remaining derivative securities consist of warrants to purchase
    common stock. The Company uses the Black-Scholes model to value
    these warrants. One of the inputs used in the Black-Scholes
    model, historical volatility, is considered an unobservable
    input in that it reflects the Company’s own assumptions
    about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing
    the asset or liability. The Company believes that this is the
    best information available for use in the fair value
    measurement. There were no changes in these valuation techniques
    during 2009.

The following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending
    balances of the fair value measurements of the Company’s
    warrants to purchase common stock that use significant
    unobservable inputs (Level 3):

In the second quarter of 2009, certain warrants held by the
    Company were modified in connection with the amendment of an
    existing license agreement. The fair value of the modification
    was recorded as deferred revenue and is being amortized to
    revenue over the term of the amended license agreement.

Stock
    Options, Other Stock Awards and Warrants

Hasbro has reserved 20,266 shares of its common stock for
    issuance upon exercise of options and the grant of other awards
    granted or to be granted under stock incentive plans for
    employees and for non-employee members of the Board of Directors
    (collectively, the “plans”). These options and other
    awards generally vest in equal annual amounts over three to five
    years. The plans provide that options be granted at exercise
    prices not less than fair market value on the date the option is
    granted and options are adjusted for such changes as stock
    splits and stock dividends. Generally, options are exercisable
    for periods of no more than ten years after date of grant.
    Certain of the plans permit the granting of awards in the form
    of stock, stock appreciation rights, stock awards and cash
    awards in addition to stock options. Upon exercise in the case
    of stock options, grant in the case of restricted stock or
    vesting in the case of performance based contingent stock
    grants, shares are issued out of available treasury shares.

The Company on occasion will issue restricted stock or grant
    restricted stock units to certain key employees. In 2009 the
    Company did not issue any restricted stock or restricted stock
    units. In 2008 and 2007 the Company granted restricted stock
    units of 60 and 12 shares, respectively. These shares or
    units are nontransferable and subject to forfeiture for periods
    prescribed by the Company. These awards are valued at the market
    value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant and
    are subsequently amortized over the periods during which the
    restrictions lapse, generally 3 years. In 2009, the Company
    had forfeitures of 2 units granted in 2008. There were no
    forfeitures in 2008 or 2007. Compensation expense, net of
    forfeitures, recognized in selling, distribution and
    administration expense relating to the outstanding restricted
    stock and restricted stock units was $768, $661, and $183 in
    fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. At December 27,
    2009, the amount of total unrecognized compensation cost related
    to restricted stock units is $1,002 and the weighted average
    period over which this will be expensed is 16 months. In
    2009, the Company issued 20 shares related to restricted
    stock granted in 2006.

In 2009, 2008, and 2007, as part of its annual equity grant to
    executive officers and certain other employees, the Compensation
    Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors approved the
    issuance of contingent stock performance awards (the “Stock
    Performance Awards”). These awards provide the recipients
    with the ability to earn shares of the Company’s common
    stock based on the Company’s achievement of stated
    cumulative diluted earnings per share and cumulative net revenue
    targets over the three fiscal years ended December 2011,
    December 2010, and December 2009 for the 2009, 2008 and 2007
    awards, respectively. Each Stock Performance Award has a target
    number of shares of common stock associated with such award
    which may be earned by the recipient if the Company achieves the
    stated diluted earnings per share and revenue targets. The
    ultimate amount of the award may vary, depending on actual
    results, from 0% to 125% of the target number of shares. The
    Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors
    has discretionary power to reduce the amount of the award
    regardless of whether the stated targets are met.

Stock Performance Awards granted during 2009 and 2008 include
    116 and 100 shares related to the 2007 and 2006 awards,
    respectively, reflecting an increase in the ultimate amount of
    the awards to be issued based on the Company’s actual
    results during the performance period. These shares are excluded
    from the calculation of the weighted average grant-date fair
    value of Stock Performance Awards granted during 2009 and 2008.

During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company recognized $15,361,
    $17,422 and $11,122, respectively, of expense relating to these
    awards. If minimum targets, as detailed under the award, are not
    met, no additional compensation cost will be recognized and any
    previously recognized compensation cost will be reversed. These
    awards were valued at the market value of the underlying common
    stock at the dates of grant and are being amortized over the
    three fiscal years ended December 2011, December 2010, and
    December 2009 for the 2009, 2008 and 2007 awards, respectively.
    At December 27, 2009, the amount of total unrecognized
    compensation cost related to these awards is approximately
    $13,339 and the weighted average period over which this will be
    expensed is 19 months.

Total compensation expense related to stock options and the
    Stock Performance Awards for the years ended December 27,

    and 3.73 years, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value
    of the options outstanding and exercisable at December 27,
    2009 was $119,747 and $82,373, respectively.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model in
    determining the fair value of stock options. The weighted
    average fair value of options granted in fiscal 2009, 2008 and
    2007 was $5.16, $4.46 and $7.39, respectively. The fair value of
    each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted
    average assumptions used for grants in the fiscal years 2009,
    2008 and 2007:

    of the option, of the options exercised in fiscal 2009, 2008 and
    2007 were $4,044, $83,747 and $54,629, respectively.

At December 27, 2009, the amount of total unrecognized
    compensation cost related to stock options was $17,343 and the
    weighted average period over which this will be expensed is
    23 months.

In 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company granted 60, 36 and
    31 shares of common stock, respectively, to its
    non-employee members of its Board of Directors. Of these shares,
    the receipt of 51 shares from the 2009 grant,
    30 shares from the 2008 grant and 19 shares from the
    2007 grant has been deferred to the date upon which the
    respective director ceases to be a member of the Company’s
    Board of Directors. These awards were valued at the market value
    of the underlying common stock at the date of grant and vested
    upon grant. In connection with these grants, compensation cost
    of $1,365, $1,260 and $990 was recorded in selling, distribution
    and administration expense in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

In 2007 certain warrants previously issued by the Company
    allowing for the purchase of 1,700 shares of the
    Company’s common stock, with a weighted average exercise
    price of approximately $16.99, were exercised. The holder of the
    warrants elected to settle the warrants through a non-cash net
    share settlement, resulting in the issuance of 779 shares.
    If the holder had not elected net share settlement, the Company
    would have received cash proceeds from the exercise totaling
    $28,888 and would have been required to issue 1,700 shares.

In addition, during 2007 the Company exercised its call option
    to repurchase warrants which allowed for the purchase of an
    aggregate of 15,750 shares of the Company’s common
    stock. The Company had a warrant amendment agreement with
    Lucasfilm Ltd. and Lucas Licensing Ltd. (together
    “Lucas”) that provided the Company with a call option
    through October 13, 2016 to purchase the warrants from
    Lucas for a price to be paid at the Company’s election of
    either $200,000 in cash or the equivalent of $220,000 in shares
    of the Company’s common stock, such stock being valued at
    the time of the exercise of the option. Also, the warrant
    amendment agreement provided Lucas with a put option through
    January 2008 to sell all of these warrants to the Company for a
    price to be paid at the Company’s election of either
    $100,000 in cash or the equivalent of $110,000 in shares of the
    Company’s common stock, such stock being valued at the time
    of the exercise of the option. In May 2007 the Company exercised
    its call option to repurchase all of the outstanding warrants
    for the Company’s common stock held by Lucas and paid
    $200,000 in cash and repurchased the warrants.

Prior to exercising the call option, the Company adjusted these
    warrants to their fair value through earnings at the end of each
    reporting period. During 2007, the Company recorded other
    expense of $44,370 to adjust the warrants to their fair value.
    This amount is included in other (income) expense, net in the
    consolidated statements of operations. There was no tax benefit
    or expense associated with these fair value adjustments.

Pension,
    Postretirement and Postemployment Benefits

Pension
    and Postretirement Benefits

The Company recognizes an asset or liability for each of its
    defined benefit pension plans equal to the difference between
    the projected benefit obligation of the plan and the fair value
    of the plan’s assets. Actuarial gains and losses and prior
    service costs that have not yet been included in income are
    recognized in the balance sheet in AOCE.

In 2007 the Company changed the measurement date of certain of
    its defined benefit pension plans and the Company’s other
    postretirement plan from September 30 to the Company’s
    fiscal year-end date. As a result of this election, the assets
    and liabilities of these plans were remeasured as of
    December 31, 2006. The remeasurement of the assets and
    liabilities resulted in an increase in the projected benefit
    obligation of $536 and an increase in the fair value of plan
    assets of $10,872. The impact of this accounting change was a
    reduction of retained earnings of $2,143, an increase to
    accumulated other comprehensive earnings of $7,779, a decrease
    in long-term accrued pension expense of $3,619, an increase in
    prepaid pension expense of $5,482, and a decrease in long-term
    deferred tax assets of $3,465.

Expenses related to the Company’s defined benefit and
    defined contribution plans for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were
    approximately $41,100, $33,400 and $25,900, respectively. Of
    these amounts, $27,600, $32,400 and $13,400 related to defined
    contribution plans in the United States and certain
    international affiliates. The remainder of the expense relates
    to defined benefit plans discussed below.

United
    States Plans

Prior to 2008, substantially all United States employees were
    covered under at least one of several non-contributory defined
    benefit pension plans maintained by the Company. Benefits under
    the two major plans



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

(Thousands

which principally cover non-union employees, were based
    primarily on salary and years of service. One of these major
    plans is funded. Benefits under the remaining plans are based
    primarily on fixed amounts for specified years of service. Of
    these remaining plans, the plan covering union employees is also
    funded.

In 2007, for the two major plans covering its non-union
    employees, the Company froze benefits being accrued effective at
    the end of December 2007. In connection with this, the Company
    recognized a reduction of its projected benefit obligation as a
    result of this curtailment of $18,499 and recorded a curtailment
    loss of $908. The pension benefit was replaced by additional
    employer contributions to the Company’s defined
    contribution plan beginning in 2008.

At December 27, 2009, the measurement date, the projected
    benefit obligations of the funded plans were in excess of the
    fair value of the plans’ assets in the amount of $19,395
    while the unfunded plans of the Company had an aggregate
    accumulated and projected benefit obligation of $36,448. At
    December 28, 2008, the projected benefit obligations of the
    funded plans were in excess of the fair value of the plans’
    assets in the amount of $25,142 while the unfunded plans of the
    Company had an aggregate accumulated and projected benefit
    obligation of $43,450.

Hasbro also provides certain postretirement health care and life
    insurance benefits to eligible employees who retire and have
    either attained age 65 with 5 years of service or
    age 55 with 10 years of service. The cost of providing
    these benefits on behalf of employees who retired prior to 1993
    is and will continue to be substantially borne by the Company.
    The cost of providing benefits on behalf of substantially all
    employees who retire after 1992 is borne by the employee. The
    plan is not funded.

In fiscal 2010, the Company expects amortization of unrecognized
    net losses and unrecognized prior service cost related to its
    defined benefit pension plans of $4,115 and $198, respectively,
    to be included as a component of net periodic benefit cost. The
    Company does not expect any amortization of unrecognized net
    losses in 2010 related to its postretirement plan.

Level 1 assets primarily consist of investments traded on

    The Plans’ Level 2 assets primarily consist of
    investments in common and collective trusts as well as other
    private investment funds that are valued using the net asset
    values provided by the trust or fund. Although these trusts and
    funds are not traded in an active market with quoted prices, the
    investments underlying the net asset value are based on quoted
    prices. The Plans’ Level 3 assets consist of an
    investment in a hedge fund which is valued using the net asset
    value provided by the investment manager. This fund contains
    investments in financial instruments that are valued using
    certain estimates which are considered unobservable in that they
    reflect the investment manager’s own assumptions about the
    inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset
    or liability. The Company believes that the net asset value is

best information available for use in the fair value measurement

    December 27, 2009.

Hasbro’s two major funded plans (the “Plans”) are
    defined benefit pension plans intended to provide retirement
    benefits to participants in accordance with the benefit
    structure established by Hasbro, Inc. The Plans’ investment
    managers, who exercise full investment discretion within
    guidelines outlined in the Plans’ Investment Policy, are
    charged with managing the assets with the care, skill, prudence
    and diligence that a prudent investment professional in similar
    circumstance would exercise. Investment practices, at a minimum,
    must comply with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
    (ERISA) and any other applicable laws and regulations.

The Plans’ asset allocations are structured to meet a
    long-term targeted total return consistent with the ongoing
    nature of the Plans’ liabilities. The shared long-term
    total return goal, presently 8.50%, includes income plus
    realized and unrealized gains

and/or

losses on the Plans’ assets. Utilizing generally accepted
    diversification techniques, the Plans’ assets, in aggregate
    and at the individual portfolio level, are invested so that the
    total portfolio risk exposure and risk-adjusted returns best
    meet the Plans’ long-term obligations to employees. The
    Company’s asset allocation includes alternative investment
    strategies designed to achieve a modest absolute return in
    addition to the return on an underlying asset class such as bond
    or equity indices. These alternative investment strategies may
    use derivatives to gain market returns in an efficient and
    timely manner; however, derivatives are not used to leverage the
    portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying assets.
    These alternative investment strategies are included in other
    equity and fixed income asset categories at December 27,
    2009 and December 28, 2008. Plan asset allocations are
    reviewed at least quarterly and rebalanced to achieve target
    allocation among the asset categories when necessary.

The Plans’ investment managers are provided specific
    guidelines under which they are to invest the assets assigned to
    them. In general, investment managers are expected to remain
    fully invested in their asset class with further limitations of
    risk as related to investments in a single security, portfolio
    turnover and credit quality.

With the exception of the alternative investment strategies
    mentioned above, the Plans’ Investment Policy restricts the
    use of derivatives associated with leverage or speculation. In
    addition, the Investment Policy also restricts investments in
    securities issued by Hasbro, Inc. except through index-related
    strategies (e.g. an S&P 500 Index Fund)

and/or

commingled funds. In addition, unless specifically approved by
    the Investment Committee (which is comprised of members of
    management, established by the Board to manage and control
    pension plan assets), certain securities, strategies, and
    investments are ineligible for inclusion within the Plans.

For 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company measured the assets and
    obligations of the Plans as of the fiscal year-end. The
    following is a detail of the components of the net periodic
    benefit cost (benefit) for the three years ended
    December 27, 2009.

If the health care cost trend rate were increased one percentage
    point in each year, the accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation at December 27, 2009 and the aggregate of the
    benefits earned during the period and the interest cost would
    have both increased by approximately 4%.

Hasbro works with external benefit investment specialists to
    assist in the development of the long-term rate of return
    assumptions used to model and determine the overall asset
    allocation. Forecast returns are based on the combination of
    historical returns, current market conditions and a forecast for
    the capital markets for the next 5-7 years. All asset class
    assumptions are within certain bands around the long-term
    historical averages. Correlations are based primarily on
    historical return patterns.

International
    Plans

Pension coverage for employees of Hasbro’s international
    subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate,
    through separate defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
    At December 27, 2009 and December 28, 2008, the
    defined benefit plans had total projected benefit obligations of
    $70,328 and $67,437, respectively, and fair values of plan
    assets of $69,724 and $40,515, respectively. Substantially all
    of the plan assets are invested in equity and fixed income
    securities. The pension expense related to these plans was
    $4,903, $3,226 and $3,937 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    In fiscal 2010, the Company expects amortization of $71 of prior
    service costs, $57 of unrecognized net losses and $(1) of
    unrecognized transition obligation to be included as a component
    of net periodic benefit cost.

Expected benefit payments under the international defined
    benefit pension plans for the five years subsequent to 2009 and
    in the aggregate for the five years thereafter are as follows:
    2010: $1,291; 2011: $1,405; 2012: $1,669; 2013: $2,104; 2014:
    $2,650; and 2015 through 2019: $16,017.

Postemployment
    Benefits

Hasbro has several plans covering certain groups of employees,
    which may provide benefits to such employees following their
    period of active employment but prior to their retirement. These
    plans include certain severance plans which provide benefits to
    employees involuntarily terminated and certain plans which
    continue the Company’s health and life insurance
    contributions for employees who have left Hasbro’s employ
    under terms of its long-term disability plan.

(14)

Leases

Hasbro occupies certain offices and uses certain equipment under
    various operating lease arrangements. The rent expense under
    such arrangements, net of sublease income which is not material,
    for 2009, 2008 and 2007 amounted to $43,562, $43,634 and
    $36,897, respectively.

Minimum rentals, net of minimum sublease income, which is not
    material, under long-term operating leases for the five years
    subsequent to 2009 and in the aggregate thereafter are as
    follows: 2010: $25,932; 2011: $22,845; 2012: $17,439; 2013:
    $14,559; 2014: $6,728; and thereafter: $10,972.

All leases expire prior to the end of 2020. Real estate taxes,
    insurance and maintenance expenses are generally obligations of
    the Company. It is expected that, in the normal course of
    business, leases that expire will be renewed or replaced by
    leases on other properties; thus, it is anticipated that future
    minimum lease commitments will not be less than the amounts
    shown for 2009.

In addition, Hasbro leases certain facilities which, as a result
    of restructurings, are no longer in use. Future costs relating
    to such facilities were accrued as a component of the original
    restructuring charge and are not included in minimum rental
    amounts above.

(15)

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Hasbro uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the
    impact of currency rate fluctuations on firmly committed and
    projected future foreign currency transactions. These

over-the-counter

contracts, which hedge future currency requirements related to
    purchases of inventory and other cross-border transactions not
    denominated in the functional currency of the business unit, are
    primarily denominated in United States and Hong Kong dollars,
    Euros and United Kingdom pound sterling and are entered into
    with a number of counterparties, all of which are major
    financial institutions. The Company believes that a default by a
    single counterparty would not have a material adverse effect on
    the financial condition of the Company. Hasbro does not enter
    into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

The Company also has warrants to purchase common stock that
    qualify as derivatives. For additional information related to
    these warrants see note 11. In addition, during the fourth
    quarter of 2009, the Company entered into several interest rate
    swap agreements to adjust the amount of long-term debt subject
    to fixed interest rates. For additional information related to
    these interest rate swaps see note 8.

Cash
    Flow Hedges

Hasbro uses foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the
    impact of currency rate fluctuations on firmly committed and
    projected future foreign currency transactions. All of the
    Company’s designated foreign currency forward contracts are
    considered to be cash flow hedges. These instruments hedge a
    portion of the Company’s currency requirements associated
    with anticipated inventory purchases and other cross-border
    transactions in 2010 and 2011.

At December 27, 2009, the notional amounts and fair values
    of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts
    designated as cash flow hedging instruments were as follows:

    forward contracts. The fair values of the Company’s foreign
    currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are
    recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at December 27,
    2009 as follows:

During the year ended December 27, 2009, the Company
    reclassified net gains from other comprehensive earnings to net
    earnings of $21,240. Of the amount reclassified in 2009, $17,173
    was reclassified to cost of sales and $4,785 was reclassified to
    royalty expense. In addition, net losses of $(718) were
    reclassified to earnings as a result of hedge ineffectiveness in
    2009.

Undesignated
    Hedges

The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts
    to minimize the impact of changes in the fair value of
    intercompany loans due to foreign currency changes. Due to the
    short-term nature of the derivative contracts involved, the
    Company does not use hedge accounting for these contracts. As of
    December 27, 2009, the total notional amount of the
    Company’s undesignated derivative instruments was $94,926.

At December 27, 2009, the fair values of the Company’s
    undesignated derivative financial instruments are recorded in
    prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated
    balance sheet as follows:

Unrealized gains

$


Unrealized losses

The Company recorded net gains (losses) of $6,580, $(42,382) and
    $(2,098) on these instruments to other (income) expense, net for
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, relating to the change in
    fair value of such derivatives, substantially offsetting gains
    and losses from the change in fair value of intercompany loans
    to which the contracts relate.

For additional information related to the Company’s
    derivative financial instruments see notes 2, 8 and 11.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Hasbro had unused open letters of credit and related instruments
    of approximately $135,277 and $100,700 at December 27, 2009
    and December 28, 2008, respectively.

The Company enters into license agreements with inventors,
    designers and others for the use of intellectual properties in
    its products. Certain of these agreements contain provisions for
    the payment of guaranteed or minimum royalty amounts.
    Additionally, the Company has a long-term commitment related to
    promotional and marketing activities at a U.S. based theme
    park. Under terms of existing agreements as of December 27,
    2009, Hasbro may, provided the other party meets their
    contractual commitment, be required to pay amounts as follows:
    2010: $32,761; 2011: $36,804; 2012: $61,926; 2013: $85,000;
    2014: $14,375; and thereafter: $100,625. At December 27,
    2009, the Company had $120,115 of prepaid royalties, $43,115 of
    which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets
    and $77,000 of which are included in other assets.

In addition to the above commitments, certain of the above
    contracts impose minimum marketing commitments on the Company.
    The Company may be subject to additional royalty guarantees
    totaling $140,000 that are not included in the amounts above
    that may be payable during the next five to six years contingent
    upon the quantity and types of theatrical movie releases.

In connection with the Company’s agreement to form a joint
    venture with Discovery, the Company is obligated to make future
    payments to Discovery under a tax sharing agreement. The Company
    estimates these payments may total approximately $139,000 and
    may range from approximately $3,000 to $7,000 per year during
    the period 2010 to 2014, and approximately $110,000 in aggregate
    for all years occurring thereafter.



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

These payments are contingent upon the Company having sufficient
    taxable income to realize the expected tax deductions of certain
    amounts related to the joint venture.

At December 27, 2009, the Company had approximately
    $251,917 in outstanding purchase commitments.

Hasbro is party to certain legal proceedings, none of which,
    individually or in the aggregate, is deemed to be material to
    the financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

Segment
    Reporting

Segment
    and Geographic Information

Hasbro is a worldwide leader in children’s and family
    leisure time products and services, including toys, games and
    licensed products ranging from traditional to high-tech and
    digital. In 2009 the Company changed the name of the Other
    segment to Entertainment and Licensing. The Company’s
    segments now are (i) U.S. and Canada,
    (ii) International, (iii) Entertainment and Licensing,
    and (iv) Global Operations.

The U.S. and Canada segment includes the marketing and
    selling of boys’ action figures, vehicles and playsets,
    girls’ toys, electronic toys and games, plush products,
    preschool toys and infant products, electronic interactive
    products, toy-related specialty products, traditional board
    games and puzzles, DVD-based games and trading card and
    role-playing games within the United States and Canada. Within
    the International segment, the Company markets and sells both
    toy and certain game products in markets outside of the
    U.S. and Canada, primarily the European, Asia Pacific, and
    Latin and South American regions. The Global Operations segment
    is responsible for manufacturing and sourcing finished product
    for the Company’s U.S. and Canada and International
    segments. The Company’s Entertainment and Licensing segment
    includes the Company’s lifestyle licensing, digital gaming,
    movie, television and online entertainment operations.

Segment performance is measured at the operating profit level.
    Included in Corporate and eliminations are certain corporate
    expenses, the elimination of intersegment transactions and
    certain assets benefiting more than one segment. Intersegment
    sales and transfers are reflected in management reports at
    amounts approximating cost. Certain shared costs, including
    global development and marketing expenses, are allocated to
    segments based upon foreign exchange rates fixed at the
    beginning of the year, with adjustments to actual foreign
    exchange rates included in Corporate and eliminations. The
    accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
    referenced in note 1.

Results shown for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 are not
    necessarily those which would be achieved if each segment was an
    unaffiliated business enterprise.

The Global Operations segment derives substantially all of its
    revenues, and thus its operating results, from intersegment
    activities.

Certain intangible assets, primarily goodwill, which benefit
    multiple operating segments are reflected as Corporate assets
    for segment reporting purposes. In accordance with accounting
    standards related to impairment testing, these amounts have been
    allocated to the reporting unit which benefits from their use.
    In addition, allocations of certain expenses related to these
    assets to the individual operating segments are done at the
    beginning of the year based on budgeted amounts. Any differences
    between actual and budgeted amounts are reflected in the
    Corporate segment.

Other
    Information

Hasbro markets its products primarily to customers in the retail
    sector. Although the Company closely monitors the
    creditworthiness of its customers, adjusting credit policies and
    limits as deemed appropriate, a substantial portion of its
    customers’ ability to discharge amounts owed is generally
    dependent upon the overall retail economic environment.

Sales to the Company’s three largest customers, Wal-Mart
    Stores, Inc., Target Corporation and Toys “R” Us,
    Inc., amounted to 25%, 13% and 11%, respectively, of
    consolidated net revenues during 2009, 25%, 12% and 10% during
    2008 and 24%, 12% and 11% during 2007. These net revenues were
    primarily within the U.S. and Canada segment.

Hasbro purchases certain components used in its manufacturing
    process and certain finished products from manufacturers in the
    Far East. The Company’s reliance on external sources of
    manufacturing can be

shifted, over a period of time, to alternative sources of supply
    for products it sells, should such changes be necessary.
    However, if the Company were prevented from obtaining products
    from a substantial number of its current Far East suppliers due
    to political, labor or other factors beyond its control, the
    Company’s operations would be disrupted, potentially for a
    significant period of time, while alternative sources of product
    were secured. The imposition of trade sanctions by the United
    States or the European Union against a class of products
    imported by Hasbro from, or the loss of “normal trade
    relations” status by, the People’s Republic of China
    could significantly increase the cost of the Company’s
    products imported into the United States or Europe.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as
    defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
    “Exchange Act”), that are designed to ensure that
    information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
    reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
    Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is
    accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,
    including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure. The Company carried out an evaluation,
    under the supervision and with the participation of the
    Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures as of December 27, 2009.
    Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and
    procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls
    and procedures were effective.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting, as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

promulgated under the Exchange Act. Hasbro’s internal
    control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance
    regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
    preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles. Hasbro’s management assessed the effectiveness
    of its internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 27, 2009. In making its assessment, Hasbro’s
    management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in
    “Internal Control-Integrated Framework”. Based on this
    assessment, Hasbro’s management concluded that, as of
    December 27, 2009, its internal control over financial
    reporting is effective based on those criteria. Hasbro’s
    independent registered public accounting firm has issued an
    audit report on internal control over financial reporting, which
    is included herein.



Report
    of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Hasbro, Inc.:

We have audited Hasbro, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 27, 2009, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Hasbro, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 27, 2009, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Hasbro, Inc. and subsidiaries as
    of December 27, 2009 and December 28, 2008, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations,
    shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal
    years in the three-year period ended December 27, 2009, and
    our report dated February 24, 2010 expressed an unqualified
    opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
