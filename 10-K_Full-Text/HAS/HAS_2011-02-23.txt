Business

General
    Development and Description of Business and Business
    Segments

Except as expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise
    requires, as used herein, “Hasbro”, the
    “Company”, “we”, or “us”, means
    Hasbro, Inc., a Rhode Island corporation organized on
    January 8, 1926, and its subsidiaries. Unless otherwise
    specifically indicated, all dollar or share amounts herein are
    expressed in thousands of dollars or shares, except for per
    share amounts.

Overview

We are a worldwide leader in children’s and family leisure
    time products and services with a broad portfolio of brands and
    entertainment properties. As a branded play, consumer-focused
    global company, Hasbro applies its brand blueprint to all of its
    operations. The brand blueprint revolves around the objective of
    continuously re-imagining, re-inventing, and re-igniting our
    brands through a wide range of innovative toys and games,
    entertainment offerings, including television programming and
    motion pictures, and licensed products, ranging from traditional
    to high-tech and digital, under well-known brand names such as
    TRANSFORMERS, PLAYSKOOL, NERF, LITTLEST PET SHOP, MY LITTLE
    PONY, G.I. JOE, TONKA, MILTON BRADLEY, PARKER BROTHERS, CRANIUM
    and WIZARDS OF THE COAST. Our offerings encompass a broad
    variety of games, including traditional board, card, hand-held
    electronic, trading card, role-playing and DVD games, as well as
    electronic learning aids and puzzles. Toy offerings include
    boys’ action figures, vehicles and playsets, girls’
    toys, electronic toys, plush products, preschool toys and infant
    products, electronic interactive products, creative play and toy
    related specialty products. In addition, in order to further
    expand our brands, we license certain of our trademarks,
    characters and other property rights to third parties for use in
    connection with digital gaming, consumer promotions, and for the
    sale of non-competing toys and games and non-toy products. We
    also seek to expand awareness of our brands through immersive
    entertainment experiences, including television and movies. We
    own a 50% interest in a joint venture with Discovery
    Communications, Inc. (“Discovery”) that operates a
    television network in the United States, THE HUB, dedicated to
    high-quality children’s and family entertainment and
    educational programming. Hasbro Studios, our wholly-owned
    production studio, produces television programming primarily
    based on our brands for distribution on THE HUB in the United
    States and for distribution on other networks internationally.

Product
    Categories

We market our brands under the following primary product
    categories: (1) boys’ toys; (2) games and
    puzzles; (3) girls’ toys; and (4) preschool toys.
    Descriptions of these product categories are as follows:

Our boys’ toys category includes a wide range of core brand
    offerings such as TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE action figures and
    accessories, NERF sports and action products, as well as
    entertainment-based licensed products based on popular movie,
    television and comic book characters, such as STAR WARS and
    MARVEL toys and accessories. In the action figure area, a key
    part of our strategy focuses on the importance of reinforcing
    the storyline associated with these products through the use of
    media-based entertainment. In 2010, sales in our boys’ toys
    category also benefited from the major motion picture release of

IRON MAN 2

. In addition, STAR WARS and SPIDER-MAN
    products were each supported by animated television series. In
    2011, the major motion pictures

TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE
    MOON,

based on our TRANSFORMERS property, and

THOR

and

CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER,

from MARVEL,
    are expected to be released. In addition to marketing and
    developing action figures and accessories for traditional play,
    the Company also develops and markets products designed for
    collectors, which has been a key component of the success of the
    STAR WARS brand. Other key boys’ brands include TONKA
    trucks and playsets, BEYBLADE tops and accessories and
    SUPERSOAKER water squirting toys.

Our games and puzzles category includes several well known
    lines, including MILTON BRADLEY, PARKER BROTHERS, CRANIUM,
    AVALON HILL and WIZARDS OF THE COAST. These brand portfolios
    consist of a broad assortment of games for children, tweens,
    families and adults. Core game brands include



MONOPOLY, TRIVIAL PURSUIT, BATTLESHIP, GAME OF LIFE, SCRABBLE,
    CHUTES AND LADDERS, CANDY LAND, TROUBLE, MOUSETRAP, OPERATION,
    HUNGRY HUNGRY HIPPOS, CONNECT FOUR, TWISTER, YAHTZEE, CRANIUM,
    JENGA, SIMON, CLUE, SORRY!, RISK, BOGGLE, TRIVIAL PURSUIT, GUESS
    WHO? and BOP IT!, as well as a line of puzzles for children and
    adults, including the BIG BEN and CROXLEY lines of puzzles.
    WIZARDS OF THE COAST offers trading card and role-playing games,
    including MAGIC: THE GATHERING, DUEL MASTERS and
    DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. We seek to keep our game brands
    relevant through sustained marketing programs, such as FAMILY
    GAME NIGHT, as well as by offering consumers new ways to
    experience these brands.

In our girls’ toys category, we seek to provide a
    traditional and wholesome play experience. Girls’ toy
    brands include LITTLEST PET SHOP, MY LITTLE PONY, FURREAL
    FRIENDS, BABY ALIVE and STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE. In 2010, the MY
    LITTLE PONY brand was supported through television programming
    on THE HUB beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010. This
    programming will continue in 2011. In addition, the LITTLEST PET
    SHOP brand will be supported by expanded digital gaming through
    our partnership with Electronic Arts, Inc. (“EA”).

Our preschool toys category encompasses a range of products for
    infants and preschoolers in the various stages of development.
    Our preschool products include a portfolio of core brands
    marketed primarily under the PLAYSKOOL trademark. The PLAYSKOOL
    line includes such well-known products as MR. POTATO HEAD,
    WEEBLES, SIT ’N SPIN and GLOWORM, along with a successful
    line of infant toys including STEP START WALK’ N RIDE,
    2-IN-1 TUMMY TIME GYM and BUSY BALL POPPER. In addition, 2011
    will be the first year of our agreement with Sesame Workshop
    that provides us with the licensed rights to produce products
    based on the SESAME STREET portfolio of characters, including
    ELMO, BIG BIRD, and COOKIE MONSTER, among others. Through our
    preschool marketing programs, we seek to provide consumer
    friendly information that assists parents in understanding the
    developmental milestones their children will encounter as well
    as the role each PLAYSKOOL product can play in helping children
    to achieve these developmental milestones. In addition, our
    preschool category also includes certain TONKA lines of trucks
    and interactive toys, including the CHUCK & FRIENDS
    line, and the PLAY-DOH brand. The CHUCK & FRIENDS line
    was supported by television programming on THE HUB in the fourth
    quarter of 2010, which will continue in 2011.

Segments

Organizationally, our three principal segments are U.S. and
    Canada, International and Entertainment and Licensing. The
    U.S. and Canada and International segments engage in the
    marketing and selling of various toy and game products as listed
    above. Our toy, game and puzzle products are developed by a
    global development group. We also have a global marketing
    function which establishes brand direction and assists the
    segments in establishing certain local marketing programs. The
    costs of these groups are allocated to the principal segments.
    Our U.S. and Canada segment covers the United States and
    Canada while the International segment primarily includes
    Europe, the Asia Pacific region and Latin and South America. The
    Entertainment and Licensing segment engages in the out-licensing
    of our trademarks, characters and other brand and intellectual
    property rights to third parties for non-competing products and
    also conducts our movie, television and online entertainment
    operations, including the operations of Hasbro Studios. In
    addition, our Global Operations segment is responsible for
    arranging product manufacturing and sourcing for the
    U.S. and Canada and International segments. Financial
    information with respect to our segments and geographic areas is
    included in note 18 to our consolidated financial
    statements, which are included in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

The Company’s strategy is focused around re-imagining,
    re-inventing, and re-igniting its existing brands, and
    imagining, inventing, and igniting new brands, globally through
    the development and marketing of innovative toy and game
    products, providing immersive entertainment experiences for our
    consumers, and expansion of our brands into other consumer
    products through a broad licensing program. The following is a
    discussion of each segment.



U.S.
    and Canada

This segment engages in the marketing and sale of our product
    categories in the United States and Canada. The U.S. and
    Canada segment’s strategy is based on promoting our brands
    through innovation and reinvention of toys and games. This is
    accomplished through introducing new initiatives driven by
    consumer and marketplace insights and leveraging opportunistic
    toy and game lines and licenses. This strategy leverages off of
    efforts to increase consumer awareness of the Company’s
    core brands through entertainment experiences such as motion
    pictures, television and publishing. Major 2010 brands and
    products included NERF, MARVEL products, STAR WARS products,
    LITTLEST PET SHOP, TRANSFORMERS, PLAYSKOOL, MAGIC: THE
    GATHERING, PLAY-DOH, FURREAL FRIENDS, and MONOPOLY.

International

The International segment engages in the marketing and sale of
    our product categories to retailers and wholesalers in most
    countries in Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin and South America
    and through distributors in those countries where we have no
    direct presence. In addition to growing core brands and
    leveraging opportunistic toy lines and licenses, we seek to grow
    our international business by continuing to expand into Eastern
    Europe and emerging markets in Asia and Latin and South America.
    In recent years, we expanded our operations in Brazil, China,
    Russia, the Czech Republic, Romania and Korea. We will continue
    to expand operations in emerging markets in future years through
    the establishment of subsidiaries or increased involvement with
    our existing distributors. The Company began operations in Peru
    in 2010 and Colombia in 2011. Key international brands for 2010
    included LITTLEST PET SHOP, NERF, TRANSFORMERS, MONOPOLY,
    FURREAL FRIENDS, PLAY-DOH, PLAYSKOOL, STAR WARS, and BEYBLADE.

Entertainment
    and Licensing

Our Entertainment and Licensing segment includes our lifestyle
    licensing, digital licensing, movie, television and online
    entertainment operations. Our lifestyle licensing category seeks
    to promote our brands through the out-licensing of our
    intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and
    merchandising uses in businesses which do not compete directly
    with our own product offerings, such as apparel, publishing,
    home goods and electronics.

Our digital licensing category seeks to promote our brands
    through the out-licensing of our intellectual properties in the
    digital area, such as for applications on mobile phones,
    personal computers, and video game consoles. This is primarily
    done through our long-term strategic alliance with EA, which
    provides EA with the exclusive worldwide rights to create
    digital games for all of these major platforms based on most of
    our toy and game intellectual properties.

As noted above, we own a 50% interest in a joint venture with
    Discovery that operates a television network in the United
    States, THE HUB, which debuted in October 2010. THE HUB is
    dedicated to providing high-quality children’s and family
    entertainment and educational programming. To support our
    strategic objective of further developing our brands through
    television entertainment, we established a wholly-owned
    television studio, Hasbro Studios, that produces programming for
    distribution on THE HUB network in the U.S. and for
    international distribution on other networks. The programming is
    primarily based on our brands, but also includes third-party
    branded content. Hasbro Studios has a coordinated development
    process that aligns with THE HUB.

In addition to the above, we also seek to promote and leverage
    our brands through major motion pictures. In 2009,

TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN

and

G.I. JOE: THE
    RISE OF COBRA

were released based on our brands. In July
    2011,

TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON

is expected to be
    released. In addition, we also have a long-term strategic
    relationship with Universal Pictures to produce at least three
    motion pictures based on certain of our core brands, with an
    option to produce two additional movies. The first movies under
    this relationship,

BATTLESHIP

and

OUIJA

, are
    expected to be released in 2012.

Promotion of our brands through major motion pictures and
    television programming provides our consumers with the ability
    to experience our brands in a different format which we believe
    can result in



increased product sales, royalty revenues, and overall brand
    awareness. To a lesser extent, we can also earn revenue from our
    participation in the financial results of motion pictures and
    related DVD releases and through the distribution of television
    programming. Revenue from product sales is a component of the
    U.S. and Canada and International segments, while royalty
    revenues, including revenues earned from movies and television
    programming, is included in the Entertainment and Licensing
    segment.

Global
    Operations

In our Global Operations segment, we manufacture and source
    production of substantially all of our toy and game products.
    The Company owns and operates manufacturing facilities in East
    Longmeadow, Massachusetts and Waterford, Ireland which
    predominantly produce games and puzzles. Sourcing of our other
    production is done through unrelated third party manufacturers
    in various Far East countries, principally China, using a Hong
    Kong based wholly-owned subsidiary operation for quality control
    and order coordination purposes. See “Manufacturing and
    Importing” below for more details concerning overseas
    manufacturing and sourcing.

Other
    Information

To further extend our range of products in the various segments
    of our business, we sell a portion of our toy and game products
    directly to retailers, on a direct import basis from the Far
    East. These sales are reflected in the revenue of the related
    segment where the customer resides.

Certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale
    in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct
    business presence.

During 2010, net revenues generated from NERF products were
    approximately $414,000, which was 10.3% of our consolidated net
    revenues for that year. During 2009, net revenues generated from
    TRANSFORMERS products were approximately $592,000, which was
    14.5% of our consolidated net revenues in that year. No other
    line of products constituted 10% or more of our consolidated net
    revenues in 2010 or 2009. No individual line of products
    accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net revenues
    during our 2008 fiscal year.

Working
    Capital Requirements

Our working capital needs are primarily financed through cash
    generated from operations and, when necessary, proceeds from
    short-term borrowings. Our borrowings generally reach peak
    levels during the third or fourth quarter of each year. This
    corresponds to the time of year when our receivables also
    generally reach peak levels as part of the production and
    shipment of product in preparation for the holiday season. The
    strategy of retailers has generally been to make a higher
    percentage of their purchases of toy and game products within or
    close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season,
    which includes Christmas. We expect that retailers will continue
    to follow this strategy. Our historical revenue pattern is one
    in which the second half of the year is more significant to our
    overall business than the first half. In 2010, the second half
    of the year accounted for approximately 65% of full year
    revenues with the third and fourth quarters accounting for 33%
    and 32% of full year revenues, respectively. In years where the
    Company has products tied to a major motion picture release,
    such as in 2009 with the mid-year releases of

TRANSFORMERS:
    REVENGE OF THE FALLEN

,

G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA

and

X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE

, this concentration of
    revenue late in the year may not be as pronounced due to the
    higher level of sales that occur around and just prior to the
    time of the motion picture theatrical release. In 2010, the
    Company had products tied to only one major motion picture
    release,

IRON MAN 2,

in May 2010.

The toy and game business is also characterized by customer
    order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of
    differences each year in the degree of consumer acceptance of
    product lines, product availability, marketing strategies and
    inventory policies of retailers, the dates of theatrical
    releases of major motion pictures for which we have product
    licenses, and changes in overall economic conditions. As a
    result, comparisons of our unshipped orders on any date with
    those at the same date in a prior year are not necessarily
    indicative of our sales for that year. Moreover, quick response
    inventory management practices



result in fewer orders being placed significantly in advance of
    shipment and more orders being placed for immediate delivery.
    Retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled
    by suppliers, such as us, closer to the time of purchase by
    consumers. Although the Company may receive orders from
    customers in advance, it is a general industry practice that
    these orders are subject to amendment or cancellation by
    customers prior to shipment and, as such, the Company does not
    believe that these unshipped orders, at any given date, are
    indicative of future sales. The amount of unshipped orders at
    any date in a given year can also be affected by programs that
    we may employ to incent customers to place orders and accept
    shipments early in the year. These programs follow general
    industry practices. The types of programs that we plan to employ
    to promote sales in 2011 are substantially the same as those we
    employed in 2010.

Historically, we commit to the majority of our inventory
    production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a
    given year prior to the peak third and fourth quarter retail
    selling season. Our accounts receivable increase during the
    third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases
    to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season. Due to
    the concentrated timeframe of this selling period, payments for
    these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in
    the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the
    subsequent year. The timing difference between expenses paid and
    revenues collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow
    varying amounts during the year. During 2010, we utilized cash
    from our operations and borrowings under our revolving credit
    agreement as well as our uncommitted lines of credit to meet our
    cash flow requirements.

Royalties
    and Product Development

Our success is dependent on continuous innovation in our
    entertainment offerings, including both the continuing
    development of new brands and products and the redesign of
    existing products to drive consumer interest and market
    acceptance. Our toy, game and puzzle products are developed by a
    global development group and the costs of this group are
    allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal
    operating segments. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, we spent $201,358,
    $181,195 and $191,424, respectively, on activities relating to
    the development, design and engineering of new products and
    their packaging (including products brought to us by independent
    designers) and on the improvement or modification of ongoing
    products. Much of this work is performed by our internal staff
    of designers, artists, model makers and engineers.

In addition to the design and development work performed by our
    own staff, we deal with a number of independent toy and game
    designers for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy
    and game manufacturers. Rights to such designs and ideas, when
    acquired by us, are usually exclusive and the agreements require
    us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item.
    These designer royalty agreements, in some cases, also provide
    for advance royalties and minimum guarantees.

We also produce a number of toys and games under trademarks and
    copyrights utilizing the names or likenesses of characters from
    movies, television shows and other entertainment media, for
    whose rights we compete with other toy and game manufacturers.
    Licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty
    on our net sales of the item. Licenses for the use of characters
    are generally exclusive for specific products or product lines
    in specified territories. In many instances, advance royalties
    and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements.

In 2010, 2009 and 2008, we incurred $248,570, $330,651 and
    $312,986, respectively, of royalty expense. A portion of this
    expense relates to amounts paid in prior years as royalty
    advances. Our royalty expenses in any given year may vary
    depending upon the timing of movie releases and other
    entertainment media.

Marketing
    and Sales

As we are focused on re-imagining, re-inventing and re-igniting
    our many brands on a consistent global basis, we have a global
    marketing function which establishes brand direction and
    messaging, as well as assists the selling entities in
    establishing certain local marketing programs. The costs of this
    group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our
    principal operating segments. Our products are sold globally to
    a broad spectrum of customers, including wholesalers,
    distributors, chain stores, discount stores, mail order houses,
    catalog stores, department stores and other traditional
    retailers, large and small, as well as internet-based



“e-tailers.”

Our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our
    products. Remaining sales are generated by independent
    distributors who sell our products, for the most part, in areas
    of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct
    presence. While we have thousands of customers, there has been
    significant consolidation at the retail level over the last
    several years in our industry. As a result, the majority of our
    sales are to large chain stores, distributors and wholesalers.
    While the consolidation of customers provides us with certain
    benefits, such as potentially more efficient product
    distribution and other decreased costs of sales and
    distribution, this consolidation also creates additional risks
    to our business associated with a major customer having
    financial difficulties or reducing its business with us. In
    addition, customer concentration may decrease the prices we are
    able to obtain for some of our products and reduce the number of
    products we would otherwise be able to bring to market. During
    2010, net revenues from our three largest customers, Wal-Mart
    Stores, Inc., Target Corporation and Toys “R” Us,
    Inc., represented 23%, 12% and 11%, respectively, of
    consolidated net revenues, and sales to our top five customers,
    including Wal-Mart, Target and Toys “R” Us, Inc.,
    accounted for approximately 50% of our consolidated net
    revenues. In the U.S. and Canada segment, approximately 71%
    of our net revenues were derived from these top three customers.

We advertise many of our toy and game products extensively on
    television. Generally our advertising highlights selected items
    in our various product groups in a manner designed to promote
    the sale of not only the selected item, but also other items we
    offer in those product groups as well. Hasbro Studios also
    produces television entertainment based on our brands which
    appears on THE HUB in the U.S. and on other major networks
    internationally. We introduce many of our new products to major
    customers during the year prior to the year of introduction of
    such products for retail sale. In addition, we showcase certain
    of our new products in New York City at the time of the American
    International Toy Fair in February, as well as at other
    international toy shows. In 2010 we spent $420,651 on
    advertising, promotion and marketing programs compared to
    $412,580 in 2009 and $454,612 in 2008.

Manufacturing
    and Importing

During 2010 substantially all of our products were manufactured
    in third party facilities in the Far East, primarily China, as
    well as in our two owned facilities located in East Longmeadow,
    Massachusetts and Waterford, Ireland.

Most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials
    such as plastic, paper and cardboard, although certain products
    also make use of electronic components. All of these materials
    are readily available but may be subject to significant
    fluctuations in price. There are certain chemicals (including
    phthalates and BPA) that national, state and local governments
    have restricted or are seeking to restrict or limit the use of;
    however, we do not believe these restrictions have or will
    materially impact our business. We generally enter into
    agreements with suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that
    establish prices for that year. However, significant volatility
    in the prices of any of these materials may require
    renegotiation with our suppliers during the year. Our
    manufacturing processes and those of our vendors include
    injection molding, blow molding, spray painting, printing, box
    making and assembly. We purchase most of the components and
    accessories used in our toys and certain of the components used
    in our games, as well as some finished items, from manufacturers
    in the United States and in other countries. However, the
    countries of the Far East, and particularly China, constitute
    the largest manufacturing center of toys in the world and the
    substantial majority of our toy products are manufactured in
    China. The 1996 implementation of the General Agreement on
    Tariffs and Trade reduced or eliminated customs duties on many
    of the products imported by us.

We believe that the manufacturing capacity of our third party
    manufacturers, together with our own facilities, as well as the
    supply of components, accessories and completed products which
    we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers, are adequate to
    meet the anticipated demand in 2011 for our products. Our
    reliance on designated external sources of manufacturing could
    be shifted, over a period of time, to alternative sources of
    supply for our products, should such changes be necessary or
    desirable. However, if we were to be prevented from obtaining
    products from a substantial number of our current Far East
    suppliers due to political, labor or other factors beyond our
    control, our operations and our ability to obtain products would
    be severely disrupted while alternative sources of product were
    secured. The imposition of trade sanctions by the
    United States or the European Union against a class of
    products imported by us from, or the loss of “normal



trade relations” status by, China, or other factors which
    increase the cost of manufacturing in China, such as higher
    Chinese labor costs or an appreciation in the Chinese Yuan,
    could significantly disrupt our operations

and/or

significantly increase the cost of the products which are
    manufactured in China and imported into other markets.

We purchase dies and molds from independent United States and
    international sources.

Competition

We are a worldwide leader in the design, manufacture and
    marketing of games and toys and other entertainment offerings,
    but our business is highly competitive. We compete with several
    large toy and game companies in our product categories, as well
    as many smaller United States and international toy and game
    designers, manufacturers and marketers. We also compete with
    companies that offer branded entertainment focused on children
    and their families. Competition is based primarily on meeting
    consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality and play
    value of our products. To a lesser extent, competition is also
    based on product pricing. In the entertainment arena, Hasbro
    Studios and THE HUB compete with other children’s
    television networks and entertainment producers, such as
    NICKELODEON and CARTOON NETWORK, for viewers, advertising
    revenue and distribution

In addition to contending with competition from other toy and
    game and branded play entertainment companies, in our business
    we must deal with the phenomenon that many children have been
    moving away from traditional toys and games at a younger age and
    the array of products and entertainment offerings competing for
    the attention of children has expanded. We refer to this as
    “children getting older younger.” As a result, our
    products not only compete with the offerings of other toy and
    game manufacturers, but we must compete, particularly in meeting
    the demands of older children, with the entertainment offerings
    of many other companies, such as makers of video games and
    consumer electronic products.

The volatility in consumer preferences with respect to family
    entertainment and low barriers to entry continually creates new
    opportunities for existing competitors and

start-ups

to
    develop products which compete with our toy and game offerings.

Employees

At December 26, 2010, we employed approximately
    5,800 persons worldwide, approximately 3,100 of whom were
    located in the United States.

Trademarks,
    Copyrights and Patents

We seek to protect our products, for the most part, and in as
    many countries as practical, through registered trademarks,
    copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is
    available, cost effective, and meaningful. The loss of such
    rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result
    in significant harm to our business, although the loss of such
    protection for a number of significant items might have such an
    effect.

Government
    Regulation

Our toy and game products sold in the United States are subject
    to the provisions of The Consumer Product Safety Act, as amended
    by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, (as
    amended, the “CPSA”), The Federal Hazardous Substances
    Act (the “FHSA”), The Flammable Fabrics Act (the
    “FFA”), and the regulations promulgated thereunder. In
    addition, certain of our products, such as the mixes for our

EASY-BAKE

ovens, are also subject to regulation by the Food and Drug
    Administration.

The CPSA empowers the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the
    “CPSC”) to take action against hazards presented by
    consumer products, including the formulation and implementation
    of regulations and uniform safety standards. The CPSC has the
    authority to seek to declare a product “a banned hazardous
    substance” under the CPSA and to ban it from commerce. The
    CPSC can file an action to seize and condemn an “imminently
    hazardous consumer product” under the CPSA and may also
    order equitable remedies such as



recall, replacement, repair or refund for the product. The FHSA
    provides for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that
    are banned.

Consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and
    cities within the United States and in many foreign markets
    including Canada, Australia and Europe. We utilize laboratories
    that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain
    compliance with the CPSA, the FHSA, the FFA, other applicable
    domestic and international product standards, and our own
    standards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no
    assurance that our products are or will be hazard free. Any
    material product recall or other safety issue impacting our
    product could have an adverse effect on our results of
    operations or financial condition, depending on the product and
    scope of the recall, and could negatively affect sales of our
    other products as well.

The Children’s Television Act of 1990 and the rules
    promulgated thereunder by the United States Federal
    Communications Commission, as well as the laws of certain
    foreign countries, also place limitations on television
    commercials during children’s programming.

We maintain programs to comply with various United States
    federal, state, local and international requirements relating to
    the environment, plant safety and other matters.

The
    volatility of ever-evolving consumer preferences, combined with
    the high level of competition and low barriers to entry in the
    family entertainment industry, make it difficult to achieve,
    maintain or build upon the success of our brands, products and
    product lines, or introduce successful new brands and products.
    In addition, an inability to develop and introduce planned new
    brands, products and product lines in a timely and
    cost-effective manner may damage our business.

The children’s and family entertainment business is a
    trend-driven industry where consumer demands and interests
    evolve quickly. We may develop products which consumers do not
    find interesting enough to buy in significant quantities to be
    profitable to us. Similarly, brands or products that were
    successful at one time may lose consumer interest. Our ongoing
    success is critically dependent upon developing and maintaining
    the consumer appeal of our brands and products and in our
    ongoing ability to achieve and maintain market interest in and
    acceptance of our offerings to a degree that enables those
    brands and products to be profitable. Our failure to
    successfully anticipate, identify and react to children’s
    interests and the current preferences in family entertainment
    could significantly lower sales of our products and harm our
    business and profitability.

A decline in the popularity of our existing brands, products and
    product lines, or the failure of our new brands, products and
    product lines to achieve and sustain sufficient interest from
    retailers and consumers, could significantly lower our revenues
    and operating margins, which would in turn harm our
    profitability, business and financial condition. In our
    industry, it is critical to identify and offer what are
    considered to be the next “hot” toys, games and other
    entertainment offerings on children’s “wish
    lists” and to effectively anticipate children’s
    evolving entertainment interests. Our continued success will
    depend on our ability to develop, market and sell popular toys,
    games and other entertainment offerings, and license our brands
    for products which are sought after by both children and their
    parents, in spite of rapidly evolving consumer tastes. We seek
    to achieve and maintain market popularity for our brands and
    products through the continued re-imagination, re-invention,
    re-ignition and extension of our existing family entertainment
    properties in ways we believe will capture evolving consumer
    interest and imagination, offer immersive brand experiences and
    remain relevant in today’s world, and by developing,
    introducing and gaining customer interest for new family
    entertainment products. This process involves anticipating and
    extending successful play patterns, offering continual product
    innovation and identifying and developing entertainment concepts
    and properties that appeal to children’s imaginations and
    feed the human need for play. However, consumer preferences with
    respect to family entertainment are continuously changing and
    are difficult to anticipate and we may not successfully identify
    product offerings which are sought after by consumers. Evolving
    consumer tastes, coupled with an ever changing pipeline of
    entertainment properties and products which compete for consumer
    interest and acceptance, create an environment in which some
    products can fail to achieve consumer acceptance, and other
    products can be extremely popular during a certain period in
    time but then rapidly be replaced in consumers’ minds with
    other properties. As a result, individual family entertainment
    products and properties often have short consumer life cycles.

Not only must we address rapidly changing consumer tastes and
    interests but we face competitors who are also constantly
    monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes, seeking
    ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new
    products that compete with our products for consumer purchasing.
    In addition to existing competitors, the barriers to entry for
    new participants in the family entertainment industry are low.
    New participants with a popular product idea or entertainment
    property can gain access to consumers and become a significant
    source of competition for our products in a very short period of
    time. In some cases our competitors’ products may achieve
    greater market acceptance than our products and potentially
    reduce demand for our products and lower our profitability.

The challenge of continuously developing and offering products
    that are sought after by children is compounded by the trend of
    children “getting older younger”. By this we mean that
    children are expanding their interests beyond traditional toys
    and games to a wider array of entertainment products at younger
    ages and, as a result, at younger and younger ages, our products
    compete with the offerings of video game suppliers, consumer
    electronics companies, media and social media companies and
    other businesses outside of the traditional toy and game
    industry.



There is no guarantee that:

•

Any of our brands, products or product lines will achieve
    popularity or continue to be popular;

•

Any property for which we have a significant license will
    achieve or sustain popularity;

•

Any new products or product lines we introduce will be
    considered interesting to consumers and achieve an adequate
    market acceptance;

•

Any product’s life cycle or sales quantities will be
    sufficient to permit us to profitably recover our development,
    manufacturing, marketing, royalties (including royalty advances
    and guarantees) and other costs of producing, marketing and
    selling the product; or

•

We will be able to manufacture, source and ship new or
    continuing products in a timely and cost-effective basis to meet
    constantly changing consumer demands, a risk that is heightened
    by our customers’ compressed shipping schedules and the
    seasonality of our business.

In developing new brands, products and product lines, we have
    anticipated dates for the associated product introductions. When
    we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a
    particular product or product line at a certain time in the
    future those expectations are based on completing the associated
    development, implementation, and marketing work in accordance
    with our currently anticipated development schedule. Unforeseen
    delays or difficulties in the development process, significant
    increases in the planned cost of development, or changes in
    anticipated consumer demand for products may cause the
    introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or,
    in some situations, may cause a product introduction to be
    discontinued.

Delays
    or increased costs associated with the development and offering
    of entertainment media based upon or related to our brands, or
    lack of sufficient consumer interest in such entertainment
    media, can harm our business and profitability.

As part of our strategy of offering immersive brand experiences,
    we look to offer consumers the ability to enjoy our brands in as
    many different forms and formats as possible. Entertainment
    media, in forms such as motion pictures and television, can
    provide popular platforms for consumers to experience our brands
    and the success, or lack of success, of such media efforts can
    significantly impact demand for our products and our financial
    success.

The success of our products is often dependent on the timelines
    and effectiveness of media efforts. Television programming,
    movie and DVD releases, comic book releases, and other media
    efforts are often critical in generating interest in our
    products and brands. Not only our efforts, but the efforts of
    third parties, heavily impact the launch dates and success of
    these media efforts. When we say that products or brands will be
    supported by certain media releases, those statements are based
    on our current plans and expectations. Unforeseen factors may
    increase the cost of these releases, delay these media releases
    or even lead to their cancellation. Any delay or cancellation of
    planned product development work, introductions, or media
    support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our
    business.

Similarly, if our and our partners’ media efforts fail to
    garner sufficient consumer interest and acceptance, our revenues
    and the financial return from such efforts will be harmed. In
    2009 we entered into a joint venture with Discovery
    Communications, Inc. (“Discovery”). Through that joint
    venture, we launched a children’s and family entertainment
    channel called THE HUB in October of 2010. In connection with
    this joint venture effort, we also developed a wholly-owned
    studio, called Hasbro Studios, which is responsible for
    developing and producing television entertainment media,
    primarily based on our brands. The television programming
    developed by Hasbro Studios is offered in the United States on
    THE HUB and will be distributed on other networks
    internationally. THE HUB is competing with a number of other
    children’s television networks in the United States for
    viewers, advertising revenue and distribution fees. There is no
    guarantee that THE HUB will be successful. Similarly, Hasbro
    Studios’ programming distributed internationally competes
    with programming by other parties. Lack of consumer interest in
    and acceptance of THE HUB, programming appearing on THE HUB,
    other programming developed by Hasbro Studios, and products
    related to that programming could



significantly harm our business. Similarly, our business could
    be harmed by greater than expected costs, or unexpected delays
    or difficulties, associated with the development of Hasbro
    Studios programming. During 2010 the Company incurred $52,047
    for programming developed by Hasbro Studios and anticipates that
    it will continue spending at increased levels in 2011 and future
    years.

At December 26, 2010, $354,612, or 8.7%, of our total
    assets represented our investment in THE HUB. If THE HUB does
    not achieve success, or there are subsequent declines in the
    success or profitability of the channel, then our investment may
    become impaired, which could result in a write-down through net
    earnings.

Economic
    downturns which negatively impact the retail and credit markets,
    or which otherwise damage the financial health of our retail
    customers and consumers, can harm our business and financial
    performance.

The success of our family entertainment products and our
    financial performance is dependent on consumer purchases of our
    products. Consumers may not purchase our products because the
    products do not capture consumer interest and imagination, or
    because competitor family entertainment offerings are deemed
    more attractive. But consumer spending on our products can also
    be harmed by factors that negatively impact consumers’
    budgets generally, and which are not due to our product
    offerings.

Recessions and other economic downturns, or disruptions in
    credit markets, in the markets in which we operate can result in
    lower levels of economic activity, lower employment levels, less
    consumer disposable income, and lower consumer confidence.
    Similarly, reductions in the value of key assets held by
    consumers, such as their homes or stock market investments, can
    lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power. Any of
    these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the
    purchase of our products. This in turn can reduce our revenues
    and harm our financial performance and profitability.

In addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our
    products during times of economic difficulty, in an effort to
    maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price
    of our products, increase our promotional spending, or take
    other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our
    products. Those steps may lower our net revenues, decrease our
    operating margins, increase our costs

and/or

lower
    our profitability.

Other
    economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we
    operate, including rising commodity and fuel prices, higher
    labor costs, increased transportation costs, outbreaks of public
    health pandemics or other diseases, or third party conduct could
    negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products,
    and lower our revenues, margins and profitability.

Various economic and public health conditions can impact our
    ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely and
    cost-effective manner, or can otherwise have a significant
    negative impact on our business.

Significant increases in the costs of other products which are
    required by consumers, such as gasoline, home heating fuels, or
    groceries, may reduce household spending on the discretionary
    entertainment products we offer. As we discussed above, weakened
    economic conditions, lowered employment levels or recessions in
    any of our major markets may significantly reduce consumer
    purchases of our products. Economic conditions may also be
    negatively impacted by terrorist attacks, wars and other
    conflicts, increases in critical commodity prices, or the
    prospect of such events. Such a weakened economic and business
    climate, as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a
    climate, could harm our revenues and profitability.

Our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand
    for our products, but also on our ability to produce and sell
    those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit.
    Rising fuel and raw material prices, for paperboard and other
    components such as resin used in plastics or electronic
    components, increased transportation costs, and increased labor
    costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all
    may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our
    products, which in turn may reduce our margins, reduce our
    profitability and harm our business.

Other conditions, such as the unavailability of sufficient
    quantities of electrical components, may impede our ability to
    manufacture, source and ship new and continuing products on a
    timely basis. Additional factors



outside of our control could further delay our products or
    increase the cost we pay to produce such products. For example,
    work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes, an outbreak of a severe
    public health pandemic, or the occurrence or threat of wars or
    other conflicts, all could impact our ability to manufacture or
    deliver product. Any of these factors could result in product
    delays, increased costs

and/or

lost
    sales for our products.

We may
    not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed
    material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from
    the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum
    guaranteed royalties.

In addition to designing and developing products based on our
    own brands, we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and
    interests by producing products based on popular entertainment
    properties developed by other parties and licensed to us. The
    success of entertainment properties for which we have a license,
    such as MARVEL or STAR WARS related products, can significantly
    affect our revenues and profitability. If we produce a line of
    products based on a movie or television series, the success of
    the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of
    consumer interest in the associated products we are offering. In
    addition, competition in our industry for access to
    entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure,
    maintain, and renew popular licenses to entertainment products
    on beneficial terms, if at all, and to attract and retain the
    talented employees necessary to design, develop and market
    successful products based on these properties. The loss of
    rights granted pursuant to any of our licensing agreements could
    harm our business and competitive position.

The license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually
    require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be
    substantial, and in some cases may be greater than what we are
    ultimately able to recoup from actual sales, which could result
    in write-offs of significant amounts which in turn would harm
    our results of operations. At December 26, 2010, we had
    $112,922 of prepaid royalties, $17,922 of which are included in
    prepaid expenses and other current assets and $95,000 of which
    are included in other assets. Under the terms of existing
    contracts as of December 26, 2010, we may be required to
    pay future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees
    totaling approximately $287,000. Acquiring or renewing licenses
    may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we
    consider to be too high to be profitable, which may result in
    losing licenses we currently hold when they become available for
    renewal, or missing business opportunities for new licenses.
    Additionally, as a licensee of entertainment based properties we
    have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will
    translate into successful toy or game products.

We anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie
    releases may make it increasingly difficult for us to profitably
    sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may
    lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in
    order to minimize their inventory risk. Furthermore, there can
    be no assurance that a successful brand will continue to be
    successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future, as
    new entertainment properties and competitive products are
    continually being introduced to the market. In the event that we
    are not able to acquire or maintain successful entertainment
    licenses on advantageous terms, our revenues and profits may be
    harmed.

Our
    business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results
    will depend, in large part, on our sales during the relatively
    brief holiday shopping season. This seasonality is exacerbated
    by retailers’ quick response inventory management
    techniques.

Sales of our family entertainment products at retail are
    extremely seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring
    during the period from September through December in
    anticipation of the holiday season, including Christmas. This
    seasonality has increased over time, as retailers become more
    efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick
    response inventory management techniques. Customers are timing
    their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers, such as
    us, closer to the time of purchase by consumers. For toys, games
    and other family entertainment products which we produce, a
    majority of retail sales for the entire year generally occur in
    the fourth quarter, close to the holiday season. As a
    consequence, the majority of our sales to our customers occur in
    the period from September through December, as our customers do
    not want to maintain large on-hand inventories throughout the
    year ahead of consumer demand. While these techniques



reduce a retailer’s investment in inventory, they increase
    pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and
    thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and
    carrying costs to the supplier.

The limited inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or
    delay retail sales, resulting in lower revenues for us. If we or
    our customers determine that one of our products is more popular
    at retail than was originally anticipated, we may not have
    sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional product to
    fully capture consumer interest in the product. Additionally,
    the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter
    time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve
    tight and compressed shipping schedules, which also may reduce
    our sales and harm our financial performance. This seasonal
    pattern requires significant use of working capital, mainly to
    manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year
    prior to the holiday season, and requires accurate forecasting
    of demand for products during the holiday season in order to
    avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing
    excess inventory of products that are less popular with
    consumers. Our failure to accurately predict and respond to
    consumer demand, resulting in our underproducing popular items

and/or

overproducing less popular items, would reduce our total sales
    and harm our results of operations. In addition, as a result of
    the seasonal nature of our business, we would be significantly
    and adversely affected, in a manner disproportionate to the
    impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the
    year, by unforeseen events, such as a terrorist attack or
    economic shock, that harm the retail environment or consumer
    buying patterns during our key selling season, or by events,
    such as strikes or port delays, that interfere with the shipment
    of goods, particularly from the Far East, during the critical
    months leading up to the holiday purchasing season.

Our
    substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the
    United States subject us to risks associated with international
    operations. Among these risks is the fact that fluctuations in
    foreign exchange rates can significantly impact our financial
    performance.

We operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries
    outside the United States. For the year ended December 26,
    2010, our net revenues from international customers comprised
    approximately 46% of our total consolidated net revenues. We
    expect our sales to international customers to continue to
    account for a significant portion of our revenues. In fact, over
    time, we expect our international sales and operations to grow
    both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overall
    business as one of our key business strategies is to increase
    our presence in emerging and underserved markets. Additionally,
    as we discuss below, we utilize third-party manufacturers
    located principally in the Far East, to produce the majority of
    our products, and we have a manufacturing facility in Ireland.
    These sales and manufacturing operations, including operations
    in emerging markets that we have entered, may enter, or may
    increase our presence in, are subject to the risks associated
    with international operations, including:

•

Currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations;

•

Limitations, including taxes, on the repatriation of earnings;

•

Potential challenges to our transfer pricing determinations and
    other aspects of our cross border transactions;

•

Political instability, civil unrest and economic instability;

•

Greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and
    weaker laws protecting such rights;

•

Complications in complying with different laws in varying
    jurisdictions and changes in governmental policies;

•

Natural disasters and the greater difficulty and expense in
    recovering therefrom;

•

Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country
    to another, including port congestion, strikes and other
    transportation delays and interruptions;

•

Changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing
    business internationally; and

•

The imposition of tariffs, quotas, or other protectionist
    measures.



Because of the importance of our international sales and
    international sourcing of manufacturing to our business, our
    financial condition and results of operations could be
    significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to
    occur.

If the exchange rate between the United States dollar and a
    local currency for an international market in which we have
    significant sales or operations changes, our financial results,
    reported in U.S. dollars, may be meaningfully impacted even
    if our business in the local currency is not significantly
    affected. As an example, if the dollar appreciates 10% relative
    to a local currency for an international market in which we had
    $200 million of net sales, the dollar value of those sales,
    as they are translated into U.S. dollars, would decrease by
    $20 million in our consolidated financial results. As such,
    we would recognize a $20 million decrease in our net
    revenues, even if the actual level of sales in the foreign
    market had not changed. Similarly, our expenses in foreign
    markets can be significantly impacted, in U.S. dollar
    terms, by exchange rates, meaning the profitability of our
    business in U.S. dollar terms can be significantly harmed
    by exchange rate movements.

The
    concentration of our retail customer base means that economic
    difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional
    policies of our major customers could have a significant impact
    on us.

We depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell
    the majority of our products. For the fiscal year ended
    December 26, 2010, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Target
    Corporation, and Toys “R” Us, Inc., accounted for
    approximately 23%, 12% and 11%, respectively, of our
    consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers,
    including Wal-Mart, Target and Toys “R” Us, in the
    aggregate accounted for approximately 50% of our consolidated
    net revenues. In the U.S. and Canada segment, approximately
    71% of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top
    three customers. While the consolidation of our customer base
    may provide certain benefits to us, such as potentially more
    efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of
    sales and distribution, this consolidation also means that if
    one or more of our major customers were to experience
    difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us, cease doing
    business with us, significantly reduce the amount of their
    purchases from us, alter the manner in which they promote our
    products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling
    our products, or return substantial amounts of our products, it
    could significantly harm our sales, profitability and financial
    condition. Increased concentration among our customers could
    also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales
    prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins
    than would otherwise be obtained if there were less
    consolidation among our customers. In addition, the bankruptcy
    or other lack of success of one or more of our significant
    retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and result
    in higher bad debt expense.

Our
    use of third-party manufacturers to produce the majority of our
    toy products, as well as certain other products, presents risks
    to our business.

We own and operate two game and puzzle manufacturing facilities,
    one in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts and the other in
    Waterford, Ireland. However, most of our toy products, in
    addition to certain other products, are manufactured by
    third-party manufacturers, most of whom are located in China.
    Although our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted,
    over a period of time, to alternative sources of supply, should
    such changes be necessary, if we were prevented or delayed in
    obtaining products or components for a material portion of our
    product line due to political, labor or other factors beyond our
    control, including natural disasters or pandemics, our
    operations would be disrupted, potentially for a significant
    period of time, while alternative sources of supply were
    secured. This delay could significantly reduce our revenues and
    profitability, and harm our business.

Given that the majority of our manufacturing is conducted by
    third-party manufacturers located in China, health conditions
    and other factors affecting social and economic activity in
    China and affecting the movement of people and products into and
    from China to our major markets, including North America and
    Europe, as well as increases in the costs of labor and other
    costs of doing business in China, could have a significant
    negative impact on our operations, revenues and earnings.
    Factors that could negatively affect our business include a
    potential significant revaluation of the Chinese Yuan, which may
    result in an increase in the cost of producing products in
    China, labor shortage and increases in labor costs in China, and
    difficulties in moving



products manufactured in China out of Asia and through the ports
    on the western coast of North America, whether due to port
    congestion, labor disputes, product regulations

and/or

inspections or other factors, and natural disasters or health
    pandemics impacting China. Also, the imposition of trade
    sanctions or other regulations by the United States or the
    European Union against products imported by us from, or the loss
    of “normal trade relations” status with, China, could
    significantly increase our cost of products imported into the
    United States or Europe and harm our business. Additionally, the
    suspension of the operations of a third party manufacturer by
    government inspectors in China could result in delays to us in
    obtaining product and may harm sales.

We require our third-party manufacturers to comply with our
    Global Business Ethics Principles, which are designed to prevent
    products manufactured by or for us from being produced under
    inhumane or exploitive conditions. The Global Business Ethics
    Principles address a number of issues, including working hours
    and compensation, health and safety, and abuse and
    discrimination. In addition, Hasbro requires that our products
    supplied by third-party manufacturers be produced in compliance
    with all applicable laws and regulations, including consumer and
    product safety laws in the markets where those products are
    sold. Hasbro has the right and exercises such right, both
    directly and through the use of outside monitors, to monitor
    compliance by our third-party manufacturers with our Global
    Business Ethics Principles and other manufacturing requirements.
    In addition, we do quality assurance testing on our products,
    including products manufactured for us by third parties.
    Notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and
    testing of compliance with them, there is always a risk that one
    or more of our third-party manufacturers will not comply with
    our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such
    non-compliance. Any failure of our third-party manufacturers to
    comply with labor, consumer, product safety or other applicable
    requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in
    damage to our reputation, harm sales of our products and
    potentially create liability for us.

Our
    success is critically dependent on the efforts and dedication of
    our employees.

Our employees are at the heart of all of our efforts. It is
    their skill, innovation and hard work which drive our success.
    We compete with many other potential employers in hiring and
    retaining our employees. Although we continuously seek to
    develop our employees, challenge them and compensate them
    fairly, there is no guarantee that we will be able to hire or
    retain the employees we need to succeed. Our loss of key
    employees, or our inability to hire talented employees we need,
    could significantly harm our business.

Part
    of our strategy for remaining relevant to children is to offer
    innovative children’s toy and game electronic products. The
    margins on many of these products are lower than more
    traditional toys and games and such products may have a shorter
    lifespan than more traditional toys and games. As a result,
    sales of children’s toy and game electronic products may
    lower our overall operating margins and produce more volatility
    in our business.

As children have grown “older younger” and have
    otherwise become interested in more and more sophisticated and
    adult products, such as videogames, consumer electronics and
    social media, at younger and younger ages, we have sought to
    keep our products relevant for these consumers. One initiative
    we have pursued to capture the interest of children is to offer
    innovative children’s electronic toys and games. Examples
    of such products in the last few years include our I-branded
    products such as I-DOG and I-CAT, and our FURREAL FRIENDS line
    of products, including BUTTERSCOTCH PONY and BISCUIT MY
    LOVIN’ PUP. In 2011 we are offering games based on our
    innovative LIVE platform and our most realistic member of the
    FURREAL FRIENDS line to date, COOKIE, MY PLAYFUL PUP. These
    products, if successful, can be an effective way for us to
    connect with consumers and increase sales. However,
    children’s electronics, in addition to the risks associated
    with our other family entertainment products, also face certain
    additional risks.

Our costs for designing, developing and producing electronic
    products tend to be higher than for many of our other more
    traditional products, such as board games and action figures.
    The ability to recoup these higher costs through sufficient
    sales quantities and to reflect higher costs in higher prices is
    constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and
    entertainment products, and can be further constrained by
    difficult economic conditions. As a consequence, our margins on
    the sales of electronic products tend to be lower than for more
    traditional products and we can face increased risk of not
    achieving sales sufficient to recover our



costs. In addition, the pace of change in product offerings and
    consumer tastes in the electronics area is potentially even
    greater than for our other products. This pace of change means
    that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain
    consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and
    games.

We
    rely on external financing, including our credit facility, to
    help fund our operations. If we were unable to obtain or service
    such financing, or if the restrictions imposed by such financing
    were too burdensome, our business would be harmed.

Due to the seasonal nature of our business, in order to meet our
    working capital needs, particularly those in the third and
    fourth quarters, we rely on our revolving credit facility and
    our other credit facilities for working capital. We currently
    have a revolving credit agreement that expires in 2014, which
    provides for a $500,000 committed revolving credit facility. The
    credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting
    forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other
    limitations typical of an investment grade facility. These
    restrictive covenants may limit our future actions, and
    financial, operating and strategic flexibility. In addition, our
    financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our
    credit facility. Our performance and financial condition may not
    meet our original expectations, causing us to fail to meet such
    financial covenants. Non-compliance with our debt covenants
    could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our
    revolving credit facility and other bank lines, a circumstance
    which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would
    most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue
    to fund our operations.

In early 2011 we established a commercial paper program which,
    subject to market conditions, will allow us to issue up to
    $500,000 in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding
    from time to time as a further source of working capital funding
    and liquidity. We did not renew our accounts receivable
    securitization facility in January 2011 as we believe issuing
    commercial paper can be a more cost effective way for us to
    raise short-term funding in the future. However, there is no
    guarantee that we will be able to issue commercial paper on
    favorable terms, or at all, at any given point in time.

We believe that our cash flow from operations, together with our
    cash on hand and access to existing credit facilities or our
    commercial paper program, are adequate for current and planned
    needs in 2011. However, our actual experience may differ from
    these expectations. Factors that may lead to a difference
    include, but are not limited to, the matters discussed herein,
    as well as future events that might have the effect of reducing
    our available cash balance, such as unexpected material
    operating losses or increased capital or other expenditures, or
    other future events that may reduce or eliminate the
    availability of external financial resources.

Not only may our individual financial performance impact our
    ability to access sources of external financing, but significant
    disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our
    ability to obtain financing. Although we believe the risk of
    nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial facilities
    is not significant, in times of severe economic downturn

and/or

distress in the credit markets, it is possible that one or more
    sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to
    provide funding to us. In such a situation, it may be that we
    would be unable to access funding under our existing credit
    facilities, and it might not be possible to find alternative
    sources of funding.

We also may choose to finance our capital needs, from time to
    time, through the issuance of debt securities. Our ability to
    issue such securities on satisfactory terms, if at all, will
    depend on the state of our business and financial condition, any
    ratings issued by major credit rating agencies, market interest
    rates, and the overall condition of the financial and credit
    markets at the time of the offering. The condition of the credit
    markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated
    significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the
    future. Variations in these factors could make it difficult for
    us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher
    interest rates in order to sell new debt securities. The failure
    to receive financing on desirable terms, or at all, could damage
    our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or
    engage in other business activities.

As of December 26, 2010, we had $1,384,895 of total
    principal amount of indebtedness outstanding. If we are unable
    to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our
    outstanding debt we would need to



refinance such debt or face default. There is no guarantee that
    we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms, or at all.

As a
    manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational
    corporation, we are subject to various government regulations
    and may be subject to additional regulations in the future,
    violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise
    harm our business. In addition, we could be the subject of
    future product liability suits or product recalls, which could
    harm our business.

As a manufacturer of consumer products, we are subject to
    significant government regulations, including, in the United
    States, under The Consumer Products Safety Act, The Federal
    Hazardous Substances Act, and The Flammable Fabrics Act, as well
    as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our
    international markets. In addition, certain of our products are
    subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration or
    similar international authorities. While we take all the steps
    we believe are necessary to comply with these acts, there can be
    no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future.
    Failure to comply could result in sanctions which could have a
    negative impact on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations. We may also be subject to involuntary product
    recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall. While costs
    associated with product recalls have generally not been material
    to our business, the costs associated with future product
    recalls individually and in the aggregate in any given fiscal
    year, could be significant. In addition, any product recall,
    regardless of direct costs of the recall, may harm consumer
    perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our
    future revenues and results of operations.

Governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we
    manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations
    relating to product safety and consumer protection in the
    future, and may also increase the penalties for failure to
    comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations.
    In addition, one or more of our customers might require changes
    in our products, such as the non-use of certain materials, in
    the future. Complying with any such additional regulations or
    requirements could impose increased costs on our business.
    Similarly, increased penalties for non-compliance could subject
    us to greater expense in the event any of our products were
    found to not comply with such regulations. Such increased costs
    or penalties could harm our business.

In addition to government regulation, products that have been or
    may be developed by us may expose us to potential liability from
    personal injury or property damage claims by the users of such
    products. There can be no assurance that a claim will not be
    brought against us in the future. Any successful claim could
    significantly harm our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

As a large, multinational corporation, we are subject to a host
    of governmental regulations throughout the world, including
    antitrust, customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott
    regulations, environmental regulations and the Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act. Complying with these regulations imposes costs on
    us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to
    successfully comply with any such legal requirements could
    subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that
    could further harm our business and financial condition.

Our
    business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may
    not be able to protect such rights successfully. In addition, we
    have a material amount of acquired product rights which, if
    impaired, would result in a reduction of our net
    earnings.

Our intellectual property, including our license agreements and
    other agreements that establish our ownership rights and
    maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property, are
    of great value. We rely on a combination of trade secret,
    copyright, trademark, patent and other proprietary rights laws
    to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related
    to our brands. From time to time, third parties have challenged,
    and may in the future try to challenge, our ownership of our
    intellectual property. In addition, our business is subject to
    the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or
    infringing on our intellectual property rights. We may need to
    resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property
    rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of
    resources. Our failure to protect our intellectual property
    rights could harm our business and competitive position. Much of
    our intellectual property has been internally developed and has
    no carrying value on our balance sheet. However, as of
    December 26, 2010, we had $500,597 of acquired product and



licensing rights included in other assets on our balance sheet.
    Declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed
    products may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of
    the related assets and could result in an impairment charge.
    Reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could
    harm our financial results.

We may
    not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or
    investments in joint ventures, or those benefits may be delayed
    or reduced in their realization.

Acquisitions have been a significant part of our historical
    growth and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify our
    product offerings. In making acquisitions, we target companies
    that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products
    or the ability for us to leverage our entertainment offerings.
    In the case of our joint venture with Discovery, we looked to
    partner with a company that has shown the ability to establish
    and operate compelling entertainment channels. However, we
    cannot be certain that the products of companies we may acquire,
    or acquire an interest in, in the future will achieve or
    maintain popularity with consumers or that any such acquired
    companies or investments will allow us to more effectively
    market our products. In some cases, we expect that the
    integration of the companies that we acquire into our operations
    will create production, marketing and other operating synergies
    which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and,
    where applicable, cost savings, operating efficiencies and other
    advantages. However, we cannot be certain that these synergies,
    efficiencies and cost savings will be realized. Even if
    achieved, these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their
    realization. In other cases, we acquire companies that we
    believe have strong and creative management, in which case we
    plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully
    integrating them into our operations. We cannot be certain that
    the key talented individuals at these companies will continue to
    work for us after the acquisition or that they will develop
    popular and profitable products or services in the future.

From
    time to time, we are involved in litigation, arbitration or
    regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which
    could entail significant expense.

As is the case with many large multinational corporations, we
    are subject, from time to time, to regulatory investigations,
    litigation and arbitration disputes. Because the outcome of
    litigation, arbitration and regulatory investigations is
    inherently difficult to predict, it is possible that the outcome
    of any of these matters could entail significant expense for us
    and harm our business. The fact that we operate in significant
    numbers of international markets also increases the risk that we
    may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply
    with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements.

We
    have a material amount of goodwill which, if it becomes
    impaired, would result in a reduction in our net
    earnings.

Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition
    exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire. Goodwill is
    not amortized and is required to be periodically evaluated for
    impairment. At December 26, 2010, $474,813, or 11.6%, of
    our total assets represented goodwill. Declines in our
    profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units,
    which could result in a write-down of our goodwill. Reductions
    in our net earnings caused by the write-down of goodwill or our
    investment in the joint venture could harm our results of
    operations.

    functions. The Company also owns an adjacent building consisting
    of approximately 23,000 square feet that is used in the
    corporate function. In addition, the Company leases a



building in East Providence, Rhode Island consisting of
    approximately 120,000 square feet that is used in the
    corporate function as well as by the Global Operations and
    Entertainment and Licensing segments. In addition to the above
    facilities, the Company also leases office space consisting of
    approximately 95,400 square feet in Renton, Washington as
    well as warehouse space aggregating approximately
    1,939,000 square feet in Georgia, California, Texas and
    Quebec that are also used by the U.S. and Canada segment.
    The Company also leases properties that total approximately
    41,500 square feet in Dedham, Massachusetts and Burbank,
    California that are used by the Entertainment and Licensing
    segment.

The Company owns manufacturing plants in East Longmeadow,
    Massachusetts and Waterford, Ireland. The East Longmeadow plant
    consists of approximately 1,148,000 square feet and is used
    by the U.S. and Canada and Global Operations segments. The
    Waterford plant consists of approximately 244,000 square
    feet and is used by our Global Operations segment. The Global
    Operations segment also leases an aggregate of
    87,900 square feet of office and warehouse space in Hong

    good condition and well maintained.

The Company believes that its facilities are adequate for its
    needs. The Company believes that, should it not be able to renew
    any of the leases related to its leased facilities, it could
    secure similar substitute properties without a material adverse
    impact on its operations.

Legal
    Proceedings

The Company has outstanding tax assessments from the Mexican tax
    authorities relating to the years 2000 through 2005. These tax
    assessments, which total approximately $179 million in
    aggregate (including interest, penalties, and inflation
    updates), are based on transfer pricing issues between the
    Company’s subsidiaries with respect to the Company’s
    operations in Mexico. The Company has filed suit in the Federal
    Tribunal of Fiscal and Administrative Justice in Mexico
    challenging the 2000 through 2003 assessments. The Company filed
    the suit related to the 2000 and 2001 assessments in May 2009;
    the 2002 assessment in June 2008; and the 2003 assessment in
    March 2009. The Company is challenging the 2004 assessment
    through administrative appeals and anticipates that it will
    challenge the 2005 assessment in a similar manner. The Company
    expects to be successful in sustaining its positions for all of
    these years. However, in order to challenge the outstanding tax
    assessments related to 2000 through 2003, as is usual and
    customary in Mexico in these matters, the Company was required
    to either make a deposit or post a bond in the full amount of
    the assessments. The Company elected to post bonds and
    accordingly, as of December 26, 2010, bonds totaling
    approximately $115 million (at year-end 2010 exchange
    rates) have been posted related to the 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003
    assessments. These bonds guarantee the full amounts of the
    related outstanding tax assessments in the event the Company is

Executive
    Summary

The Company earns revenue and generates cash primarily through
    the sale of a variety of toy and game products, as well as
    through the out-licensing of rights for use of its properties in
    connection with non-competing products, including digital games,
    offered by third parties. The Company sells its products both
    within the United States and in a number of international
    markets. The Company’s business is highly seasonal with a
    significant amount of revenues occurring in the second half of
    the year. In 2010 and 2009, the second half of the year
    accounted for 65% of the Company’s net revenues and, in
    2008, the second half of the year accounted for 63% of the
    Company’s net revenues. While many of the Company’s
    products are based on brands and technology the Company owns or
    controls, the Company also offers products which are licensed
    from outside inventors. In addition, the Company licenses rights
    to produce products based on movie, television, music and other
    entertainment properties owned by third parties, such as the
    MARVEL, STAR WARS and SESAME STREET properties.

The Company’s business is separated into three principal
    business segments, U.S. and Canada, International and
    Entertainment and Licensing. The U.S. and Canada segment
    develops, markets and sells both toy and game products in the
    U.S. and Canada. The International segment consists of the
    Company’s European, Asia Pacific and Latin and South
    American marketing and sales operations. The Company’s
    Entertainment and Licensing segment includes the Company’s
    lifestyle licensing, digital gaming, movie, television and
    online entertainment operations. In addition to these three
    primary segments, the Company’s world-wide manufacturing
    and product sourcing operations are managed through its Global
    Operations segment.

The Company seeks to make its brands relevant in all areas
    important to its consumers. Brand awareness is amplified through
    immersive traditional play, digital applications, publishing and
    lifestyle licensing and entertainment experiences, including
    television programming and motion pictures, presented for
    consumers’ enjoyment. The Company’s focus remains on
    growing core owned and controlled brands, developing new and
    innovative products which respond to market insights, offering
    immersive entertainment experiences which allow consumers to
    experience the Company’s brands across multiple forms and
    formats, and optimizing efficiencies within the Company’s
    operations to reduce costs, increase operating profits and
    maintain a strong balance sheet. The Company’s core brands
    represent Company-owned or Company-controlled brands, such as
    TRANSFORMERS, MY LITTLE PONY, LITTLEST PET SHOP, MONOPOLY,
    MAGIC: THE GATHERING, PLAYSKOOL, G.I. JOE and NERF, which have
    been successful over the long term. The Company has a large
    portfolio of owned and controlled brands, which can be
    introduced in new formats and platforms over time. These brands
    may also be further extended by pairing a licensed concept with
    a core brand. By focusing on core brands, the Company is working
    to maintain a more consistent revenue stream and basis for
    future growth, and to leverage profitability. During 2010 the
    Company had significant revenues from core brands, namely NERF,
    LITTLEST PET SHOP, TRANSFORMERS, FURREAL FRIENDS, PLAYSKOOL,
    PLAY-DOH, MONOPOLY and MAGIC: THE GATHERING. The Company’s
    strategy of re-imagining, re-inventing and re-igniting its
    brands has been instrumental in achieving its overall long-term
    growth objectives.

The Company also seeks to drive product-related revenues by
    increasing the visibility of its core brands through
    entertainment. As an example of this, in June of 2009, the

TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN

motion picture was
    released by Dreamworks, LLC and Paramount Pictures Corporation
    as a sequel to



the 2007 motion picture

TRANSFORMERS

. In addition, in
    August 2009, the motion picture

G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA

was released by Paramount Pictures Corporation. The Company
    developed and marketed product lines based on these motion
    pictures. In 2011, the Company expects the second TRANSFORMERS
    sequel,

TRANSFORMERS: DARK OF THE MOON

, to be released.
    As a result of pairing these core brands with motion picture
    entertainment, both the movies and the product lines benefited.
    In addition, the Company has entered into a strategic
    relationship with Universal Pictures to produce at least three
    motion pictures based on certain of Hasbro’s core brands,
    with the potential for production of two additional pictures.
    The first movie under this relationship is expected to be
    released in 2012. As part of its strategy, in addition to using
    theatrical entertainment, the Company continues to seek
    opportunities to use other entertainment outlets and forms of
    entertainment as a way to build awareness of its brands.

The Company is a partner in a joint venture with Discovery
    Communications, Inc. (“Discovery”) which runs THE HUB,
    a television network in the United States dedicated to
    high-quality children’s and family entertainment and
    educational programming. Programming on the network includes
    content based on Hasbro’s brands, Discovery’s library
    of children’s educational programming, as well as
    programming developed by third parties. THE HUB debuted in
    October of 2010 and was available in approximately
    60 million homes in the U.S. upon launch. In
    connection with its television initiative, the Company
    established Hasbro Studios, an internal wholly-owned production
    studio that is responsible for the creation and development of
    television programming based primarily on Hasbro’s brands.
    Hasbro Studios creates programming for distribution in the
    United States on THE HUB, and for distribution on other networks
    in international markets. The Company incurred a certain level
    of investment spending leading up to the debut of THE HUB in
    October 2010, as well as costs in 2010, and expected in the
    future, related to the production of television programming by
    Hasbro Studios. The Company believes that its television
    initiative of developing programming based on its brands for
    distribution in the United States and in international markets
    supports its strategy of growing its core brands well beyond
    traditional toys and games and providing entertainment
    experiences for consumers of all ages in any form or format.

While the Company believes it has built a more sustainable
    revenue base by developing and maintaining its core brands and
    avoiding reliance on licensed entertainment properties, it
    continues to opportunistically enter into or leverage existing
    strategic licenses which complement its brands and key
    strengths. The Company’s primary licenses include its
    agreements with Marvel Characters B.V. (“Marvel”), for
    characters in the Marvel universe, including IRON MAN and
    SPIDER-MAN; Lucas Licensing, Ltd. (“Lucas”), related
    to the STAR WARS brand; and Sesame Workshop, related to the
    SESAME STREET characters. The majority of product offerings
    under the Sesame Workshop license will commence in 2011. During
    2010 the Company had significant sales of products related to
    the movie release of

IRON MAN 2

in May 2010 as well as
    continued strong sales of STAR WARS products. During 2009 the
    Company had a high level of revenues from products related to
    television programming based on SPIDER-MAN and STAR WARS.

The Company’s long-term strategy also focuses on extending
    its brands further into the digital world. As part of this
    strategy, the Company is party to a multi-year strategic
    agreement with Electronic Arts, Inc. (“EA”). The
    agreement gives EA the worldwide rights, subject to existing
    limitations on the Company’s rights and certain other
    exclusions, to create digital games for all platforms, such as
    mobile phones, gaming consoles and personal computers, based on
    a broad spectrum of the Company’s intellectual properties,
    including MONOPOLY, SCRABBLE, YAHTZEE, NERF, TONKA, G.I. JOE and
    LITTLEST PET SHOP.

The Company is investing to grow its business in emerging
    markets. During the last two years, the Company expanded its
    operations in China, Brazil, Russia, Korea, Romania and the
    Czech Republic. In addition, the Company is seeking to grow its
    business in entertainment and digital gaming, and will continue
    to evaluate strategic alliances and acquisitions which may
    complement its current product offerings, allow it entry into an
    area which is adjacent to or complementary to the toy and game
    business, or allow it to further develop awareness of its brands
    and expand the ability of consumers to experience its brands in
    different forms of media.

While the Company remains committed to investing in the growth
    of its business, it also continues to be focused on reducing
    fixed costs through operating efficiencies and on profit
    improvement. Over the last 8 years



the Company has improved its full year operating margin from
    7.8% in 2002 to 14.7% in 2010. The Company reviews its
    operations on an ongoing basis and seeks to reduce the cost
    structure of its underlying business and promote efficiency.

The Company is committed to returning excess cash to its
    shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As part of
    this initiative, from 2005 to 2010, the Company’s Board of
    Directors (the “Board”) adopted five successive share
    repurchase authorizations with a cumulative authorized
    repurchase amount of $2,325,000. The fifth authorization was
    approved in April 2010 for $625,000. At December 26, 2010,
    the Company had $150,068 remaining under the April 2010
    authorization. In 2010, the Company invested $636,681 in the
    repurchase of 15,763 shares of common stock in the open
    market. For the years ended 2009 and 2008, the Company spent
    $90,994 and $357,589, respectively, to repurchase 3,172 and
    11,736 shares, respectively, in the open market. The
    increased level of share repurchases in 2010 compared to 2009
    partially reflects the Company’s repurchase of an
    equivalent number of shares that were issued in 2010 in
    connection with the call and related conversion of its
    convertible debt. The Company intends to, at its discretion,
    opportunistically repurchase shares in the future subject to
    market conditions, the Company’s other potential uses of
    cash and the Company’s levels of cash generation. In
    addition to the share repurchase program, the Company also seeks
    to return excess cash through the payment of quarterly
    dividends. In February 2011, the Company’s Board of
    Directors increased the Company’s quarterly dividend rate
    to $0.30 per share from $0.25 per share.

Results
    of Operations

Each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended
    December 26, 2010 were fifty-two week periods.

Net earnings for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2010
    were $397,752, or $2.74 per diluted share. This compares to net
    earnings for fiscal 2009 and 2008 of $374,930 and $306,766, or
    $2.48 and $2.00 per diluted share, respectively.

Net earnings for 2010 include a $0.15 per diluted share
    favorable impact resulting from the completion of a
    U.S. tax examination for the 2004 and 2005 tax years. Net
    earnings for 2010 and 2009 include dilution from



the Company’s television investments, including the
    investment in the joint venture with Discovery and its issuance
    of $425,000 of long-term debt, both of which closed in May 2009,
    as well as the

start-up

of
    the Company’s internal television studio, Hasbro Studios.

Consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 26,
    2010 were $4,002,161 compared to $4,067,947 in 2009 and
    $4,021,520 in 2008. Most of the Company’s net revenues and
    operating profits were derived from its three principal
    segments: the U.S. and Canada segment, the International
    segment and the Entertainment and Licensing segment, which are
    discussed in detail below. Consolidated net revenues in 2010
    were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation of
    approximately $17,700 as a result of the stronger
    U.S. dollar in 2010 as compared to 2009. Consolidated net
    revenues in 2009 were also negatively impacted by foreign
    currency translation of approximately $65,200 as a result of the
    stronger U.S. dollar in 2009 as compared to 2008.

The following table presents net revenues and operating profit
    data for the Company’s three principal segments for 2010,
    2009 and 2008.

U.S.

U.S. and Canada segment net revenues for the year ended
    December 26, 2010 decreased 6% to $2,299,547 from
    $2,447,943 in 2009. In 2010, net revenues were positively
    impacted by currency translation by approximately $10,300. The
    decrease in net revenues in 2010 was primarily due to decreased
    revenues in the boys’ toys category, primarily as a result
    of decreased sales of TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE products. The
    2009 sales of these lines benefited from the theatrical releases
    of

TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN

in June 2009 and

G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA

in August 2009. Boys’
    toys sales were also negatively impacted by decreased sales of
    STAR WARS products. These decreases were partially offset by
    increased sales of NERF products as well as increased sales of
    MARVEL products, which benefited from the theatrical release of

IRON MAN 2

in May 2010. Boys’ toys sales were also
    positively impacted by the reintroduction of BEYBLADE products
    in the second half of 2010. Net revenues in the games and
    puzzles category also decreased in 2010 due to decreased sales
    of traditional board games and puzzles in the U.S. late in
    the year. These decreases were partially offset by increased
    sales of MAGIC: THE GATHERING trading card games. Sales in the
    girls’ category were flat in 2010. Increased sales of
    FURREAL FRIENDS products and, to a lesser extent, BABY ALIVE
    products were offset by decreased sales of MY LITTLE PONY and
    LITTLEST PET SHOP products. Although revenues from LITTLEST PET
    SHOP products decreased in 2010, sales of these products
    remained a significant contributor to U.S. and Canada
    segment net revenues. Net revenues in the preschool category
    increased in 2010 as the result of stronger sales of PLAY-DOH,
    TONKA and PLAYSKOOL products.

U.S. and Canada operating profit decreased to $349,594 in
    2010 from $380,580 in 2009. Foreign currency translation did not
    have a material impact on U.S. and Canada operating profit
    in 2010. The decrease in U.S. and Canada operating profit
    was primarily driven by the decreased revenues in 2010 discussed
    above and, to a lesser extent, higher cost of sales as a
    percentage of those revenues due to a change in the mix of
    products sold. These decreases were partially offset by
    decreased royalty and amortization expense in 2010.



U.S. and Canada segment net revenues for the year ended
    December 27, 2009 increased 2% to $2,447,943 from
    $2,406,745 in 2008. The increase in net revenues in 2009 was
    primarily due to increased revenues in the boys’ toys
    category, primarily as a result of increased sales of
    TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE products due to the theatrical
    releases of

TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN

in June
    2009 and

G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA

in August 2009, as
    well as increased sales of NERF products. Increased sales in the
    boys’ toys category were partially offset by decreased
    sales of STAR WARS, MARVEL and INDIANA JONES products. The
    increase in U.S. and Canada segment net revenues for 2009
    was also due to increased revenues in the preschool category
    primarily resulting from higher sales of TONKA and PLAY-DOH
    products, partially offset by decreased sales of PLAYSKOOL
    products. Revenues from sales of PLAYSKOOL products declined
    primarily as a result of decreased sales of ROSE PETAL COTTAGE
    products which are no longer in the Company’s product line.
    Revenues from the girls’ toys category decreased primarily
    as a result of lower sales of BABY ALIVE and I-DOG products,
    partially offset by sales of STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE products which
    were reintroduced to the Company’s line in the second
    quarter of 2009. Net revenues in the games and puzzles category
    decreased slightly in 2009, primarily due to decreased sales of
    traditional board games, partially offset by increased revenues
    from sales of MAGIC: THE GATHERING trading card games. Net
    revenues in 2009 were also negatively impacted by decreased
    sales of TOOTH TUNES products, which have been discontinued from
    the Company’s product line.

U.S. and Canada operating profit increased to $380,580 in
    2009 from $283,152 in 2008. Operating profit in 2009 was
    positively impacted by approximately $3,100 due to the
    translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar.
    U.S. and Canada operating profit increased in 2009
    primarily as a result of the increased revenues discussed above
    and lower cost of sales as a percentage of those revenues due to
    lower obsolescence charges and a change in the mix of products
    sold, primarily due to increased sales of entertainment-based
    products in 2009 as compared to 2008. The increase in operating
    profit for 2009 also reflects decreased selling, distribution
    and administration expenses which primarily reflect lower
    shipping and distribution costs as well as decreased marketing
    and sales expenses. In addition, operating profit increased as a
    result of decreased advertising expense.

International

International segment net revenues for the year ended
    December 26, 2010 increased by 7% to $1,559,927 from
    $1,459,476 in 2009. In 2010, net revenues were negatively
    impacted by currency translation of approximately $27,600 as a
    result of a stronger U.S. dollar. Excluding the unfavorable
    impact of foreign exchange, International segment net revenues
    increased 9% in local currency in 2010. The increased net
    revenues in 2010 were driven by increased sales in all
    categories as well as growth in emerging markets, including
    Brazil, Russia and China. The increase in the boys’ toys
    category was primarily due to higher sales of NERF products as
    well as the reintroduction of BEYBLADE products in 2010.
    Increased sales of MARVEL and TONKA products also contributed to
    the increased sales in the boys’ toys category. These
    increases were partially offset by decreases in the TRANSFORMERS
    and G.I. JOE lines. The increase in net revenues in the
    girls’ toys category was primarily driven by increased
    sales of FURREAL FRIENDS products partially offset by lower
    sales of MY LITTLE PONY and LITTLEST PET SHOP products.
    Preschool category net revenues increased primarily as the
    result of stronger sales of PLAY-DOH and PLAYSKOOL products
    offset by decreased sales of IN THE NIGHT GARDEN products. Net
    revenues in the games and puzzles category increased slightly as
    a result of increased revenues from MAGIC: THE GATHERING trading
    card games.

International segment operating profit increased 29% to $209,704
    in 2010 from $162,159 in 2009. Operating profit for the
    International segment in 2010 was negatively impacted by
    approximately $11,500 due to the translation of foreign
    currencies to the U.S. dollar. The increase in operating
    profit was primarily driven by the increased revenues described
    above. In addition, operating profit was positively impacted by
    decreased royalty expense and amortization. These were offset by
    increased selling, distribution and administrative expenses.

International segment net revenues for the year ended
    December 27, 2009 decreased by 3% to $1,459,476 from
    $1,499,334 in 2008. In 2009, net revenues were negatively
    impacted by currency translation of approximately $64,500 as a
    result of a stronger U.S. dollar. Excluding the unfavorable
    impact of foreign



exchange, International segment net revenues increased 2% in
    local currency in 2009. The increase in local currency net
    revenues was driven by increased sales in the boys’ toys
    category, primarily as a result of increased sales of
    TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE products, as well as increased sales
    of NERF products which were partially offset by lower revenues
    from MARVEL, ACTION MAN, INDIANA JONES and STAR WARS products.
    Net revenues in the girls’ toys category decreased
    primarily as a result of decreased sales of MY LITTLE PONY and
    FURREAL FRIENDS products, partially offset by increased sales of
    LITTLEST PET SHOP products and sales of STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE
    products, which were reintroduced to the Company’s line in
    the second quarter of 2009. Net revenues in the preschool
    category decreased primarily as a result of decreased revenues
    from sales of IN THE NIGHT GARDEN and PLAYSKOOL products,
    partially offset by increased revenues from sales of PLAY-DOH
    products. Net revenues in the games and puzzles category
    decreased slightly as a result of decreased sales of board
    games. Net revenues in 2009 were also negatively impacted by
    decreased sales of TOOTH TUNES products, which have been
    discontinued in the Company’s product line.

International segment operating profit decreased 2% to $162,159
    in 2009 from $165,186 in 2008. Operating profit for the
    International segment in 2009 was positively impacted by
    approximately $9,500 due to the translation of foreign
    currencies to the U.S. dollar. The increased net revenues
    discussed above were more than offset by increased operating
    expenses, including the impact of our investments in opening
    offices in emerging international markets. In addition,
    International segment operating profit in 2008 was positively
    impacted by the recognition of a pension surplus in the United
    Kingdom of approximately $6,000.

Entertainment
    and Licensing

The Entertainment and Licensing segment’s net revenues for
    the year ended December 26, 2010 decreased 12% to $136,488
    from $155,013 for the year ended December 27, 2009. The
    decrease was primarily due to decreases in both lifestyle and
    digital gaming licensing revenues, primarily relating to lower
    licensing revenues from TRANSFORMERS and, to a lesser extent,
    G.I. JOE, products following the motion picture releases in 2009.

Entertainment and Licensing segment operating profit decreased
    34% to $43,234 in 2010 from $65,572 in 2009. Operating profit
    decreased as a result of the decreased revenues discussed above
    and program production amortization costs associated with our
    television shows. This was partially offset by lower selling,
    distribution and administrative expenses. Selling, distribution
    and administrative expenses in 2009 were negatively impacted by
    approximately $7,200 in transaction costs related to the
    Company’s investment in the joint venture with Discovery.

While the Discovery joint venture is a component of our
    television operations, the Company’s 50% share in the
    earnings from the joint venture are included in other (income)
    expense and therefore are not a component of operating profit of
    the segment.

The Entertainment and Licensing segment’s net revenues for
    the year ended December 27, 2009 increased 44% to $155,013
    from $107,929 for the year ended December 28, 2008. The
    increase was primarily due to higher lifestyle and digital
    gaming licensing revenues, primarily relating to TRANSFORMERS
    and G.I. JOE licensed products.

Entertainment and Licensing segment operating profit increased
    28% to $65,572 in 2009 from $51,035 in 2008. Operating profit
    increased as a result of the higher revenues discussed above,
    partially offset by increased selling, distribution and
    administrative expenses which included approximately $7,200 in
    transaction costs related to the Company’s investment in
    the joint venture with Discovery,

start-up

costs associated with the Company’s television studio, as
    well as increased intangible amortization and royalty expense.

The Company’s operating expenses, stated as percentages of
    net revenues, are illustrated below for the three fiscal years
    ended December 26, 2010:

Cost of sales primarily consists of purchased materials, labor,
    manufacturing overheads and other inventory-related costs such
    as obsolescence. In addition, 2010 cost of sales also includes
    amortization of television program production costs. Cost of
    sales increased to 42.8% for the year ended December 26,
    2010 from 41.2% in 2009. In 2010, cost of sales includes $22,069
    of television programming amortization. The remaining increase
    was partially due to a change in the mix of revenues. Increased
    cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues reflects a change
    in product mix primarily due to decreased sales of
    entertainment-based products in 2010 as compared to 2009. While
    cost of sales as a percentage of revenues of theatrical
    entertainment-based products are generally lower than many of
    the Company’s other products, sales from these products,
    including Company owned or controlled brands based on a movie
    release, also incur royalty expense. Such royalties reduce the
    benefit of these lower cost of sales. Cost of sales decreased to
    41.2% for the year ended December 27, 2009 from 42.1% in
    2008. The decrease was partially due to a change in the mix of
    revenues reflecting higher licensing revenues in 2009. In
    addition, the decrease reflects a change in product mix
    primarily due to increased sales of entertainment-based products
    in 2009 as compared to 2008. Cost of sales in 2009 were also
    positively impacted by lower obsolescence charges.

Royalty expense decreased to $248,570 or 6.2% of net revenues in
    2010 compared to $330,651 or 8.1% of net revenues in 2009 and
    $312,986 or 7.8% of net revenues in 2008. The decrease in 2010
    and the increase in 2009 primarily reflect the higher sales of
    entertainment-driven products in 2009, namely TRANSFORMERS and
    G.I. JOE products. The increase in royalty expense in 2009 was
    partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange.

Product development expense increased in 2010 to $201,358 or
    5.0% of net revenues compared to $181,195 or 4.5% of net
    revenues in 2009. This increase reflects costs associated with
    the development of products for introduction in 2011, including
    products related to the Company’s agreement with Sesame
    Workshop. Product development expense decreased in 2009 to
    $181,195 or 4.5% of net revenues from $191,424 or 4.8% of net
    revenues in 2008. The decrease in 2009 primarily reflected an
    effort to reduce the Company’s overall SKU count and make
    development spending more efficient as part of the
    Company’s ongoing cost control efforts.

Advertising expense increased to $420,651 or 10.5% of net
    revenues in 2010 compared to $412,580 or 10.1% of net revenues
    in 2009. This increase reflects the decrease in
    entertainment-driven products in 2010, which do not require the
    same level of advertising that the Company spends on
    non-entertainment based products. In addition, the increase in
    2010 reflects a lower revenue base due to the decline in
    U.S. sales late in the year as well as increased
    advertising rates in 2010. Advertising expense decreased to
    $412,580 or 10.1% of net revenues in 2009 compared to $454,612
    or 11.3% of net revenues in 2008. In years in which the Company
    has significant sales of products related to major motion
    picture releases, such as in 2009, advertising expense as a
    percentage of revenue is generally lower, as such products do
    not require the same level of advertising that the Company
    spends on non-entertainment based products. The decrease in
    advertising expense in 2009 also reflects lower advertisement
    placement costs as well as the impact of foreign exchange.

Amortization expense decreased to $50,405 or 1.3% of net
    revenues in 2010 compared to $85,029 or 2.1% of net revenues in
    2009. The decrease is the result of the property rights related
    to Wizards of the Coast becoming fully amortized in the fourth
    quarter of 2009. Amortization expense increased to $85,029 or
    2.1% of



net revenues in 2009 compared to $78,265 or 1.9% of net revenues
    in 2008. The increase was primarily a result of accelerated
    amortization related to a write-down of the carrying value of
    certain property rights as well as the purchase of the
    intellectual property rights related to TRIVIAL PURSUIT in the
    second quarter of 2008. Property rights of $80,800 were recorded
    as a result of the purchase of TRIVIAL PURSUIT and are being
    amortized over fifteen years.

Selling, distribution and administration expenses decreased in
    dollars but remained flat as a percentage of revenues in 2010.
    These expenses were $781,192 or 19.5% of revenues compared to
    $793,558 or 19.5% of revenues in 2009. The 2009 amount includes
    approximately $7,200 of transaction costs related to the
    Company’s purchase of a 50% interest in THE HUB television
    network. The remaining decrease relates to management incentive
    and other compensation expenses in 2010 partially offset by
    higher marketing and sales costs related to emerging markets and
    our television initiatives. Selling, distribution and
    administration expenses decreased to $793,558 or 19.5% of net
    revenues in 2009, compared to $797,209 or 19.8% of net revenues
    in 2008. Absent the impact of foreign exchange, selling,
    distribution and administration expenses increased in 2009.
    Included in selling, distribution and administration expenses in
    2009 were approximately $7,200 in transaction costs discussed
    above. The increase in selling, distribution and administration
    expense in 2009 also reflected higher incentive compensation
    expense as well as costs related to the start up of the
    Company’s television studio and continued investments in
    emerging markets. Selling, distribution and administration
    expense was also positively impacted by lower shipping and
    distribution costs in 2009. In addition, selling, distribution
    and administration expenses in 2008 were positively impacted by
    the recognition of a pension surplus in the United Kingdom of
    approximately $6,000.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense increased to $82,112 in 2010 from $61,603 in
    2009. The 2009 interest expense amount includes approximately
    $4,000 in costs related to a short-term borrowing facility
    commitment the Company entered into in April 2009 in connection
    with the Company’s anticipated investment in the joint
    venture with Discovery. Absent this charge, the increase was
    primarily due to higher outstanding borrowings and, to a lesser
    extent, higher average borrowing rates. The higher average
    borrowings reflect the issuance of $425,000 in principal amount
    of Notes in May 2009 and $500,000 in principal amount of Notes
    in March 2010, partially offset by the conversion and redemption
    of the 2.75% contingent convertible debentures during March and
    April of 2010. The proceeds from the issuance of the Notes in
    May 2009 were primarily used to purchase a 50% interest in THE
    HUB. The increase in average borrowing rates in 2010 is due to
    the issuance of Notes in March 2010, which bear interest at the
    rate of 6.35%, partially offset by the conversion and redemption
    of the contingent convertible debentures during March and April
    2010, which bore interest at 2.75%. Interest expense increased
    to $61,603 in 2009 from $47,143 in 2008. The increase in
    interest expense reflects both higher outstanding borrowings and
    a higher average borrowing rate as a result of the issuance of
    $425,000 of notes in May 2009. As noted above, interest expense
    in 2009 also includes approximately $4,000 in costs related to a
    short-term borrowing facility commitment the Company entered
    into in April 2009 in connection with the Company’s
    anticipated investment in the joint venture with Discovery. In
    addition, interest expense in 2010 and 2009 include amounts
    related to the Company’s tax sharing agreement with
    Discovery.

Interest
    Income

Interest income was $5,649 in 2010 compared to $2,858 in 2009.
    The increase primarily reflects higher invested cash balances in
    2010. Interest income was $2,858 in 2009 compared to $17,654 in
    2008. The decrease in interest income was primarily the result
    of lower returns on invested cash as well as lower average
    invested cash balances.

Other
    (Income) Expense, Net

Other (income) expense, net of $3,676 in 2010 compares to $156
    in 2009. Other (income) expense, net in 2010 and 2009 includes
    $9,323 and $(3,856), respectively, relating to the
    Company’s 50% share in the (earnings) loss of THE HUB. The
    2010 amount also includes a gain of $4,950 on the sale of a
    product line.



Other (income) expense, net of $156 in 2009 compared to $23,752
    in 2008. Other (income) expense, net in 2009 included income of
    $(3,856) representing the Company’s 50% share in the
    earnings of THE HUB. The remainder of the change in other
    (income) expense in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily reflected
    the impact of foreign exchange gains and losses.

Income
    Taxes

Income tax expense totaled 21.7% of pretax earnings in 2010
    compared with 29.2% in 2009 and 30.4% in 2008. Income tax
    expense for 2010 is net of a benefit of approximately $22,300
    from discrete tax events, primarily related to the settlement of
    various tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions, including
    the United States. Income tax expense for 2009 is net of a
    benefit of approximately $2,300 from discrete tax events,
    primarily related to the expiration of state statutes and
    settlement of various tax examinations in multiple
    jurisdictions. Income tax expense for 2008 is net of a benefit
    of approximately $10,200 related to discrete tax events,
    primarily comprised of a benefit from the repatriation of
    certain foreign earnings, as well as the settlement of various
    tax examinations in multiple jurisdictions. Absent these items
    and potential interest and penalties related to uncertain tax
    positions in 2010, 2009 and 2008, the effective tax rates would
    have been 25.4%, 29.0% and 32.8%, respectively. The decrease in
    the adjusted tax rate from 29.0% in 2009 compared to 25.4% in
    2010 is primarily due to a change in the mix of where the
    company earned its profits, due to lower earnings in the
    U.S. and increased earnings in international jurisdictions
    in which the tax rates are lower. The adjusted tax rate of 32.8%
    in 2008 primarily reflects the decision to provide for the
    repatriation of a portion of 2008 international earnings to the
    U.S.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The Company has historically generated a significant amount of
    cash from operations. In 2010, the Company funded its operations
    and liquidity needs primarily through cash flows from
    operations, and, when needed, using borrowings under its
    available lines of credit. In addition, in January 2011, the
    Company entered into an agreement with a group of banks to
    establish a commercial paper program. Under the program, at the
    Company’s request and subject to market conditions, the
    group of banks may either purchase or arrange for the sale by
    the Company of unsecured commercial paper notes from time to
    time up to an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any
    given time of $500,000. During 2011, the Company expects to
    continue to fund its working capital needs primarily through
    cash flows from operations and, when needed, by issuing
    commercial paper or borrowing under its new revolving credit
    agreement. In the event that the Company is not able to issue
    commercial paper, the Company intends to utilize its available
    lines of credit. The Company believes that the funds available
    to it, including cash expected to be generated from operations
    and funds available through its commercial paper program or its
    available lines of credit are adequate to meet its working
    capital needs for 2011, however, unexpected events or
    circumstances such as material operating losses or increased
    capital or other expenditures, or inability to otherwise access
    the commercial paper market, may reduce or eliminate the
    availability of external financial resources. In addition,
    significant disruptions to credit markets may also reduce or
    eliminate the availability of external financial resources.
    Although we believe the risk of nonperformance by the
    counterparties to our financial facilities is not significant,
    in times of severe economic downturn in the credit markets it is
    possible that one or more sources of external financing may be
    unable or unwilling to provide funding to us.

At December 26, 2010, cash and cash equivalents, net of
    short-term borrowings, were $713,228 compared to $621,932 and
    $622,804 at December 27, 2009 and December 28, 2008,
    respectively. Hasbro generated $367,981, $265,623 and $593,185
    of cash from its operating activities in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Cash from operations in 2010 and 2009 includes
    long-term royalty advance payments of $25,000 and $75,000,
    respectively. There were no long-term advance royalty payments
    made in 2008. Operating cash flows in 2009 were also negatively
    impacted by the Company’s decision to sell $250,000 of its
    accounts receivable under its securitization program at
    December 28, 2008. The securitization program was not
    utilized at December 26, 2010 or December 27, 2009.
    The Company did not renew its accounts receivable securitization
    facility when that facility came up for renewal in January 2011.



Accounts receivable decreased to $961,252 at December 26,
    2010 from $1,038,802 at December 27, 2009. The accounts
    receivable balance at December 26, 2010 includes a decrease
    of approximately $11,500 as a result of the translation of
    foreign currency balances due to the stronger U.S. dollar
    at December 26, 2010 compared to December 27, 2009.
    Absent the effect of foreign exchange, the decrease in accounts
    receivable reflects decreased sales in the fourth quarter of
    2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. There was no
    utilization of the Company’s securitization program at
    December 26, 2010 or December 27, 2009. Accounts
    receivable increased to $1,038,802 at December 27, 2009
    from $611,766 at December 28, 2008. The accounts receivable
    balance at December 27, 2009 includes an increase of
    approximately $33,200 as a result of a weaker U.S. dollar
    at December 27, 2009 as compared to December 28, 2008.
    Absent the effect of foreign exchange, the increase in accounts
    receivable primarily reflects the utilization of the
    Company’s securitization program at December 28, 2008
    of $250,000. The increase in accounts receivable also reflects
    higher sales, and the timing of those sales, in the fourth
    quarter of 2009 as compared to 2008. Fourth quarter days sales
    outstanding were 68 days in 2010 and 2009 and 45 days
    in 2008. Absent the impact of securitization, days sales
    outstanding would have been 63 days in 2008.

Inventories increased to $364,194 at December 26, 2010
    compared to $207,895 at December 27, 2009. The increased
    inventory balance at December 26, 2010 reflects the lower
    sales in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to 2009.
    Inventories decreased to $207,895 at December 27, 2009
    compared to $300,463 at December 28, 2008. The decrease
    primarily reflects higher inventory levels at December 28,
    2008 due to decreased sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 as
    well as increased sales in the fourth quarter of 2009.

Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased slightly to
    $167,807 at December 26, 2010 from $162,290 at
    December 27, 2009. Increases in income tax receivables,
    current deferred income taxes and the values of the
    Company’s forward currency contracts were partially offset
    by decreased prepaid royalties as the result of utilization of
    advance royalty payments. Generally, when the Company enters
    into a licensing agreement for entertainment-based properties,
    an advance royalty payment is required at the inception of the
    agreement. This payment is then recognized in the consolidated
    statement of operations as the related sales are made. Each
    reporting period, the Company reflects as current prepaid
    expense the amount of royalties it expects to reflect in the
    statement of operations in the upcoming twelve months. Prepaid
    expenses and other current assets decreased to $162,290 at
    December 27, 2009 from $171,387 at December 28, 2008.
    The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the value of the
    Company’s foreign currency contracts as a result of the
    stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by purchases of
    short-term investments of $18,000 in 2009, which are reflected
    as an investing activity in the accompanying consolidated
    statement of cash flows.

Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased to $704,233 at
    December 26, 2010 compared to $801,775 at December 27,
    2009. This decrease primarily related to lower accrued payroll
    and management incentives, lower accrued royalties as a result
    of the decrease in entertainment-driven products, and lower
    accounts payable balances due to the timing of payments in the
    current year. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to
    $801,775 at December 27, 2009 from $792,306 at
    December 28, 2008. The accounts payable and accrued
    expenses balance at December 27, 2009 includes an increase
    of approximately $17,700 as a result of a weaker
    U.S. dollar at December 27, 2009 as compared to
    December 28, 2008. Absent the impact of foreign exchange,
    accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased approximately
    $8,300. Decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses in
    2009 primarily relate to decreased accrued pension benefits, as
    well as lower accounts payable. These decreases were partially
    offset by higher accrued payroll and management incentives at
    December 27, 2009.

Cash flows from investing activities were a net utilization of
    $104,188, $497,509, and $271,920 in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The 2009 utilization includes the Company’s
    $300,000 payment to Discovery for its 50% interest in THE HUB, a
    payment of $45,000 to Lucas to extend the term of the license
    agreement related to the STAR WARS brand and approximately
    $26,500 used to acquire certain other intellectual properties.
    The 2008 utilization includes the Company’s purchase of the
    intellectual property rights related to the TRIVIAL PURSUIT
    brand for a total cost of $80,800 as well as $65,153 in cash,
    net of cash acquired, used to acquire Cranium in January 2008.
    There were no investments or acquisitions in 2010. During 2010,
    the Company expended approximately $113,000 on additions to its
    property, plant and equipment compared to $104,000 during 2009
    and $117,000 during 2008. Of these amounts, 57% in 2010, 58% in
    2009 and 56% in



2008 were for purchases of tools, dies and molds related to the
    Company’s products. In 2011, the Company expects capital
    expenditures to be in the range of $125,000 to $135,000. During
    the three years ended December 26, 2010, depreciation of
    plant and equipment was $95,925, $95,934 and $87,873,
    respectively.

The Company commits to inventory production, advertising and
    marketing expenditures prior to the peak third and fourth
    quarter retail selling season. Accounts receivable increase
    during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their
    purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday
    season. Due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling
    period, payments for these accounts receivable are generally not
    due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of
    the subsequent year. This timing difference between expenditures
    and cash collections on accounts receivable makes it necessary
    for the Company to borrow higher amounts during the latter part
    of the year. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company primarily
    utilized cash from operations, borrowings under its available
    lines of credit and its accounts receivable securitization
    program to fund its operations.

During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company was party to an accounts
    receivable securitization program whereby the Company sold, on
    an ongoing basis, substantially all of its U.S. trade
    accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote special purpose
    entity, Hasbro Receivables Funding, LLC (“HRF”). HRF
    was consolidated with the Company for financial reporting
    purposes. The securitization program then allowed HRF to sell,
    on a revolving basis, an undivided fractional ownership interest
    of up to $250,000 in the eligible receivables it held to certain
    bank conduits. The program provided the Company with a source of
    working capital. Based on the amount of eligible accounts
    receivable as of December 26, 2010, the Company had
    availability under this program to sell $250,000, of which no
    amounts were utilized. In January 2011, the Company terminated
    this facility.

On December 16, 2010, the Company entered into a revolving
    credit agreement (the “Agreement”) which provides it
    with a $500,000 committed borrowing facility through December of
    2014. The Agreement replaced the Company’s previous
    revolving credit agreement. The Agreement contains certain
    financial covenants setting forth leverage and coverage
    requirements, and certain other limitations typical of an
    investment grade facility, including with respect to liens,
    mergers and incurrence of indebtedness. The Company was in
    compliance with all covenants in the Agreement, as well as the
    covenants in the prior revolving credit agreement for that
    portion of 2010 that it was effective, as of and for the fiscal
    year ended December 26, 2010. The Company had no borrowings
    outstanding under its committed revolving credit facility at
    December 26, 2010. However, letters of credit outstanding
    under this facility as of December 26, 2010 were
    approximately $1,400. Amounts available and unused under the
    committed line at December 26, 2010 were approximately
    $498,600. The Company also has other uncommitted lines from
    various banks, of which approximately $77,700 was utilized at
    December 26, 2010. Of the amount utilized under the
    uncommitted lines, approximately $14,400 and $63,300 represent
    outstanding short-term borrowings and letters of credit,
    respectively.

In January 2011, the Company entered into an agreement with a
    group of banks to establish a commercial paper program (the
    “Program”). Under the Program, at the request of the
    Company and subject to market conditions, the banks may either
    purchase from the Company, or arrange for the sale by the
    Company, of unsecured commercial paper notes. Under the Program,
    the Company may issue notes from time to time up to an aggregate
    principal amount outstanding at any given time of $500,000. The
    maturities of the notes may vary but may not exceed
    397 days. The notes will be sold under customary terms in
    the commercial paper market and will be issued at a discount to
    par, or alternatively, will be sold at par and will bear varying
    interest rates based on a fixed or floating rate basis. The
    interest rates will vary based on market conditions and the
    ratings assigned to the notes by the credit rating agencies at
    the time of issuance.

Net cash utilized by financing activities was $170,595 in 2010.
    Of this amount, $639,563 reflects cash paid, including
    transaction costs, to repurchase the Company’s common
    stock. During 2010, the Company repurchased 15,763 shares
    at an average price of $40.37. At December 26, 2010,
    $150,068 remained under the April 2010 authorization. Dividends
    paid were $133,048 in 2010 compared to $111,458 in 2009
    reflecting the increase in the Company’s dividend rate in
    2010 to $0.25 per quarter from $0.20 per quarter. These
    utilizations



were partially offset by proceeds of $492,528 from the issuance
    of long-term notes in March 2010. In addition, cash received
    from the exercise of employee stock options in 2010 was $93,522.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $236,779 in 2009.
    Of this amount, $421,309 reflected net proceeds from the
    issuance of long-term notes in May 2009. In addition, cash
    received from the exercise of employee stock options in 2009 was
    $9,193. These sources of cash were partially offset by $88,112,
    which included transaction costs, used to repurchase shares of
    the Company’s common stock. During 2009, the Company
    repurchased 3,172 shares at an average price per share of
    $28.67. Dividends paid were $111,458 in 2009 compared to
    $107,065 in 2008.

Net cash utilized by financing activities was $457,391 in 2008.
    Of this amount, $360,244, which includes transaction costs, was
    used to repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock.
    During 2008, the Company repurchased 11,736 shares at an
    average price per share of $30.44. Dividends paid were $107,065
    in 2008. In addition, $135,092 was used to repay long-term debt.
    These uses of cash were partially offset by cash receipts of
    $120,895 from the exercise of employee stock options.

At December 27, 2009, the Company had outstanding $249,828
    in principal amount of senior convertible debentures due 2021.
    If the closing price of the Company’s common stock exceeded
    $23.76 for at least 20 trading days, within the 30 consecutive
    trading day period ending on the last trading day of the
    calendar quarter, or upon other specified events, the debentures
    were convertible at an initial conversion price of $21.60 in the
    next calendar quarter. At December 31, 2009, this
    conversion feature was met and the debentures were convertible
    during the first quarter of 2010. During the first quarter of
    2010, holders of these debentures converted $111,177, in
    principal amount, of these debentures which resulted in the
    issuance of 5,147 shares. In addition, if the closing price
    of the Company’s common stock exceeded $27.00 for at least
    20 trading days in any 30 day period, the Company had the
    right to call the debentures by giving notice to the holders of
    the debentures. During a prescribed notice period following such
    a call by the Company, the holders of the debentures had the
    right to convert their debentures in accordance with the
    conversion terms described above. As of March 28, 2010, the
    Company had the right to call the debentures. On March 29,
    2010, as part of the Company’s overall debt management
    strategy and in furtherance of its capital structure goals, the
    Company gave notice of its election to redeem in cash all of the
    outstanding debentures on April 29, 2010 at a redemption
    price of $1,011.31 per $1,000 principal amount, which was equal
    to the par value thereof plus accrued and unpaid cash interest
    through April 29, 2010. During the notice period, $138,467,
    in principal amount, of the debentures were converted by the
    holders, resulting in the issuance of 6,410 shares of
    common stock. The remaining debentures were redeemed at a total
    cost of $186, which included accrued interest through the
    redemption date.

The $350,000 notes due in 2017 bear interest at a rate of 6.30%,
    which may be adjusted upward in the event that the
    Company’s credit rating from Moody’s Investor
    Services, Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings
    Services or Fitch Ratings is reduced to Ba1, BB+, or BB+,
    respectively, or below. At December 26, 2010, the
    Company’s ratings from Moody’s Investor Services,
    Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and
    Fitch Ratings were Baa2, BBB and BBB+, respectively. The
    interest rate adjustment is dependent on the degree of decrease
    of the Company’s ratings and could range from 0.25% to a
    maximum of 2.00%. The Company may redeem the notes at its option
    at the greater of the principal amount of the notes or the
    present value of the remaining scheduled payments discounted
    using the effective interest rate on applicable
    U.S. Treasury bills at the time of repurchase.

The $425,000 notes due in 2014 bear interest at a rate of
    6.125%, which may be adjusted upward in the event that the
    Company’s credit rating from Moody’s Investor
    Services, Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings
    Services or Fitch Ratings is reduced to Ba1, BB+, or BB+,
    respectively, or below. At December 26, 2010, the
    Company’s ratings from Moody’s Investor Services,
    Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and
    Fitch Ratings were Baa2, BBB, and BBB+, respectively. The
    interest rate adjustment is dependent on the degree of decrease
    of the Company’s ratings and could range from 0.25% to a
    maximum of 2.00%. The Company may redeem the notes at its option
    at the greater of the principal amount of the notes or the
    present value of the remaining scheduled payments discounted
    using the effective interest rate on applicable
    U.S. Treasury bills at the time of repurchase.



Including the debentures and notes described above, the Company
    has remaining principal amounts of long-term debt at
    December 26, 2010 of approximately $1,384,895 due at
    varying times from 2014 through 2040. The Company also had
    letters of credit and other similar instruments of approximately
    $179,592 and purchase commitments of $340,007 outstanding at
    December 26, 2010. Letters of credit and similar
    instruments include $114,890 related to the defense of tax
    assessments in Mexico. These assessments relate to transfer
    pricing that the Company is defending and expects to be
    successful in sustaining its position. In addition, the Company
    is committed to guaranteed royalty and other contractual
    payments of approximately $39,513 in 2011.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates

The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. As such, management is required to
    make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it
    believes are reasonable based on information available. These
    estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets
    and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods
    presented. The significant accounting policies which management
    believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and
    evaluating the Company’s reported financial results include
    sales allowances, program production costs, recoverability of
    goodwill and intangible assets, recoverability of royalty
    advances and commitments, pension costs and obligations and
    income taxes.

Sales
    Allowances

Sales allowances for customer promotions, discounts and returns
    are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue
    is recognized. Revenue from product sales is recognized upon
    passing of title to the customer, generally at the time of
    shipment. Revenue from product sales, less related sales
    allowances, is added to license fees and royalty revenue and
    reflected as net revenues in the consolidated statements of
    operations. The Company routinely commits to promotional sales
    allowance programs with customers. These allowances primarily
    relate to fixed programs, which the customer earns based on
    purchases of Company products during the year. Discounts and
    allowances are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the
    time of sale. While many of the allowances are based on fixed
    amounts, certain of the allowances, such as the returns
    allowance, are based on market data, historical trends and
    information from customers and are therefore subject to
    estimation.

For its allowance programs that are not fixed, such as returns,
    the Company estimates these amounts using a combination of
    historical experience and current market conditions. These
    estimates are reviewed periodically against actual results and
    any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or
    decrease to net revenues. During 2010, there have been no
    material adjustments to the Company’s estimates made in
    prior years.

Program
    Production Costs

The Company incurs certain costs in connection with the
    production of television programs based primarily on the
    Company’s toy and game brands, including animated and
    live-action programs and game shows. These costs are capitalized
    as they are incurred and amortized using the
    individual-film-forecast method, whereby these costs are
    amortized in the proportion that the current year’s
    revenues bear to management’s estimate of total ultimate
    revenues as of the beginning of each fiscal year related to the
    program. These capitalized costs are reported at the lower of
    cost, less accumulated amortization, or fair value, and reviewed
    for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs
    that indicates that an impairment may exist. The fair value is
    determined using a discounted cash flow model which is primarily
    based on management’s future revenue and cost estimates.

The most significant estimates are those used in the
    determination of ultimate revenue in the
    individual-film-forecast method. Ultimate revenue estimates
    impact the timing of program production cost amortization in the
    consolidated statement of operations. Ultimate revenue includes
    revenue from all sources that are



estimated to be earned related to the television program and
    include toy, game and other merchandise licensing fees; first
    run program distribution fees; and other revenue sources, such
    as DVD distribution. Our ultimate revenue estimates for each
    television program are developed based on our estimates of
    expected future results. We review and revise these estimates at
    each reporting date to reflect the most current available
    information. If estimates for a television program are revised,
    the difference between the program production cost amortization
    determined using the revised estimate and any amounts previously
    expensed during that fiscal year, are included as an adjustment
    to program production cost amortization in the consolidated
    statement of operations in the quarter in which the estimates
    are revised. Prior period amounts are not adjusted for
    subsequent changes in estimates. Factors that can impact our
    revenue estimates include the success and popularity of our
    television programs in the U.S. which are distributed on
    THE HUB, our ability to achieve broad distribution and viewer
    acceptance in international markets, and success of our
    program-related toy, game and other merchandise.

For the year ended December 26, 2010 we have $35,415 of
    program production costs included in other assets in the
    consolidated balance sheet. Program production cost amortization
    of $22,069 is included in cost of sales in the consolidated
    statement of operations for the year ended December 26,
    2010. We currently expect that over 90% of capitalized program
    production costs will be amortized over a 4 year period
    including the year of the programs’ initial broadcast
    distribution. The Company estimates program production cost
    amortization in 2011 to be in the range of $35,000 to $45,000,
    which includes amortization related to amounts capitalized
    during 2010 as well as amortization of amounts expected to be
    incurred for programs to be completed and released in 2011.
    Future program production cost amortization is subject to change
    based on actual costs incurred and management’s then
    current estimates of ultimate revenues. During 2010 the Company
    did not incur any impairment charges related to its program
    production costs.

Recoverability
    of Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite
    lives are tested for impairment at least annually. If an event
    occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying
    value may not be recoverable, the Company will perform an
    interim test at that time. The impairment test begins by
    allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable
    reporting units. Goodwill is then tested using a two step
    process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the
    reporting unit using an income approach, which looks to the
    present value of expected future cash flows.

The first step is a screen for potential impairment while the
    second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an
    indication from the first step that one exists. Intangible
    assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by
    comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value
    which is also calculated using an income approach. The
    Company’s annual goodwill impairment test was performed in
    the fourth quarter of 2010 and the estimated fair value of the
    Company’s reporting units with allocated goodwill were
    substantially in excess of their carrying value. No reporting
    units were considered to be at risk of failing the first step of
    the impairment test. Accordingly, no impairment was indicated.
    The Company’s annual impairment tests related to intangible
    assets with indefinite lives were also performed in the fourth
    quarter of 2010 and no impairments were indicated. The
    estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments
    and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the
    respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those
    revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in
    anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a
    change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge.
    The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the
    selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different
    assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash
    flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment
    charge. At December 26, 2010, the Company has goodwill and
    intangible assets with indefinite lives of $550,551 recorded on
    the balance sheet.

Intangible assets, other than those with indefinite lives, are
    amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for
    indications of impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Recoverability of the value of these intangible
    assets is measured by a comparison of the assets’ carrying
    value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected
    to be generated by the asset. If such assets were considered to
    be impaired, the impairment would be measured by



the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its
    fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows. The
    estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments
    and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the
    respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those
    revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in
    anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a
    change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge.
    The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the
    selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different
    assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash
    flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment
    charge. Intangible assets covered under this policy were
    $424,859 at December 26, 2010. During 2010, the Company
    wrote down certain intangible assets by approximately $3,900 to
    reflect revised expectations of future cash flows for the
    related product lines.

Recoverability
    of Royalty Advances and Commitments

The Company’s ability to earn-out royalty advances and
    contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed
    royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum
    guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related
    cash flow projections to be derived from the related product. If
    sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular
    product do not support the recoverability of the remaining
    minimum guaranty or, if the Company decides to discontinue a
    product line with royalty advances or commitments, a charge to
    royalty expense to write-off the non-recoverable minimum
    guaranty is required. The preparation of revenue forecasts and
    related cash flows for these products requires judgments and
    estimates. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in
    the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to
    these products could result in a change to the assessment of
    recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties. At
    December 26, 2010, the Company had $112,922 of prepaid
    royalties, $17,922 of which are included in prepaid expenses and
    other current assets and $95,000 of which are included in other
    assets.

Pension
    Costs and Obligations

Pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current
    and future benefits using estimates for expected return on
    assets and applicable discount rates. At the end of 2007 the
    Company froze benefits under its two largest pension plans in
    the U.S., with no future benefits accruing to employees. The
    Company will continue to pay benefits under the plan consistent
    with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit
    freeze. The estimates for the Company’s U.S. plans are
    established at the Company’s measurement date. The Company
    uses its fiscal year-end date as its measurement date to measure
    the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the
    expense for the upcoming year.

The Company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted
    average rate based on historical market data for the investment
    classes of assets held by the plan, the allocation of plan
    assets among those investment classes, and the current economic
    environment. Based on this information, the Company’s
    estimate of expected return on U.S. plan assets used in the
    calculation of 2010 pension expense for the U.S. plans was
    8.0%. A decrease in the estimate used for expected return on
    plan assets would increase pension expense, while an increase in
    this estimate would decrease pension expense. A decrease of
    0.25% in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would
    have increased 2010 pension expense for U.S. plans by
    approximately $610.

Discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the
    measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments
    currently available and expected to be available during the
    period to maturity of the pension benefits. The Company’s
    discount rate for its U.S. plans used for the calculation
    of 2010 pension expense averaged 5.73%. A decrease in the
    discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an
    increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense. A
    decrease of 0.25% in the Company’s discount rate would have
    increased 2010 pension expense and the 2010 projected benefit
    obligation by approximately $383 and $9,815, respectively.

Actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are
    accumulated and, if outside a certain corridor, amortized over
    future periods and, therefore affect recognized expense in
    future periods. At December 26, 2010, the Company’s
    U.S. plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of $87,553
    included in accumulated other



comprehensive earnings related to its defined benefit pension
    plans compared to $80,201 at December 27, 2009. The
    increase primarily reflects additional unrecognized actuarial
    losses in 2010, primarily due to the reduction of the discount
    rate used to value the liability at December 26, 2010. The
    discount rate decreased to 5.20% at December 26, 2010 from
    5.73% used at December 27, 2009. Pension plan assets are
    valued on the basis of their fair market value on the
    measurement date. These changes in the fair market value of plan
    assets impact the amount of future pension expense due to
    amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses or gains.

Income
    Taxes

The Company’s annual income tax rate is based on its
    income, statutory tax rates, changes in prior tax positions and
    tax planning opportunities available in the various
    jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment and
    estimates are required to determine the Company’s annual
    tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions. Despite the
    Company’s belief that its tax return positions are fully
    supportable, these positions are subject to challenge and
    estimated liabilities are established in the event that these
    positions are challenged and the Company is not successful in
    defending these challenges. These estimated liabilities are
    adjusted, as well as the related interest, in light of changing
    facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit.

An estimated effective income tax rate is applied to the
    Company’s quarterly operating results. In the event there
    is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the
    Company’s quarterly operating results, the tax attributable
    to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the time.
    Changes in the Company’s estimated effective income tax
    rate during 2010 were primarily due to changes in its estimate
    of earnings by tax jurisdiction. In addition, changes in
    judgment regarding likely outcomes related to tax positions
    taken in a prior fiscal year, or tax costs or benefits from a
    resolution of such positions would be recorded entirely in the
    interim period the judgment changes or resolution occurs. During
    2010, the Company recorded a total benefit of approximately
    $22,300 related to discrete tax events primarily related to the
    completion of a U.S. tax examination.

In certain cases, tax law requires items to be included in the
    Company’s income tax returns at a different time than when
    these items are recognized on the financial statements or at a
    different amount than that which is recognized on the financial
    statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as
    expenses that are not deductible on the Company’s tax
    returns, while other differences are temporary and will reverse
    over time, such as depreciation expense. These differences that
    will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and
    liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Deferred tax
    assets represent credits or deductions that have been reflected
    in the financial statements but have not yet been reflected in
    the Company’s income tax returns. Valuation allowances are
    established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is
    determined that the Company will have insufficient future
    taxable income, including capital gains, to fully realize the
    future credits, deductions or capital losses. Deferred tax
    liabilities represent expenses recognized on the Company’s
    income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the
    Company’s financial statements or income recognized in the
    financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the
    Company’s income tax return. In 2007, the Mexican
    government instituted a tax structure which results in companies
    paying the higher of an income-based tax or an alternative flat
    tax commencing in 2008. Should the Company be subject to the
    alternative flat tax, it would be required to review whether its
    net deferred tax assets would be realized. As the Company
    believes that it will continue to be subject to the income-based
    tax in 2011, it believes that the net deferred tax assets
    related to the Mexican tax jurisdiction will be realizable.
    Should the facts and circumstances change, the Company may be
    required to reevaluate deferred tax assets related to its
    Mexican operations, which may result in additional tax expense.



Contractual
    Obligations and Commercial Commitments

In the normal course of its business, the Company enters into
    contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under
    license, which may require the payment of minimum guarantees, as
    well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and
    equipment. In addition, the Company has $1,384,895 in principal
    amount of long-term debt outstanding at December 26, 2010.
    Future payments required under these and other obligations as of
    December 26, 2010 are as follows:

The Company has a liability at December 26, 2010, including
    potential interest and penalties, of $105,575 for uncertain tax
    positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in
    various income tax returns. The Company does not know the
    ultimate resolution of these uncertain tax positions and as
    such, does not know the ultimate timing of payments related to
    this liability. Accordingly, these amounts are not included in
    the table above.

In connection with the Company’s agreement to form a joint
    venture with Discovery, the Company is obligated to make future
    payments to Discovery under a tax sharing agreement. These
    payments are contingent upon the Company having sufficient
    taxable income to realize the expected tax deductions of certain
    amounts related to the joint venture. Accordingly, estimates of
    these amounts are included in the table above.

The Company’s agreement with Marvel provides for minimum
    guaranteed royalty payments and requires the Company to make
    minimum expenditures on marketing and promotional activities.
    The future minimum contractual payments in the table above
    include future guaranteed contractual royalty payments of
    approximately $19,000 payable to Marvel that are contingent upon
    the theatrical release of

SPIDER-MAN 4

which the Company
    currently expects to be paid in 2012 and may be reduced by
    payments occurring prior to the theatrical release of

SPIDER-MAN 4

. In addition, in connection with the
    extension of the Marvel license in 2009, the Company may be
    subject to additional royalty guarantees totaling $140,000 that
    are not included in the table above and that may be payable
    during the next five to six years contingent upon the quantity
    and types of theatrical movie releases.

In addition to the amounts included in the table above, the
    Company expects to make contributions totaling approximately
    $5,400 related to its unfunded U.S. and other International
    pension plans in 2011. The Company also has letters of credit
    and related instruments of approximately $179,592 at
    December 26, 2010.

The Company believes that cash from operations and funds
    available through its commercial paper program or lines of
    credit will allow the Company to meet these and other
    obligations described above.

Financial
    Risk Management

The Company is exposed to market risks attributable to
    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the
    result of sourcing products priced in U.S. dollars, Hong
    Kong dollars and Euros while marketing those products in more
    than twenty currencies. Results of operations may be affected
    primarily by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, Hong
    Kong dollar, Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and Mexican
    peso and, to a lesser extent, currencies in Latin American and
    Asia Pacific countries.



To manage this exposure, the Company has hedged a portion of its
    forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange
    forward contracts. The Company estimates that a hypothetical
    immediate 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against
    foreign currencies could result in an approximate $68,455
    decrease in the fair value of these instruments. A decrease in
    the fair value of these instruments would be substantially
    offset by decreases in the related forecasted foreign currency
    transactions.

The Company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with
    respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short-term
    borrowing positions in currencies other than the
    U.S. dollar. The Company believes, however, that the
    on-going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its
    financial condition. In addition, the Company’s revenues
    and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by
    changes in foreign currency rates. A significant change in
    foreign exchange rates can materially impact the Company’s
    revenues and earnings due to translation of foreign-denominated
    revenues and expenses. The Company does not hedge against
    translation impacts of foreign exchange. From time to time,
    affiliates of the Company may make or receive intercompany loans
    in currencies other than their functional currency. The Company
    manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using
    foreign exchange contracts.

The Company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an
    asset or liability on the balance sheet. The Company does not
    speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts. At
    December 26, 2010, these contracts had unrealized gains of
    $16,151, of which $14,681 are recorded in prepaid expenses and
    other current assets and $1,470 are recorded in other assets.
    Included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings at
    December 26, 2010 are deferred gains of $15,432, net of
    tax, related to these derivatives.

At December 26, 2010, the Company had fixed rate long-term
    debt, excluding fair value adjustments, of $1,384,895. The
    Company is party to several interest rate swap agreements, with
    a total notional amount of $400,000, to adjust the amount of
    long-term debt subject to fixed interest rates. The interest
    rate swaps are matched with specific long-term debt issues and
    are designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair
    value of the associated debt. Changes in fair value of these
    contracts are wholly offset in earnings by changes in the fair
    value of the related long-term debt. At December 26, 2010,
    the fair value of these contracts was an asset of $12,786, which
    is included in other assets, with a corresponding fair value
    adjustment to increase long-term debt. Changes in interest rates
    affect the fair value of fixed rate debt not hedged by interest
    rate swap agreements while affecting the earnings and cash flows
    of the long-term debt hedged by the interest rate swaps. The
    Company estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point
    decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or
    decrease the fair value of this long-term debt by approximately
    $122,000 or $104,800, respectively. A hypothetical one-quarter
    percentage point change in interest rates would increase or
    decrease 2011 pretax earnings by $882 and 2011 cash flows by
    $764.

The
    Economy and Inflation

The principal market for the Company’s products is the
    retail sector. Revenues from the Company’s top five
    customers, all retailers, accounted for approximately 50% of its
    consolidated net revenues in 2010 and 54% and 52% of its
    consolidated net revenues in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In
    recent years certain customers in the retail sector have
    experienced economic difficulty. The Company monitors the
    creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies
    and limits as it deems appropriate.

The Company’s revenue pattern continues to show the second
    half of the year to be more significant to its overall business
    for the full year. In 2010, approximately 65% of the
    Company’s full year net revenues were recognized in the
    second half of the year. Although the Company expects that this
    concentration will continue, particularly as more of its
    business has shifted to larger customers with order patterns
    concentrated in the second half of the year, this concentration
    may be less in years where the Company has products related to a
    major motion picture release that occurs in the first half of
    the year. In 2010, the Company had products related to the
    mid-year major motion picture release of

IRON MAN 2

,
    while in 2009 the Company had products related to the mid-year
    major motion picture releases of

TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE
    FALLEN

,

G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA

and

X-MEN
    ORIGINS: WOLVERINE

. The concentration of sales in the second
    half of the year increases the risk of (a) underproduction
    of popular items, (b) overproduction of less popular items,
    and (c) failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping
    schedules. The business of the



Company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary
    from year to year largely because of differences in the degree
    of consumer acceptance of a product line, product availability,
    marketing strategies, inventory levels, policies of retailers
    and differences in overall economic conditions. The trend of
    larger retailers has been to maintain lower inventories
    throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product
    within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling
    season, which includes Christmas.

Quick response inventory management practices being used by
    retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate
    delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of
    shipment. Retailers are timing their orders so that they are
    being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by
    consumers. To the extent that retailers do not sell as much of
    their year-end inventory purchases during this holiday selling
    season as they had anticipated, their demand for additional
    product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed,
    thus negatively impacting the Company’s future revenues. In
    addition, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the
    Company’s significant retailers could negatively impact the
    Company’s future revenues.

The effect of inflation on the Company’s operations during
    2010 was not significant and the Company will continue its
    policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices, accordingly.

Other
    Information

The Company is not aware of any material amounts of potential
    exposure relating to environmental matters and does not believe
    its environmental compliance costs or liabilities to be material
    to its operating results or financial position.

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Hasbro, Inc.:

    December 26, 2010. These consolidated financial statements
    are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated

    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred

    results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
    fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 26,
    2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Hasbro, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 26, 2010, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO), and our report dated February 23, 2011 expressed an
    unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.

HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

(1)

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Hasbro, Inc. and all majority-owned subsidiaries
    (“Hasbro” or the “Company”). Investments
    representing 20% to 50% ownership interests in other companies
    are accounted for using the equity method. All significant
    intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Preparation
    of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
    notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the 2009 and 2008 consolidated financial
    statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2010
    presentation.

Fiscal
    Year

Hasbro’s fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in December.
    Each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended
    December 26, 2010 were fifty-two week periods.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and highly
    liquid investments purchased with a maturity to the Company of
    three months or less.

Marketable
    Securities

Marketable securities consist of investments in private
    investment funds. For these investments, which are included in
    prepaid and other current assets on the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheets, the Company has selected the fair
    value option which requires the Company to record the unrealized
    gains and losses on these investments in the consolidated
    statements of operations at the time they occur.

Accounts
    Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Credit is granted to customers predominantly on an unsecured
    basis. Credit limits and payment terms are established based on
    extensive evaluations made on an ongoing basis throughout the
    fiscal year with regard to the financial performance, cash
    generation, financing availability and liquidity status of each
    customer. The majority of customers are formally reviewed at
    least annually; more frequent reviews are performed based on the
    customer’s financial condition and the level of credit
    being extended. For customers on credit who are experiencing
    financial difficulties, management performs additional financial
    analyses before shipping orders. The Company uses a variety of
    financial transactions, based on availability and cost, to
    increase the collectibility of certain of its accounts,
    including letters of credit, credit insurance, factoring with
    unrelated third parties, and requiring cash in advance of
    shipping.

The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on
    management’s assessment of the business environment,
    customers’ financial condition, historical collection
    experience, accounts receivable aging and customer disputes.
    When a significant event occurs, such as a bankruptcy filing by
    a specific



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

customer, and on a quarterly basis, the allowance is reviewed
    for adequacy and the balance is adjusted to reflect current risk
    assessments.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out) or market. Based upon a consideration of quantities
    on hand, actual and projected sales volume, anticipated product
    selling price and product lines planned to be discontinued,
    slow-moving and obsolete inventory is written down to its
    estimated net realizable value.

At December 26, 2010 and December 27, 2009, finished
    goods comprised 96% and 93% of inventories, respectively.

Equity
    Method Investments

For the Company’s equity method investments, only the
    Company’s investment in and amounts due to and from the
    equity method investments are included on the consolidated
    balance sheet and only the Company’s share of the equity
    method investments’ earnings (losses) is included on the
    consolidated statement of operations. Dividends, cash
    distributions, loans or other cash received from the equity
    method investments, additional cash investments, loan repayments
    or other cash paid to the investee are included in the
    consolidated statement of cash flows.

The Company reviews its investments in equity method investments
    for impairment on a periodic basis. If it has been determined
    that the equity investment is less than its related fair value
    and that this decline is

other-than-temporary,

the carrying value of the investment is adjusted downward to
    reflect these declines in value. The Company has one significant
    equity method investment, its 50% interest in a joint venture
    with Discovery Communications, Inc. See note 5 for
    additional information.

Long-Lived
    Assets

The Company’s long-lived assets consist of property, plant
    and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
    lives as well as other intangible assets the Company considers
    to have a defined life.

Goodwill results from acquisitions the Company has made over
    time. Substantially all of the other intangibles consist of the
    cost of acquired product rights. In establishing the value of
    such rights, the Company considers existing trademarks,
    copyrights, patents, license agreements and other
    product-related rights. These rights were valued on their
    acquisition date based on the anticipated future cash flows from
    the underlying product line. The Company has certain intangible
    assets related to the Tonka and Milton Bradley acquisitions that
    have an indefinite life.

Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives
    are not amortized and are tested for impairment at least
    annually. The annual test begins with goodwill and all
    intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units.
    Goodwill is then tested using a two-step process that begins
    with an estimation of fair value of the reporting unit using an
    income approach, which looks to the present value of expected
    future cash flows. The first step is a screen for potential
    impairment while the second step measures the amount of
    impairment if there is an indication from the first step that
    one exists. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested
    annually for impairment by comparing their carrying value to
    their estimated fair value, also calculated using the present
    value of expected future cash flows.

The remaining intangibles having defined lives are being
    amortized over periods ranging from five to twenty-five years,
    primarily using the straight-line method. At December 26,
    2010, approximately 15% of



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

other intangibles relate to rights acquired in connection with a
    major entertainment property and are being amortized in
    proportion to projected sales of the licensed products over the
    contract life.

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less
    accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using
    accelerated and straight-line methods to depreciate the cost of
    property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives.
    The principal lives, in years, used in determining depreciation
    rates of various assets are: land improvements 15 to 19,
    buildings and improvements 15 to 25 and machinery and equipment
    3 to 12. Depreciation expense is classified in the statement of
    operations based on the nature of the property and equipment
    being depreciated. Tools, dies and molds are depreciated over a
    three-year period or their useful lives, whichever is less,
    using an accelerated method. The Company generally owns all
    tools, dies and molds related to its products.

The Company reviews property, plant and equipment and other
    intangibles with defined lives for impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the
    carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future
    undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or
    asset group. If such assets were considered to be impaired, the
    impairment to be recognized would be measured by the amount by
    which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value.
    Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or
    appraised values, depending on the nature of the assets. Assets
    to be disposed of are carried at the lower of the net book value
    or their estimated fair value less disposal costs.

Financial
    Instruments

Hasbro’s financial instruments include cash and cash
    equivalents, accounts receivable, short-term borrowings,
    accounts payable and accrued liabilities. At December 26,
    2010, the carrying cost of these instruments approximated their
    fair value. The Company’s financial instruments at
    December 26, 2010 also include long-term borrowings (see
    note 9 for carrying cost and related fair values) as well
    as certain assets and liabilities measured at fair value (see
    notes 9, 12 and 16).

Securitization
    and Transfer of Financial Instruments

During the three years ended 2010, Hasbro had an agreement that
    allowed the Company to sell, on an ongoing basis, an undivided
    fractional ownership interest in certain of its trade accounts
    receivable through a revolving securitization arrangement. The
    Company retained servicing responsibilities for, as well as a
    subordinate interest in, the transferred receivables. In 2009
    and prior, Hasbro accounted for the securitization of trade
    accounts receivable as a sale in accordance with then current
    accounting standards. As a result, the related receivables were
    removed from the consolidated balance sheet.

In 2010, the Company adopted the revised accounting standards
    related to the transfer of financial assets. As a result of the
    adoption of these standards, the Company was required to account
    for the sale of the receivables under the securitization
    facility as a secured borrowing. The receivables sold are
    included in accounts receivable until collection. The proceeds
    from utilization of the facility are recorded as short-term
    debt. The Company did not utilize this facility in 2010. The
    facility was terminated effective January 28, 2011.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue from product sales is recognized upon the passing of
    title to the customer, generally at the time of shipment.
    Provisions for discounts, rebates and returns are made when the
    related revenues are recognized. The Company bases its estimates
    for discounts, rebates and returns on agreed customer terms and
    historical experience.



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

The Company enters into arrangements licensing its brand names
    on specifically approved products. The licensees pay the Company
    royalties as products are sold, in some cases subject to minimum
    guaranteed amounts. Royalty revenues are recognized as they are
    reported as earned and payment becomes assured, over the life of
    the agreement.

The Company produces television programming for license to third
    parties. Revenues from the licensing of television programming
    are recorded when the content is available for telecast by the
    licensee and when certain other conditions are met.

Revenue from product sales less related provisions for
    discounts, rebates and returns, as well as royalty revenues and
    television programming revenues comprise net revenues in the
    consolidated statements of operations.

Costs
    of Sales

Cost of sales primarily consists of purchased materials, labor,
    manufacturing overheads and other inventory-related costs such
    as obsolescence. In addition, cost of sales during 2010 also
    includes amortization of program production costs.

Royalties

The Company enters into license agreements with inventors,
    designers and others for the use of intellectual properties in
    its products. These agreements may call for payment in advance
    or future payment of minimum guaranteed amounts. Amounts paid in
    advance are recorded as an asset and charged to expense as
    revenue from the related products is recognized. If all or a
    portion of the minimum guaranteed amounts appear not to be
    recoverable through future use of the rights obtained under
    license, the non-recoverable portion of the guaranty is charged
    to expense at that time.

Advertising

Production costs of commercials are charged to operations in the
    fiscal year during which the production is first aired. The
    costs of other advertising, promotion and marketing programs are
    charged to operations in the fiscal year incurred.

Program
    Production Costs

The Company incurs certain costs in connection with the
    production of television programming. These costs are
    capitalized by the Company as they are incurred and amortized
    using the individual-film-forecast method, whereby these costs
    are amortized in the proportion that the current year’s
    revenues bear to management’s estimate of total ultimate
    revenues as of the beginning of such period related to the
    program. These capitalized costs are reported at the lower of
    cost, less accumulated amortization, or fair value, and reviewed
    for impairment when an event or change in circumstances occurs
    that indicates that impairment may exist. The fair value is
    determined using a discounted cash flow model which is primarily
    based on management’s future revenue and cost estimates.

Shipping
    and Handling

Hasbro expenses costs related to the shipment and handling of
    goods to customers as incurred. For 2010, 2009 and 2008, these
    costs were $154,604, $155,496 and $178,738, respectively, and
    are included in selling, distribution and administration
    expenses.



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

Operating
    Leases

Hasbro records lease expense in such a manner as to recognize
    this expense on a straight-line basis inclusive of rent
    concessions and rent increases. Reimbursements from lessors for
    leasehold improvements are deferred and recognized as a
    reduction to lease expense over the lease term.

Income
    Taxes

Hasbro uses the asset and liability approach for financial
    accounting and reporting of income taxes. Deferred income taxes
    have not been provided on the majority of undistributed earnings
    of international subsidiaries as the majority of such earnings
    are indefinitely reinvested by the Company.

The Company uses a two step process for the measurement of
    uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to
    be taken in a tax return. The first step is a determination of
    whether the tax position should be recognized in the financial
    statements. The second step determines the measurement of the
    tax position. The Company records potential interest and
    penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income
    tax expense.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into
    U.S. dollars at period-end rates, and revenues, costs and
    expenses are translated at weighted average rates during each
    reporting period. Earnings include gains or losses resulting
    from foreign currency transactions and, when required,
    translation gains and losses resulting from the use of the
    U.S. dollar as the functional currency in highly
    inflationary economies. Other gains and losses resulting from
    translation of financial statements are a component of other
    comprehensive earnings.

Pension
    Plans, Postretirement and Postemployment
    Benefits

Pension expense and related amounts in the consolidated balance
    sheet are based on actuarial computations of current and future
    benefits. The Company’s policy is to fund amounts which are
    required by applicable regulations and which are tax deductible.
    In 2011, the Company expects to contribute approximately $5,400
    to its pension plans. The estimated amounts of future payments
    to be made under other retirement programs are being accrued
    currently over the period of active employment and are also
    included in pension expense. Hasbro has a contributory
    postretirement health and life insurance plan covering
    substantially all employees who retire under any of its United
    States defined benefit pension plans and meet certain age and
    length of service requirements. The cost of providing these
    benefits on behalf of employees who retired prior to 1993 is and
    will continue to be substantially borne by the Company. The cost
    of providing benefits on behalf of substantially all employees
    who retire after 1992 is borne by the employee. It also has
    several plans covering certain groups of employees, which may
    provide benefits to such employees following their period of
    employment but prior to their retirement. The Company measures
    the costs of these obligations based on actuarial computations.

Risk
    Management Contracts

Hasbro uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the
    impact of currency rate fluctuations on firmly committed and
    projected future foreign currency transactions. These

over-the-counter

contracts, which hedge future purchases of inventory and other
    cross-border currency requirements not denominated in the
    functional currency of the business unit, are primarily
    denominated in United States and Hong Kong dollars, Euros and
    British pound sterling and are entered into with a number of
    counterparties, all of which are major financial institutions.
    The Company believes that a default by a counterparty would not
    have a



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

material adverse effect on the financial condition of the
    Company. Hasbro does not enter into derivative financial
    instruments for speculative purposes.

At the inception of the contracts, Hasbro designates its
    derivatives as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The
    Company formally documents all relationships between hedging
    instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management
    objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge
    transactions. All hedges designated as cash flow hedges are
    linked to forecasted transactions and the Company assesses, both
    at the inception of the hedge and on an on-going basis, the
    effectiveness of the derivatives used in hedging transactions in
    offsetting changes in the cash flows of the forecasted
    transaction. The ineffective portion of a hedging derivative, if
    any, is immediately recognized in the consolidated statements of
    operations.

The Company records all derivatives, such as foreign currency
    exchange contracts, on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes
    in the derivative fair values that are designated effective and
    qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred and recorded as a
    component of AOCE until the hedged transactions occur and are
    then recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.
    The Company’s foreign currency contracts hedging
    anticipated cash flows are designated as cash flow hedges. When
    it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a
    hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively.
    Any gain or loss deferred through that date remains in AOCE
    until the forecasted transaction occurs, at which time it is
    reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations. To
    the extent the transaction is no longer deemed probable of
    occurring, hedge accounting treatment is discontinued and
    amounts deferred would be reclassified to the consolidated
    statements of operations. In the event hedge accounting
    requirements are not met, gains and losses on such instruments
    are included currently in the consolidated statements of
    operations. The Company uses derivatives to economically hedge
    intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies. Due to the
    short-term nature of the derivative contracts involved, the
    Company does not use hedge accounting for these contracts.

The Company also uses interest rate swap agreements to adjust
    the amount of long-term debt subject to fixed interest rates.
    The interest rate swaps are matched with specific fixed rate
    long-term debt obligations and are designated as fair value
    hedges of the change in fair value of the related debt
    obligations. These agreements are recorded at their fair value
    as an asset or liability. Gains and losses on these contracts
    are included in the consolidated statements of operations and
    are wholly offset by changes in the fair value of the related
    long-term debt. These hedges are considered to be perfectly
    effective under current accounting guidance. The interest rate
    swap contracts are with a number of major financial institutions
    in order to minimize counterparty credit risk. The Company
    believes that it is unlikely that any of its counterparties will
    be unable to perform under the terms of the contracts.

Accounting
    for Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has a stock-based employee compensation plan for
    employees and non-employee members of the Company’s Board
    of Directors. Under this plan the Company may grant stock
    options at or above the fair market value of the Company’s
    stock, as well as restricted stock, restricted stock units and
    contingent stock performance awards. All awards are measured at
    fair value at the date of the grant and amortized as expense on
    a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the
    award. For awards contingent upon Company performance, the
    measurement of the expense for these awards is based on the
    Company’s current estimate of its performance over the
    performance period. See note 13 for further discussion.

Net
    Earnings Per Common Share

Basic net earnings per share is computed by dividing net
    earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding
    for the year. Diluted net earnings per share is similar except
    that the weighted average number of shares outstanding is
    increased by dilutive securities, and net earnings are adjusted
    for certain



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

amounts related to dilutive securities. Dilutive securities
    include shares issuable under convertible debt, as well as
    shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants for
    which the market price exceeds the exercise price, less shares
    which could have been purchased by the Company with the related
    proceeds. Options totaling 94, 5,784 and 3,491 for 2010, 2009
    and 2008, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of
    diluted earnings per share because to include them would have
    been antidilutive.

A reconciliation of net earnings and average number of shares

    well as to add back to outstanding shares the amount of shares
    potentially issuable under the contingent conversion feature of
    these debentures. During the first and second quarter of 2010,
    substantially all of these debentures were converted into shares
    of common stock. See note 9 for further information.

In 2010, 2009 and 2008, net gains (losses) on cash flow hedging
    activities reclassified to earnings, net of tax, included gains
    (losses) of $(109), $(679), and $1,292, respectively, as a
    result of hedge ineffectiveness.

The related tax benefit (expense) of other comprehensive
    earnings items was $5,327, $1,322 and $16,022 for the years
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Income tax expense (benefit)
    related to reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive
    earnings of $8,767, $(331) and $763 in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, were included in these amounts.

At December 26, 2010, the Company had remaining deferred
    gains on hedging instruments, net of tax, of $15,432 in AOCE.
    These instruments hedge inventory purchased during the fourth
    quarter of 2010 or forecasted to be purchased during 2011 and
    2012 and intercompany expenses and royalty payments expected to
    be paid or received during 2011 and 2012. These amounts will be
    reclassified into the consolidated statement of operations upon
    the sale of the related inventory or receipt or payment of the
    related royalties and expenses. Of the amount included in AOCE
    at December 26, 2010, the Company expects approximately
    $11,822 to be reclassified to the consolidated statement of
    operations within the next 12 months. However, the amount
    ultimately realized in earnings is dependent on the fair value
    of the contracts on the settlement dates.

Goodwill
    and Intangibles

Goodwill and certain intangible assets relating to rights
    obtained in the Company’s acquisition of Milton Bradley in
    1984 and Tonka in 1991 are not amortized. These rights were
    determined to have indefinite lives and total approximately
    $75,700. The Company’s other intangible assets are
    amortized over their remaining useful lives, and accumulated
    amortization of these other intangibles is reflected in other
    intangibles, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

The Company performs an annual impairment test on goodwill and
    intangible assets with indefinite lives. This annual impairment
    test is performed in the fourth quarter of the Company’s
    fiscal year. In addition, if an event occurs or circumstances
    change that indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable, the Company will perform an interim impairment test
    at that time. For the three fiscal years ended December 26,
    2010, no such events occurred. The Company completed its annual
    impairment tests in the fourth quarters of 2010, 2009 and 2008
    and had no impairment charges.

A portion of the Company’s goodwill and other intangible
    assets reside in the Corporate segment of the business. For
    purposes of impairment testing, these assets are allocated to
    the reporting units within the Company’s operating
    segments. Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill, by
    operating segment, for the years ended December 26, 2010
    and December 27, 2009 are as follows:

In May 2009 the Company amended its license agreement with Lucas
    Licensing, Ltd. (“Lucas”) related to the STAR WARS
    brand. The amendment included the extension of the term of the
    license for an additional two years, from the end of 2018 to the
    end of 2020. In connection with the extension of the license
    rights, $45,000 was recorded as an intangible asset during 2009
    and will be amortized over the term of the extension. The
    amendment also provided for the settlement of certain royalty
    audit issues, primarily related to contractual interpretations
    associated with the computation of royalties dating back to
    1999, and the clarification of certain terms and interpretations
    of the agreement on a prospective basis through the end of the
    term, including the scope of licensed rights to future developed
    properties by Lucas.

The Company will continue to incur amortization expense related
    to the use of acquired and licensed rights to produce various
    products. The amortization of these product rights will
    fluctuate depending on related projected revenues during an
    annual period, as well as rights reaching the end of their
    useful lives. The Company currently estimates continuing
    amortization expense related to the above intangible assets for
    the next five years to be approximately:

Equity
    Method Investment

In the second quarter of 2009, the Company acquired a 50%
    interest in a joint venture, Hub Television Networks, LLC
    (“THE HUB”, formerly known as DHJV Company LLC), with
    Discovery Communications, Inc. (“Discovery”). THE HUB,
    formerly known as the Discovery Kids Network, was established to
    create a television network in the United States dedicated to
    high-quality children’s and family entertainment and
    educational programming. The Company purchased its 50% share in
    THE HUB for a payment of $300,000 and certain future payments
    based on the value of certain tax benefits expected to be
    received by the Company. The present value of the expected
    future payments at the acquisition date totaled approximately
    $67,900 and was recorded as a component of the Company’s
    investment in the joint venture. The balance of the associated
    liability, including imputed interest, was $72,665 and $71,234
    at December 26, 2010 and December 27, 2009,
    respectively, and is included as a component of other
    liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet.

Voting control of the joint venture is shared


/


between the Company and Discovery. The Company has determined
    that it does not meet the control requirements to consolidate
    the joint venture, and accounts for the investment using the
    equity method of accounting. The Company’s share in the
    earnings (loss) of the joint

venture for the years ended December 26, 2010 and
    December 27, 2009 totaled $(9,323) of loss and $3,856 of
    earnings, respectively, and is included as a component of other
    (income) expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of
    operations.

The Company has entered into a license agreement with the joint
    venture that will require the payment of royalties by the
    Company to the joint venture based on a percentage of revenue
    derived from products related to television shows broadcast by
    the joint venture. The license agreement includes a minimum
    royalty guarantee of $125,000, payable in 5 annual installments
    of $25,000 per year, commencing in 2009, which can be earned out
    over approximately a

10-year

period. During 2010 and 2009, the Company paid the first two
    annual installments of $25,000 each. The Company and the joint
    venture are also parties to an agreement under which the Company
    will provide the joint venture with an exclusive first look in
    the U.S. to license certain types of programming developed
    by the Company based on its intellectual property. In the event
    the joint venture licenses the programming from the Company to
    air on the network, the joint venture is required to pay the
    Company a license fee.

As of December 26, 2010, the Company’s interest in the
    joint venture totaled $354,612 and is a component of other
    assets. The Company enters into certain transactions with the
    joint venture including the licensing of television programming
    and the purchase of advertising. During 2010 and 2009, these
    transactions were not material.

Program
    Production Costs

Program production costs consist of the following at
    December 26, 2010:


Released, less amortization

$

12,852

In production

19,319

Development and pre-production

1,417

Acquired libraries

Based on management’s total revenue estimates at
    December 26, 2010, approximately 95% of unamortized
    television programming costs relating to released productions is
    expected to be amortized during the next three years. The
    Company expects to amortize, based on current estimates,
    approximately $4,600 of the $12,852 of released programs during
    fiscal 2011.

At December 26, 2010, acquired program libraries are being
    amortized based on estimates of future expected revenues over a
    remaining period of approximately 2 years.

Financing
    Arrangements

Short-Term
    Borrowings

At December 26, 2010, Hasbro had available an unsecured
    committed line and unsecured uncommitted lines of credit from
    various banks approximating $500,000 and $206,400, respectively.
    A significant portion of the short-term borrowings outstanding
    at the end of 2010 and 2009 represent borrowings made under, or
    supported by, these lines of credit. Borrowings under the lines
    of credit were made by certain international affiliates of the
    Company on terms and at interest rates generally extended to
    companies of comparable creditworthiness in those markets. The
    weighted average interest rates of the outstanding borrowings as
    of December 26, 2010 and December 27, 2009 were 5.79%
    and 1.23%, respectively. The Company had no



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

borrowings outstanding under its committed line of credit at
    December 26, 2010. During 2010, Hasbro’s working
    capital needs were fulfilled by cash generated from operations
    and borrowings under lines of credit.

The unsecured committed line (the “Agreement”)
    provides the Company with a $500,000 committed borrowing
    facility through December 2014. The Agreement was entered into
    on December 16, 2010 replacing the previous Revolving
    Credit Agreement. The Agreement contains certain financial
    covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and
    certain other limitations typical of an investment grade
    facility, including with respect to liens, mergers and
    incurrence of indebtedness. The Company was in compliance with
    all covenants as of and for the year ended December 26,
    2010.

The Company pays a commitment fee (0.225% as of
    December 26, 2010) based on the unused portion of the
    facility and interest equal to a Base Rate or Eurocurrency Rate
    plus a spread on borrowings under the facility. The Base Rate is
    determined based on either the Federal Funds Rate plus a spread,
    Prime Rate or Eurocurrency Rate plus a spread. The commitment
    fee and the amount of the spread to the Base Rate or
    Eurocurrency rate both vary based on the Company’s
    long-term debt ratings and the Company’s leverage. At
    December 26, 2010, the interest rate under the facility was
    equal to Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.50%.

In January 2011, the Company entered into an agreement with a
    group of banks to establish a commercial paper program (the
    “Program”). Under the Program, at the Company’s
    request the banks may either purchase from the Company, or
    arrange for the sale by the Company, of unsecured commercial
    paper notes. Under the Program, the Company may issue notes from
    time to time up to an aggregate principal amount outstanding at
    any given time of $500,000. The maturities of the notes may vary
    but may not exceed 397 days. Subject to market conditions,
    the notes will be sold under customary terms in the commercial
    paper market and will be issued at a discount to par, or
    alternatively, will be sold at par and will bear varying
    interest rates based on a fixed or floating rate basis. The
    interest rates will vary based on market conditions and the
    ratings assigned to the notes by the credit rating agencies at
    the time of issuance.

Securitization

During the three years ended 2010, the Company was party to an
    accounts receivable securitization program whereby the Company
    sold, on an ongoing basis, substantially all of its
    U.S. trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy-remote,
    special purpose subsidiary, Hasbro Receivables Funding, LLC
    (HRF), which is wholly-owned and consolidated by the Company.
    HRF, subject to certain conditions, sold, from time to time on a
    revolving basis, an undivided fractional ownership interest in
    up to $250,000 of eligible domestic receivables to various
    multi-party commercial paper conduits supported by a committed
    liquidity facility. During the period from the first day of the
    October fiscal month through the last day of the following
    January fiscal month, this limit increased to $300,000.
    Subsequent to December 27, 2009, in January 2010, the
    agreement was amended on a prospective basis to eliminate the
    additional $50,000 available from the first day of the October
    fiscal month through the last day of the following January
    fiscal month. Under the terms of the agreement, new receivables
    are added to the pool as collections reduce previously held
    receivables. The Company serviced, administered, and collected
    the receivables on behalf of HRF and the conduits. The net
    proceeds of sale were less than the face amount of accounts
    receivable sold by an amount that approximates a financing cost.
    Effective January 28, 2011, this program was terminated.

As of December 26, 2010 and December 27, 2009, there
    were no amounts utilized under the receivables facility. The
    Company did not utilize the facility in 2010. As of
    December 26, 2010 the Company had $250,000 available to
    sell under the facility. During 2009 and 2008, the transactions
    were accounted for as sales under then current accounting
    guidance. During 2009 and 2008, the loss on the sale of
    receivables totaled $2,514 and $5,302, respectively, which is
    recorded in selling, distribution and administration expenses in
    the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The
    discount on interests sold was approximately equal to the
    interest rate paid by the conduits to the holders of the
    commercial paper plus other fees.

The carrying cost of the 6.125% Notes Due 2014 includes
    principal amounts of $425,000 as well as fair value adjustments
    of $12,786 and $(2,725) at December 26, 2010 and
    December 27, 2009, respectively, related to interest rate
    swaps. All other carrying costs represent principal amounts.
    Total principal amounts of long-term debt at December 26,
    2010 and December 27, 2009 were $1,384,895 and $1,134,723,
    respectively.

The fair value of the convertible debt is based on an average of
    the prices of trades occurring around the balance sheet date.
    The fair values of the Company’s other long-term borrowings
    are measured using a combination of broker quotations when
    available and discounted future cash flows. The fair value of
    the interest rate swaps are measured based on the present value
    of future cash flows using the swap curve as of the date of
    valuation.

In March 2010 the Company issued $500,000 of Notes that are due
    in 2040 (the “Notes”). The Notes bear interest at a
    rate of 6.35%. The Company may redeem the Notes at its option at
    the greater of the principal amount of the Notes or the present
    value of the remaining scheduled payments discounted using the
    effective interest rate on applicable U.S. Treasury bills
    at the time of repurchase.

In May 2009 the Company issued $425,000 of Notes that are due in
    2014 (the “Notes”). The Notes bear interest at a rate
    of 6.125%, which may be adjusted upward in the event that the
    Company’s credit rating from Moody’s Investor
    Services, Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings
    Services or Fitch Ratings is reduced to Ba1, BB+, or BB+,
    respectively, or below. At December 26, 2010, the
    Company’s ratings from Moody’s Investor Services,
    Inc., Standard & Poor’s Rating Services and Fitch
    ratings were Baa2, BBB, and BBB+, respectively. The interest
    rate adjustment is dependent on the degree of decrease of the
    Company’s ratings and could range from 0.25% to a maximum
    of 2.00%. The Company may redeem the Notes at its option at the
    greater of the



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to

    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

principal amount of the Notes or the present value of the
    remaining scheduled payments discounted using the effective
    interest rate on applicable U.S. Treasury bills at the time
    of repurchase.

The Company is party to a series of interest rate swap
    agreements to adjust the amount of debt that is subject to fixed
    interest rates. The interest rate swaps are matched with the
    6.125% Notes Due 2014 and accounted for as fair value
    hedges of those notes. The interest rate swaps have a total
    notional amount of $400,000 with maturities in 2014. In each of
    the contracts, the Company receives payments based upon a fixed
    interest rate of 6.125%, which matches the interest rate of the
    notes being hedged, and makes payments based upon a floating
    rate based on Libor. These contracts are designated and
    effective as hedges of the change in the fair value of the
    associated debt. At December 26, 2010 and December 27,
    2009, the fair value of these contracts was an asset (liability)
    of $12,786 and $(2,725), respectively, which is recorded in
    other assets and other liabilities with a corresponding fair
    value adjustment to increase (decrease) long-term debt. The
    Company recorded a gain (loss) of $15,511 and $(2,725) on these
    instruments in other (income) expense, net for the years ended
    December 26, 2010 and December 27, 2009, respectively,
    relating to the change in fair value of such derivatives, wholly
    offsetting gains and losses from the change in fair value of the
    associated long-term debt.

In 2008 the Company repaid $135,092 of 6.15% notes due in
    July 2008.

At December 27, 2009, the Company had $249,828 outstanding
    in principal amount of contingent convertible debentures due
    2021. If the closing price of the Company’s common stock
    exceeded $23.76 for at least 20 trading days, within the 30
    consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of
    the calendar quarter, the holders had the right to convert the
    notes to shares of the Company’s common stock at the
    initial conversion price of $21.60 in the next calendar quarter.
    During the first quarter of 2010, holders of these debentures
    converted $111,177 of these debentures which resulted in the
    issuance of 5,147 shares of common stock. In addition, if
    the closing price of the Company’s common stock exceeded
    $27.00 for at least 20 trading days in any thirty day period,
    the Company had the right to call the debentures by giving
    notice to the holders of the debentures. During a prescribed
    notice period following a call by the Company, the holders of
    the debentures had the right to convert their debentures in
    accordance with the conversion terms described above. On
    March 29, 2010, the Company gave notice of its election to
    redeem all of the outstanding debentures on April 29, 2010
    at a redemption price to be paid in cash of $1,011.31 per $1,000
    principal amount, which was equal to the par value thereof plus
    accrued and unpaid cash interest through April 29, 2010.
    During the notice period, $138,467 of the debentures were
    converted by the holders, resulting in the issuance of
    6,410 shares of common stock. The remaining debentures were
    redeemed at a total cost of $186, which included accrued
    interest through the redemption date.

At December 26, 2010, as detailed above, the Company’s
    6.125% Notes mature in 2014. All of the Company’s
    other long-term borrowings have contractual maturities that
    occur subsequent to 2015.

Certain income tax (benefits) expenses, not reflected in income
    taxes in the consolidated statements of operations totaled
    $(87,367) in 2010, $(2,905) in 2009, and $(29,287) in 2008.
    These income tax (benefits) expenses relate primarily to the
    reversal through additional paid in capital of deferred tax
    liabilities relating to the Company’s contingent
    convertible debentures upon the conversion of these debentures
    in 2010. These amounts also include derivative and pension
    amounts recorded in AOCE and stock options. In 2010, 2009, and
    2008, the deferred tax portion of the total (benefit) expense
    was $(64,700), $(1,041), and $(26,555), respectively.

During 2010 and 2009, the Company indefinitely reinvested all
    current year international net earnings outside the U.S. In
    2008, the Company designated $60,000 of the international net
    earnings during that year that will not be indefinitely
    reinvested outside of the U.S. The incremental income tax
    on these amounts, representing the difference between the
    U.S. federal income tax rate and the income tax rates in
    the applicable international jurisdictions, is a component of
    deferred income tax expense.

Hasbro has a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets
    at December 26, 2010 of $10,776, which is a decrease of
    $865 from $11,641 at December 27, 2009. The valuation
    allowance pertains to certain International loss carryforwards,
    some of which have no expiration and others that would expire
    beginning in 2013.

Based on Hasbro’s history of taxable income and the
    anticipation of sufficient taxable income in years when the
    temporary differences are expected to become tax deductions, the
    Company believes that it will realize the benefit of the
    deferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation allowance.

Deferred income taxes of $64,536 and $54,321 at the end of 2010
    and 2009, respectively, are included as a component of prepaid
    expenses and other current assets, and $57,613 and $31,537,
    respectively, are included as a component of other assets. At
    the same dates, deferred income taxes of $2,135 and $1,456,
    respectively, are included as a component of accrued
    liabilities, and $1,065 and $5,305, respectively, are included
    as a component of other liabilities.

A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding
    potential interest and penalties, for the fiscal years ended
    December 26, 2010, December 27, 2009, and

If the $91,109 balance as of December 26, 2010 is
    recognized, approximately $77,000 would decrease the effective
    tax rate in the period in which each of the benefits is
    recognized. The remaining amount would be offset by the reversal
    of related deferred tax assets.

During 2010, 2009, and 2008 the Company recognized $3,171,
    $3,405, and $3,357, respectively, of potential interest and
    penalties, which are included as a component of income taxes in
    the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. At
    December 26, 2010, December 27, 2009, and
    December 28, 2008, the Company had accrued potential
    interest and penalties of $14,466, $17,938, and $13,660,
    respectively.

The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the
    United States and various state and international jurisdictions.
    In the normal course of business, the Company is regularly
    audited by U.S. federal, state and local and international
    tax authorities in various tax jurisdictions. The Company is no
    longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for
    years before 2006. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer
    subject to U.S. state or local and

non-U.S. income

tax examinations by tax authorities in its major jurisdictions
    for years before 2006.

The U.S. Internal Revenue Service commenced an examination
    related to the 2006 and 2007 U.S. federal income tax
    returns. The Company is also under income tax examination in
    several U.S. state and local and

non-U.S. jurisdictions.

The U.S. Internal Revenue Service recently completed an
    examination related to 2004 and 2005, including review by the
    Joint Committee on Taxation. During 2010, as the result of the
    completion of this examination, the Company recognized $24,167
    of previously accrued unrecognized tax benefits, including the
    reversal of related accrued interest, primarily related to the
    deductibility of certain expenses, as well as the tax treatment
    of certain subsidiary and other transactions. Of this amount,
    $7,032 was recorded as a reduction of deferred tax assets and
    the remainder as a reduction of income tax expense. The total
    income tax benefit resulting from the completion of the
    examination, including other adjustments, totaled approximately
    $21,000 during 2010.

In connection with tax examinations in Mexico for the years 2000
    to 2005, the Company has received tax assessments totaling
    approximately $178,970, which include interest, penalties and
    inflation updates, related to transfer pricing which the Company
    is vigorously defending. In order to continue the process of
    defending its position, the Company was required to guarantee
    the amount of the assessments for the years 2000 to 2003, as is
    usual and customary in Mexico with respect to these matters.
    Accordingly, as of December 26, 2010, bonds



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

totaling approximately $114,890 (at year-end 2010 exchange
    rates) have been provided to the Mexican government related to
    the 2000 to 2003 assessments, allowing the Company to defend its
    positions. The Company currently does not expect to be required
    to guarantee the amount of the 2004 or 2005 assessments. The
    Company expects to be successful in sustaining its position with
    respect to these assessments as well as similar positions that
    may be taken by the Mexican tax authorities for periods
    subsequent to 2005.

The Company believes it is reasonably possible that certain tax
    examinations and statutes of limitations may be concluded and
    will expire within the next 12 months, and that
    unrecognized tax benefits, excluding potential interest and
    penalties, may decrease by up to approximately $2,200,
    substantially all of which would be recorded as a tax benefit in
    the statement of operations. In addition, approximately $300 of
    potential interest and penalties related to these amounts would
    also be recorded as a tax benefit in the statement of
    operations. These unrecognized tax benefits primarily relate to
    both the timing and the nature of the deductibility of certain
    expenses, as well as the tax treatment of certain subsidiary and
    other transactions.

The cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of Hasbro’s
    international subsidiaries held for indefinite reinvestment is
    approximately $1,130,000 at December 26, 2010. In the event
    that all international undistributed earnings were remitted to
    the United States, the amount of incremental taxes would be
    approximately $268,000.

Capital
    Stock

In April 2010 the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
    the repurchase of up to $625,000 in common stock after four
    previous authorizations dated May 2005, July 2006, August 2007
    and February 2008 with a cumulative authorized repurchase amount
    of $1,700,000 were fully utilized. Purchases of the
    Company’s common stock may be made from time to time,
    subject to market conditions, and may be made in the open market
    or through privately negotiated transactions. The Company has no
    obligation to repurchase shares under the authorization and the
    timing, actual number, and the value of the shares which are
    repurchased will depend on a number of factors, including the
    price of the Company’s common stock. In 2010, the Company
    repurchased 15,763 shares at an average price of $40.37.
    The total cost of these repurchases, including transaction
    costs, was $636,681. At December 26, 2010, $150,068
    remained under this authorization.

(12)

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The Company measures certain assets at fair value in accordance
    with current accounting standards. The fair value hierarchy
    consists of three levels: Level 1 fair values are
    valuations based on quoted market prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability
    to access; Level 2 fair values are those valuations based
    on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted
    prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are
    observable or can be corroborated by observable data for
    substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and
    Level 3 fair values are valuations based on inputs that are
    supported by little or no market activity and that are
    significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

Current accounting standards permit entities to choose to
    measure many financial instruments and certain other items at
    fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure
    requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities
    that choose different measurement attributes for similar assets
    and liabilities. The Company has elected the fair value option
    for certain investments. At December 26, 2010 and
    December 27, 2009, these investments totaled $21,767 and
    $21,108, respectively, and are included in prepaid expenses and
    other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The
    Company recorded net gains of $1,218 and $1,019 on these
    investments in other (income) expense, net for the years ended
    December 26, 2010 and December 27, 2009, respectively,
    relating to the change in fair value of such investments.

For a portion of the Company’s

available-for-sale

securities, the Company is able to obtain quoted prices from
    stock exchanges to measure the fair value of these securities.
    Certain other

available-for-sale

securities held by the Company are valued at the net asset value
    which is quoted on a private market that is not active; however,
    the unit price is predominantly based on underlying investments
    which are traded on an active market. The Company’s
    derivatives consist primarily of foreign currency forward
    contracts. The Company uses current forward rates of the
    respective foreign currencies to measure the fair value of these
    contracts. The Company’s derivatives also include interest
    rate swaps used to adjust the amount of long-term debt subject
    to fixed interest rates. The fair values of the interest rate
    swaps are measured based on the present value of future cash
    flows using the swap curve as of the valuation date. The
    remaining derivative securities consist of warrants to purchase
    common stock. The Company uses the Black-Scholes model to value
    these warrants. One of the inputs used in the Black-Scholes
    model, historical volatility, is considered an unobservable
    input in that it reflects the Company’s own assumptions
    about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing
    the asset or liability. The Company believes that this is the
    best information available for use in the fair value
    measurement. There were no changes in these valuation techniques
    during 2010.

The following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending
    balances of the fair value measurements of the Company’s
    warrants to purchase common stock that use significant
    unobservable inputs (Level 3):

In the second quarter of 2009, certain warrants held by the

    was recorded as deferred revenue and is being amortized to
    revenue over the term of the amended license agreement.

Stock
    Options, Other Stock Awards and Warrants

Hasbro has reserved 20,364 shares of its common stock for
    issuance upon exercise of options and the grant of other awards
    granted or to be granted under stock incentive plans for
    employees and for non-employee members of the Board of Directors
    (collectively, the “plans”). These options and other
    awards generally vest in equal annual amounts over three to five
    years. The plans provide that options be granted at exercise
    prices not less than fair market value on the date the option is
    granted and options are adjusted for such changes as stock
    splits and stock dividends. Generally, options are exercisable
    for periods of no more than ten years after date of grant.
    Certain of the plans permit the granting of awards in the form
    of stock, stock appreciation rights, stock awards and cash
    awards in addition to stock options. Upon exercise in the case
    of stock options, grant in the case of restricted stock or
    vesting in the case of performance based contingent stock
    grants, shares are issued out of available treasury shares.

The Company on occasion will issue restricted stock or grant
    restricted stock units to certain key employees. In 2010 and
    2008, the Company granted restricted stock units of 138 and 60,
    respectively. The 2010 and 2008 grants had weighted average
    grant date fair values of $41.93 and $34.61. In 2009 the Company
    did not issue any restricted stock or restricted stock units.
    These shares or units are nontransferable and subject to
    forfeiture for periods prescribed by the Company. These awards
    are valued at the market value of the underlying common stock at
    the date of grant and are subsequently amortized over the
    periods during which the restrictions lapse, generally between
    three and five years. There were no forfeitures in 2010 or 2008.
    In 2009, the Company had forfeitures of 2 units granted in
    2008. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized
    compensation expense, net of forfeitures, on these awards of
    $1,209, $768 and $661, respectively. At December 26, 2010,
    the amount of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
    restricted stock units is $5,583 and the weighted average period
    over which this will be expensed is 53 months. In 2010, the
    Company issued 12 shares related to restricted stock
    granted in 2007. At December 26, 2010, the Company has
    unvested and unissued awards outstanding of 196 shares with
    a weighted average grant date fair value of $39.77.

In 2010, 2009 and 2008, as part of its annual equity grant to
    executive officers and certain other employees, the Compensation
    Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors approved the
    issuance of contingent stock performance awards (the “Stock
    Performance Awards”). These awards provide the recipients
    with the ability to earn shares of the Company’s common
    stock based on the Company’s achievement of stated
    cumulative diluted earnings per share and cumulative net revenue
    targets over the three fiscal years ended December 2012,
    December 2011, and December 2010 for the 2010, 2009 and 2008
    awards, respectively. Each Stock Performance Award has a target
    number of shares of common stock associated with such award
    which may be earned by the recipient if the Company achieves the
    stated diluted earnings per share and revenue targets. The
    ultimate amount of the award may vary, depending on actual
    results. Awards prior to 2010 may vary from 0% to 125% of
    the target number of shares. Awards for 2010 may vary from
    0% to 200% of the target number of shares. The Compensation
    Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors has
    discretionary power to reduce the amount of the award regardless
    of whether the stated targets are met.

Stock Performance Awards granted during 2010, 2009 and 2008
    include 80, 116 and 100 shares related to the 2008, 2007
    and 2006 awards, respectively, reflecting an increase in the
    ultimate amount of the awards issued or expected to be issued
    based on the Company’s actual results during the
    performance period. These shares are excluded from the
    calculation of the weighted average grant-date fair value of
    Stock Performance Awards granted during 2010, 2009 and 2008.

During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized $17,144,
    $15,361 and $17,422, respectively, of expense relating to these
    awards. If minimum targets, as detailed under the award, are not
    met, no additional compensation cost will be recognized and any
    previously recognized compensation cost will be reversed. These
    awards were valued at the market value of the underlying common
    stock at the dates of grant and are being expensed over the
    three fiscal years ended December 2012, December 2011, and
    December 2010 for the 2010, 2009 and 2008 awards, respectively.
    At December 26, 2010, the amount of total unrecognized
    compensation cost related to these awards is approximately
    $22,901 and the weighted average period over which this will be
    expensed is 27 months.

In 2010, the Company granted awards to certain employees
    consisting of cash settled restricted stock units. Under these
    awards, the recipients are granted restricted stock units that
    vest over three years. At the end of the vesting period, the
    fair value of those shares will be paid in cash to the
    recipient. Under no circumstances will shares be issued. The
    Company accounts for these awards as a liability and marks the

With respect to the 11,392 outstanding options and 6,256 options
    exercisable at December 26, 2010, the weighted average
    remaining contractual life of these options was 4.24 years
    and 3.17 years, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value
    of the options outstanding and exercisable at December 26,
    2010 was $260,960 and $159,503, respectively.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model in
    determining the fair value of stock options. The weighted
    average fair value of options granted in fiscal 2010, 2009 and
    2008 was $7.24, $5.16 and $4.46, respectively. The fair value of
    each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted
    average assumptions used for grants in the fiscal years 2010,
    2009 and 2008:

The intrinsic values, which represent the difference between the
    fair market value on the date of exercise and the exercise price
    of the option, of the options exercised in fiscal 2010, 2009 and
    2008 were $80,783, $4,044 and $83,747, respectively.

At December 26, 2010, the amount of total unrecognized
    compensation cost related to stock options was $20,012 and the
    weighted average period over which this will be expensed is
    23 months.

In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company granted 36, 60 and
    36 shares of common stock, respectively, to its
    non-employee members of its Board of Directors. Of these shares,
    the receipt of 30 shares from the 2010 grant,
    51 shares from the 2009 grant and 30 shares from the
    2008 grant has been deferred to the date upon which the
    respective director ceases to be a member of the Company’s
    Board of Directors. These awards were valued at the market value
    of the underlying common stock at the date of grant and vested
    upon grant. In connection with these grants, compensation cost
    of $1,440, $1,365 and $1,260 was recorded in selling,
    distribution and administration expense in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Pension,
    Postretirement and Postemployment Benefits

Pension
    and Postretirement Benefits

The Company recognizes an asset or liability for each of its
    defined benefit pension plans equal to the difference between
    the projected benefit obligation of the plan and the fair value
    of the plan’s assets. Actuarial gains and losses and prior
    service costs that have not yet been included in income are
    recognized in the balance sheet in AOCE.

Expenses related to the Company’s defined benefit and
    defined contribution plans for 2010, 2009 and 2008 were
    approximately $34,900, $41,100 and $33,400, respectively. Of
    these amounts, $29,000, $27,600 and $32,400, respectively,
    related to defined contribution plans in the United States and
    certain international affiliates. The remainder of the expense
    relates to defined benefit plans discussed below.

United
    States Plans

Prior to 2008, substantially all United States employees were
    covered under at least one of several non-contributory defined
    benefit pension plans maintained by the Company. Benefits under
    the two major plans which principally cover non-union employees,
    were based primarily on salary and years of service. One of
    these major plans is funded. Benefits under the remaining plans
    are based primarily on fixed amounts for specified years of
    service. Of these remaining plans, the plan covering union
    employees is also funded. In 2007, for the two major plans
    covering its non-union employees, the Company froze benefits
    being accrued effective at the end of December 2007.

At December 26, 2010, the measurement date, the projected
    benefit obligations of the funded plans were in excess of the
    fair value of the plans’ assets in the amount of $25,086
    while the unfunded plans of the Company had an aggregate
    accumulated and projected benefit obligation of $38,281. At
    December 27, 2009, the projected benefit obligations of the
    funded plans were in excess of the fair value of the plans’
    assets in the amount of $19,395 while the unfunded plans of the
    Company had an aggregate accumulated and projected benefit
    obligation of $36,448.

Hasbro also provides certain postretirement health care and life
    insurance benefits to eligible employees who retire and have
    either attained age 65 with 5 years of service or
    age 55 with 10 years of service. The cost of providing
    these benefits on behalf of employees who retired prior to 1993
    is and will continue to be substantially borne by the Company.
    The cost of providing benefits on behalf of substantially all
    employees who retire after 1992 is borne by the employee. The
    plan is not funded.

In fiscal 2011, the Company expects amortization of unrecognized
    net losses and unrecognized prior service cost related to its
    defined benefit pension plans of $4,623 and $198, respectively,
    to be included as a component of net periodic benefit cost. The
    Company expects amortization of unrecognized net losses and
    unrecognized prior service cost in 2011 related to its
    postretirement plan of $38 and $29, respectively.

Level 1 assets primarily consist of investments traded on
    active markets that are valued using published closing prices.
    The Plans’ Level 2 assets primarily consist of
    investments in common and collective trusts as



HASBRO,

    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

well as other private investment funds that are valued using the
    net asset values provided by the trust or fund. Although these
    trusts and funds are not traded in an active market with quoted
    prices, the investments underlying the net asset value are based
    on quoted prices. The Company believes that these investments
    could be sold at amounts approximating the net asset values
    provided by the trust or fund. The Plans’ Level 3
    assets consist of an investment in a hedge fund which is valued
    using the net asset value provided by the investment manager as
    well as an investment in a public-private investment fund which
    is also valued using the net asset value provided by the
    investment manager. The hedge fund contains investments in
    financial instruments that are valued using certain estimates
    which are considered unobservable in that they reflect the
    investment manager’s own assumptions about the inputs that
    market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
    The public-private investment fund, which is included in fixed
    income investments above, invests in commercial mortgage-backed
    securities and non-agency residential mortgage-backed
    securities. These securities are valued using certain estimates
    which are considered unobservable in that they reflect the
    investment manager’s own assumptions about the inputs that
    market participants would use in pricing the asset. The Company
    believes that the net asset value is the best information
    available for use in the fair value measurement of this fund. Of
    the activity in Level 3 assets for 2010 $7,126 relates to
    purchases of investments, $2,102 relates to capital
    distributions and $8,276 relates to the return on plan assets
    still held at December 26, 2010.

Hasbro’s two major funded plans (the “Plans”) are
    defined benefit pension plans intended to provide retirement
    benefits to participants in accordance with the benefit
    structure established by Hasbro, Inc. The Plans’ investment
    managers, who exercise full investment discretion within
    guidelines outlined in the Plans’ Investment Policy, are
    charged with managing the assets with the care, skill, prudence
    and diligence that a prudent investment professional in similar
    circumstance would exercise. Investment practices, at a minimum,
    must comply with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
    (ERISA) and any other applicable laws and regulations.

The Plans’ asset allocations are structured to meet a
    long-term targeted total return consistent with the ongoing
    nature of the Plans’ liabilities. The shared long-term
    total return goal, presently 8.00%, includes income plus
    realized and unrealized gains

and/or

losses on the Plans’ assets. Utilizing generally accepted
    diversification techniques, the Plans’ assets, in aggregate
    and at the individual portfolio level, are invested so that the
    total portfolio risk exposure and risk-adjusted returns best
    meet the Plans’ long-term obligations to employees. The
    Company’s asset allocation includes alternative investment
    strategies designed to achieve a modest absolute return in
    addition to the return on an underlying asset class such as bond
    or equity indices. These alternative investment strategies may
    use derivatives to gain market returns in an efficient and
    timely manner; however, derivatives are not used to leverage the
    portfolio beyond the market value of the underlying assets.
    These alternative investment strategies are included in other
    equity and fixed income asset categories at December 26,
    2010 and December 27, 2009. Plan asset allocations are
    reviewed at least quarterly and rebalanced to achieve target
    allocation among the asset categories when necessary.

The Plans’ investment managers are provided specific
    guidelines under which they are to invest the assets assigned to
    them. In general, investment managers are expected to remain
    fully invested in their asset class with further limitations of
    risk as related to investments in a single security, portfolio
    turnover and credit quality.

With the exception of the alternative investment strategies
    mentioned above, the Plans’ Investment Policy restricts the
    use of derivatives associated with leverage or speculation. In
    addition, the Investment Policy also restricts investments in
    securities issued by Hasbro, Inc. except through index-related
    strategies (e.g. an S&P 500 Index Fund)

and/or

commingled funds. In addition, unless specifically approved by
    the Investment Committee (which is comprised of members of
    management, established by the Board to manage and control
    pension plan assets), certain securities, strategies, and
    investments are ineligible for inclusion within the Plans.

For 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company measured the assets and

If the health care cost trend rate were increased one percentage
    point in each year, the accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation at December 26, 2010 and the aggregate of the
    benefits earned during the period and the interest cost would
    have both increased by approximately 4%.

Hasbro works with external benefit investment specialists to
    assist in the development of the long-term rate of return
    assumptions used to model and determine the overall asset
    allocation. Forecast returns are based on the combination of
    historical returns, current market conditions and a forecast for
    the capital markets for the next 5-7 years. All asset class
    assumptions are within certain bands around the long-term
    historical averages. Correlations are based primarily on
    historical return patterns.

International
    Plans

Pension coverage for employees of Hasbro’s international
    subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate,
    through separate defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
    At December 26, 2010 and December 27, 2009, the
    defined benefit plans had total projected benefit obligations of
    $76,900 and $70,328, respectively, and fair values of plan
    assets of $68,762 and $69,724, respectively. Substantially all
    of the plan assets are invested in equity and fixed income
    securities. The pension expense related to these plans was
    $2,333, $4,903, and $3,226 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
    In fiscal 2011, the Company expects amortization of $65 of prior
    service costs, $349 of unrecognized net losses and $(2) of
    unrecognized transition obligation to be included as a component
    of net periodic benefit cost.

Expected benefit payments under the international defined
    benefit pension plans for the five years subsequent to 2010 and
    in the aggregate for the five years thereafter are as follows:
    2011: $1,528; 2012: $1,740; 2013: $1,906; 2014: $2,138; 2015:
    $2,423; and 2016 through 2020: $16,095.

Postemployment
    Benefits

Hasbro has several plans covering certain groups of employees,
    which may provide benefits to such employees following their
    period of active employment but prior to their retirement. These
    plans include certain severance plans which provide benefits to
    employees involuntarily terminated and certain plans which
    continue the Company’s health and life insurance
    contributions for employees who have left Hasbro’s employ
    under terms of its long-term disability plan.

Leases

Hasbro occupies certain offices and uses certain equipment under
    various operating lease arrangements. The rent expense under
    such arrangements, net of sublease income which is not material,
    for 2010, 2009 and 2008 amounted to $41,911, $43,562 and
    $43,634, respectively.

Minimum rentals, net of minimum sublease income, which is not
    material, under long-term operating leases for the five years
    subsequent to 2010 and in the aggregate thereafter are as
    follows: 2011: $28,200; 2012: $24,261; 2013: $20,966; 2014:
    $10,040; 2015: $6,911; and thereafter: $8,549.

All leases expire prior to the end of 2020. Real estate taxes,
    insurance and maintenance expenses are generally obligations of
    the Company. It is expected that, in the normal course of
    business, leases that expire will be renewed or replaced by
    leases on other properties; thus, it is anticipated that future
    minimum lease commitments will not be less than the amounts
    shown for 2010.

In addition, Hasbro leases certain facilities which, as a result
    of restructurings, are no longer in use. Future costs relating

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Hasbro uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the
    impact of currency rate fluctuations on firmly committed and
    projected future foreign currency transactions. These

over-the-counter

contracts, which hedge future currency requirements related to
    purchases of inventory and other cross-border transactions not
    denominated in the functional currency of the business unit, are
    primarily denominated in United States and Hong Kong dollars,
    Euros and British pound sterling and are entered into with a
    number of counterparties, all of which are major financial
    institutions. The Company believes that a default by a single
    counterparty would not have a material adverse effect on the
    financial condition of the Company. Hasbro does not enter into
    derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

The Company also has warrants to purchase common stock that
    qualify as derivatives. For additional information related to
    these warrants see note 12. In addition, the Company is
    also party to several interest rate swap agreements to adjust
    the amount of long-term debt subject to fixed interest rates.
    For additional information related to these interest rate swaps
    see note 9.

Cash
    Flow Hedges

Hasbro uses foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the
    impact of currency rate fluctuations on firmly committed and
    projected future foreign currency transactions. All of the
    Company’s designated foreign currency forward contracts are
    considered to be cash flow hedges. These instruments hedge a
    portion of the Company’s currency requirements associated
    with anticipated inventory purchases and other cross-border
    transactions in 2011 and 2012.

At December 26, 2010 and December 27, 2009, the
    notional amounts and fair values of the Company’s foreign
    currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedging
    instruments were as follows:

The Company has a master agreement with each of its
    counterparties that allows for the netting of outstanding
    forward contracts. The fair values of the Company’s foreign
    currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are
    recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at December 26,
    2010 and December 27, 2009 as follows:

During the years ended December 26, 2010 and

    other comprehensive earnings to net earnings of $17,912 and
    $21,240, respectively. Of the amount reclassified in 2010 and
    2009, $13,249 and $17,173 were reclassified to cost of sales and
    $4,663 and $4,785 were reclassified to royalty expense,
    respectively. In addition, net losses of $(132) and $(718) were
    reclassified to earnings as a result of hedge ineffectiveness in
    2010 and 2009, respectively.

Undesignated
    Hedges

The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts
    to minimize the impact of changes in the fair value of
    intercompany loans due to foreign currency changes. Due to the
    short-term nature of the derivative contracts involved, the
    Company does not use hedge accounting for these contracts. As of
    December 26, 2010, the total notional amount of the
    Company’s undesignated derivative instruments was $89,191.

At December 26, 2010 and December 27, 2009, the fair
    values of the Company’s undesignated derivative financial
    instruments are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current
    assets in the consolidated balance sheet as follows:

    for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, relating to the change in
    fair value of such derivatives, substantially offsetting gains
    and losses from the change in fair value of intercompany loans
    to which the contracts relate.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Hasbro had unused open letters of credit and related instruments
    of approximately $179,592 and $135,277 at December 26, 2010
    and December 27, 2009, respectively. Included in this
    amount is $114,890 of bonds related to a tax assessment in
    Mexico. See note 10 for additional discussion.

The Company enters into license agreements with inventors,
    designers and others for the use of intellectual properties in
    its products. Certain of these agreements contain provisions for
    the payment of guaranteed or minimum royalty amounts. Under
    terms of existing agreements as of December 26, 2010,
    Hasbro may, provided the other party meets their contractual
    commitment, be required to pay amounts as follows: 2011:
    $39,513; 2012: $46,353; 2013: $85,675; 2014: $14,775; 2015:
    $14,375; and thereafter: $86,250. At December 26, 2010, the
    Company had $112,922 of prepaid royalties, $17,922 of which are
    included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and
    $95,000 of which are included in other assets.

In addition to the above commitments, certain of the above
    contracts impose minimum marketing commitments on the Company.
    The Company may be subject to additional royalty guarantees
    totaling $140,000 that are not included in the amounts above
    that may be payable during the next five to six years contingent
    upon the quantity and types of theatrical movie releases.

In connection with the Company’s agreement to form a joint
    venture with Discovery, the Company is obligated to make future
    payments to Discovery under a tax sharing agreement. The Company
    estimates these payments may total approximately $135,600 and
    may range from approximately $6,000 to $7,500 per year during
    the period 2011 to 2015, and approximately $102,000 in aggregate
    for all years occurring thereafter. These payments are
    contingent upon the Company having sufficient taxable income to
    realize the expected tax deductions of certain amounts related
    to the joint venture.

At December 26, 2010, the Company had approximately
    $340,007 in outstanding purchase commitments.

Hasbro is party to certain legal proceedings, as well as certain
    asserted and unasserted claims. Amounts accrued, as well as the
    total amount of reasonably possible losses with respect to such
    matters, individually and in the aggregate, are not deemed to be
    material to the consolidated financial statements.

Segment
    Reporting

Segment
    and Geographic Information

Hasbro is a worldwide leader in children’s and family
    leisure time products and services, including toys, games and
    licensed products ranging from traditional to high-tech and
    digital. In 2009 the Company changed the name of the Other
    segment to Entertainment and Licensing. The Company’s
    segments now are (i) U.S. and Canada,
    (ii) International, (iii) Entertainment and Licensing,
    and (iv) Global Operations.

The U.S. and Canada segment includes the marketing and
    selling of boys’ action figures, vehicles and playsets,
    girls’ toys, electronic toys and games, plush products,
    preschool toys and infant products, electronic interactive
    products, toy-related specialty products, traditional board
    games and puzzles, DVD-based games and trading card and
    role-playing games within the United States and Canada. Within
    the International segment, the Company markets and sells both
    toy and certain game products in markets outside of the
    U.S. and Canada, primarily the European, Asia Pacific, and
    Latin and South American regions. The Global Operations segment
    is responsible for manufacturing and sourcing finished products
    for the Company’s U.S. and Canada and International
    segments. The Company’s Entertainment and Licensing segment
    includes the Company’s lifestyle licensing, digital gaming,
    movie, television and online entertainment operations.

Segment performance is measured at the operating profit level.
    Included in Corporate and eliminations are certain corporate
    expenses, the elimination of intersegment transactions and
    certain assets benefiting more

than one segment. Intersegment sales and transfers are reflected
    in management reports at amounts approximating cost. Certain
    shared costs, including global development and marketing
    expenses, are allocated to segments based upon foreign exchange
    rates fixed at the beginning of the year, with adjustments to
    actual foreign exchange rates included in Corporate and
    eliminations. The accounting policies of the segments are the
    same as those referenced in note 1.

Results shown for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 are not
    necessarily those which would be achieved if each segment was an
    unaffiliated business enterprise.

Certain intangible assets, primarily goodwill, which benefit
    multiple operating segments are reflected as Corporate assets
    for segment reporting purposes. In accordance with accounting
    standards related to impairment testing, these amounts have been
    allocated to the reporting unit which benefits from their use.
    In addition, allocations of certain expenses related to these
    assets to the individual operating segments are done at the
    beginning of the year based on budgeted amounts. Any differences
    between actual and budgeted amounts are reflected in the
    Corporate segment.

Other
    Information

Hasbro markets its products primarily to customers in the retail
    sector. Although the Company closely monitors the
    creditworthiness of its customers, adjusting credit policies and
    limits as deemed appropriate, a substantial portion of its
    customers’ ability to discharge amounts owed is generally
    dependent upon the overall retail economic environment.

Sales to the Company’s three largest customers, Wal-Mart
    Stores, Inc., Target Corporation and Toys “R” Us,
    Inc., amounted to 23%, 12% and 11%, respectively, of
    consolidated revenues during 2010, 25%, 13% and



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

11%, respectively, of consolidated net revenues during 2009 and
    25%, 12% and 10% during 2008. These net revenues were primarily
    within the U.S. and Canada segment.

Hasbro purchases certain components used in its manufacturing
    process and certain finished products from manufacturers in the
    Far East. The Company’s reliance on external sources of
    manufacturing can be shifted, over a period of time, to
    alternative sources of supply for products it sells, should such
    changes be necessary. However, if the Company were prevented
    from obtaining products from a substantial number of its current
    Far East suppliers due to political, labor or other factors
    beyond its control, the Company’s operations would be
    disrupted, potentially for a significant period of time, while
    alternative sources of product were secured. The imposition of
    trade sanctions, quotas or other protectionist measures by the
    United States or the European Union against a class of products
    imported by Hasbro from, or the loss of “normal trade
    relations” status by, China could significantly increase
    the cost of the Company’s products imported into the
    United States or Europe.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as
    defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
    “Exchange Act”), that are designed to ensure that
    information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
    reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
    Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is
    accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,
    including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure. The Company carried out an evaluation,
    under the supervision and with the participation of the
    Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures as of December 26, 2010.
    Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and
    procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls
    and procedures were effective.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting, as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

promulgated under the Exchange Act. Hasbro’s internal
    control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance
    regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
    preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles. Hasbro’s management assessed the effectiveness
    of its internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 26, 2010. In making its assessment, Hasbro’s
    management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in
    “Internal Control-Integrated Framework”. Based on this
    assessment, Hasbro’s management concluded that, as of
    December 26, 2010, its internal control over financial
    reporting is effective based on those criteria. Hasbro’s
    independent registered public accounting firm has issued an
    audit report on internal control over financial reporting, which
    is included herein.



Report
    of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Hasbro, Inc.:

We have audited Hasbro, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 26, 2010, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Hasbro, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 26, 2010, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Hasbro, Inc. and subsidiaries as
    of December 26, 2010 and December 27, 2009, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations,
    shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal
    years in the three-year period ended December 26, 2010, and
    our report dated February 23, 2011 expressed an unqualified
    opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Changes
    in Internal Controls

There were no changes in the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting, as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

promulgated under the Exchange Act, during the quarter ended
    December 26, 2010, that have materially affected, or are
    reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.

The Company is currently in the process of a multi-year global
    initiative to upgrade its existing SAP system and implement
    enhanced global business practices. During the second quarter of
    2010, the SAP upgrade was completed for the U.S. and Canada
    operations. There were no significant changes in the
    Company’s internal controls over financial reporting
    resulting from the completion of this phase of the project. The
    next phase of the project consists of the implementation of the
    SAP upgrade in Europe along with enhanced global business
    practices in the Company’s European business, including
    consolidation of various activities to improve efficiency. This
    phase is anticipated to be completed during the first quarter of
    2011.

Report
    of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Hasbro, Inc.:

Under date of February 23, 2011, we reported on the
    consolidated balance sheets of Hasbro, Inc. and subsidiaries as
    of December 26, 2010 and December 27, 2009, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations,
    shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal
    years in the three-year period ended December 26, 2010,
    which are included in the

Form 10-K

for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2010. In connection
    with our audits of the aforementioned consolidated financial
    statements, we also audited the related consolidated financial
    statement schedule of Valuation and Qualifying Accounts in the

Form 10-K.

This financial statement schedule is the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on this financial statement schedule based on our audits.

In our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.
