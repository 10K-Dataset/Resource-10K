Item 1.

Business

General
    Development and Description of Business and Business
    Segments

Except as expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise
    requires, as used herein, “Hasbro”, the
    “Company”, “we”, or “us”, means
    Hasbro, Inc., a Rhode Island corporation organized on
    January 8, 1926, and its subsidiaries. Unless otherwise
    specifically indicated, all dollar or share amounts herein are
    expressed in thousands of dollars or shares, except for per
    share amounts.

Overview

We are a worldwide leader in children’s and family leisure
    time and entertainment products and services, including the
    design, manufacture and marketing of games and toys. Both
    internationally and in the U.S., our widely recognized core
    brands such as PLAYSKOOL, TONKA, SUPER SOAKER, MILTON BRADLEY,
    PARKER BROTHERS, TIGER, and WIZARDS OF THE COAST provide what we
    believe are the highest quality play experiences in the world.
    Our offerings encompass a broad variety of games, including
    traditional board, card, hand-held electronic, trading card,
    roleplaying, plug and play and DVD games, as well as electronic
    learning aids and puzzles. Toy offerings include boys’
    action figures, vehicles and playsets, girls’ toys,
    electronic toys, plush products, preschool toys and infant
    products, children’s consumer electronics, electronic
    interactive products, creative play and toy related specialty
    products. In addition, we license certain of our trademarks,
    characters and other property rights to third parties for use in
    connection with consumer promotions and for the sale of
    noncompeting toys and non-toy products.

In managing our business in 2005, we focused on two major areas,
    toys and games. Organizationally, our principal segments were
    U.S. Toys, Games, and International. In 2005, our
    U.S. Toys segment engaged in the development, marketing and
    selling of toy and children’s consumer electronic products
    in the United States. Our Games segment included the
    development, manufacturing, marketing and selling of games, as
    well as electronic learning aids and puzzles, in the United
    States. Within the International segment, we developed,
    manufactured, marketed and sold both toy and game products in

non-U.S. markets.

Financial information with respect to our segments and
    geographic areas is included in note 15 to our financial
    statements, which are included in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

Beginning in 2006 we restructured our business by combining the
    existing U.S. Toys and Games segments and adding to this
    combined segment our Mexican and Canadian operations, which were
    formerly managed as part of the International segment. Under
    this new structure, all of our toy and game business in the
    United States, Canada, and Mexico is managed as one
    North American segment under common leadership. We believe
    this restructuring will allow us to better focus our efforts in
    the development, marketing and selling of products in this North
    American market. In 2006 we will continue to have an
    International segment, comprised of our operations in Europe and
    the Asia Pacific and Latin American regions. The International
    segment will manage toy and game sales, and the related
    marketing and certain development activity outside of North
    America. In addition, the Hasbro Properties Group outlicenses
    our intellectual property to third parties on a worldwide basis.

In 2006, our Global Operations segment will be responsible for
    arranging product manufacturing and sourcing for all of our
    other segments.

The remainder of this business discussion is formatted
    consistently with our 2005 segment structure.

U.S. Toys

The U.S. Toys segment’s strategy in 2005 was based on
    growing core brands through innovation and reinvention,
    introducing new initiatives driven by consumer and marketplace
    insights and leveraging opportunistic toy lines and licenses. In
    order to meet shifting consumer dynamics, the execution of this
    strategy centered on consumer insights, which are used to inform
    and motivate our product development. We use consumer insights
    to drive innovation across our business. In recent years, a
    major source of innovation



has been technology, which the U.S. Toys segment has used
    to address the issue of “children getting older
    younger.” This represents the trend whereby children at
    younger ages are shifting from traditional toys to electronic
    devices, such as MP3 players, cell phones and other
    entertainment and lifestyle products. Major 2005 brands and
    products included STAR WARS, VIDEONOW, I-DOG, PLAYSKOOL, MY
    LITTLE PONY, NERF, TRANSFORMERS and LITTLEST PET SHOP. In the
    U.S. Toys segment, our products are organized into one of
    four categories, boys’ toys, girls’ toys, preschool,
    and tween products.

Our boys’ toys include a wide range of core properties such
    as G.I. JOE and TRANSFORMERS action figures, and the TONKA line
    of trucks and interactive toys. Other products include
    entertainment-based licensed products based on popular movie and
    television characters, such as STAR WARS toys and accessories.
    In 2005 our STAR WARS based line of toys and accessories was
    extremely successful, bolstered by the theater and DVD release
    of STAR WARS EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH. As boys
    become more sophisticated in their evaluation of entertainment,
    our boys’ toys are increasingly competing with video games
    for boys’ attention. Role-playing is a vital part of our
    boys’ toys business. As demonstrated in 2005 through the
    introduction of STAR WARS LIGHT SABERS and the DARTH VADER
    VOICE-CHANGER, we seek to develop products that will allow boys
    to look and act like their favorite characters. In the action
    figure area, a key part of our strategy focuses on the
    importance of reinforcing the storyline associated with these
    products through the use of media-based entertainment, primarily
    television. In 2006, both G.I. JOE and TRANSFORMERS will
    continue to have television programming to assist in providing
    exposure to the characters and story lines associated with these
    products. In addition, a key factor in the success of 2005 was
    the performance of our sports action brands such as NERF
    products. We expect the momentum in this line to continue in
    2006 as we introduce innovative new products such as NERF
    SHOWTIME HOOPS. In January 2006, we completed a licensing
    agreement with Marvel Entertainment, Inc. and its subsidiary
    Marvel Characters, Inc. to produce action figures and other toys
    and games based on their library of intellectual property,
    including SPIDERMAN and the FANTASTIC 4. We expect certain
    products related to this license to begin shipping late in 2006,
    with the full extent of the licensed products being recognized
    in 2007 and thereafter.

In our girls’ toy category, we seek to provide a
    traditional and wholesome play experience. Girls’ toys
    include the MY LITTLE PONY and LITTLEST PET SHOP lines as well
    as the EASY BAKE oven. In 2005, the MY LITTLE PONY brand was
    supported by the DVD release of MY LITTLE PONY: A VERY MINTY
    CHRISTMAS. In 2006, we plan to support this brand with two new
    DVD releases. The LITTLEST PET SHOP will build on its strong
    reintroduction in 2005 with new electronic play patterns in
    2006. We also plan to enter a new category in 2006, large dolls,
    with the reintroduction of BABY ALIVE, a doll incorporating
    animatronic technology.

Our preschool toy category encompasses a range of products for
    preschoolers in the various stages of development, from infant
    to kindergarteners. Our preschool products include a portfolio
    of core brands marketed primarily under the PLAYSKOOL trademark.
    The PLAYSKOOL line includes such well-known products as MR.
    POTATO HEAD, WEEBLES, SIT ‘N SPIN and GLOWORM, along
    with a successful line of infant toys including STEP START
    WALK N‘ RIDE, 2-IN-1 TUMMY TIME GYM and BUSY BALL
    POPPER. Through our AGES & STAGES system, we seek to
    provide consumer friendly information that assists parents in
    understanding the developmental milestones their children will
    encounter as well as the role each PLAYSKOOL product can play in
    helping children to achieve these developmental milestones. In
    2006, a major focus of our preschool line will be on one of the
    fastest growing segments of the preschool toy market, electronic
    learning aids, with the planned introduction of two new product
    lines: ION, an interactive educational gaming system, and TJ
    BEARYTALES, an electronic story telling bear. In addition, in
    2006, the PLAY-DOH brand will be celebrating its

th

anniversary
    and will be supported by a variety of promotional programs.

Our tweens toy category generally markets products under the
    TIGER ELECTRONICS brand and seeks to target those children who
    have outgrown traditional toys. The age group targeted by this
    category is generally 8 to 12 years old. In recent years,
    we have used our consumer insights and electronic innovation to
    develop a strong line of products focusing on this target
    audience. Our major tweens toys product lines in 2005 included
    VIDEONOW, I-DOG and CHATNOW. As demonstrated through our 2005
    launch of

I-DOG,



an interactive pet that acts as an accessory to an MP3 player,
    we seek to draw on the popularity of electronic trends in our
    tween product offerings. In 2006, we plan to continue offering
    innovative new products in this category, including ZOOMBOX.

Games

Our Games segment strategy focused on providing product
    innovation based on consumer insights, including an
    understanding of consumer attitudes and behaviors. We market our
    games and puzzles under several well known core brands,
    including MILTON BRADLEY, PARKER BROTHERS, TIGER GAMES, AVALON
    HILL, and WIZARDS OF THE COAST. Major 2005 products included
    TRIVIAL PURSUIT, CANDY LAND, MONOPOLY and MAGIC: THE GATHERING.

The MILTON BRADLEY, PARKER BROTHERS, TIGER GAMES and AVALON HILL
    brand portfolios consist of a broad assortment of games for
    children, tweens, families and adults. Core game items include
    MONOPOLY, BATTLESHIP, GAME OF LIFE, SCRABBLE, CHUTES AND
    LADDERS, CANDY LAND, TROUBLE, MOUSETRAP, OPERATION, HUNGRY
    HUNGRY HIPPOS, CONNECT FOUR, TWISTER, YAHTZEE, JENGA, SIMON,
    CLUE, SORRY!, RISK, BOGGLE, and TRIVIAL PURSUIT, as well as a
    line of jigsaw puzzles for children and adults, including BIG
    BEN and CROXLEY. In 2005 we added to our puzzle portfolio
    through the acquisition of the assets and product lines of
    Wrebbit Inc., a creator and manufacturer of innovative puzzles,
    including three dimensional puzzles marketed under the PUZZ-3D
    brand. We seek to keep our core brands relevant through
    sustained marketing programs as well as by offering consumers
    new ways to experience them. In 2006 we plan to continue this
    strategy through the introduction of core brand extensions such
    as BIG TROUBLE, YAHTZEE TURBO and TRIVIAL PURSUIT 80’S
    EDITION. Another way we seek to keep our core brands fresh is
    through co-branding of some of our most popular lines. By
    developing and introducing products such as CANDY LAND: DORA
    EDITION and MONOPOLY: STAR WARS EDITION, we are able to extend
    our brand franchises by appealing to a broader consumer base. In
    2006 we plan to continue to capitalize on popular licensed
    franchises including DISNEY, the SIMPSONS, STAR WARS and
    NICKLEODEON.

In addition to our core brands strategy, the games segment seeks
    to extend beyond traditional board games by developing
    technology-based platforms that reflect evolving consumer
    lifestyles. In 2005 we continued to offer many DVD extensions of
    our traditional games, such as our CANDY LAND DVD game. In 2006
    we plan to continue this focus on innovative new games through
    the introduction of TWISTER DANCE, a DVD-based game, GIGA PETS
    COMBO, a combination of a hand-held and plug n’ play
    game, as well a variety of other new technology-enabled games.
    We have a series of marketing initiatives designed to encourage
    game play among a wide variety of audiences, including
    promotional programs designed to support the family games and
    adult games lines, respectively. In 2005 we introduced our GAMES
    MAKE GREAT GIFTS marketing campaign, which we plan to continue
    in 2006.

WIZARDS OF THE COAST offers a variety of successful trading card
    and roleplaying games, including MAGIC: THE GATHERING and
    DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. In addition to maintaining our
    focus on the success of MAGIC: THE GATHERING in both trading
    cards and online formats, our 2006 strategy will also focus on
    expanding our successful miniatures lines and our publishing
    business. The miniatures lines of pre-painted plastic characters
    are designed to enhance the roleplaying experience. We will also
    seek to continue the success of WIZARDS OF THE COAST’s
    publishing endeavors that have produced several books that were
    included on the New York Times Bestseller list in recent years.
    In 2006 we will seek to expand our marketing to younger readers
    by encouraging them to read through the placement of books in
    schools and libraries throughout the U.S.

International

In addition to our business in the United States, in 2005 we
    operated in more than 25 countries, selling a representative
    range of the toy and game products marketed in the United
    States, together with some items that are sold only
    internationally. In 2005 all of our international operations
    were managed under our International segment. In addition to
    growing core brands and leveraging opportunistic toy lines and
    licenses,



we seek to grow our international business by continuing to
    expand into Eastern Europe and emerging markets in Asia and
    Latin America. Key international brands for 2005 included MILTON
    BRADLEY and PARKER BROTHERS games, STAR WARS, ACTION MAN, FURBY,
    FURREAL FRIENDS, BEYBLADE, PLAY-DOH, PLAYSKOOL, MONOPOLY, and
    MAGIC: THE GATHERING. In 2006 our Canadian and Mexican
    operations are being moved into our new North American segment
    along with the U.S. Toys and Games segments. Our other
    international operations, primarily in Europe, the Asia Pacific
    region and Latin America, will be managed as separate geographic
    units under common leadership within our International segment.

Other
    Segments

In our Operations segment, we source production of substantially
    all of our toy products and certain of our game products through
    unrelated manufacturers in various Far East countries,
    principally China, using a Hong Kong based subsidiary for
    quality control and order coordination purposes. See
    “Manufacturing and Importing” below for more details
    concerning overseas manufacturing. In 2006 our Global Operations
    segment will continue to source product for our marketing and
    sales subsidiaries, and is expected to also manage our
    manufacturing operations in North America and Europe.

Our other segment, the Hasbro Properties Group, generates
    revenue through the out-licensing worldwide of certain of our
    intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and
    merchandising uses in businesses which do not compete directly
    with our own product offerings.

Other
    Information

To further extend our range of products in the various segments
    of our business, we have Hong Kong operations that sell our toy
    and game products directly to retailers, primarily on a direct
    import basis. These sales are reflected in the revenue of the
    related segment where the customer resides.

Certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale
    in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct
    business presence.

During the 2005 fiscal year, revenues generated from the sale of
    STAR WARS products produced under our license with Lucas
    Licensing and Lucasfilm were approximately $494,000, which was
    16% of our consolidated net revenues in 2005. No other line of
    products constituted 10% or more of our consolidated net
    revenues in 2005. No individual line of products accounted for
    10% or more of our consolidated net revenues during our 2004
    fiscal year. During the 2003 fiscal year, revenues from our
    BEYBLADE line of products were 11% of our consolidated net
    revenues. No other line of products constituted 10% or more of
    our consolidated revenues in 2003.

Working
    Capital Requirements

Our working capital needs are primarily financed through cash
    generated from operations and, when necessary, short-term
    borrowings and proceeds from our accounts receivable
    securitization program. Our borrowings and the use of our
    accounts receivable program generally reach peak levels during
    the fourth quarter of each year. This corresponds to the time of
    year when our receivables also generally reach peak levels as
    part of the production and shipment of product in preparation
    for the holiday shipping season. Our historical revenue pattern
    is one in which the second half of the year is more significant
    to our overall business than the first half and, within the
    second half of the year, the fourth quarter is the more
    prominent. The strategy of retailers has been to make a higher
    percentage of their purchases of toy and game products within or
    close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer buying season,
    which includes Christmas. This trend has become more pronounced
    over the past few years and we expect that it will continue.

The toy and game business is also characterized by customer
    order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of
    differences each year in the degree of consumer acceptance of a
    product line, product availability, marketing strategies and
    inventory policies of retailers, the dates of theatrical
    releases of major motion pictures for which we have product
    licenses, and changes in overall economic conditions. As a
    result, comparisons of our unshipped orders on any date with
    those at the same date in a prior year are not



necessarily indicative of our sales for that year. Moreover,
    quick response inventory management practices now being used
    result in fewer orders being placed significantly in advance of
    shipment with more orders being placed for immediate delivery.
    Unshipped orders at January 29, 2006 and January 23,
    2005 were approximately $123,000 and $131,000, respectively. It
    is a general industry practice that orders are subject to
    amendment or cancellation by customers prior to shipment. The
    backlog of unshipped orders at any date in a given year can also
    be affected by programs that we may employ to incent customers
    to place orders and accept shipments early in the year. This
    method is a general industry practice. The programs that we plan
    to employ to promote sales in 2006 are substantially the same as
    those we employed in 2005. These are primarily fixed programs,
    for which a customer may qualify based on purchases of Company
    products throughout the year.

Historically, we commit to the majority of our inventory
    production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a
    given year prior to the peak third and fourth quarter retail
    selling season. Our accounts receivable increase during the
    third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases
    to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season. Due to
    the concentrated timeframe of this selling period, payments for
    these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in
    the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the
    subsequent year. The timing difference between expenses paid and
    revenues collected makes it necessary for us to borrow varying
    amounts during the year. During 2005 and 2004, we utilized cash
    from our operations, proceeds from our accounts receivable
    securitization program, borrowing under our secured amended and
    restated revolving credit agreement as well as our uncommitted
    lines of credit to meet our cash flow requirements.

Royalties,
    Research and Development

Our success is dependent on innovation through the continuing
    development of new products and the redesign of existing items
    for continued market acceptance. In 2005, 2004, and 2003, we
    spent $150,586, $157,162, and $143,183, respectively, on
    activities relating to the development, design and engineering
    of new products and their packaging (including items brought to
    us by independent designers) and on the improvement or
    modification of ongoing products. Much of this work is performed
    by our internal staff of designers, artists, model makers and
    engineers.

In addition to the design and development work performed by our
    own staff, we deal with a number of independent toy and game
    designers for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy
    and game manufacturers. Rights to such designs and ideas, when
    acquired by us, are usually exclusive and the agreements require
    us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item.
    These designer royalty agreements, in some cases, also provide
    for advance royalties and minimum guarantees.

We also produce a number of toys under trademarks and copyrights
    utilizing the names or likenesses of characters from movies,
    television shows and other entertainment media, for whose rights
    we compete with other toy and game manufacturers. Licensing fees
    for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net
    sales of the item. Licenses for the use of characters are
    generally exclusive for specific products or product lines in
    specified territories. In many instances, advance royalties and
    minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements. In
    2005, 2004, and 2003, we incurred $247,283, $223,193, and
    $248,423, respectively, of total royalty expense. A portion of
    this expense relates to amounts paid in prior years as royalty
    advances. Our royalty expenses in any given year vary depending
    upon the timing of movie releases and other entertainment. In
    2005, royalty expense increased due to the release of STAR WARS
    EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH, and the corresponding
    increase of our sales of STAR WARS licensed products. We have
    $37,107 of prepaid royalties, which are a component of prepaid
    expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet. Included
    in other assets is $89,408 representing the long-term portion of
    royalty advances already paid. As further detailed in
    Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations, based on
    contracts in effect at December 25, 2005, the Company may
    be required to pay approximately $66,770 of minimum guaranteed
    royalties at various times from 2006 through 2010. Amounts paid
    and advances to be paid relate to anticipated revenues from
    licensed properties to be sold in the years 2006 through 2018.
    In addition, in January 2006, we entered into a five-year
    arrangement with Marvel Entertainment, Inc., and its subsidiary
    Marvel Characters, Inc. (“Marvel”), to develop
    products based on



certain Marvel properties, including SPIDERMAN, for retail sale
    beginning on January 1, 2007. The agreement requires us to
    make guaranteed minimum payments in the amount of $205,000. Of
    this $205,000 in guaranteed payment, $100,000 was paid in
    February 2006, $70,000 is expected to be paid in 2007 upon the
    release of SPIDERMAN 3 and the remainder is to be paid upon the
    release of SPIDERMAN 4, whose release date is yet to be
    determined.

Marketing
    and Sales

Our products are sold nationally and internationally to a broad
    spectrum of customers, including wholesalers, distributors,
    chain stores, discount stores, mail order houses, catalog
    stores, department stores and other traditional retailers, large
    and small, as well as internet-based

“e-tailers.”

Our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our
    products. Remaining sales are generated by independent
    distributors who sell our products, for the most part, in areas
    of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct
    presence. We maintain showrooms in New York and selected other
    major cities worldwide as well as at many of our subsidiary
    locations. Although we had more than 2,500 customers in the
    United States and Canada during 2005, including specialty
    retailers carrying trading card games and toy-related products,
    there has been significant consolidation at the retail level
    over the last several years in our industry, which we expect to
    continue. As a result, the majority of our sales are to large
    chain stores, distributors and wholesalers. While the
    consolidation of customers provides us with certain benefits,
    such as potentially more efficient product distribution and
    other decreased costs of sales and distribution, this
    consolidation also creates additional risks to our business
    associated with a major customer having financial difficulties
    or reducing its business with us. In addition, customer
    concentration may decrease the prices we are able to obtain for
    some of our products and reduce the number of products we would
    otherwise be able to bring to market. During 2005, sales to our
    three largest customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Toys ‘R Us,
    Inc. and Target Corporation, represented 24%, 12% and 12%,
    respectively, of consolidated net revenues, and sales to our top
    five customers accounted for approximately 53% of our
    consolidated net revenues.

We advertise many of our toy and game products extensively on
    television. Generally our advertising highlights selected items
    in our various product groups in a manner designed to promote
    the sale of not only the selected item, but also other items we
    offer in those product groups as well. We introduce many of our
    new products to major customers during the year prior to the
    year of introduction of such products for retail sale. In
    addition, we showcase many of our new products in New York City
    at the time of the American International Toy Fair in February.

In 2005 we spent $366,371 on advertising, promotion and
    marketing programs compared to $387,523 in 2004 and $363,876 in
    2003.

Manufacturing
    and Importing

During 2005 substantially all of our products were manufactured
    in third party facilities in the Far East as well as in our two
    owned facilities located in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts and
    Waterford, Ireland.

Most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials
    such as plastic, paper and cardboard, although certain products
    also make use of electronic components. All of these materials
    are readily available but may be subject to significant
    fluctuations in price. We generally enter into agreements with
    suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish
    prices for that year. For this reason, we are generally
    insulated, in the short-term, from increases in the prices of
    raw materials. However, severe increases in the prices of any of
    these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers
    during the year. Our manufacturing processes and those of our
    vendors include injection molding, blow molding, spray painting,
    printing, box making and assembly. We purchase most of the
    components and accessories used in our toys and certain of the
    components used in our games, as well as some finished items,
    from manufacturers in the United States and in other countries.
    However, the countries of the Far East, and particularly the
    People’s Republic of China, constitute the largest
    manufacturing center of toys in the world and the substantial
    majority of our toy products are manufactured in China. The 1996
    implementation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
    reduced or eliminated customs duties on many of the products
    imported by us.



We believe that the manufacturing capacity of our third party
    manufacturers, together with our own facilities, as well as the
    supply of components, accessories and completed products which
    we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers, are adequate to
    meet the anticipated demand in 2006 for our products. Our
    reliance on designated external sources of manufacturing could
    be shifted, over a period of time, to alternative sources of
    supply for our products, should such changes be necessary or
    desirable. However, if we were to be prevented from obtaining
    products from a substantial number of our current Far East
    suppliers due to political, labor or other factors beyond our
    control, our operations and our ability to obtain products would
    be disrupted while alternative sources of product were secured.
    The imposition of trade sanctions by the United States or the
    European Union against a class of products imported by us from,
    or the loss of “normal trade relations” status by, the
    People’s Republic of China could significantly disrupt our
    operations and increase the cost of our products imported into
    the United States or Europe.

We purchase dies and molds, principally from independent United
    States and international sources.

Competition

We are a worldwide leader in the design, manufacture and
    marketing of games and toys, but our business is highly
    competitive. We compete with several large toy and game
    companies in our product categories, as well as many smaller
    United States and international toy and game designers,
    manufacturers and marketers. Competition is based primarily on
    meeting consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality
    and play value of our products. To a lesser extent, competition
    is also based on product pricing.

In addition to contending with competition from other toy and
    game companies, in our business we must deal with the phenomena
    that many children have been moving away from traditional toys
    and games at a younger age. We refer to this as “children
    getting older younger.” As a result, our products not only
    compete with the offerings of other toy and game manufacturers,
    but we must compete, particularly in meeting the demands of
    older children, with the entertainment offerings of many other
    companies, such as makers of video games and consumer electronic
    products.

The volatility in consumer preferences with respect to family
    entertainment and low barriers to entry continually create new
    opportunities for existing competitors and

start-ups

to
    develop products which compete with our toy and game offerings.

Employees

At December 25, 2005, we employed approximately 5,900
    persons worldwide, approximately 3,300 of whom were located in
    the United States.

Trademarks,
    Copyrights and Patents

We seek to protect our products, for the most part, and in as
    many countries as practical, through registered trademarks,
    copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is
    available, cost effective, and meaningful. The loss of such
    rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result
    in significant harm to our business, although the loss of such
    protection for a number of significant items might have such an
    effect.

Government
    Regulation

Our toy and game products sold in the United States are subject
    to the provisions of The Consumer Product Safety Act (the
    “CPSA”), The Federal Hazardous Substances Act (the
    “FHSA”), The Flammable Fabrics Act (the
    “FFA”), and the regulations promulgated thereunder. In
    addition, certain of our products, such as the mixes for our
    EASY BAKE ovens, are also subject to regulation by the Food and
    Drug Administration.

The CPSA empowers the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the
    “CPSC”) to take action against hazards presented by
    consumer products, including the formulation and implementation
    of regulations and uniform safety standards. The CPSC has the
    authority to seek to declare a product “a banned hazardous
    substance” under the CPSA and to ban it from commerce. The
    CPSC can file an action to seize and condemn



an “imminently hazardous consumer product” under the
    CPSA and may also order equitable remedies such as recall,
    replacement, repair or refund for the product. The FHSA provides
    for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that are
    banned.

Consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and
    cities within the United States and in Canada, Australia and
    Europe. We maintain laboratories that employ testing and other
    procedures intended to maintain compliance with the CPSA, the
    FHSA, the FFA, international standards, and our own standards.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that
    our products are or will be hazard free. Any material product
    recall could have an adverse effect on our results of operations
    or financial condition, depending on the product and scope of
    the recall, and could negatively affect sales of our other
    products, as well.

The Children’s Television Act of 1990 and the rules
    promulgated thereunder by the United States Federal
    Communications Commission, as well as the laws of certain
    foreign countries, place limitations on television commercials
    during children’s programming.

We maintain programs to comply with various United States
    federal, state, local and international requirements relating to
    the environment, plant safety and other matters.

Volatility
    of consumer preferences, combined with the high level of
    competition and low barriers to entry in the family
    entertainment industry make it difficult to maintain the
    long-term success of existing product lines or consistently
    introduce successful new products. In addition, an inability to
    develop and introduce planned new products and product lines in
    a timely manner may damage our business.

The family entertainment business is a fashion industry. Our
    success is critically dependent upon the consumer appeal of our
    products, principally games and toys. Our failure to
    successfully anticipate, identify and react to children’s
    interests and the preferences in family entertainment could
    significantly lower sales of our products and harm our
    profitability.

A decline in the popularity of our existing products and product
    lines, or the failure of our new products and product lines to
    achieve and sustain market acceptance, could significantly lower
    our sales and operating margins, which would harm our
    profitability, business and financial condition. In our
    industry, it is important to identify and offer what are
    considered to be the “hot” toys and games on
    children’s wish lists. Our continued success will depend on
    our ability to develop, market and sell popular toys, games and
    children’s electronic products which are sought after by
    both children and their parents. We seek to achieve and maintain
    market popularity for our products through the redesign and
    extension of our existing family entertainment properties in
    ways that capture consumer interest and imagination and remain
    relevant in today’s world, and by developing, introducing
    and gaining customer interest for new family entertainment
    products. This process involves anticipating and extending
    successful play patterns and identifying entertainment concepts
    and properties that appeal to children’s imaginations.
    However, consumer preferences with respect to family
    entertainment are continuously changing and are difficult to
    anticipate. Individual family entertainment products and
    properties generally, and high technology products in
    particular, often have short consumer life cycles.

Not only must we address rapidly changing consumer tastes and
    interests but we face competitors who are also constantly
    monitoring consumer tastes, seeking ideas which will appeal to
    consumers and introducing new products that compete with our
    products for consumer purchasing. In addition to existing
    competitors, the barriers to entry for new participants in the
    family entertainment industry are low. New participants with a
    popular product idea or property can gain access to consumers
    and become a significant source of competition for our products.

The challenge of developing and offering products that are
    sought after by children is compounded by the trend of children
    “getting older younger”. By this we mean that children
    are losing interest in traditional toys at younger ages and, as
    a result, at younger and younger ages, our products compete with
    the offerings of video game suppliers, consumer electronics
    companies and other businesses outside of the traditional toy
    and game industry.

In addition to designing and developing products based on our
    own brands, we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and
    interests by producing products based on popular entertainment
    properties developed by other parties and licensed to us. The
    success of entertainment properties released theatrically for
    which we have a license, such as STAR WARS related products, can
    significantly affect our revenues. If we produce a line of
    products based on a movie or television series, the success of
    the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of
    consumer interest in the associated products we are offering. In
    addition, competition in our industry for access to
    entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure,
    maintain, and renew popular licenses to entertainment products
    on beneficial terms, if at all, and to attract and retain the
    talented employees necessary to design, develop and market
    successful products based on these properties. The loss of
    ownership rights granted pursuant to any of our licensing
    agreements could harm our business and competitive position.

There is no guarantee that:

1) Any of our current products or product lines will
    continue to be popular;

2) Any property for which we have a significant license
    will achieve or sustain popularity;

3) Any new products or product lines we introduce will be
    considered interesting to consumers and achieve an adequate
    market acceptance;



4) Any new product’s life cycle will be sufficient to
    permit us to profitably recover development, manufacturing,
    marketing, royalties (including royalty advances and guarantees)
    and other costs of producing and selling the product; or

5) We will be able to manufacture, source and ship new or
    continuing products in a timely basis to meet constantly
    changing consumer demands, a risk that is heightened by our
    customers’ compressed shipping schedules and the
    seasonality of our business.

In developing new products and product lines, we have
    anticipated dates for the associated product introductions. When
    we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a
    particular product or product line at a certain time in the
    future those expectations are based on completing the associated
    development and implementation work in accordance with our
    currently anticipated development schedule. Unforeseen delays or
    difficulties in the development process, or significant
    increases in the planned cost of development, may cause the
    introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or,
    in some situations, may cause a product introduction to be
    discontinued. Similarly, the success of our products is often
    dependent on the timelines and effectiveness of related
    advertising and media efforts. Television programming, movie and
    DVD releases, comic book releases, and other media efforts are
    often critical in generating interest in our products. Not only
    our efforts, but the efforts of third parties, heavily impact
    the launch dates and success of these media efforts. When we say
    that products or brands will be supported by certain media
    releases, those statements are based on our current plans and
    expectations. Unforeseen factors may delay these media releases
    or even lead to their cancellation. Any delay or cancellation of
    planned product development work, introductions, or media
    support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our
    business.

Our
    business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results
    will depend, in large part, on our sales during the relatively
    brief holiday season. Further, this seasonality is increasing,
    as large retailers become more efficient in their control of
    inventory levels through quick response inventory management
    techniques.

Sales of our family entertainment products at retail are
    extremely seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring
    during the period from September through December in
    anticipation of the holiday season, including Christmas. This
    seasonality is increasing, as large retailers become more
    efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick
    response inventory management techniques. These customers are
    timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers,
    such as us, closer to the time of purchase by consumers. For
    toys, games and other family entertainment products which we
    produce a majority of retail sales occur in the fourth quarter,
    close to the holiday season. As a consequence, the majority of
    our sales to our customers occur in the period from September
    through December, as our customers do not want to maintain large
    on-hand inventories throughout the year to meet consumer demand.
    While these techniques reduce a retailer’s investment in
    inventory, they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill
    orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of
    inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier.

The limited inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or
    delay retail sales, resulting in lower revenues for us. If we or
    our customers determine that one of our products is more popular
    at retail than was originally anticipated, we may not have
    sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional product to
    fully capture consumer interest in the product. Additionally,
    the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter
    time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve
    tight and compressed shipping schedules, which also may reduce
    our sales and harm our financial performance. This seasonal
    pattern requires significant use of working capital, mainly to
    manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year
    prior to the holiday season, and requires accurate forecasting
    of demand for products during the holiday season in order to
    avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing
    excess inventory of products that are less popular with
    consumers. Our failure to accurately predict and respond to
    consumer demand, resulting in our underproducing popular items

and/or

overproducing less popular items, would reduce our total sales
    and harm our results of operations. In addition, as a result of
    the seasonal nature of our business, we would be significantly
    and adversely affected, in a manner disproportionate to the
    impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the
    year, by unforeseen events, such as a terrorist attack or
    economic shock, that harm the retail environment or consumer
    buying patterns during our key selling season, or by events,
    such



as strikes or port delays, that interfere with the shipment of
    goods, particularly from the Far East, during the months leading
    up to the holiday purchasing season.

The
    continuing consolidation of our retail customer base means that
    economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing policies of
    our major customers could have a significant impact on
    us.

We depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell
    the majority of our products. For the fiscal year ended
    December 25, 2005, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Toys ‘R Us,
    Inc., and Target Corporation accounted for approximately 24%,
    12% and 12%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenues and
    our five largest customers, including Wal-Mart, Toys ‘R Us
    and Target, in the aggregate accounted for approximately 53% of
    our consolidated net revenues. While the consolidation of our
    customer base may provide certain benefits to us, such as
    potentially more efficient product distribution and other
    decreased costs of sales and distribution, this consolidation
    also means that if one or more of our major customers were to
    experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us,
    cease doing business with us, significantly reduce the amount of
    their purchases from us or return substantial amounts of our
    products, it could harm our business, financial condition and
    results of operations. Increased concentration among our
    customers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate
    higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower
    gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were
    less consolidation among our customers. In addition, the
    bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our
    significant retail customers could negatively impact our
    revenues and bad debt expense.

We may
    not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed
    material has less market appeal than expected or if sales
    revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out
    the minimum guaranteed royalties.

An important part of our business involves obtaining licenses to
    produce products based on various theatrical releases, such as
    STAR WARS movies. The license agreements we enter to obtain
    these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty
    guarantees that may be substantial, and in some cases may be
    greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual
    sales, which could result in write-offs of such amounts that
    would harm our results of operations. At December 25, 2005,
    we had $126,515 of prepaid royalties, $37,107 of which are
    included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and
    $89,408 of which are included in other assets. Under the terms
    of existing contracts as of December 25, 2005, we are
    required to pay future minimum guaranteed royalties and other
    licensing fees totaling approximately $66,770. Acquiring or
    renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed
    royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable,
    which may result in losing licenses we currently hold when they
    become available for renewal, or missing business opportunities
    for new licenses. As a licensee, we have no guaranty that a
    particular brand will translate into successful toy or game
    products.

In addition to contracts existing as of the end of our 2005
    fiscal year, in January 2006, we entered into a license
    arrangement with Marvel Entertainment, Inc., and its subsidiary
    Marvel Characters, Inc. This license arrangement, which grants
    us the right to produce certain products based on Marvel’s
    characters for five years for retail sales beginning in 2007,
    requires us to make guaranteed minimum payments in the amount of
    up to $205,000. There is no guarantee that we will sell enough
    licensed merchandise under the agreement to earn-out the
    $205,000 in guaranteed payments and make a profit.

We anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie
    releases will make it increasingly difficult for us to sell
    licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead
    our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order
    to minimize inventory risk. Furthermore, there can be no
    assurance that a successful brand will continue to be successful
    or maintain a high level of sales in the future. In the event
    that we are not able to acquire or maintain advantageous
    licenses, our revenues and profits may be harmed.



Our
    substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the
    United States subject us to risks associated with international
    operations.

We operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries
    outside the United States. For the year ended December 25,
    2005, our net revenues from international customers comprised
    approximately 40% of our total consolidated net revenues. We
    expect our sales to international customers to continue to
    account for a significant portion of our revenues. Additionally,
    we utilize third-party manufacturers located principally in the
    Far East and we have a manufacturing facility in Ireland. These
    sales and manufacturing operations are subject to the risks
    associated with international operations, including:

1) Currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations;

2) Limitations, including taxes, on the repatriation of
    earnings;

3) Political instability, civil unrest and economic
    instability;

4) Greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property
    rights and weaker laws protecting such rights;

5) Complications in complying with laws in varying
    jurisdictions and changes in governmental policies;

6) Natural disasters and the greater difficulty and expense
    in recovering therefrom;

7) Transportation delays and interruptions; and

8) The imposition of tariffs.

Our reliance on external sources of manufacturing can be
    shifted, over a period of time, to alternative sources of
    supply, should such changes be necessary. However, if we were
    prevented from obtaining products or components for a material
    portion of our product line due to political, labor or other
    factors beyond our control, our operations would be disrupted
    while alternative sources of products were secured. In
    particular, as the majority of our toy products, in addition to
    certain other products, are manufactured in the People’s
    Republic of China, health conditions and other factors affecting
    social and economic activity in China and affecting the movement
    of people and products into and from China to our major markets,
    including North America and Europe, could have a significant
    negative impact on our operations. Factors that could negatively
    affect our business include a potential revaluation of the
    Chinese yuan, which may result in an increase in the cost of
    producing products in China, or increases in labor costs and
    difficulties in moving products manufactured in the Far East
    through the ports on the western coast of North America. Also,
    the imposition of trade sanctions by the United States or the
    European Union against a class of products imported by us from,
    or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with,
    the People’s Republic of China, could significantly
    increase our cost of products imported into the United States or
    Europe and harm our business. Because of the importance of our
    international sales and international sourcing of manufacturing
    to our business, our financial condition and results of
    operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks
    described above were to occur.

Part
    of our strategy for remaining relevant to older children is to
    offer innovative children’s toy and game electronic
    products. The margins on many of these products are lower than
    more traditional toys and games and such products may have a
    shorter lifespan than more traditional toys and games. As a
    result, increasing sales of children’s toy and game
    electronic products may lower our overall operating margins and
    produce more volatility in our business.

As children have grown “older younger” and have become
    interested in more and more sophisticated and adult products,
    such as videogames and consumer electronics, at younger and
    younger ages, we have needed to work even harder to keep our
    products relevant for these consumers. One initiative we have
    been pursuing to capture the interest of older children is to
    offer innovative children’s electronic toys and games.
    Examples of such products in the last few years include
    VIDEONOW, CHATNOW, MISSION PAINTBALL and I-DOG. These products,
    if successful, can be an effective way for us to connect with
    tween consumers and increase



sales. However, children’s electronics, in addition to the
    risks associated with our other family entertainment products,
    also face certain additional risks.

Our costs for producing electronic products tend to be higher
    than for many of our other more traditional products, such as
    board games and action figures. The ability to reflect higher
    costs in higher prices is constrained by heavy competition in
    consumer electronics. As a consequence, our margins on the sales
    of electronic products tend to be lower than for more
    traditional products. In addition, the pace of change in product
    offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics area is
    potentially even greater than for our other products. This pace
    of change means that the window in which a product can achieve
    and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter.

Market
    conditions, including commodity and fuel prices, public health
    conditions and other third party conduct could negatively impact
    our margins and our other business initiatives.

Economic and public health conditions, including factors that
    impact the strength of the retail market and retail demand, or
    our ability to manufacture and deliver products, can have a
    significant impact on our business. The success of our family
    entertainment products is dependant on consumer purchasing of
    those products. Consumers may not purchase our products because
    the products do not capture consumer interest and imagination.
    But consumer spending on our products can also be harmed by
    factors that negatively impact consumer’s budgets
    generally, and which are not due to our product offerings.
    Significant increases in the costs of other products which are
    required by consumers, such as gasoline and home heating fuels,
    may reduce household spending on entertainment products we
    offer. In addition, rising fuel and raw material prices, for
    components such as resin, or increased transportation costs, may
    increase our costs for producing and transporting our products,
    which in turn may reduce our margins and harm our business.

In addition, general economic conditions and employment levels
    can impact demand for our products. Economic conditions were
    significantly harmed by the September 11, 2001 terrorist
    attacks and could be similarly affected by any future attacks.
    Economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by wars and
    other conflicts, increases in critical commodity prices, or the
    prospect of such events. Such a weakened economic and business
    climate, as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a
    climate, could harm our sales and profitability.

Other conditions, such as the unavailability of electrical
    components, may impede our ability to manufacture, source and
    ship new and continuing products on a timely basis. Additional
    factors outside of our control could delay or increase the cost
    of implementing our business initiatives and product plans or
    alter our actions and reduce actual results. For example, work
    stoppages, slowdowns or strikes, or the occurrence or threat of
    wars or other conflicts, could impact our ability to manufacture
    or deliver product, resulting in increased costs

and/or

lost
    sales for our products.

Our
    business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may
    not be able to protect such rights successfully. In addition, we
    have a material amount of acquired product rights which, if
    impaired, would result in a reduction of our
    income.

Our intellectual property, including our license agreements and
    other agreements that establish our ownership rights and
    maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property, are
    of great value. We rely on a combination of trade secret,
    copyright, trademark, patent and other proprietary rights laws
    to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related
    to our brands. From time to time, third parties have challenged,
    and may in the future try to challenge, our ownership of our
    intellectual property. In addition, our business is subject to
    the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or
    infringing on our intellectual property rights. We may need to
    resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property
    rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of
    resources. Our failure to protect our intellectual property
    rights could harm our business and competitive position. Much of
    our intellectual property has been internally developed and has
    no carrying value on our balance sheet. As of December 25,
    2005, we had approximately $609,678 of acquired product and
    licensing rights included in other assets on our balance sheet.
    Declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed
    products may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of
    the related assets and



could result in an impairment charge. Reduction in our net
    income caused by impairment charges could harm our financial
    results.

We may
    not realize the anticipated benefits of future acquisitions or
    those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their
    realization.

Although we have not made any major acquisitions in the last few
    years, acquisitions have been a significant part of our
    historical growth and have enabled us to further broaden and
    diversify our product offerings. In making acquisitions, we
    target companies that we believe offer attractive family
    entertainment products. However, we cannot be certain that the
    products of companies we may acquire in the future will achieve
    or maintain popularity with consumers. In some cases, we expect
    that the integration of the product lines of the companies that
    we acquire into our operations will create production, marketing
    and other operating synergies which will produce greater revenue
    growth and profitability and, where applicable, cost savings,
    operating efficiencies and other advantages. However, we cannot
    be certain that these synergies, efficiencies and cost savings
    will be realized. Even if achieved, these benefits may be
    delayed or reduced in their realization. In other cases, we
    acquire companies that we believe have strong and creative
    management, in which case we plan to operate them autonomously
    rather than fully integrating them into our operations. We
    cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these
    companies will continue to work for us after the acquisition or
    that they will continue to develop popular and profitable
    products or services.

From
    time to time, we are involved in litigation, arbitration or
    regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which
    could entail significant expense.

As is the case with many large multinational corporations, we
    are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations,
    litigation and arbitration disputes. Because the outcome of
    litigation, arbitration and regulatory investigations is
    inherently difficult to predict, it is possible that the outcome
    of any of these matters could entail significant expense for us
    and harm our business.

We
    rely on external financing, including our credit facilities and
    accounts receivable securitization facility, to fund our
    operations. If we were unable to obtain or service such
    financing, or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were
    too burdensome, our business would be harmed.

Due to the seasonal nature of our business, in order to meet our
    working capital needs, particularly those in the third and
    fourth quarters, we rely on our revolving credit facility and
    our other credit facilities for working capital. We currently
    have an amended and restated revolving credit agreement, which
    provides for a $350,000 revolving credit facility. The credit
    agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth
    minimum cash flow and coverage requirements, and a number of
    other limitations, including restrictions on capital
    expenditures, investments, acquisitions, share repurchases,
    incurrence of indebtedness and dividend payments. These
    restrictive covenants may limit our future actions, and
    financial, operating and strategic flexibility. In addition, our
    financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our
    credit facility. Our performance and financial condition may not
    meet our original expectations, causing us to fail to meet such
    financial covenants. If we were unable to meet our financial
    covenants, or if we failed to comply with other covenants in our
    credit facility, we could face significant negative
    consequences, including loss of the ability to raise capital
    under these facilities to fund our operations.

As an additional source of working capital and liquidity, we
    currently have a $250,000 accounts receivable securitization
    program. Under this program, we sell on an ongoing basis,
    substantially all of our U.S. dollar denominated trade
    accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote special purpose
    entity. Under this facility, the special purpose entity is able
    to sell, on a revolving basis, undivided ownership interests in
    the eligible receivables to bank conduits. During the term of
    the facility, we must maintain certain performance ratios. If we
    fail to maintain these ratios, we could be prevented from
    accessing this cost-effective source of working capital and
    short-term financing.

We believe that our cash flow from operations, together with our
    cash on hand and access to existing credit facilities and our
    accounts receivable securitization facility, are adequate for
    current and planned needs



in 2006. However, our actual experience may differ from these
    expectations. Factors that may lead to a difference include, but
    are not limited to, the matters discussed herein, as well as
    future events that might have the effect of reducing our
    available cash balance, such as unexpected material operating
    losses or increased capital or other expenditures, as well as
    increases in inventory or accounts receivable that are
    ineligible for sale under our securitization facility, or future
    events that may reduce or eliminate the availability of external
    financial resources.

We also may choose to finance our capital needs, from time to
    time, through the issuance of debt securities. Our ability to
    issue such securities on satisfactory terms, if at all, will
    depend on the state of our business and financial condition, any
    ratings issued by major credit rating agencies, market interest
    rates, and the overall condition of the financial and credit
    markets at the time of the offering. The condition of the credit
    markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the
    past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Variations in
    these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt
    securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order
    to sell new debt securities. The failure to receive financing on
    desirable terms, or at all, could damage our ability to support
    our future operations or capital needs or engage in other
    business activities.

As of December 25, 2005, we had approximately
    $527.7 million of total principal amount of indebtedness
    outstanding. If we are unable to generate sufficient available
    cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to
    refinance such debt or face default. There is no guarantee that
    we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms, or at
    all. This total indebtedness includes $249,996 in aggregate
    principal amount of 2.75% senior convertible debentures
    that we issued in 2001. On December 1, 2011 and
    December 1, 2016, and upon the occurrence of certain
    fundamental corporate changes, holders of the 2.75% senior
    convertible debentures may require us to purchase their
    debentures. At that time, the purchase price may be paid in
    cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the two, at our
    discretion, provided that we will pay accrued and unpaid
    interest in cash. We may not have sufficient cash at that time
    to make the required repurchases and may be required to settle
    in shares of common stock.

We previously issued warrants that provide the holder with an
    option through January 2008 to sell all of these warrants to us
    for a price to be paid, at our election, of either $100,000 in
    cash or $110,000 in our common stock, such stock being valued at
    the time of the exercise of the option. Should we be required to
    settle these warrants under this option, we believe that we will
    have adequate funds to settle in cash if necessary. However, we
    may not have sufficient funds at that time to make the required
    payment and may be required to settle the warrants in stock.

As a
    manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational
    corporation, we are subject to various government regulations,
    violation of which could subject us to sanctions. In addition,
    we could be the subject of future product liability suits, which
    could harm our business.

As a manufacturer of consumer products, we are subject to
    significant government regulations under The Consumer Products
    Safety Act, The Federal Hazardous Substances Act, and The
    Flammable Fabrics Act. In addition, certain of our products are
    subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration. While
    we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with
    these acts, there can be no assurance that we will be in
    compliance in the future. Failure to comply could result in
    sanctions which could have a negative impact on our business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

In addition to government regulation, products that have been or
    may be developed by us may expose us to potential liability from
    personal injury or property damage claims by the users of such
    products. There can be no assurance that a claim will not be
    brought against us in the future. While we currently maintain
    product liability insurance coverage in amounts we believe
    sufficient for our business risks, we may not be able to
    maintain such coverage or such coverage may not be adequate to
    cover all potential claims. Moreover, even if we maintain
    sufficient insurance coverage, any successful claim could
    significantly harm our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

As a large, multinational corporation, we are subject to a host
    of governmental regulations throughout the world, including
    antitrust, customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott
    regulations and the Foreign Corrupt



Practices Act. Our failure to successfully comply with any such
    legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and
    other sanctions that could harm our business and financial
    condition.

We
    have a material amount of goodwill which, if it becomes
    impaired, would result in a reduction in our net
    income.

Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition
    accounted for using the purchase method exceeds the fair value
    of the net assets we acquire. Current accounting standards
    require that goodwill no longer be amortized but instead be
    periodically evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of
    the reporting unit. At December 25, 2005, approximately
    $467,061 or 14.1%, of our total assets represented goodwill.
    Declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our
    reporting units, which could result in a further write-down of
    our goodwill. Reductions in our net income caused by the
    write-down of goodwill could harm our results of operations.

Executive
    Summary

The Company earns revenue and generates cash through the sale of
    a variety of toy and game products. The Company sells these
    products both within the United States and in a number of
    international markets. While many of the Company’s products
    are based on brands the Company owns or controls, the Company
    also offers products which are licensed from outside inventors.
    The Company also licenses rights to produce products based on
    movie, television, music and other family entertainment
    properties, such as STAR WARS.

For the past several years, the Company has focused on growing
    core owned and controlled brands, developing new and innovative
    products which respond to market insights, and optimizing
    efficiencies within the Company to reduce costs, increase
    operating profits and strengthen its balance sheet. While the
    Company has sought to achieve a more sustainable revenue base by
    developing and maintaining its core brands and avoiding reliance
    on licensed entertainment properties, the Company continues to
    opportunistically enter into or leverage existing strategic
    licenses which complement its brands and leverage its key
    strengths.

The Company’s core brands represent Company-owned or
    Company-controlled brands, such as G.I. JOE, TRANSFORMERS,
    MY LITTLE PONY, MONOPOLY, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, PLAYSKOOL and
    TONKA, which the Company views as presenting potential to be
    successful over the long term. The Company has a large portfolio
    of owned and controlled brands, which can be introduced in new
    formats and platforms over time. These brands may also be
    further extended by pairing a licensed concept with a
    core-brand. By focusing on core brands, the Company is working
    to build a more consistent revenue stream and basis for future
    growth. However, the volatility of consumer preferences and the
    high level of competition in the toy and game industry make it
    challenging to maintain the long-term success of existing
    product lines and to consistently introduce successful new
    products.

In addition to its focus on core brands, the Company’s
    strategy also involves trying to meet ever-changing consumer
    preferences by identifying and offering innovative products
    based on market opportunities and insights. In 2005, the
    Company’s position as a leader in developing innovative
    electronic products for children was reinforced with the
    introduction of products such as I-DOG, VIDEONOW XP, ZOOMBOX and
    the reintroduction of an enhanced, interactive FURBY. The
    Company believes its strategy of focusing on the development of
    its core brands and continuing to identify innovative new
    products will help to prevent the Company from being dependent
    on the success of any one product line.

With the theatrical release of Lucasfilm’s STAR WARS
    EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH in May 2005, and the
    subsequent holiday season DVD release, sales of product related
    to the Company’s strategic STAR WARS license rose
    substantially in 2005. Aggregate net revenues from products
    associated with this license were approximately $494,000 in 2005
    and accounted for 16% of consolidated net revenues. Pairing this
    key licensed property with the Company’s ability to design
    and produce action figures, role playing toys, and games, as
    well as the ability to launch an integrated marketing campaign
    to promote the product globally, was the key to this line’s
    success. While the Company’s strategy has continued to
    focus on growing its core brands and developing innovative, new
    products, the Company will continue to evaluate and enter into
    arrangements to license properties when the Company believes it
    is economically attractive. In early 2006, the Company announced
    it entered into a license with Marvel Entertainment, Inc. and
    Marvel Characters, Inc. to produce toys and games based on
    Marvel’s portfolio of characters. While gross profits of
    theatrical entertainment-based products are generally higher
    than many of the Company’s other products, sales from



these products also incur royalty expenses payable to the
    licensor. Such royalties reduce the impact of these higher gross
    margins. In certain instances, such as with Lucasfilm’s
    STAR WARS, the Company may also incur amortization expense on
    property right based assets acquired from the licensor of such
    properties, further impacting profit made on these items.

The Company’s strategy in the last several years has also
    involved reducing fixed costs and increasing operating margins.
    The Company ended 2005 with a strong balance sheet. The Company
    has achieved its targeted debt to capitalization ratio and will
    continue making scheduled debt repayments.

In 2005, utilizing cash from operations, the Company reacquired
    the digital gaming rights on several of its core brands which
    had previously been licensed to a third party, and purchased the
    assets of Wrebbit Inc., a maker of innovative puzzles, which
    complement the Company’s current product portfolio. The
    Company will continue to evaluate acquisitions which may
    complement its current product offerings or allow it entry into
    an area which is adjacent to and complementary to the toy and
    game business.

As part of its continuous effort to focus on consumer demands,
    better anticipate the needs of its retail customers, provide a
    more integrated toy and game marketing plan, place a greater
    company-wide focus on its core brands and thereby improve its
    overall business, in January 2006 the Company announced that it
    has simplified and integrated its operating segment structure.
    The Company’s North American toy and games business will be
    managed under common leadership beginning in 2006, providing a
    combined focus on developing, marketing, and selling products in
    the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The International segment will
    consist of the Company’s European, Asia Pacific and Latin
    American marketing operations. The Company’s world-wide
    manufacturing and product sourcing operations will be managed
    through its Global Operations segment. The Hasbro Properties
    Group will continue to be responsible for the world-wide
    outlicensing of the Company’s intellectual properties and
    will work closely with the North American and International
    segments on the development and licensing of the Company’s
    brands. The remainder of this Discussion and Analysis is
    presented according to the 2005 segment structure under which
    the Company operated.

    include a cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax, of
    $(17,351), or $(.09) per diluted share, relating to the adoption
    of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150,
    “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
    Characteristics of Liabilities and Equity”

    2005 were $3,087,627 compared to $2,997,510 in 2004 and
    $3,138,657 in 2003. Most of the Company’s revenues and
    operating profits were derived from its three principal
    segments: U.S. Toys, Games and International, which are
    discussed in detail below.

U.S. Toys

U.S. Toys segment net revenues for the year ended
    December 25, 2005 increased 13% to $1,074,540 from $952,923
    in 2004. This increase is predominantly due to increased
    revenues from STAR WARS related products as the result of the
    theatrical and DVD releases of STAR WARS EPISODE III:
    REVENGE OF THE SITH in 2005. In addition to the increase in STAR
    WARS related revenues, 2005 U.S. Toys revenues were also
    positively impacted by the successful reintroduction of LITTLEST
    PET SHOP and FURBY products as well as increased sales of NERF
    products. These increases were partially offset by decreased
    sales of VIDEONOW and FURREAL FRIENDS products as well as the
    continued decline in BEYBLADE products. In addition, other
    boys’ toys products such as G.I. JOE and TRANSFORMERS were
    negatively impacted by the success of STAR WARS products.

U.S. Toys operating profit increased to $79,991 in 2005
    from $7,185 in 2004. The increase was due primarily to the
    increase in revenue. U.S. Toys gross profit was also
    positively impacted by the change in product mix with increased
    sales of high margin lines such as STAR WARS and LITTLEST PET
    SHOP products and decreased sales of VIDEONOW products which
    carry a lower gross margin. The increase in gross profit was
    partially offset by increased royalty and amortization expense
    resulting from increased sales of STAR WARS products. U.S. Toys
    product development costs decreased as the result of
    efficiencies gained from its realignment in 2004. This
    realignment streamlined the U.S. Toys workforce and moved
    certain product development outside of the U.S. Advertising
    expense also decreased for U.S. Toys in 2005 primarily



due to the high percentage of sales from STAR WARS products,
    which do not require as much advertising and promotion to raise
    awareness as an internally-developed product would.

U.S. Toys segment net revenues for the year ended
    December 26, 2004 decreased 10% to $952,923 from 2003. The
    results reflect an overall softness in the boys’ toy
    business, as demonstrated primarily by decreased sales of
    BEYBLADE, and to a lesser extent, lower sales of TRANSFORMERS
    and G.I. JOE products. Decreased sales of PLAYSKOOL and ZOIDS
    products also contributed to the overall decrease in revenues.
    These decreases were partially offset by increased sales of
    VIDEONOW products, increased shipments of MY LITTLE PONY
    products, which were reintroduced in the third quarter of 2003,
    and revenues from the new product launch of LAZER TAG. Net
    revenues in 2004 were also positively impacted by increased
    shipments of STAR WARS products over 2003.

The decrease in U.S. Toys’ operating profit to $7,185
    in 2004 from 2003, primarily relates to decreased gross profit
    as a result of the lower net revenues as well as a change in
    product mix, including the decline in sales of BEYBLADE products
    which carry a higher gross margin and increased sales of
    VIDEONOW hardware, which carry a lower gross margin. Competitive
    price pressures and customer sales allowances related to
    VIDEONOW also contributed to lower gross margin. Increased
    advertising expense related to core brands and new product
    introductions also contributed to the decline in operating
    profit. U.S. Toys’ 2004 operating profit was also
    impacted by charges of $6,900 associated with organizational and
    staffing changes made in December 2004. The decrease in
    operating profit was partially offset by decreased royalties,
    driven by lower sales of BEYBLADE products, as well as lower
    selling, distribution, and administration expenses as a result
    of a combination of lower sales activity and the Company’s
    cost reduction initiatives.

Games

Games segment net revenues for the year ended December 25,
    2005 decreased 8% to $730,635 from 2004. The decrease in
    revenues primarily reflects decreased revenues from trading card
    games, primarily DUEL MASTERS and MAGIC: THE GATHERING. The
    decreased revenues also reflect a reduction in board game sales
    primarily due to lower revenues from TRIVIAL PURSUIT, which had
    higher revenues in 2004 as a result of the release of TRIVIAL
    PURSUIT 1990’S EDITION. Revenues were positively impacted
    by STAR WARS revenues, primarily the plug and play LIGHT
    SABER BATTLE game, as well as increased sales of CANDY LAND
    products as a result of core brand extensions including CANDY
    LAND: DORA EDITION and the CANDY LAND DVD game.

Games segment operating profit decreased 50% in 2005 to $69,477
    from 2004. The decrease in operating profit is primarily due to
    decreased gross profit due to the decline in revenues and
    specifically, the decline in trading card games, which have a
    high gross margin. Games segment operating profit was also
    negatively impacted by a loss of approximately $23,000 in the
    electronic games category, which included charges associated
    with inventory obsolescence and customer allowances related to
    plug and play games.

Games segment net revenues for the year ended December 26,
    2004 decreased slightly by 1% to $796,032 from 2003. The
    decrease in revenues was primarily due to decreased sales of
    board games. Partially offsetting this decrease were increased
    revenues from products in the electronic and pre-school
    categories including strong sales of ELEFUN and

WHAC-A-MOLE.

Revenues from trading card games increased slightly with sales
    of DUEL MASTERS, which was introduced in the fourth quarter of
    2003 offsetting decreased revenues from other trading card
    games, including MAGIC: THE GATHERING, which had one less
    release in 2004 than in 2003.

Games segment operating profit decreased 21% to $137,628 in 2004
    from 2003. The decrease reflects lower gross margin as a result
    of a change in the mix of trading card game revenue, higher
    product development and royalty expenses associated with DVD
    games, and increased advertising expense.

International

International segment net revenues for the year ended
    December 25, 2005 increased by 3% to $1,231,761 from 2004.
    The increase in revenues was primarily the result of increased
    sales of STAR WARS products in



2005 and, to a lesser extent, the successful reintroduction of
    LITTLEST PET SHOP and FURBY products and the introduction of
    B-DAMAN products. These increases were partly offset by
    decreased sales of BEYBLADE and ACTION MAN products as well as
    decreased sales of FURREAL FRIENDS and VIDEONOW products.
    Revenues for board games grew internationally in 2005, while the
    Company experienced decreased revenues in its trading card
    games, primarily DUEL MASTERS and MAGIC: THE GATHERING.
    International net revenues were negatively impacted by currency
    translation of approximately $700 as a result of the stronger
    U.S. dollar.

International operating profit increased 5% to $148,135 in 2005
    from 2004. Increased gross profit as a result of increased
    revenues was partially offset by higher amortization and royalty
    expenses as a result of the higher sales of licensed products,
    primarily STAR WARS products, in 2005. International operating
    profit was negatively impacted by $2,913 due to the translation
    of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar.

International segment net revenues increased slightly by 1% to
    $1,194,630 in 2004 from 2003. International segment
    2004 net revenues were positively impacted by currency
    translation of approximately $78,000 as the result of the weaker
    U.S. dollar. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign
    exchange, International net revenues decreased 6% in local
    currency for the year ended December 26, 2004. The decrease
    in local currency revenue was primarily the result of lower
    sales of BEYBLADE products, and, to a lesser extent, decreased
    sales of ACTION MAN. These decreases were partially offset by
    increased revenues from MY LITTLE PONY products, which were
    introduced in the third quarter of 2003, and higher sales of
    FURREAL FRIENDS, DUEL MASTERS, and VIDEONOW products. To a
    lesser extent, 2004 revenues were also positively impacted by
    increased sales of core brand products, including PLAYSKOOL and
    MONOPOLY products, as well as TRIVIAL PURSUIT products including
    TRIVIAL PURSUIT 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION.

International segment operating profit increased significantly
    by 54% to $140,784 in 2004 from 2003. International gross
    profits and operating profits were positively impacted by the
    cessation of manufacturing at the Company’s Valencia, Spain
    facility at the end of 2003. Operating profit in 2003 included
    cash charges of approximately $18,400 associated with severance
    related to this cost reduction initiative. The improvement in
    operating profit in 2004 over 2003 was also due to lower royalty
    expense primarily from decreased sales of BEYBLADE, which was
    partially offset by an increase in advertising expense as a
    result of the Company’s ongoing initiative to raise
    awareness of its core brands. In 2004, there was a net favorable
    translation impact to International segment operating profit of
    approximately $4,800 for the year.

Gross
    Profit

The Company’s gross profit margin increased slightly to
    58.3% for the year ended December 25, 2005 from 58.2% in
    2004. This increase was primarily due to increased sales of STAR
    WARS products, which generally carry a higher gross margin,
    which is offset by royalty and amortization expense. Gross
    profit margin in 2005 was also impacted by decreased sales of
    VIDEONOW products that have lower gross margins. These increases
    were largely offset by inventory obsolescence and customer
    allowances on plug and play games as well as lower sales of
    trading card games that carry a higher gross margin.

The Company’s gross profit margin decreased to 58.2% for
    the year ended December 26, 2004 from 59.0% in 2003. The
    decrease in 2004 from 2003 was due to changes in product mix,
    primarily decreased sales of BEYBLADE products, which carry a
    higher gross margin. Gross margin was also negatively impacted
    by increased sales of VIDEONOW hardware products, which carry a
    lower gross margin, and decreased margin on VIDEONOW products
    due to competition and customer sales allowances. 2003 gross
    profit includes charges incurred by the Company to cease
    manufacturing operations in Spain, comprised primarily of
    severance costs as well as non-cash charges associated with
    fixed assets. The production activities previously performed in
    Spain were transferred to the Company’s other manufacturing
    facilities or outsourced to third party suppliers.

The Company aggressively monitors its levels of inventory,
    attempting to avoid unnecessary expenditures of cash and
    potential charges related to obsolescence. The Company’s
    failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand
    could result in overproduction of less popular items, which
    could result in higher obsolescence costs, causing a reduction
    in gross profit.

Amortization increased to $102,035 in 2005 from $70,562 in 2004
    and $76,053 in 2003. The increase in amortization in 2005
    relates to increased amortization of STAR WARS property rights
    due to the theatrical and DVD releases of STAR WARS
    EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH. Amortization of these
    rights is based on actual sales of products as a portion of
    total expected sales of related products related to this
    licensing right. The decrease in amortization expense in 2004
    from 2003 primarily relates to 2003 charges related to certain
    unprofitable product lines. The Company expects amortization
    expense to decrease in 2006 from 2005 levels due to lower
    expected sales of STAR WARS products.

Royalty expense increased to $247,283, or 8.0% of net revenues
    in 2005 from $223,193, or 7.4% of net revenues in 2004 and
    $248,423, or 7.9% of net revenues in 2003. Increased royalty
    expense in 2005 relates primarily to increased sales of STAR
    WARS related products. The increase from STAR WARS products was
    partially offset by lower sales of BEYBLADE, SHREK and DISNEY
    products. Lower royalty expense in 2004 compared to 2003 is
    primarily due to the decreased sales of BEYBLADE products partly
    offset by a $7,200 charge related to future minimum guarantees
    not expected to be fully realized related to the Disney license
    agreement. The Company expects royalty expense to decrease in
    both dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in 2006
    compared to 2005, due to the lower expected revenues of STAR
    WARS related products.

Research and product development decreased in 2005 to $150,586,
    or 4.9% of net revenues, from $157,162, or 5.2% of net revenues
    in 2004. The decrease reflects increased efficiencies in the
    U.S. Toys product development resulting from its
    realignment in 2004. This realignment streamlined the
    U.S. Toys workforce and moved certain product development
    outside of the U.S. While the Company strives to incur these
    costs in the most efficient manner possible, investment in
    research and product development costs is an important component
    to the Company’s strategy to grow core brands and to create
    new and innovative toy and game products. The increase in
    expenditures for research and product development from $143,183,
    or 4.6% of net revenues in 2003 to $157,162, or 5.2% of net
    revenues in 2004 reflects higher development costs associated
    with electronic toys such as VIDEONOW COLOR and electronic games
    such as MISSION PAINT BALL plug and play, as well as DVD games.

Advertising expense in 2005 decreased in dollars and as a
    percentage of net revenues to $366,371, or 11.8% of net
    revenues, in 2005 from $387,523, or 12.9% of net revenues in
    2004. This decrease reflects higher sales of STAR WARS products,
    which do not require the same amount of advertising as the
    Company’s non-entertainment based products. The Company
    continues to focus on marketing to raise awareness of its core
    brands, as well as to introduce new products. Advertising
    expense increased in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues
    to $387,523, or 12.9% of net revenues in 2004 from $363,876, or
    11.6% of net revenues in 2003. The Company expects advertising
    to increase as a percentage of revenues in 2006 from 2005 as an
    increased percentage of revenues will come from core brands and
    new products due to the lower expected sales of STAR WARS
    product.

Selling, distribution and administration expenses increased in
    dollars but decreased as a percentage of net revenues to
    $624,560, or 20.2% of net revenues in 2005, from $614,401, or
    20.5% of net revenues in 2004. The increase in administration
    costs in dollars primarily reflects increased performance
    incentive bonus provisions reflecting the Company’s
    improved performance. Selling, distribution and administration
    expenses decreased in dollars and as a percentage of net
    revenues to $614,401, or 20.5% of net revenues in 2004, from



$674,544, or 21.5% of net revenues in 2003. The decrease in 2004
    from 2003 reflects lower expenses resulting from the
    Company’s cost reduction and business efficiency
    initiatives, and lower levels of performance incentive bonus
    provisions relating to lower revenues and operating earnings.
    Additionally, the 2003 amount included costs associated with the
    Company’s closure of its retail stores operated under the
    Wizards of the Coast and Gamekeeper names.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense decreased to $30,537 in 2005 from $31,698 in
    2004 and $52,462 in 2003. Decreased interest expense, resulting
    from lower levels of debt, were largely offset by increased
    interest expense as a result of higher interest rates. The
    decrease in interest expense mainly reflects the Company’s
    strategy to reduce its long-term debt. The Company repurchased
    or repaid principal amounts of long-term debt of $93,303 in
    2005, $56,697 in 2004, and $368,937 in 2003.

Approximately 72% of the decrease in interest expense from 2003
    to 2004 was attributable to lower levels of short-term and
    long-term debt in 2004 than in 2003 with the remaining 28%
    decrease in interest expense due to lower effective interest
    rates, primarily the result of interest rate swap agreements
    that reduce the amount of the Company’s debt subject to
    fixed interest rates. The Company will continue to review the
    amount of long-term debt outstanding as part of its strategic
    capital structure objective of maintaining a debt to
    capitalization ratio between 25% and 30%.

Other
    (Income) Expense, Net

Other income, net of $30,929 for the year ended
    December 25, 2005 compares to other expense, net of $1,226
    and $48,090 for the years ended December  26, 2004 and
    December 28, 2003. Other income, net in 2005 primarily
    consists of interest income of $24,157, which compares to $7,729
    in 2004 and $4,377 in 2003. The increase in interest income
    primarily relates to increases in invested cash balances in 2005.

Other income, net in 2005 also includes non-cash income of
    $2,080 compared to $12,710 in 2004 and a non-cash charge to
    earnings of $13,630 in 2003, related to the change in the fair
    value of certain warrants required to be classified as a
    liability. These warrants are required to be adjusted to their
    fair value each quarter through earnings. The fair value of
    these warrants is primarily affected by the Company’s stock
    price, but is also affected by the Company’s stock price
    volatility and dividends, as well as risk-free interest rates.
    Assuming the Company’s stock volatility and dividend
    payments, as well as risk-free interest rates remain constant,
    the fair value of the warrants would increase and the Company
    would recognize a charge to earnings as the price of the
    Company’s stock increases. If the price of the
    Company’s stock decreases and the Company’s stock
    volatility, dividend payments, and the risk-free interest rates
    remain constant, the fair value of the warrants will decrease
    and the Company will recognize income. Based on a hypothetical
    increase in the Company’s stock price to $22.00 per
    share at December 25, 2005 from its actual price of $20.36
    a share on that date, the Company would have recognized a
    non-cash charge of approximately $7,790 rather than actual
    non-cash income recorded of $2,080 for the year ended
    December 25, 2005, to reflect the change in the fair value
    of the warrants from their fair value of $125,940 at
    December 26, 2004.

Other expense, net in 2004 also includes a $8,988 write-down of
    the value of the common stock of Infogrames, held by the Company
    as an

available-for-sale

investment. This write-down resulted from an

other-than-temporary

decline in the fair value of this investment.

Other expense, net in 2003 includes a loss on extinguishment of
    debt of $20,342 relating to the 8.50% Notes due 2006,
    repurchased pursuant to a tender offer in the fourth quarter of
    2003. Under the tender offer, the Company repurchased notes
    totaling $167,257 in aggregate principal amount.

Income
    Taxes

Income tax expense was 31.8% of pretax earnings in 2005 compared
    with 24.6% of pretax earnings in 2004 and 28.3% of pretax
    earnings in 2003. Income tax expense for 2005 includes
    approximately $25,800 related to the repatriation in the fourth
    quarter of 2005 of $547,000 of foreign earnings pursuant to the
    special



incentive provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
    Income tax expense for 2005 was also reduced by approximately
    $4 million, due primarily to an Internal Revenue Service
    examination of tax years ending in December 2001. Absent these
    items and the effect of the adjustment of certain warrants to
    their fair value, which has no tax effect, the 2005 effective
    tax rate would have been 24.9%.

Absent the effect of the adjustment of certain warrants to their
    fair value, which has no tax effect, the 2004 and 2003 effective
    tax rates would have been 25.9% and 26.8%, respectively. The
    2004 and 2003 effective tax rates were negatively impacted by
    increases in the valuation allowance primarily attributable to
    decreases in the value of the Company’s

available-for-sale

investment in Infogrames Entertainment SA. The decrease in the
    adjusted rate, to 24.9% in 2005 from 25.9% in 2004, is also due
    to the tax impact of higher operating profits in jurisdictions
    with lower statutory tax rates.

Cumulative
    Effect of Accounting Changes

On June 30, 2003, the first day of the third quarter of
    fiscal 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 150, “Accounting for Certain
    Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Liabilities and
    Equity” (“SFAS 150”). SFAS 150 required
    the Company to reclassify certain warrants recorded as equity to
    a liability, and adjust the warrants to their fair value through
    earnings as of that date. On the date of adoption, the Company
    reclassified $107,669 from equity, where the warrants had
    previously been recorded, to current liabilities. A cumulative
    effect of accounting change of $17,351 was recorded to adjust
    the amount of this liability to its fair value on the adoption
    date. There was no tax benefit associated with this charge.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The Company has historically generated a significant amount of
    cash from operations. In 2005, the Company funded its operations
    and liquidity needs primarily through cash flows from
    operations, and, when needed, proceeds from its accounts
    receivable securitization program and borrowings under its
    unsecured credit facilities. During 2006, the Company expects to
    continue to fund its working capital needs primarily through
    operations and, when needed, using proceeds from the accounts
    receivable securitization program and borrowings under its
    available lines of credit. The Company believes that the funds
    available to it, including cash expected to be generated from
    operations and funds available through its securitization
    program and other available lines of credit, are adequate to
    meet its needs for 2006. However, unforeseen circumstances in
    the toy or game industry, such as softness in the retail
    environment or unanticipated changes in consumer preferences,
    could result in a significant decline in revenues and operating
    results for the Company, which could result in the Company being
    in non-compliance with its debt covenants and unable to use
    funding from its accounts receivable securitization program.
    Non-compliance with its debt covenants could result in the
    Company being unable to utilize borrowings under its revolving
    credit facility and other bank lines, a circumstance which
    potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most
    require supplementary borrowings to enable the Company to
    continue to fund its operations. Also, non-compliance with
    covenants under its accounts receivable securitization program
    could result in the Company being unable to utilize this
    program. In addition, a significant deterioration in the
    business of a major U.S. customer could result in a
    decrease in eligible accounts receivable that would prevent the
    Company from being able to fully utilize its accounts receivable
    securitization program.

During the last four fiscal years, as part of its strategy of
    reducing long-term debt and its overall

debt-to-capitalization

ratio, the Company has repurchased or repaid approximately
    $646,000 in principal amount of long-term debt, primarily using
    cash from operations. Remaining principal amounts of long-term
    debt at December 25, 2005, including portions classified as
    current, were $527,726. The Company believes that the reduction
    in its

debt-to-capitalization

ratio has improved its liquidity situation by decreasing cash
    required to service outstanding debt, thereby increasing the
    ability of the Company to obtain additional financing should the
    need to do so arise.

At December 25, 2005, cash and cash equivalents, net of
    short-term borrowings, were $927,592 compared to $707,043 and
    $497,393 at December 26, 2004 and December 28, 2003,
    respectively. Hasbro generated



approximately $497,000, $359,000, and $454,000 of cash from its
    operating activities in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
    increase in 2005 from 2004 is primarily due to the mix of
    products in 2005 net revenues. Net earnings in 2005
    included increased non-cash expenses primarily as a result of
    increased STAR WARS revenues. Increased royalty expense in 2005
    related to revenues from STAR WARS products. A portion of these
    royalties had been paid in prior years and recorded as a prepaid
    expense. The Company paid an advance of $35,000 in 2005 related
    to STAR WARS royalties. In addition, the Company had increased
    amortization expense in 2005, which did not impact the cash
    flows from operations. Although net earnings before cumulative
    effect of accounting change increased to $195,977 in 2004 from
    $175,015 in 2003, the decrease in cash from operations in 2004
    as compared to 2003 was primarily the result of changes in
    operating assets and liabilities, further discussed below.

Accounts receivable decreased to $523,232 at December 25,
    2005 from $578,705 at December 26, 2004. Fourth quarter
    days sales outstanding decreased to 44 days in 2005 from
    49 days in 2004 and 2003. The decrease in days sales
    outstanding from 2004 primarily reflects improved collections,
    increased utilization of the securitization facility in 2005 and
    decreases in international accounts receivable due to the
    stronger U.S. dollar in 2005. In 2003, the Company entered
    into a revolving accounts receivable securitization facility
    whereby the Company is able to sell undivided interests in
    qualifying accounts receivable on an ongoing basis. At
    December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004, there was
    $250,000 and $206,055, respectively, sold under this program.
    The December 25, 2005 accounts receivable balance includes
    a decrease of approximately $23,884 related to the currency
    impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. Inventories decreased to
    $179,398 at December 25, 2005 from $194,780 at
    December 26, 2004. The decrease in inventory represents
    higher levels of inventory at December 26, 2004 due to
    lower levels of sales in the fourth quarter of 2004. In
    addition, inventories decreased approximately $5,900 due to the
    stronger U.S. dollar in 2005. The increase in inventory to
    $194,780 at December 26, 2004 from $168,979 at
    December 28, 2003 reflects lower than normal inventory
    levels in 2003 and, to a lesser extent, lower revenues in the
    fourth quarter of 2004. Inventory levels at year-end 2003 were
    at their lowest point since 1990.

Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased to $185,297
    at December 25, 2005 from $219,735 at December 26,
    2004. This decrease is primarily related to decreased prepaid
    royalties as a result of the increased sales of STAR WARS
    products in 2005. Generally, when the Company enters into a
    licensing agreement for entertainment-based properties, an
    advance royalty payment is required at the inception of the
    agreement. This payment is then recognized in the consolidated
    statement of operations as the related sales are recorded. The
    decrease related to prepaid royalties was partially offset by
    increased deferred taxes. Prepaid expenses and other current
    assets increased slightly to $219,735 at December 26, 2004
    from $211,981 at December 28, 2003. An increase in current
    prepaid royalties as a result of the 2005 release of STAR WARS
    EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH was partially offset by
    decreased deferred taxes. With respect to the STAR WARS license,
    the Company has prepaid royalties recorded in both current and
    non-current assets.

Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to $863,280 at
    December 25, 2005 from $806,528 at December 26, 2004.
    This primarily reflects an increase in accrued income taxes
    primarily as a result of improved earnings in 2005 and, to a
    lesser extent, taxes payable related to earnings repatriated
    under the American Jobs Creation Act (the “Act”). In
    December 2005, the Company repatriated approximately $547,000
    under this Act. The increase from accrued income taxes was
    partially offset by lower accrued royalties at December 25,
    2005 due to lower sales of BEYBLADE and SHREK products in the
    fourth quarter of 2005. These contracts did not require the
    Company to prepay royalties as these royalty amounts were paid
    in arrears. Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased to
    $806,528 at December 26, 2004 from $905,368 at
    December 28, 2003. The decrease primarily relates to
    decreases in accrued bonuses and performance incentives as well
    as a decrease in accrued income taxes. To a lesser extent, this
    decrease was also due to a decrease in the value of certain
    warrants that the Company is required to record as liabilities
    under SFAS 150. As a result of SFAS 150, the Company
    classifies certain warrants containing a put option as a current
    liability and adjusts the amount of this liability to its fair
    value on a periodic basis.

Cash flows from investing activities were a net utilization of
    $120,671, $84,967, and $64,879 in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
    respectively. During 2005, the Company expended $65,000 to
    reacquire the digital gaming rights for its owned or controlled
    properties from Infogrames Entertainment SA (Infogrames). These
    rights



were previously held by Infogrames on an exclusive basis as a
    result of a licensing agreement entered into during 2000. In
    addition, the Company expended $14,179 to purchase the assets of
    Wrebbit Inc., a Montreal-based creator and manufacturer of
    innovative puzzles. In 2005, the Company also had proceeds from
    the sales of property, plant and equipment of $33,083. These
    proceeds came primarily from the sale of the Company’s
    former manufacturing facility in Spain. During 2005, the Company
    expended approximately $71,000 on additions to its property,
    plant and equipment while during 2004 and 2003 it expended
    approximately $79,000 and $63,000, respectively. Of these
    amounts, 61% in 2005, 58% in 2004, and 66% in 2003 were for
    purchases of tools, dies and molds related to the Company’s
    products. The level of capital spending in 2005, 2004, and 2003
    was below the level permitted under its outstanding credit
    facilities. In 2006, the Company expects capital expenditures to
    continue to be in the range of $70,000 to $90,000. During the
    three years ended December 25, 2005, depreciation and
    amortization of plant and equipment was $78,097, $75,618, and
    $88,070, respectively. In 2004, the Company acquired the
    remaining unowned interest in its Latin America operations for
    total consideration of $9,824. This purchase resulted in an
    increase in goodwill in the amount of $9,390. The Company made
    no acquisitions of businesses in 2003.

The Company commits to inventory production, advertising and
    marketing expenditures prior to the peak third and fourth
    quarter retail selling season. Accounts receivable increase
    during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their
    purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday
    season. Due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling
    period, payments for these accounts receivable are generally not
    due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of
    the subsequent year. This timing difference between expenditures
    and cash collections on accounts receivable made it necessary
    for the Company to borrow varying amounts during the year.
    During 2005 and 2004, the Company primarily utilized cash from
    operations and its accounts receivable securitization program.
    During 2003, the Company primarily utilized cash from operations
    and borrowings under its secured amended and restated revolving
    credit agreement to meet its cash flow requirements.

The Company is party to an accounts receivable securitization
    program whereby the Company sells, on an ongoing basis,
    substantially all of its U.S. trade accounts receivable to
    a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, Hasbro Receivables
    Funding, LLC (“HRF”). HRF is consolidated with the
    Company for financial reporting purposes. The securitization
    program then allows HRF to sell, on a revolving basis, an
    undivided interest of up to $250,000 in the eligible receivables
    it holds to certain bank conduits. The program provides the
    Company with a cost-effective source of working capital. Based
    on the amount of eligible accounts receivable as of
    December 25, 2005, the Company utilized $250,000, which was
    the maximum available to sell under this program.

The Company has an amended and restated credit agreement, which
    provides it with an unsecured revolving credit facility of
    $350,000, maturing in March 2007. The Company is not required to
    maintain compensating balances under the agreement. The amended
    and restated agreement contains certain restrictive covenants
    setting forth minimum cash flow and coverage requirements, and a
    number of other limitations, including with respect to capital
    expenditures, investments, acquisitions, share repurchases and
    dividend payments. The Company was in compliance with all
    restrictive covenants as of and for the fiscal year ended
    December 25, 2005. The Company had no borrowings
    outstanding under its committed revolving credit facility at
    December 25, 2005. The Company also has other uncommitted
    lines from various banks, of which approximately $44,552 was
    utilized at December 25, 2005. Amounts available and unused
    under the committed line at December 25, 2005 were
    approximately $346,000.

Net cash utilized by financing activities was $158,641 in 2005.
    This amount included repayments in principal amount of long-term
    debt totaling $93,303. These amounts primarily related to
    $71,970 of bonds that matured in November of 2005. The remaining
    amount relates to repayment of long-term debt associated with
    the Company’s former manufacturing facility in Spain.
    Dividends paid increased to $58,901 as a result of the increase
    of the quarterly dividend rate to $0.09 in the first quarter of
    2005 from $0.06. In May 2005, the Company’s Board of
    Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $350 million
    in common stock. In 2005, the Company repurchased
    2,386 shares at an average price of $20.10. The total cost
    of these repurchases, including transaction costs, was $48,030.
    The Company received $45,278 in 2005 in proceeds from the
    exercise of employee stock options.



Net cash utilized by financing activities was $75,824 in 2004.
    This amount included repurchases in principal amount of
    long-term debt totaling $56,697 in connection with the
    Company’s strategy of reducing its overall debt and
    improving its

debt-to-capitalization

ratio. The Company received $25,836 from the exercise of stock
    options during the year. In December 2003, the Company increased
    its quarterly dividend to $0.06 per share from
    $0.03 per share. This increased cash paid for dividends to
    $37,088 from the 2003 amount of $20,851.

Net cash utilized by financing activities was $373,307 in 2003.
    This was primarily the result of the Company’s use of cash
    flows from operations to repurchase or repay $200,288 in
    principal amount of 7.95% Notes in March 2003. In addition,
    the Company repurchased $167,257 in principal amount of 8.50%
    Notes due 2006 in the fourth quarter of 2003 at a total cost of
    $188,991. Also in 2003, as the result of the increase in the
    Company’s stock price during the year, the Company received
    $39,892 in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options.
    The Company also paid $3,378 to repurchase shares issued upon
    the exercise of certain warrants as well as to terminate a
    warrant agreement.

The Company has outstanding $249,996 in principal amount of
    senior convertible debentures due 2021. The senior convertible
    debentures bear interest at 2.75%, which could be subject to an
    upward adjustment in the rate, not to exceed 11%, should the
    price of the Company’s stock trade at or below
    $9.72 per share for 20 of the 30 trading days
    preceding the fifth day prior to an interest payment date. This
    contingent interest feature represents a derivative instrument
    that is recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value, with
    changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations.
    If the closing price of the Company’s stock exceeds $23.76
    for at least 20 trading days, within the 30 consecutive trading
    day period ending on the last trading day of the calendar
    quarter, or upon other specified events, the debentures will be
    convertible at an initial conversion price of $21.60 in the next
    calendar quarter. This contingent conversion feature was not met
    in 2005. The holders of these debentures may put the notes back
    to Hasbro in December 2011 and December 2016 at the original
    principal amount. At that time, the purchase price may be paid
    in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the two, at
    the Company’s discretion. While the Company’s current
    intent is to settle in cash any puts exercised, there can be no
    guarantee that the Company will have the funds necessary to
    settle this obligation in cash. On December 1, 2005, the
    holders of these debentures had the option to put these notes
    back to Hasbro. On that date, the Company redeemed $4 of these
    notes in cash. Due to this put option, these debentures were
    classified on the Company’s balance sheet in the current
    portion of long-term debt at December 26, 2004. Subsequent
    to December 1, 2005, the remaining $249,996 of principal
    amount of these notes were reclassified to long-term debt.

The Company has remaining principal amounts of long-term debt,
    including current portions, at December 25, 2005 of
    approximately $527,726. As detailed below in Contractual
    Obligations and Commercial Commitments, this debt is due at
    varying times from 2006 through 2028. Of the total principal
    amount, the Company has $32,743 of 8.50% Notes due in March
    2006. In addition, the Company is committed to guaranteed
    royalty and other contractual payments of approximately $128,220
    in 2006, which includes $100,000 of royalty commitments on a
    contract signed in January 2006 with Marvel Entertainment, Inc.
    and Marvel Characters, Inc. Also, as detailed in Contractual
    Obligations and Commercial Commitments, the Company has certain
    warrants, currently recorded in accrued liabilities, that may be
    settleable for, at the Company’s option, $100,000 in cash
    or $110,000 in the Company’s stock, such stock being valued
    at the time of the exercise of the option. The Company believes
    that cash from operations, including the securitization
    facility, and, if necessary, its line of credit, will allow the
    Company to meet these and other obligations listed. The Company
    will continue to review the amount of long-term debt outstanding
    as part of its strategic capital structure objective of
    maintaining a debt to capitalization ratio between 25% and 30%.

On May 19, 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $350 million in common
    stock. This authorization replaced a prior authorization, dated
    December 6, 1999 of $500 million, which had
    $204.5 million remaining. Purchases of the Company’s
    common stock may be made in the open market or through privately
    negotiated transactions. The Company has no obligation to
    repurchase shares under the authorization, and the timing,
    actual number, and the value of the shares that are repurchased
    will depend on a number of factors, including the price of the
    Company’s stock. The Company may suspend or discontinue the
    program at any time and there is no expiration date. In 2005,
    the Company repurchased



2,386 shares at an average price of $20.10. The total cost
    of these repurchases, including transaction costs, was $48,030.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates

The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. As such, management is required to
    make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it
    believes are reasonable based on the information available.
    These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the
    periods presented. The significant accounting policies which
    management believes are the most critical to aid in fully
    understanding and evaluating the Company’s reported
    financial results include sales allowances, inventory valuation,
    recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, recoverability
    of royalty advances and commitments and pensions.

Sales allowances for customer promotions, discounts and returns
    are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue
    is recognized. Revenue from product sales is recognized upon
    passing of title to the customer, generally at the time of
    shipment. Revenue from product sales, less related sales
    allowances, is added to royalty revenue and reflected as net
    revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. The
    Company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance
    programs with customers. These allowances primarily relate to
    fixed programs, which the customer earns based on purchases of
    Company products during the year. Discounts are recorded as a
    reduction of related revenue at the time of sale. While many of
    the allowances are based on fixed amounts, certain of the
    allowances, such as the returns allowance, are based on market
    data, historical trends and information from customers and are
    therefore subject to estimation.

Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. Based upon a
    consideration of quantities on hand, actual and projected sales
    volume, anticipated product selling prices and product lines
    planned to be discontinued, slow-moving and obsolete inventory
    is written down to its net realizable value. Failure to
    accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result
    in the Company under producing popular items or overproducing
    less popular items. Management estimates are monitored on a
    quarterly basis and a further adjustment to reduce inventory to
    its net realizable value is recorded, as an increase to cost of
    sales, when deemed necessary under the lower of cost or market
    standard.

Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite
    lives are tested for impairment at least annually. If an event
    occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying
    value may not be recoverable, the Company will perform an
    interim test at that time. The impairment test begins by
    allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable
    reporting units. Goodwill is then tested using a two step
    process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the
    reporting unit using an income approach, which looks to the
    present value of expected future cash flows.

The first step is a screen for potential impairment while the
    second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an
    indication from the first step that one exists. Intangible
    assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by
    comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value
    which is also calculated using an income approach. The
    Company’s annual impairment test was performed in the
    fourth quarter of 2005 and no impairment was indicated. The
    estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments
    and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the
    respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those
    revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in
    anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a
    change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge.
    The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the
    selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different
    assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash
    flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment
    charge. At December 25, 2005, the Company has goodwill and
    intangible assets with indefinite lives of $542,799 recorded on
    the balance sheet.

Intangible assets, other than those with indefinite lives, are
    reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Recoverability of the value of these intangible
    assets is measured by a comparison of the assets’ carrying
    value



to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be
    generated by the asset. If such assets were considered to be
    impaired, the impairment would be measured by the amount by
    which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value
    based on estimated future discounted cash flows. The estimation
    of future cash flows requires significant judgments and
    estimates with respect to future revenues related to the
    respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those
    revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in
    anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a
    change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge.
    The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the
    selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different
    assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash
    flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment
    charge. Intangible assets covered under this policy were
    $533,940 at December 25, 2005. During 2005, there were no
    impairment charges related to these intangible assets.

The recoverability of royalty advances and contractual
    obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is
    assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the
    estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow
    projections to be derived from the related product. If sales
    forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do
    not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty
    or, if the Company decides to discontinue a product line with
    royalty advances or commitments, a charge to royalty expense to
    write-off the remaining minimum guaranty is required. The
    preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for
    these products requires judgments and estimates. Actual revenues
    and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of
    anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products
    could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of
    remaining minimum guaranteed royalties. At December 25,
    2005, the Company had $126,515 of prepaid royalties, $37,107 of
    which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets
    and $89,408 which are included in other assets.

The Company, except for certain international subsidiaries, has
    pension plans covering substantially all of its full-time
    employees. Pension expense is based on actuarial computations of
    current and future benefits using estimates for expected return
    on assets, expected compensation increases, and applicable
    discount rates. The Company estimates expected return on assets
    using a weighted average rate based on historical market data
    for the investment classes of assets held by the plan, the
    allocation of plan assets among those investment classes, and
    the current economic environment. Based on this information, the
    Company’s estimate of expected return on domestic plan
    assets was 8.75% in 2005, 2004 and 2003. A decrease in the
    estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase
    pension expense, while an increase in this estimate would
    decrease pension expense. A decrease of .25% in the estimate of
    expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense
    for U.S. plans by approximately $470. Expected compensation
    increases are estimated using a combination of historical
    compensation increases with expected compensation increases in
    the Company’s long-term business forecasts. Based on this
    analysis, the Company’s estimate of expected long-term
    compensation increases for its U.S. plans was 4.0% in 2005,
    2004 and 2003. Increases in estimated compensation increases
    would result in higher pension expense while decreases would
    lower pension expense. Discount rates are selected based upon
    rates of return at the measurement date on high quality
    corporate bond investments currently available and expected to
    be available during the period to maturity of the pension
    benefits. Based on this long-term corporate bond yield at
    September 30, 2005, the Company’s measurement date for
    its pension assets and liabilities, the Company selected a
    discount rate for its domestic plans of 5.50%. A decrease in the
    discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an
    increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense. A
    decrease of .25% in the Company’s discount rate would
    increase pension expense and the projected benefit obligation by
    approximately $995 and $11,110, respectively. In accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87,
    “Employers Accounting for Pensions”, actual results
    that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and,
    if outside a certain corridor, amortized over future periods
    and, therefore generally affect recognized expense and the
    recorded obligation in future periods. Assets in the plan are
    valued on the basis of their fair market value on the
    measurement date. In 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded a
    minimum pension liability for its U.S. plans of $53,329 and
    $43,196, respectively. This amount represents the amount by
    which the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the sum of the
    fair market value of plan assets and accrued amounts previously
    recorded.



Contractual
    Obligations and Commercial Commitments

In the normal course of its business, the Company enters into
    contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under
    license, which may require the payment of minimum guarantees, as
    well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and
    equipment. In addition, the Company has $527,726 of long-term
    debt outstanding at December 25, 2005, including current
    portions and excluding fair value adjustments. Future payments
    required under these and other obligations as of
    December 25, 2005 are as follows:

In addition to the above commitments, in January 2006, the
    Company entered into a five-year license arrangement with Marvel
    Entertainment, Inc., and its subsidiary Marvel Characters, Inc.
    (together “Marvel”) to develop products based on
    certain Marvel properties for retail sales beginning on
    January 1, 2007. The arrangement requires the Company to
    make guaranteed minimum payments in the amount of $205,000 with
    $100,000 paid in February 2006. Of the remaining payments,
    $70,000 is expected to be paid in 2007 upon the release of the
    motion picture SPIDERMAN 3 and the remainder to be paid upon the
    release of the motion picture SPIDERMAN 4, whose release
    date is yet to be determined. The agreement also requires the
    Company to make minimum expenditures on marketing and
    promotional activities, including the spending of at least
    $15,000 associated with the motion picture SPIDERMAN 3. Certain
    of the future minimum guaranteed contractual royalty payments
    are contingent upon the theatrical release of the related
    entertainment property.

Included in the Thereafter column above is $249,996 in principal
    amount of senior convertible debt due 2021. The holders of these
    debentures may put the notes back to the Company in December
    2011 and December 2016 at the principal amount. At that time,
    the purchase price may be paid in cash, shares of common stock
    or a combination of the two.

In addition to the above, the Company has certain warrants
    outstanding at December 25, 2005 that contain a put option
    that would require the Company to repurchase the warrants for a
    price to be paid, at the Company’s election, of either
    $100,000 in cash or $110,000 in shares of the Company’s
    common stock, such stock being valued at the time of the
    exercise of the option. The Company’s current intent is to
    settle this put option in cash if exercised. In accordance with
    SFAS 150, these warrants are recorded as an accrued
    liability at fair value at December 25, 2005. In addition,
    the Company expects to make contributions totaling approximately
    $21,000 to its pension plans in 2006. The Company also has
    letters of credit of approximately $33,600 at December 25,
    2005.

Financial
    Risk Management

The Company is exposed to market risks attributable to
    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the
    result of sourcing products priced in U.S. dollars, Hong
    Kong dollars and Euros while marketing those products in more
    than twenty currencies. Results of operations may be affected
    primarily by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, Hong
    Kong dollar, Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and Mexican
    peso and, to a lesser extent, currencies in Latin American and
    Asia Pacific countries.

To manage this exposure, the Company has hedged a portion of its
    forecasted foreign currency transactions using forward foreign
    exchange contracts, and purchased foreign currency options. The
    Company estimates that a hypothetical immediate 10% depreciation
    of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies could



result in an approximate $9,200 decrease in the fair value of
    these instruments. A decrease in the fair value of these
    instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the
    related forecasted foreign currency transaction.

The Company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with
    respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short-term
    borrowing positions in currencies other than the
    U.S. dollar. The Company believes, however, that the
    on-going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its
    financial condition. In addition, the Company’s revenues
    and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by
    changes in foreign currency rates. From time to time, affiliates
    of the Company may make or receive intercompany loans in
    currencies other than their functional currency. The Company
    manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using
    foreign exchange contracts. Other than as set forth above, the
    Company does not hedge foreign currency exposures. The Company
    reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or
    liability on the balance sheet. The Company does not speculate
    in foreign currency exchange contracts.

At December 25, 2005, the Company had fixed rate long-term
    debt, including current portions and excluding fair value
    adjustments, of $527,726. At December  25, 2005, the
    Company had

fixed-for-floating

interest rate swaps with notional amounts of $100,000. The
    interest rate swaps are designed to adjust the amount of the
    Company’s debt subject to a fixed interest rate. The
    interest rate swaps are matched with specific long-term debt
    issues and are designated and effective as hedges of the change
    in the fair value of the associated debt. Changes in fair value
    of these contracts are wholly offset in earnings by changes in
    the fair value of long-term debt. At December 25, 2005,
    these contracts had a fair value of $663, with $636 included in
    other assets, and the remaining $27 included in prepaid expenses
    and other current assets, with corresponding fair value
    adjustments to increase long-term debt and current portions of
    long-term debt, respectively. Changes in interest rates affect
    the fair value of fixed rate debt not hedged by interest rate
    swap agreements while affecting the earnings and cash flows of
    the long-term debt hedged by the interest rate swaps. The
    Company estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point
    decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or
    decrease the fair value of this long-term debt by approximately
    $15,900 or $13,600, respectively. A hypothetical one percentage
    point change in interest rates would increase or decrease 2006
    pretax earnings and cash flows by $729 and $375, respectively.

The
    Economy and Inflation

The Company continued to experience difficult economic
    environments in some parts of the world during 2005. The
    principal market for the Company’s products is the retail
    sector. Revenues from the Company’s top 5 customers, all
    retailers, accounted for approximately 53%, 50%, and 52% of its
    consolidated net revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
    In the past two years certain customers in the retail sector
    have experienced economic difficulty. The Company monitors the
    creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies
    and limits as it deems appropriate.

The Company’s revenue pattern continues to show the second
    half of the year, and within that half, the fourth quarter, to
    be more significant to its overall business for the full year.
    The Company expects that this concentration will continue,
    particularly as more of its business shifts to larger customers
    with order patterns concentrated in the second half of the year.
    The concentration of sales in the second half of the year and,
    specifically, the fourth quarter increases the risk of
    (a) underproduction of popular items,
    (b) overproduction of less popular items, and
    (c) failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping
    schedules. The business of the Company is characterized by
    customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely
    because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a
    product line, product availability, marketing strategies,
    inventory levels, policies of retailers and differences in
    overall economic conditions. The trend of larger retailers has
    been to maintain lower inventories throughout the year and
    purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the
    fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season, which includes
    Christmas.

Quick response inventory management practices now being used
    result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and
    fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment. To the
    extent that retailers do not sell as much of their year-end
    inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they
    had anticipated, their demand for additional product earlier in
    the following fiscal year may be curtailed, thus



negatively impacting the Company’s revenues. In addition,
    the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the
    Company’s significant retailers could negatively impact the
    Company’s future revenues.

The effect of inflation on the Company’s operations during
    2005 was not significant and the Company will continue its
    policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices, accordingly.

Other
    Information

Hasbro uses the intrinsic-value method of accounting for stock
    options granted to employees. As required by the Company’s
    existing stock plans, stock options are granted at, or above,
    the fair market value of the Company’s stock, and,
    accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized for these
    grants in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company
    records compensation expense related to other stock-based
    awards, such as restricted stock grants, over the period the
    award vests, typically three years.

On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised
    2004), “Share-Based Payment”
    (“SFAS 123(R)”), which amends SFAS 123 and
    SFAS 95 “Statement of Cash Flows”.
    SFAS 123(R) requires companies to measure all employee
    stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and
    record such expense in its consolidated financial statements. In
    addition, the adoption of SFAS 123(R) requires additional
    accounting and disclosure related to the income tax and cash
    flow effects resulting from share-based payment arrangements.
    SFAS 123(R) is effective for the Company as of
    December 26, 2005, the first day of the 2006 fiscal year.
    The Company will adopt SFAS 123(R) on the prospective basis
    as defined in the statement. Under this adoption method, the
    Company will record expense relating to employee stock-based
    compensation awards in the periods subsequent to adoption. This
    expense will be based on all unvested options as of the adoption
    date as well as all future stock-based compensation awards.
    Based on the current options outstanding, the Company’s
    2006 pretax expense for those options is expected to be between
    $16,000 and $17,000. This amount may increase to the extent that
    options are granted in 2006.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
    (the “Act”) was signed into law. The Act created a
    one-time incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate
    undistributed earnings from their international subsidiaries by
    providing an 85% dividends-received deduction for certain
    international earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the
    Company repatriated approximately $547,000 of foreign earnings
    under the provisions of the Act which resulted in income tax of
    $25,844.

The Company is not aware of any material amounts of potential
    exposure relating to environmental matters and does not believe
    its environmental compliance costs or liabilities to be material
    to its operating results or financial position.

HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

(1)

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Hasbro, Inc. and all majority-owned subsidiaries
    (“Hasbro” or the “Company”). Investments
    representing 20% to 50% ownership interest in other companies
    are accounted for using the equity method. The Company had no
    equity method investments at December 25, 2005 that were
    material to the consolidated financial statements. All
    significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
    eliminated.

Preparation
    of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
    notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the 2004 and 2003 consolidated financial
    statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2005
    presentation.

Fiscal
    Year

Hasbro’s fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in December.
    Each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended
    December 25, 2005 was a fifty-two week period.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and highly
    liquid investments purchased with a maturity to the Company of
    three months or less. The Company recorded interest income of
    $24,157, $7,729 and $4,377 in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Marketable
    Securities

Marketable securities are comprised of investments in
    publicly-traded securities, classified as

available-for-sale,

and are recorded at market value with unrealized gains or
    losses, net of tax, reported as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive earnings within shareholders’ equity until
    realized. Unrealized losses are evaluated to determine the
    nature of the losses. If the losses are determined to be other
    than temporary, the basis of the security is adjusted and the
    loss is recognized in earnings at that time. These securities
    are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheets.

Accounts
    Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Credit is granted to customers predominantly on an unsecured
    basis. Credit limits and payment terms are established based on
    extensive evaluations made on an ongoing basis throughout the
    fiscal year with regard to the financial performance, cash
    generation, financing availability and liquidity status of each
    customer. The majority of customers are reviewed at least
    annually; more frequent reviews are performed based on the
    customer’s financial condition and the level of credit
    being extended. For customers on credit who are experiencing
    financial difficulties, management performs additional financial
    analyses before shipping orders. The Company uses a variety of
    financial transactions based on availability and cost, to
    increase the collectibility of certain of its accounts,
    including letters of credit, credit insurance, factoring with
    unrelated third parties, and requiring cash in advance of
    shipping.



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts at the
    time revenue is recognized based on management’s assessment
    of the business environment, customers’ financial
    condition, historical collection experience, accounts receivable
    aging and customer disputes. When a significant event occurs,
    such as a bankruptcy filing by a specific customer, and on a
    quarterly basis, the allowance is reviewed for adequacy and the
    balance or accrual rate is adjusted to reflect current risk
    prospects.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out) or market. Based upon a consideration of quantities
    on hand, actual and projected sales volume, anticipated product
    selling price and product lines planned to be discontinued,
    slow-moving and obsolete inventory is written down to its net
    realizable value.

At December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004, finished
    goods comprised 89% and 92% of inventories, respectively.

Long-Lived
    Assets

The Company’s long-lived assets consist of property, plant
    and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
    lives as well as other intangibles assets the Company considers
    to have a defined life.

Goodwill results from purchase method acquisitions the Company
    has made over time. Substantially all of the other intangibles
    consist of the cost of acquired product rights. In establishing
    the value of such rights, the Company considers, but does not
    individually value, existing trademarks, copyrights, patents,
    license agreements and other product-related rights. These
    rights were valued at their acquisition date based on the
    anticipated future cash flows from the underlying product line.
    The Company has certain intangible assets related to the Tonka
    and Milton Bradley acquisitions that have an indefinite life,
    and amortization of these assets has been suspended until a
    remaining useful life can be determined.

Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives
    are not amortized and are tested for impairment at least
    annually. The annual test begins with goodwill and all
    intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units.
    Goodwill is then tested using a two-step process that begins
    with an estimation of fair value of the reporting unit using an
    income approach, which looks to the present value of expected
    future cash flows. The first step is a screen for potential
    impairment while the second step measures the amount of
    impairment if there is an indication from the first step that
    one exists. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested
    annually for impairment by comparing their carrying value to
    their estimated fair value, also calculated using the income
    approach.

The remaining intangibles having defined lives are being
    amortized over three to twenty-five years, primarily using the
    straight-line method. Approximately 11% of other intangibles
    relate to rights acquired in connection with major motion
    picture entertainment properties and are being amortized over
    the contract life, in proportion to projected sales of the
    licensed products during the same period.

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less
    accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and
    amortization are computed using accelerated and straight-line
    methods to amortize the cost of property, plant and equipment
    over their estimated useful lives. The principal lives, in
    years, used in determining depreciation rates of various assets
    are: land improvements 15 to 19, buildings and improvements
    15 to 25 and machinery and equipment 3 to 12. Tools, dies and
    molds are amortized over a three-year period or their useful
    lives, whichever is less, using an accelerated method.

The Company reviews property, plant and equipment and other
    intangibles with defined lives for impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the
    carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets
    were considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized
    would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of
    the assets exceeds their fair value. Fair value is determined
    based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending on
    the nature of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are carried at
    the lower of the net book value or their fair value less
    disposal costs.

Financial
    Instruments

Hasbro’s financial instruments include cash and cash
    equivalents, accounts receivable, marketable securities, short-
    and long-term borrowings, accounts payable and accrued
    liabilities. At December 25, 2005, the carrying cost of
    these instruments approximated their fair value. Its financial
    instruments also include foreign currency forwards and options
    (see note 13) as well as interest rate swap agreements
    (see note 7). At December 25, 2005, the carrying value
    of these instruments approximated their fair value based on
    quoted or publicly available market information.

Securitization
    and Transfer of Financial Instruments

Hasbro has an agreement that allows the Company to sell, on an
    ongoing basis, an undivided interest in certain of its trade
    accounts receivable through a revolving securitization
    arrangement. The Company retains servicing responsibilities for,
    as well as a subordinate interest in the transferred
    receivables. Hasbro accounts for the securitization of trade
    accounts receivable as a sale in accordance with
    SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and
    Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of
    Liabilities” (“SFAS 140”). As a result, the
    related receivables are removed from the consolidated balance
    sheet.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue from product sales is recognized upon the passing of
    title to the customer, generally at the time of shipment.
    Provisions for discounts, rebates and returns are made when the
    related revenues are recognized. The Company bases its estimates
    for discounts, rebates and returns on agreed customer terms and
    historical experience.

The Company enters into arrangements licensing its brand names
    on specifically approved products. The licensees pay the Company
    royalties as products are sold, in some cases subject to annual
    minimum guaranteed amounts. Royalty revenues are recognized as
    they are reported as earned and payment becomes assured, over
    the life of the agreement. Revenue from product sales less
    related provisions for discounts, rebates and returns, as well
    as royalty revenues comprise net revenues in the consolidated
    statements of operations.

Royalties

The Company enters into license agreements with inventors,
    designers and others for the use of intellectual properties in
    its products. These agreements may call for payment in advance
    or future payment for minimum guaranteed amounts. Amounts paid
    in advance are recorded as an asset and charged to expense as
    revenue from the related products is recognized. If all or a
    portion of the minimum guaranteed amounts appear not to be
    recoverable through future use of the rights obtained under
    license, the nonrecoverable portion of the guaranty is charged
    to expense at that time.



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

Advertising

Production costs of commercials and programming are charged to
    operations in the fiscal year during which the production is
    first aired. The costs of other advertising, promotion and
    marketing programs are charged to operations in the fiscal year
    incurred.

Shipping
    and Handling

Hasbro expenses costs related to the shipment and handling of
    goods to customers as incurred. For 2005, 2004, and 2003, these
    costs were $144,953, $144,620 and $149,702, respectively, and
    are included in selling, distribution and administration
    expenses.

Operating
    Leases

Hasbro records lease expense in such a manner as to recognize
    this expense on a straight-line basis inclusive of rent
    concessions and rent increases. Reimbursements from lessors for
    leasehold improvements are deferred and recognized as a
    reduction to lease expense over the lease term.

Income
    Taxes

Hasbro uses the asset and liability approach for financial
    accounting and reporting of income taxes. Deferred income taxes
    have not been provided on undistributed earnings of
    international subsidiaries as substantially all of such earnings
    are indefinitely reinvested by the Company. See note 8,
    which includes discussion of the American Jobs Creation Act of
    2004.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into
    U.S. dollars at period-end rates, and revenues, costs and
    expenses are translated at weighted average rates during each
    reporting period. Earnings include gains or losses resulting
    from foreign currency transactions as well as translation gains
    and losses resulting from the use of the U.S. dollar as the
    functional currency in highly inflationary economies. Other
    gains and losses resulting from translation of financial
    statements are a component of other comprehensive earnings.

Pension
    Plans, Postretirement and Postemployment
    Benefits

Hasbro, except for certain international subsidiaries, has
    pension plans covering substantially all of its full-time
    employees. Pension expense is based on actuarial computations of
    current and future benefits. The Company’s policy is to
    fund amounts which are required by applicable regulations and
    which are tax deductible. In 2006, the Company expects to
    contribute approximately $21,000 to its pension plans. The
    estimated amounts of future payments to be made under other
    retirement programs are being accrued currently over the period
    of active employment and are also included in pension expense.

Hasbro has a contributory postretirement health and life
    insurance plan covering substantially all employees who retire
    under any of its United States defined benefit pension plans and
    meet certain age and length of service requirements. It also has
    several plans covering certain groups of employees, which may
    provide benefits to such employees following their period of
    employment but prior to their retirement. The Company measures
    the costs of these obligations based on actuarial computations.

Risk
    Management Contracts

Hasbro uses foreign currency forward and option contracts,
    generally purchased for terms of not more than eighteen months,
    to mitigate the impact of adverse currency rate fluctuations on
    firmly committed and



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

projected future foreign currency transactions. These

over-the-counter

contracts, which hedge future purchases of inventory and other
    cross-border currency requirements not denominated in the
    functional currency of the unit, are primarily denominated in
    United States and Hong Kong dollars, Euros and United Kingdom
    pound sterling and are entered into with counterparties who are
    major financial institutions. The Company believes any risk
    related to default by a counterparty to be remote. Hasbro does
    not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative
    purposes.

At the inception of the contracts, Hasbro designates its
    derivatives as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The
    Company formally documents all relationships between hedging
    instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management
    objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge
    transactions. All hedges designated as cash flow hedges are
    linked to forecasted transactions and the Company assesses, both
    at the inception of the hedge and on an on-going basis, the
    effectiveness of the derivatives used in hedging transactions in
    offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items. The
    ineffective portion of a hedging derivative is immediately
    recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.

The Company records all derivatives, such as foreign currency
    exchange contracts, on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes
    in the derivative fair values that are designated effective and
    qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred and recorded as a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings
    (“AOCE”) until the hedged transactions occur and are
    then recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.
    The Company’s foreign currency contracts hedging
    anticipated cash flows are designated as cash flow hedges. When
    it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a
    hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively.
    Any gain or loss deferred through that date remains in AOCE
    until the forecasted transaction occurs, at which time it is
    reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations. To
    the extent the transaction is no longer deemed probable of
    occurring, hedge accounting treatment is discontinued
    prospectively and amounts deferred would be reclassified to the
    consolidated statements of operations. In the event hedge
    accounting requirements are not met, gains and losses on such
    instruments are included currently in the statements of
    operations. The Company uses derivatives to hedge intercompany
    loans denominated in foreign currencies. Due to the short-term
    nature of the contracts involved, the Company does not use hedge
    accounting for these contracts.

The Company also uses interest rate swap agreements to adjust
    the amount of long-term debt subject to fixed interest rates.
    The interest rate swaps are matched with specific long-term debt
    obligations and are designated and effective as fair value
    hedges of the change in fair value of those debt obligations.
    These agreements are recorded at their fair value as an asset or
    liability. Gains and losses on these contracts are included
    currently in the consolidated statements of operations and are
    wholly offset by changes in the fair value of the related
    long-term debt. These hedges are considered to be perfectly
    effective under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities,” as amended by Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 138 (collectively
    “SFAS 133”). The interest rate swap contracts are
    with a number of major financial institutions in order to
    minimize counterparty credit risk. The Company believes that it
    is unlikely that any of its counterparties will be unable to
    perform under the terms of the contracts.

Accounting
    for Stock-Based Compensation

At December 25, 2005, the Company had stock-based employee
    compensation plans and plans for non-employee members of the
    Company’s Board of Directors, which are described more
    fully in note 10. As permitted by Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 123, as amended by No. 148,
    “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”,
    (collectively “SFAS 123”) Hasbro accounts for
    those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of
    Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
    “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”, and
    related interpretations. As required by the Company’s
    existing stock plans, stock options are

granted at or above the fair market value of the Company’s
    stock and, accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized
    for these grants in the consolidated statements of operations.
    The Company records compensation expense related to other
    stock-based awards, such as restricted stock grants, over the
    period the award vests, typically three years. Had compensation
    expense been recorded under the fair value method as set forth
    in the provisions of SFAS 123 for stock options awarded,
    the impact on the Company’s net earnings and earnings per
    share would have been:

On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised
    2004), “Share-Based Payment”
    (“SFAS 123(R)”), which amends SFAS 123 and
    SFAS 95 “Statement of Cash Flows”.
    SFAS 123(R) requires companies to measure all employee
    stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and
    record such expense in its consolidated financial statements. In
    addition, the adoption of SFAS 123(R) requires additional
    accounting and disclosure related to the income tax and cash
    flow effects resulting from share-based payment arrangements.
    SFAS 123(R) is effective for the Company as of
    December 26, 2005, the first day of the 2006 fiscal year.
    The Company will adopt SFAS 123(R) on the prospective basis
    as defined in the statement. Under this adoption method, the
    Company will record expense relating to employee stock-based
    compensation awards in the periods subsequent to adoption. This
    expense will be based on all unvested options as of the adoption
    date as well as all future stock-based compensation awards.
    Based on the current options outstanding, the Company’s
    2006 pretax expense for those options is expected to be between
    $16,000 and $17,000. This amount may increase to the extent any
    options are granted in 2006.

Earnings
    Per Common Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings by
    the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the year.
    Diluted earnings per share is similar except that the weighted
    average number of shares outstanding is increased by dilutive
    securities, and net earnings are adjusted for certain amounts
    related to dilutive securities. Dilutive securities include
    shares issuable under convertible debt, as well as shares
    issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants for which
    market price exceeds exercise price, less shares which could
    have been purchased by the Company with the related proceeds.
    Dilutive securities may also

include shares potentially issuable to settle liabilities.
    Options and warrants totaling 6,018, 10,207 and 3,451 for 2005,
    2004 and 2003, respectively, were excluded from the calculation
    of diluted earnings per share because to include them would have
    been antidilutive.

A reconciliation of earnings before cumulative effect of

In December 2004, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force
    (“EITF”)

Issue 04-8,

“The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on
    Diluted Earnings per Share”, which states that the dilutive
    effect of contingent convertible debt instruments must be
    included in dilutive earnings per share regardless of whether
    the triggering contingency has been satisfied. The earnings per
    share calculations for the three years ended December 25,
    2005 include adjustments to add back to earnings the interest
    expense, net of tax, incurred on the Company’s Senior
    Convertible Debentures due 2021, as well as add back to
    outstanding shares the amount of shares potentially issuable as
    if the contingent conversion features were met.

As a result of the adoption in 2003 of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 150 “Accounting for Certain
    Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Liabilities and
    Equity” (note 6), certain warrants containing a put
    feature that may be settled in cash or common stock are required
    to be accounted for as a liability at fair value. The Company is
    required to assess if these warrants, classified as a liability,
    have a more dilutive impact on earnings per share when treated
    as an equity contract. As of December 25, 2005 and
    December 26, 2004, the warrants had a more dilutive impact
    on earnings per share, assuming they were treated as an equity
    contract. Accordingly, the numerator includes an adjustment to
    earnings for the income

included therein related to the fair market value adjustment and
    the denominator includes an adjustment for the shares issuable
    as of those dates. As of December 28, 2003, the warrants
    had a more dilutive impact on earnings per share, assuming they
    were treated as a liability contract. Accordingly, the charge to
    earnings for the change in fair value of the contract in 2003 is
    not eliminated and no shares related to this warrant were
    included in dilutive securities.

Other
    Comprehensive Earnings

The Company’s other comprehensive earnings (loss) for the

Reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive earnings
    to earnings in 2005, 2004 and 2003 were net of related income
    taxes of $89, $1,724 and $378, respectively. The
    reclassification adjustment for 2004 includes an impairment
    charge relating to other than temporary decreases in the value
    of the Company’s

available-for-sale

securities. In accordance with Hasbro’s marketable
    securities accounting policy, as the result of the decline in
    the fair value of the Company’s investment in Infogrames
    Entertainment SA common stock, the Company adjusted the basis of
    this investment and recorded a pretax charge to earnings in the
    amount of $8,988. The remainder of the reclassification
    adjustments in 2004, as well as the 2005 and 2003
    reclassification adjustments include net losses on cash flow
    hedging derivatives for which the related transaction has
    impacted earnings and was reflected in cost of sales.

The related tax benefit (expense) of other comprehensive
    earnings items was $3,960, $(283), and $(2,199) for the years
    2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Goodwill
    and Intangibles

Goodwill and certain intangible assets relating to rights
    obtained in the Company’s acquisition of Milton Bradley in
    1984 and Tonka in 1991 are not amortized. These rights were
    determined to have indefinite lives and total approximately
    $75,700. The Company’s other intangible assets are
    amortized over their remaining useful lives, and accumulated
    amortization of these other intangibles is reflected in other
    intangibles, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

The Company performs an annual impairment test for goodwill and
    intangible assets with indefinite lives. This annual impairment
    test is performed in the fourth quarter of the Company’s
    fiscal year. In addition, if an event occurs or circumstances
    change that indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable, the Company will perform an interim impairment test
    at that time. For the three fiscal years ended December 25,
    2005, no such events occurred. The Company completed its annual
    impairment tests in the fourth quarters of 2005, 2004 and 2003,
    which indicated that there was no impairment.

    purposes of testing pursuant to Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 142, these assets are allocated to
    the reporting units within the Company’s operating

On September 9, 2005, the Company purchased the assets and
    assumed certain liabilities of Wrebbit Inc., a Montreal-based
    creator and manufacturer of innovative puzzles. The purchase
    price was approximately $14,200. Based on the allocation of the
    purchase price, property rights related to acquired product
    lines of approximately $10,900 were recorded in connection with
    this acquisition. These property rights are being amortized over
    a ten year life. No goodwill was recorded as a result of this
    acquisition.

During June 2005, the Company reacquired the digital gaming
    rights for all its owned or controlled properties from
    Infogrames Entertainment SA (Infogrames) for $65,000. These
    rights were previously held by Infogrames on an exclusive basis
    as a result of a license agreement entered into during 2000 with
    an expiration date in 2016. The consideration paid to reacquire
    these rights, which represents fair value, is included as a
    component of acquired product rights and is being amortized over
    a

10-year

period. In addition, the Company



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

and Infogrames entered into a new licensing agreement that
    provides Infogrames exclusive rights to
    DUNGEONS  & DRAGONS and rights to nine other
    properties for a limited number of platforms. Under the new
    license agreement, the Company will receive royalty income on
    Infogrames sales.

The Company will continue to incur amortization expense related
    to the use of acquired and licensed rights to produce various
    products. The amortization of these product rights will
    fluctuate depending on related projected revenues during an
    annual period, as well as rights reaching the end of their
    useful lives. The Company currently estimates continuing
    amortization expense for the next five years to be approximately:

Financing
    Arrangements

Short-Term
    Borrowings

At December 25, 2005, Hasbro had available an unsecured
    committed line and unsecured uncommitted lines of credit from
    various banks approximating $350,000 and $206,200, respectively.
    A significant portion of the short-term borrowings outstanding
    at the end of 2005 and 2004 represents borrowings made under, or
    supported by, these lines of credit. The weighted average
    interest rates of the outstanding borrowings as of
    December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004 were 4.2% and
    3.9%, respectively. The Company had no borrowings outstanding
    under its committed line of credit at December 25, 2005.
    During 2005, Hasbro’s working capital needs were fulfilled
    by cash generated from operations, borrowing under lines of
    credit, and the Company’s accounts receivable
    securitization program. Borrowings under the lines of credit
    were on terms and at interest rates generally extended to
    companies of comparable creditworthiness.

The Company’s committed revolving credit facility of
    $350,000 matures in March 2007. During the first quarter of
    2005, the Company entered into an amendment of its bank
    agreement, which reduced the interest rate margin and commitment
    fees on certain borrowings, eliminated the provisions that,
    under some circumstances, provided lenders with security
    interests in certain of the Company’s assets, and
    eliminated the $100,000 step down of available funds ($50,000 in
    both March and November 2005). The amendment also increased the
    Company’s flexibility to repurchase common stock, provided
    it maintains a debt to capitalization ratio at or below 30%, and
    increased the Company’s acquisition capacity from $100,000
    to $400,000 per annum, cumulative. The Company is not
    required to maintain compensating balances under the agreement.
    The Company pays a fee (currently .20%) based on the unused
    portion of the facility and interest equal to Libor or Prime
    plus a spread (currently 1.20% or 0.00%, respectively) on
    borrowings under the facility. The amount of the spread to Libor
    or Prime varies based on the Company’s long-term debt
    ratings. If the Company fails to maintain certain financial
    ratios or if the credit rating of the Company drops below BB or
    Ba3, borrowings under the agreement would be secured by
    substantially all domestic inventory as well as certain
    intangible assets.

The agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting
    forth minimum cash flow and coverage requirements, and a number
    of other limitations, including restrictions on capital
    expenditures, investments, acquisitions, share repurchases,
    incurrence of indebtedness, and dividend payments. The Company
    was in compliance with all covenants as of and for the year
    ended December 25, 2005.

Securitization

In December 2003, the Company entered into a three-year
    receivable securitization program. Under this program, the
    Company sells, on an ongoing basis, substantially all of its
    domestic trade receivables to a bankruptcy-remote, special
    purpose subsidiary, Hasbro Receivables Funding, LLC (HRF), which
    is wholly owned and consolidated by the Company. HRF will,
    subject to certain conditions, sell, from time to time on a
    revolving basis, an undivided fractional ownership interest in
    up to $250,000 of eligible domestic receivables to various
    multi-party commercial paper conduits supported by a committed
    liquidity facility. Under the terms of the agreement, new
    receivables are added to the pool as collections reduce
    previously held receivables. The Company expects to service,
    administer, and collect the receivables on behalf of HRF and the
    conduits. The net proceeds of sale will be less than the face
    amount of accounts receivable sold by an amount that
    approximates the purchaser’s financing costs.

The receivables facility contains certain restrictions on the
    Company and HRF that are customary for facilities of this type.
    The commitments under the facility are subject to termination
    prior to their term upon the occurrence of certain events,
    including payment defaults, breach of covenants, breach of
    representations or warranties, bankruptcy, and failure of the
    receivables to satisfy certain performance criteria.

As of December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004 the
    utilization of the receivables facility was $250,000 and
    $206,055, respectively, which were the maximum available to the
    Company to sell under this program. The transactions are
    accounted for as sales under SFAS 140. During 2005 and
    2004, the loss on the sale of the receivables totaled $6,925 and
    $2,995, respectively, which is recorded in selling, distribution
    and administration expenses in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of operations. The discount on interests sold is
    approximately equal to the interest rate paid by the conduits to
    the holders of the commercial paper plus other fees. The
    discount rate as of December 25, 2005 was approximately
    4.30%.

Upon sale to the conduits, HRF continues to hold a subordinated
    retained interest in the receivables. The subordinated interest
    in receivables is recorded at fair value, which is determined
    based on the present value of future expected cash flows
    estimated using management’s best estimates of credit
    losses and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved.
    Due to the short-term nature of trade receivables, the carrying
    amount, less allowances, approximates fair value. Variations in
    the credit and discount assumptions would not significantly
    impact fair value.

The Company currently has a warrant amendment agreement with
    Lucas Licensing Ltd. that provides the Company with a call
    option through October  13, 2016 to purchase all of
    these warrants from Lucas for a price to be paid at the
    Company’s election of either $200,000 in cash or the
    equivalent of $220,000 in shares of the Company’s common
    stock, such stock being valued at the time of the exercise of
    the option. Also, the warrant amendment agreement provides Lucas
    with a put option through January 2008 to sell all of these
    warrants to the Company for a price to be paid at the
    Company’s election of either $100,000 in cash or the

equivalent of $110,000 in shares of the Company’s common
    stock, such stock being valued at the time of the exercise of
    the option.

On June 30, 2003, the first day of the third quarter of
    fiscal 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 150, “Accounting for Certain
    Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Liabilities and
    Equity”, (“SFAS 150”), which establishes
    standards for issuers’ classification as liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheet of certain financial instruments that
    have characteristics of both liabilities and equity.

In accordance with SFAS 150, due to the put feature of the
    warrants, in 2003 the Company reclassified the historic value of
    the above warrants of $107,669 from equity to current
    liabilities, and recorded a charge for the cumulative effect of
    an accounting change of $17,351, or $0.09 per diluted
    share, to adjust the warrants to their fair value as of that
    date. Under SFAS 150, the Company is required to adjust the
    warrants to their fair value through earnings at the end of each
    reporting period. In accordance with SFAS 150, during 2005,
    2004 and the last half of 2003, the Company recorded income
    (expense) of $2,080, $12,710 and $(13,630) respectively, to
    adjust the warrants to their fair value. This income (expense)
    is included in other (income) expense, net in the consolidated
    statement of operations. There is no tax benefit or expense
    associated with the cumulative effect charge and subsequent fair
    value adjustments.

Should either the put or call option be required to be settled,
    the Company believes that it will have adequate funds available
    to settle them in cash if necessary. Had this option been
    exercised at December 25, 2005 and the Company had elected
    to settle this option in the Company’s stock, the Company
    would have been required to issue 5,396 shares. If the
    share price of the Company’s common stock were higher as of
    December 25, 2005 the number of shares issuable would have
    decreased. If the share price were lower as of December 25,
    2005, the number of shares issuable would have increased.

Included in current portion in 2004 was $250,000 of Senior
    Convertible Debentures due 2021. Although the contractual
    maturity date of these notes is 2021, the holders of these
    debentures could, at their option, put the notes back to the
    Company in December 2005. In December of 2005, $4 of these notes
    were put back to the Company and were repaid in cash. The
    remaining $249,996 of these notes have been reclassified to
    long-term debt at December 25, 2005. The provisions of this
    convertible debenture are further discussed below.

In 2005, the Company repaid $71,970 in principal amount of
    5.6% notes due November 2005.

In addition to the convertible debentures put back to the
    Company in December 2005 and the $71,970 of contractual
    maturities, the Company used proceeds from the sale of certain
    facilities, primarily its former manufacturing facility in Spain
    to repay associated other long-term debt in the amount of
    $21,242 in the second quarter of 2005.

During 2004, the Company repurchased an aggregate of $55,658 in
    principal amount of long-term debt, comprised of $19,105 in
    principal amount of 6.60% Debentures due 2028, $10,908 in
    principal amount of 6.15% Notes due 2008, and $25,645 in
    principal amount of 5.60% Notes due 2005. The Company
    recorded a loss on repurchase of $1,277, which is included in
    other (income) expense, net in the accompanying consolidated
    statement of operations.

In November 2003, the Company initiated a tender offer, whereby
    $167,257 of aggregate principal amount of 8.50% notes due
    2006 previously issued by the Company were repurchased. In
    connection with this tender offer, the Company recorded a loss
    on the extinguishment of debt in the amount of $20,342, which is
    included in other (income) expense, net in the accompanying
    consolidated statement of operations.

The Company is a party to interest rate swap agreements in order
    to adjust the amount of total debt that is subject to fixed
    interest rates. The interest rate swaps are matched with
    specific long-term debt obligations and accounted for as fair
    value hedges of those debt obligations. At December 25,
    2005, these interest rate swaps had a total notional amount of
    $100,000 with maturities between 2006 and 2008. In each of the
    contracts, the Company receives payments based upon a fixed
    interest rate that matches the interest rate of the debt being
    hedged and makes payments based upon a floating rate based on
    Libor. These contracts are designated and effective as hedges of
    the change in the fair value of the associated debt. At
    December 25, 2005, these contracts had a fair value of
    $663, with $636 included in other assets, and the other $27
    included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, with
    corresponding fair value adjustments to increase long-term debt
    and current portion of long-term debt, respectively.

The Company currently has $249,996 outstanding in principal
    amount of contingent convertible debentures due 2021. These
    debentures bear interest at 2.75%, which could be subject to an
    upward adjustment commencing in December 2005 depending on the
    price of the Company’s stock. If the closing price of the
    Company’s stock exceeds $23.76 for at least 20 trading
    days, within the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the
    last trading day of the calendar quarter, the holders have the
    right to convert the notes to shares of the Company’s
    common stock at the initial conversion price of $21.60 in the
    next calendar quarter. This contingent conversion feature was
    not met during 2005. The holders of these debentures may put the
    notes back to Hasbro in December 2011 and December 2016. At
    these times, the purchase price may be paid in cash, shares of
    common stock or a combination of the two, at the discretion of
    the Company.

The cumulative effect of accounting change in 2003 is shown net
    of tax on the statement of operations. There was no tax expense
    or benefit related to this amount.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
    (the “Act”) was signed into law. The Act created a
    one-time incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate
    undistributed earnings from their international subsidiaries by
    providing an 85% dividends-received deduction for certain
    international earnings. The deduction was available to
    corporations during the tax year that includes October 22,
    2004 or in the immediately subsequent tax year. In the fourth
    quarter of 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors approved
    a plan to repatriate approximately $547,000 in foreign earnings,
    which was completed in December 2005. The tax expense related to
    this repatriation was $25,844.

Certain tax benefits (expenses) are not reflected in income
    taxes in the statements of operations. Such benefits of $8,426
    in 2005, $6,675 in 2004, and $6,108 in 2003, relate primarily to
    stock options. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, the deferred tax portion
    of the total benefit (expense) was $4,563, $(283), and $(2,199),
    respectively.

Hasbro has a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets at
    December 25, 2005 of $23,333, which is a decrease of $1,380
    from $24,713 at December 26, 2004. The valuation allowance
    pertains to United States and International loss carryforwards,
    some of which have no expiration and others that would expire
    beginning in 2006. If the operating loss carryforwards are fully
    realized, $263 will reduce goodwill and the balance will reduce
    future income tax expense.

Based on Hasbro’s history of taxable income and the
    anticipation of sufficient taxable income in years when the
    temporary differences are expected to become tax deductions, it
    believes that it will realize the benefit of the deferred tax
    assets, net of the existing valuation allowance.

Deferred income taxes of $103,209 and $93,134 at the end of 2005
    and 2004, respectively, are included as a component of prepaid
    expenses and other current assets, and $58,075 and $41,539,
    respectively, are included as a component of other assets. At
    the same dates, deferred income taxes of $200 and $421,

Notes to

(Thousands

respectively, are included as a component of accrued
    liabilities, and $1,630 and $2,339, respectively, are included
    as a component of deferred liabilities.

The cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of Hasbro’s
    international subsidiaries held for reinvestment is
    approximately $430,000 at December 25, 2005. In the event
    that all international undistributed earnings were remitted to
    the United States, the amount of incremental taxes would be
    approximately $88,000.

Capital
    Stock

Preference
    Share Purchase Rights

Hasbro maintains a Preference Share Purchase Rights Plan (the
    “Rights Plan”). Under the terms of the Rights Plan,
    each share of common stock is accompanied by a Preference Share
    Purchase Right (“Right”). Each Right is only
    exercisable under certain circumstances and, until exercisable,
    the Rights are not transferable apart from Hasbro’s common
    stock. When exercisable, each Right will entitle its holder to
    purchase until June 30, 2009, in certain merger or other
    business combination or recapitalization transactions, at the
    Right’s then current exercise price, a number of the
    acquiring company’s or Hasbro’s, as the case may be,
    common shares having a market value at that time of twice the
    Right’s exercise price. Under certain circumstances, the
    Company may substitute cash, other assets, equity securities or
    debt securities for the common stock. At the option of the Board
    of Directors of Hasbro (“the Board”), the rightholder
    may, under certain circumstances, receive shares of
    Hasbro’s stock in exchange for Rights.

Prior to the acquisition by a person or group of beneficial
    ownership of a certain percentage of Hasbro’s common stock,
    the Rights are redeemable for $.01 per Right. The Rights
    Plan contains certain exceptions with respect to the Hassenfeld
    family and related entities.

Common
    Stock

In May 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
    the repurchase of up to $350 million in common stock.
    Purchases of the Company’s common stock may be made from
    time to time, subject to market conditions, and may be made in
    the open market or through privately negotiated transactions.
    The Company has no obligation to repurchase shares under the
    authorization and the timing, actual number, and the value of
    the shares which are repurchased will depend on a number of
    factors, including the price of the Company’s common stock.
    This authorization replaces all prior authorizations. In 2005,
    the Company repurchased 2,386 shares at an average price of
    $20.10. The total cost of these repurchases, including
    transaction costs, was $48,030. In 2003, the Company repurchased
    common stock pursuant to the exercise of outstanding warrants
    under the terms of that warrant agreement.

(10)

Stock
    Options, Restricted Stock and Warrants

Hasbro has various stock incentive plans for employees and for
    non-employee members of the Board (collectively, the
    “plans”) and has reserved 25,691 shares of its
    common stock for issuance upon exercise of options and the grant
    of other awards granted or to be granted under the plans. These
    options generally vest in equal annual amounts over three to
    five years. The plans provide that options be granted at
    exercise prices not less than fair market value on the date the
    option is granted and options are adjusted for such changes as
    stock splits and stock dividends. Generally, options are
    exercisable for periods of no more than ten years after date of
    grant. Certain of the plans permit the granting of awards in the
    form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards
    and cash awards in addition to options.

The Company issued restricted stock and granted deferred
    restricted stock units to certain key employees of 35 during
    2003. The Company did not issue or grant any restricted stock or
    deferred restricted stock units during 2005 or 2004. These
    shares or units are nontransferable and subject to forfeiture
    for periods prescribed



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

by the Company. Upon granting of these awards, unearned
    compensation equivalent to the market value at the date of grant
    is charged to shareholders’ equity and subsequently
    amortized over the periods during which the restrictions lapse,
    generally 3 years. Amortization of deferred, unearned
    compensation relating to the restricted stock and deferred
    restricted stock units of $74, $138, and $172 was recorded in
    fiscal 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

The weighted average fair value of options granted in 2005,
    2004, and 2003 were $5.41, $6.32, and $4.93, respectively. The
    fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
    following weighted average assumptions used for grants in 2005,
    2004, and 2003, respectively: risk-free interest rates of 3.84%,
    3.85%, and 3.02%; expected dividend yields of 1.75%, 1.29%, and
    1.04% and expected volatility of approximately 29%, 40%, and
    43%. The weighted average assumptions used for expected option
    lives were approximately 5 years in 2005 and 2004, and
    approximately 6 years in 2003. Pro forma information
    regarding net earnings as required by SFAS No. 123,
    “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” has been
    determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee
    stock options under the fair value method (note 1).

Additionally, the Company has reserved 17,450 shares of its
    common stock for issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants.

Pension
    and Postretirement Benefits

Hasbro’s pension and 401(k) matching contribution costs for
    2005, 2004 and 2003 were approximately $28,800, $26,300, and
    $25,300, respectively.

United
    States Plans

Substantially all United States employees are covered under at
    least one of several non-contributory defined benefit pension
    plans maintained by the Company. Benefits under the two major
    plans which principally cover non-union employees, are based
    primarily on salary and years of service. One of these major
    plans is funded. Benefits under the remaining plans are based
    primarily on fixed amounts for specified years of service. Of
    these remaining plans, the plan covering union employees is also
    funded. At December 25, 2005, the two funded plans have
    plan assets of $208,625 and accumulated benefit obligations of
    $248,367. The unfunded plans have accumulated benefit
    obligations of $41,353.

Hasbro also provides certain postretirement health care and life
    insurance benefits to eligible employees who retire and have
    either attained age 65 with 5 years of service or
    age 55 with 10 years of service. The cost of providing
    these benefits on behalf of employees who retired prior to 1993
    is and will continue to be substantially borne by the Company.
    The cost of providing benefits on behalf of employees who retire
    after 1992 is shared, with the employee contributing an
    increasing percentage of the cost. This resulted in the plan
    being an employee-paid plan after the year 2002. The plan is not
    funded.

The provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Pensions”, required the Company to record an additional
    minimum pension liability for certain of the Company’s
    plans of $53,329 and $43,196 at December 25, 2005 and
    December 26, 2004, respectively. This liability represents
    the amount by which the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds
    the sum of the fair market value of plan assets and accrued
    amounts previously recorded. The additional minimum pension
    liability is offset by an intangible asset to the extent of
    previously unrecognized prior service cost. An intangible asset
    in the amount of $3,550 and $4,126 is included in other
    intangibles on the balance sheet as of December 25, 2005
    and December 26, 2004, respectively. The remaining amounts
    of $49,779 and $39,070 are recorded as components of AOCE, along
    with related deferred taxes of $18,916 and $14,847, at
    December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004, respectively.

Hasbro’s two major funded plans (the “Plans”) are
    defined benefit pension plans intended to provide retirement
    benefits to participants in accordance with the benefit
    structure established by Hasbro, Inc. The Plans’ investment
    managers, who exercise full investment discretion within
    guidelines outlined in the Plans’ Investment Policy, are
    charged with managing the assets with the care, skill, prudence
    and diligence that a prudent investment professional in similar
    circumstance would exercise. Investment practices, at a minimum,
    must comply with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
    (ERISA) and any other applicable laws and regulations.

The Plans’ shared primary investment goal is maximum total
    return, consistent with prudent investment management. The
    Plans’ asset allocations are structured to meet a long-term
    targeted total return consistent with the ongoing nature of the
    Plans’ liabilities. The shared long-term total return goal,
    presently 8.75%, includes income plus realized and unrealized
    gains

and/or

losses on the Plans’ assets. Utilizing generally accepted
    diversification techniques, the Plans’ assets, in aggregate
    and at the individual portfolio level, are invested so that the
    total portfolio risk exposure and risk-adjusted returns best
    meet the Plans’ long-term liabilities to employees. Plan
    asset allocations are reviewed at least quarterly and rebalanced
    to achieve target allocation among the asset categories when
    necessary.

The Plans’ investment managers are provided specific
    guidelines under which they are to invest the assets assigned to
    them. In general, investment managers are expected to remain
    fully invested in their asset class with further limitations of
    risk as related to investments in a single security, portfolio
    turnover and credit quality.

The Plans’ Investment Policy generally prohibits the use of
    derivatives associated with leverage and speculation, or
    investments in securities issued by Hasbro, Inc., except through
    index-related strategies (e.g. an S&P 500 Index Fund)

and/or

commingled funds. In addition, unless specifically approved by
    the Investment Committee (which is comprised of members of
    management, established by the Board to manage and control
    pension plan assets), certain securities, strategies, and
    investments are ineligible for inclusion within the Plans.

The Company measures its liabilities and related assets at

Hasbro works with external benefit investment specialists to
    assist in the development of the long-term rate of return
    assumptions used to model and determine the overall asset
    allocation. Forecast returns are based on the combination of
    historical returns, current market conditions and a forecast for
    the capital markets for the next 5-7 years. Approximately
    75% of the return assumption is based on the historical
    information and 25% is based on current or forward-looking
    information. All asset class assumptions are within certain
    bands around the long-term historical averages. Correlations are
    based primarily on historical return patterns.

If the health care cost trend rate were increased one percentage
    point in each year, the accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation at December 25, 2005 and the aggregate of the
    benefits earned during the period and the interest cost would
    have each increased by approximately 9% and 5%, respectively.

Hasbro has a retirement savings plan to which eligible employees
    may make contributions of up to 50% of their salary, as allowed
    under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The
    Company contributed approximately $8,700, $9,600, and $8,400 to
    the plan in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

International
    Plans

Pension coverage for employees of Hasbro’s international
    subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate,
    through separate defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
    At December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004, the
    defined benefit plans had total projected benefit obligations of
    $58,206 and $52,416, respectively, accumulated benefit
    obligations of $46,557 and $42,812, respectively, and fair
    values of plan assets of $40,397 and $37,624, respectively.
    Substantially all of the plan assets are invested in equity and
    fixed income securities. The pension expense related to these
    plans was $3,073 for fiscal 2005 and $2,312 for fiscal 2004. At
    December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004, the Company
    has recorded an additional minimum pension liability related to
    these international plans of $3,100 and $1,322, respectively.
    This additional minimum pension liability is offset by an
    intangible asset in the amount of $206 at December 25, 2005
    and $46 as of December 26, 2004. The remaining amounts of
    $2,894 and $1,271 as of December 25, 2005 and
    December 26, 2004, respectively, are recorded as a separate
    component of AOCE, along with related deferred taxes of $902 and
    $452, respectively. Assumptions used to calculate the benefit
    obligations and pension expense for these plans vary depending
    on each plan and are based on factors specific to each country.

Postemployment
    Benefits

Hasbro has several plans covering certain groups of employees,
    which may provide benefits to such employees following their
    period of active employment but prior to their retirement. These
    plans include certain severance plans which provide benefits to
    employees involuntarily terminated and certain plans which
    continue the Company’s health and life insurance
    contributions for employees who have left Hasbro’s employ
    under terms of its long-term disability plan.

(12)

Leases

Hasbro occupies certain offices and uses certain equipment under
    various operating lease arrangements. The rent expense under
    such arrangements, net of sublease income which is not material,
    for 2005, 2004, and 2003 amounted to $35,570, $36,576, and
    $48,015, respectively.

Minimum rentals, net of minimum sublease income, which is not
    material, under long-term operating leases for the five years
    subsequent to 2005 and in the aggregate are as follows:

All leases expire prior to the end of 2018. Real estate taxes,
    insurance and maintenance expenses are generally obligations of
    the Company. It is expected that in the normal course of
    business, leases that expire will be renewed or replaced by
    leases on other properties; thus, it is anticipated that future
    minimum lease commitments will not be less than the amounts
    shown for 2005.

In addition, Hasbro leases certain facilities which, as a result
    of restructurings, are no longer in use. Future costs relating
    to such facilities were accrued as a component of the original
    charge and are not included in the table above.

(13)

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Hasbro uses foreign currency forwards and options, generally
    purchased for terms of not more than eighteen months, to reduce
    the impact of currency rate fluctuations on firmly committed and
    projected future foreign currency transactions.

(Thousands

During 2005, 2004, and 2003, the Company reclassified net
    losses, net of tax, from other comprehensive income to earnings
    of $2,005, $9,111, and $8,799, respectively, which included
    gains (losses) of $509, $(163), and $(436), respectively, as the
    result of ineffectiveness.

The remaining balance in AOCE at December 25, 2005 of
    $3,848 represents a net unrealized gain on foreign currency
    contracts relating to hedges of inventory purchased during the
    fourth quarter of 2005 or forecasted to be purchased during 2006
    and intercompany expenses and royalty payments expected to be
    paid or received during 2006. These amounts will be transferred
    to the consolidated statement of operations upon the sale of the
    related inventory and receipt or payment of the related
    royalties and expenses. The Company expects substantially all of
    the balance in AOCE to be reclassified to the consolidated
    statement of operations within the next 12 months.

The Company also enters into derivative instruments to offset
    changes in the fair value of intercompany loans due to the
    impact of foreign currency changes. The Company recorded a net
    loss on these instruments to other (income) expense, net of
    $60,014, $30,882, and $13,545 in 2005, 2004, and 2003,
    respectively, relating to the change in fair value of such
    derivatives, substantially offsetting gains from the change in
    fair value of intercompany loans to which the contracts relate
    included in other (income) expense, net.

(14)

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Hasbro had unused open letters of credit of approximately
    $33,619 and $13,300 at December 25, 2005 and
    December 26, 2004, respectively.

The Company enters into license agreements with inventors,
    designers and others for the use of intellectual properties in
    its products. Certain of these agreements contain provisions for
    the payment of guaranteed or minimum royalty amounts.
    Additionally, the Company has a long-term commitment related to
    promotional and marketing activities at a U.S. based theme
    park. Under terms of currently existing agreements as of
    December 25, 2005, Hasbro may, provided the other party
    meets their contractual commitment, be required to pay amounts
    as follows:


$

27,500


14,940


12,130


7,100


5,100

$

66,770

In addition to the above commitments, in January 2006, the
    Company entered into a five-year royalty agreement with Marvel
    Entertainment, Inc. and Marvel Characters, Inc. (together
    “Marvel”) to develop products based on certain Marvel
    properties for retail sale beginning on January 1, 2007.
    The agreement requires Hasbro to make guaranteed minimum
    payments in the amount of $205,000. Of these required minimum
    payments, $100,000 was paid in February 2006, $70,000 is
    expected to be paid in 2007 and the remainder is expected to be
    paid upon the release of a motion picture whose release date is
    yet to be determined. The agreement also imposes minimum
    marketing commitments on the Company, including the expenditure
    of $15,000 in connection with a theatrical release expected to
    occur in 2007.

In addition, the Company has $37,107 of prepaid royalties
    included as a component of prepaid expenses and other current
    assets in the balance sheet. The long-term portion of advances
    paid of $89,408 is included in other assets. Advanced royalties
    paid and guaranteed or minimum royalties to be paid relate to
    anticipated revenues in the years 2006 through 2018.

At December 25, 2005, the Company had approximately
    $171,551 in outstanding purchase commitments.

Hasbro is party to certain legal proceedings, none of which,
    individually or in the aggregate, is deemed to be material to
    the financial condition of the Company.

Segment
    Reporting

Segment
    and Geographic Information

Hasbro is a worldwide leader in children’s and family
    leisure time and entertainment products and services, including
    the design, manufacture and marketing of games and toys ranging
    from traditional to

high-tech.

The Company’s main reportable segments for the three years
    ended December 25, 2005 are U.S. Toys, Games and
    International. In addition, the Company has one other segment,
    Operations, which meets the quantitative thresholds for
    reportable segments.

In the United States, the U.S. Toys segment includes the
    development, marketing and selling of boys’ action figures,
    vehicles and playsets, girls’ toys, preschool toys and
    infant products, creative play products, electronic interactive
    products, children’s consumer electronics, electronic
    learning aids and toy-related specialty products. The Games
    segment includes the development, manufacturing, marketing and
    selling of traditional board games and puzzles, electronic
    games, as well as trading card and role-playing games. Within
    the International segment, the Company develops, manufactures,
    markets and sells both toy and game products in

non-U.S. markets.

The Operations segment sources finished product for the majority
    of the Company’s segments. The Company also has other
    segments that primarily license out certain toy and game
    properties and a retail segment, which operated retail stores
    prior to December 2003. The Company announced the closure of
    these stores in December 2003. These other segments do not meet
    the quantitative thresholds for reportable segments and have
    been combined for reporting purposes.

Segment performance is measured at the operating profit level.
    Included in Corporate and eliminations are general corporate
    expenses, the elimination of intersegment transactions and
    certain assets benefiting more than one segment. Intersegment
    sales and transfers are reflected in management reports at
    amounts approximating cost. Certain shared costs are allocated
    to segments based upon foreign exchange rates fixed at the
    beginning of the year, with adjustment to actual foreign
    exchange rates included in Corporate and eliminations.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
    described in note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements.

Other
    Information

Hasbro markets its products primarily to customers in the retail
    sector. Although the Company closely monitors the
    creditworthiness of its customers, adjusting credit policies and
    limits as deemed appropriate, a substantial portion of its
    customers’ ability to discharge amounts owed is generally
    dependent upon the overall retail economic environment.

Sales to the Company’s three largest customers, Wal-Mart
    Stores, Inc., Toys ‘R Us, Inc. and Target Corporation,
    amounted to 24%, 12% and 12%, respectively, of consolidated net
    revenues during 2005 and 21%, 15% and 10% during 2004. Sales to
    the Company’s two largest customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
    and Toys ‘R Us, Inc. amounted to 21% and 16%, respectively,
    during 2003.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

Hasbro purchases certain components and accessories used in its
    manufacturing process and certain finished products from
    manufacturers in the Far East. The Company’s reliance on
    external sources of manufacturing can be shifted, over a period
    of time, to alternative sources of supply for products it sells,
    should such changes be necessary. However, if the Company were
    prevented from obtaining products from a substantial number of
    its current Far East suppliers due to political, labor or other
    factors beyond its control, the Company’s operations would
    be disrupted while alternative sources of product were secured.
    The imposition of trade sanctions by the United States or the
    European Union against a class of products imported by Hasbro
    from, or the loss of “normal trade relations” status
    by, the People’s Republic of China could significantly
    increase the cost of the Company’s products imported into
    the United States or Europe.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as
    defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
    “Exchange Act”), that are designed to ensure that
    information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
    reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
    Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is
    accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,
    including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure. The Company carried out an evaluation,
    under the supervision and with the participation of the
    Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures as of December 25, 2005.
    Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and
    procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls
    and procedures were effective.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting, as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

promulgated under the Exchange Act. Hasbro’s internal
    control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance
    regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
    preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
    Hasbro’s management assessed the effectiveness of its
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 25, 2005. In making its assessment, Hasbro’s
    management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (“COSO”) in “Internal Control-Integrated
    Framework”. Based on this assessment, Hasbro’s
    management concluded that, as of December 25, 2005, its
    internal control over financial reporting is effective based on
    those criteria. Hasbro’s independent auditors have issued
    an audit report on management’s assessment of its internal
    control over financial reporting, which appears below.



Report
    of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Hasbro, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting

,

that Hasbro, Inc. maintained
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 25, 2005, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
    opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Hasbro, Inc.
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 25, 2005 is fairly stated, in all material
    respects, based on criteria established in Internal
    Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
    Also, in our opinion, Hasbro, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 25, 2005 based on criteria established in
    Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Hasbro, Inc. and subsidiaries as
    of December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations,
    shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal
    years in the three-year period ended December 25, 2005, and
    our report dated February 21, 2006, expressed an
    unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Report
    of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Hasbro, Inc.:

Under date of February 21, 2006, we reported on the
    consolidated balance sheets of Hasbro, Inc. as of
    December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004, and the
    related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders’
    equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the
    three-year period ended December 25, 2005, which are
    included in the

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 25, 2005. Our report refers to
    a change in the method used to compute diluted earnings per
    share and a change in the method used to account for certain
    financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and
    equity. In connection with our audits of the aforementioned
    consolidated financial statements, we also audited the related
    financial statement schedule of Valuation and Qualifying
    Accounts in the

Form 10-K.

This financial statement schedule is the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on this financial statement schedule based on our audits.

In our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.
