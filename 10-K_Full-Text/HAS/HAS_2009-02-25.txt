    Segments

Except as expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise
    requires, as used herein, “Hasbro”, the
    “Company”, “we”, or “us”, means
    Hasbro, Inc., a Rhode Island corporation organized on
    January 8, 1926, and its subsidiaries. Unless otherwise
    specifically indicated, all dollar or share amounts herein are
    expressed in thousands of dollars or shares, except for per
    share amounts.

Overview

We are a worldwide leader in children’s and family leisure
    time and entertainment products and services, including the
    design, manufacture and marketing of games and toys.
    Internationally and in the United States, our widely recognized
    core brands such as PLAYSKOOL, TRANSFORMERS, MY LITTLE PONY,
    LITTLEST PET SHOP, TONKA, G.I. JOE, SUPER SOAKER, MILTON
    BRADLEY, PARKER BROTHERS, TIGER and WIZARDS OF THE COAST provide
    what we believe are the highest quality play experiences in the
    world. Our offerings encompass a broad variety of games,
    including traditional board, card, hand-held electronic, trading
    card, role-playing and DVD games, as well as electronic learning
    aids and puzzles. Toy offerings include boys’ action
    figures, vehicles and playsets, girls’ toys, electronic
    toys, plush products, preschool toys and infant products,
    electronic interactive products, creative play and toy related
    specialty products. In addition, we license certain of our
    trademarks, characters and other property rights to third
    parties for use in connection with digital gaming, consumer
    promotions, and for the sale of non-competing toys and games and
    non-toy products.

Organizationally, our principal segments are U.S. and
    Canada and International. Both of these segments engage in the
    marketing and selling of various toy and game products as listed
    above. Our toy, game and puzzle products are developed by a
    global development group. We also have a global marketing
    function which establishes brand direction and assists the
    segments in establishing certain local marketing programs. The
    costs of these groups are allocated to the principal segments.
    Our U.S. and Canada segment covers the United States and
    Canada while the International segment primarily includes
    Europe, the Asia Pacific region and Latin and South America
    (including Mexico). Financial information with respect to our
    segments and geographic areas is included in note 16 to our
    financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

In addition, our Global Operations segment is responsible for
    arranging product manufacturing and sourcing for the
    U.S. and Canada and International segments and our Other
    segment out-licenses our intellectual property to third parties
    on a worldwide basis, including licensing of the Company’s
    intellectual property for use in digital games.

U.S.
    and Canada

The U.S. and Canada segment’s strategy is based on
    growing its core brands through innovation and reinvention,
    introducing new initiatives driven by consumer and marketplace
    insights and leveraging opportunistic toy and game lines and
    licenses. This strategy includes increasing visibility of the
    Company’s core brands through entertainment, such as motion
    pictures, television and publishing. Major 2008 brands and
    products included STAR WARS, TRANSFORMERS, LITTLEST PET SHOP,
    NERF, PLAYSKOOL, MARVEL products, MONOPOLY, FURREAL FRIENDS,
    MAGIC: THE GATHERING, and BABY ALIVE. In the U.S. and
    Canada segment, our products were organized into the following
    categories in 2008: (i) games and puzzles;
    (ii) boys’ toys; (iii) girls’ toys;
    (iv) preschool toys; (v) tween toys; and
    (vi) other.

Our games and puzzles category includes several well known
    brands, including MILTON BRADLEY, PARKER BROTHERS, TRIVIAL
    PURSUIT, CRANIUM, AVALON HILL and WIZARDS OF THE COAST. These
    brand portfolios consist of a broad assortment of games for
    children, tweens, families and adults. Core game brands include
    MONOPOLY, BATTLESHIP, GAME OF LIFE, SCRABBLE, CHUTES AND



LADDERS, CANDY LAND, TROUBLE, MOUSETRAP, OPERATION, HUNGRY
    HUNGRY HIPPOS, CONNECT FOUR, TWISTER, YAHTZEE, CRANIUM, JENGA,
    SIMON, CLUE, SORRY!, RISK, BOGGLE, TRIVIAL PURSUIT and GUESS
    WHO?,  as well as a line of puzzles for children and adults,
    including the BIG BEN and CROXLEY lines of puzzles. WIZARDS OF
    THE COAST offers trading card and role-playing games, including
    MAGIC: THE GATHERING and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. We seek
    to keep our core brands relevant through sustained marketing
    programs as well as by offering consumers new ways to experience
    these brands. In 2008, we acquired Cranium, Inc., which resulted
    in an extension of our core brand portfolio of games. The
    Cranium brand includes a range of products targeted to kids,
    families and adults. In addition, we hope to increase the reach
    of our brands through our strategic alliance with Electronic
    Arts Inc. (“EA”) which expands our brands to a variety
    of new digital platforms.

Our boys’ toys include a wide range of core brands such as
    G.I. JOE and TRANSFORMERS action figures and accessories as well
    as entertainment-based licensed products based on popular movie,
    television and comic book characters, such as STAR WARS and
    MARVEL toys and accessories. In the action figure area, a key
    part of our strategy focuses on the importance of reinforcing
    the storyline associated with these products through the use of
    media-based entertainment. In 2008, sales in our boys’ toys
    category also benefited from major motion picture releases of
    IRONMAN, THE INCREDIBLE HULK, and INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM
    OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL. In addition, STAR WARS, SPIDER-MAN and
    TRANSFORMERS products were supported by animated television
    series. In 2009, the major motion pictures G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF
    COBRA and TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN are expected to be
    released based on our G.I. JOE and TRANSFORMERS brands. In
    addition, the Company expects product revenues from the 2009
    release of the motion picture, X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE, based
    on the MARVEL character. In addition to marketing and developing
    action figures for traditional play, the Company also develops
    and markets products designed for collectors, which has been a
    key component of the success of the STAR WARS brand.

In our girls’ toys category, we seek to provide a
    traditional and wholesome play experience. Girls’ toys
    include LITTLEST PET SHOP, MY LITTLE PONY, FURREAL FRIENDS and
    BABY ALIVE brands. In 2009, we will seek to continue to grow and
    refresh the LITTLEST PET SHOP brand through the introduction of
    new characters. In addition, in 2009, we plan to expand our
    presence in this category by introducing a full line of
    STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE toys.

Our preschool toys category encompasses a range of products for
    infants and preschoolers in the various stages of development.
    Our preschool products include a portfolio of core brands
    marketed primarily under the PLAYSKOOL trademark. The PLAYSKOOL
    line includes such well-known products as MR. POTATO HEAD,
    WEEBLES, SIT ’N SPIN and GLOWORM, along with a successful
    line of infant toys including STEP START WALK N’ RIDE,
    2-IN-1 TUMMY TIME GYM and BUSY BALL POPPER. Through our
    AGES & STAGES system, we seek to provide consumer
    friendly information that assists parents in understanding the
    developmental milestones their children will encounter as well
    as the role each PLAYSKOOL product can play in helping children
    to achieve these developmental milestones. In addition, our
    preschool category also includes the TONKA line of trucks and
    interactive toys and the PLAY-DOH brand.

Over the last several years our tweens toys category generally
    marketed products under the TIGER and NERF brands and sought to
    target those children who have outgrown traditional toys. The
    age group targeted by this category was generally 8 to
    12 years old. The major tweens toys product lines in 2008
    were NERF and I-DOG. In recent years, we have used our consumer
    insights and electronic innovation to develop a strong line of
    products focusing on this target audience; however, as consumer
    electronics have become more affordable to this age group, this
    category has become less relevant. As a result, we have seen a
    reduction in demand for many tween electronic products as the
    target consumers have increasingly embraced adult consumer
    electronics. We also have not achieved the profit margins on
    many of the tween electronic products which we considered
    necessary. For that reason, starting in 2009 we will no longer
    have a tweens product category. However, we do plan to continue
    to opportunistically offer electronic products which we believe
    can be successful items. Going forward, those items will be
    offered under either our boys’ or girls’ categories.
    For example, starting in 2009, I-DOG will be managed under the
    girls’ toys category. In addition, our NERF and



SUPER SOAKER products have been highly successful and starting
    in 2009 will be managed as part of the boys’ toys category.

International

In addition to our business in the United States and Canada, our
    International segment sells a representative range of the toy
    and game products marketed in the U.S. and Canada segment
    as discussed above, together with some items that are sold only
    internationally. These products are sold directly to retailers
    and wholesalers in most countries in Europe, Asia Pacific and
    Latin and South America and through distributors in those
    countries where we have no presence. The products sold
    internationally are managed under the same categories as in the
    U.S. and Canada. The major geographic regions included in
    the International segment are Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin and
    South America, including Mexico. In addition to growing core
    brands and leveraging opportunistic toy lines and licenses, we
    seek to grow our international business by continuing to expand
    into Eastern Europe and emerging markets in Asia and Latin and
    South America. In 2008, we expanded our operations in Brazil,
    China, Russia, the Czech Republic and Korea. Key international
    brands for 2008 included LITTLEST PET SHOP, PLAYSKOOL,
    TRANSFORMERS, STAR WARS, MONOPOLY, MY LITTLE PONY and MARVEL.

Other
    Segments

In our Global Operations segment, we manufacture and source
    production of substantially all of our toy and game products.
    The Company owns and operates manufacturing facilities in East
    Longmeadow, Massachusetts and Waterford, Ireland. Sourcing of
    our other production is done through unrelated manufacturers in
    various Far East countries, principally China, using a Hong Kong
    based wholly-owned subsidiary operation for quality control and
    order coordination purposes. See “Manufacturing and
    Importing” below for more details concerning overseas
    manufacturing and sourcing.

Through our Other segment we generate revenue through the
    out-licensing worldwide of certain of our intellectual
    properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising
    uses in businesses which do not compete directly with our own
    product offerings. During 2008, our Other segment out-licensed
    our brands primarily in apparel, publishing, home goods and
    electronics, and certain brands in the digital area. One of the
    primary goals of this segment is to further expand our brands
    into the digital world through strategic licenses. As an
    example, we have a long-term strategic licensing alliance with
    Electronic Arts Inc. (“EA”), which provides EA with
    the exclusive worldwide rights to create digital games for all
    major platforms, including mobile phones, personal computers,
    and game consoles such as XBOX, PLAYSTATION and WII, based on
    most of our toy and game intellectual properties. The first
    games generated under this strategic alliance were introduced in
    2008, with a full line expected in 2009. In 2009, the Company
    expects its licensing revenues to be positively impacted by the
    major motion picture releases of G.I. JOE: RISE OF COBRA and
    TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN.

Other
    Information

To further extend our range of products in the various segments
    of our business, we sell our toy and game products directly to
    retailers, primarily on a direct import basis from the Far East.
    These sales are reflected in the revenue of the related segment
    where the customer resides.

Certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale
    in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct
    business presence.

No individual line of products accounted for 10% or more of our
    consolidated net revenues during our 2008 and 2006 fiscal years.
    During the 2007 fiscal year, revenues generated from
    TRANSFORMERS products were approximately $482,000, which was
    12.6% of our consolidated net revenues in 2007. No other line of
    products constituted 10% or more of our consolidated net
    revenues in 2007.



Working
    Capital Requirements

Our working capital needs are primarily financed through cash
    generated from operations and, when necessary, proceeds from
    short-term borrowings and our accounts receivable securitization
    program. Our borrowings and the use of our accounts receivable
    program generally reach peak levels during the third quarter of
    each year. This corresponds to the time of year when our
    receivables also generally reach peak levels as part of the
    production and shipment of product in preparation for the
    holiday season. The strategy of retailers has generally been to
    make a higher percentage of their purchases of toy and game
    products within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer
    buying season, which includes Christmas. We expect that
    retailers will continue to follow this strategy. Our historical
    revenue pattern is one in which the second half of the year is
    more significant to our overall business than the first half
    and, within the second half of the year, the fourth quarter is
    generally more predominant. In 2008, the second half of the year
    accounted for approximately 63% of full year revenues with the
    third and fourth quarters accounting for 32% and 31% of full
    year revenues, respectively. In years where the Company has
    products tied to a major motion picture release, such as in 2008
    with the mid-year releases of IRONMAN, THE INCREDIBLE HULK and
    INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL, and in 2007
    with the mid-year releases of SPIDER-MAN 3 and TRANSFORMERS,
    this concentration may not be as pronounced due to the higher
    level of sales that occur around and just prior to the time of
    the motion picture theatrical release.

The toy and game business is also characterized by customer
    order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of
    differences each year in the degree of consumer acceptance of
    product lines, product availability, marketing strategies and
    inventory policies of retailers, the dates of theatrical
    releases of major motion pictures for which we have product
    licenses, and changes in overall economic conditions. As a
    result, comparisons of our unshipped orders on any date with
    those at the same date in a prior year are not necessarily
    indicative of our sales for that year. Moreover, quick response
    inventory management practices result in fewer orders being
    placed significantly in advance of shipment and more orders
    being placed for immediate delivery. Retailers are timing their
    orders so that they are being filled by suppliers, such as us,
    closer to the time of purchase by consumers. Unshipped orders at
    January 25, 2009 and January 27, 2008 were
    approximately $108,000 and $149,000, respectively. It is a
    general industry practice that orders are subject to amendment
    or cancellation by customers prior to shipment. The backlog of
    unshipped orders at any date in a given year can also be
    affected by programs that we may employ to incent customers to
    place orders and accept shipments early in the year. These
    programs follow general industry practices. The types of
    programs that we plan to employ to promote sales in 2009 are
    substantially the same as those we employed in 2008. In the
    fourth quarter of 2008 we increased our support of retailers as
    a result of the weak retail environment. The Company currently
    does not expect to have similar incremental promotional programs
    in 2009.

Historically, we commit to the majority of our inventory
    production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a
    given year prior to the peak third and fourth quarter retail
    selling season. Our accounts receivable increase during the
    third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases
    to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season. Due to
    the concentrated timeframe of this selling period, payments for
    these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in
    the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the
    subsequent year. The timing difference between expenses paid and
    revenues collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow
    varying amounts during the year. During 2008, we utilized cash
    from our operations, borrowings under our secured amended and
    restated revolving credit agreements as well as our uncommitted
    lines of credit, and proceeds from our accounts receivable
    securitization program to meet our cash flow requirements.

Royalties,
    Research and Development

Our success is dependent on innovation, including both the
    continuing development of new products and the redesign of
    existing products for continued market acceptance. Our toy, game
    and puzzle products are developed by a global development group
    and the costs of this group are allocated to the selling
    entities which comprise our operating segments. In 2008, 2007,
    and 2006, we spent $191,424, $167,194 and $171,358,
    respectively, on activities relating to the development, design
    and engineering of new products and their packaging (including
    products brought to us by independent designers) and on the
    improvement or



modification of ongoing products. Much of this work is performed
    by our internal staff of designers, artists, model makers and
    engineers.

In addition to the design and development work performed by our
    own staff, we deal with a number of independent toy and game
    designers for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy
    and game manufacturers. Rights to such designs and ideas, when
    acquired by us, are usually exclusive and the agreements require
    us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item.
    These designer royalty agreements, in some cases, also provide
    for advance royalties and minimum guarantees.

We also produce a number of toys and games under trademarks and
    copyrights utilizing the names or likenesses of characters from
    movies, television shows and other entertainment media, for
    whose rights we compete with other toy and game manufacturers.
    Licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty
    on our net sales of the item. Licenses for the use of characters
    are generally exclusive for specific products or product lines
    in specified territories. In many instances, advance royalties
    and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements.
    In 2008, 2007, and 2006, we incurred $312,986, $316,807 and
    $169,731, respectively, of royalty expense. A portion of this
    expense relates to amounts paid in prior years as royalty
    advances. Our royalty expenses in any given year vary depending
    upon the timing of movie releases and other entertainment.
    Royalty expense in 2008 and 2007 was more significant in those
    years as compared to 2006 due to the release of IRONMAN, THE
    INCREDIBLE HULK and INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL
    SKULL in 2008 and SPIDER-MAN 3 and TRANSFORMERS in 2007. In
    addition, royalty expense related to sales of STAR WARS products
    were significant in both of these years.

Marketing
    and Sales

As we are focused on reimagining, reinventing and reigniting our
    many brands on a consistent global basis, we have a global
    marketing function which establishes brand direction and
    messaging, as well as assists the selling entities in
    establishing certain local marketing programs. The costs of this
    group are allocated to the selling entities. Our products are
    sold nationally and internationally to a broad spectrum of
    customers, including wholesalers, distributors, chain stores,
    discount stores, mail order houses, catalog stores, department
    stores and other traditional retailers, large and small, as well
    as internet-based

“e-tailers.”

Our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our
    products. Remaining sales are generated by independent
    distributors who sell our products, for the most part, in areas
    of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct
    presence. While we have thousands of customers, including over
    1,800 in the United States during 2008, there has been
    significant consolidation at the retail level over the last
    several years in our industry. As a result, the majority of our
    sales are to large chain stores, distributors and wholesalers.
    While the consolidation of customers provides us with certain
    benefits, such as potentially more efficient product
    distribution and other decreased costs of sales and
    distribution, this consolidation also creates additional risks
    to our business associated with a major customer having
    financial difficulties or reducing its business with us. In
    addition, customer concentration may decrease the prices we are
    able to obtain for some of our products and reduce the number of
    products we would otherwise be able to bring to market. During
    2008, net revenues from our three largest customers, Wal-Mart
    Stores, Inc., Target Corporation and Toys “R” Us,
    Inc., represented 25%, 12% and 10%, respectively, of
    consolidated net revenues, and sales to our top five customers,
    including Wal-Mart, Target and Toys “R” Us, Inc.,
    accounted for approximately 52% of our consolidated net
    revenues. In the U.S. and Canada segment, approximately 71%
    of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top
    three customers.

We advertise many of our toy and game products extensively on
    television. Generally our advertising highlights selected items
    in our various product groups in a manner designed to promote
    the sale of not only the selected item, but also other items we
    offer in those product groups as well. We introduce many of our
    new products to major customers during the year prior to the
    year of introduction of such products for retail sale. In
    addition, we showcase certain of our new products in New York
    City at the time of the American International Toy Fair in
    February, as well as at other international toy shows.

In 2008 we spent $454,612 on advertising, promotion and
    marketing programs compared to $434,742 in 2007 and $368,996 in
    2006.



Manufacturing
    and Importing

During 2008 substantially all of our products were manufactured
    in third party facilities in the Far East, primarily China, as
    well as in our two owned facilities located in East Longmeadow,
    Massachusetts and Waterford, Ireland.

Most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials
    such as plastic, paper and cardboard, although certain products
    also make use of electronic components. All of these materials
    are readily available but may be subject to significant
    fluctuations in price. There are certain chemicals (including
    phthalates and BPA) that national, state and local governments
    have restricted or are seeking to restrict or limit the use of;
    however, we do not believe these restrictions will materially
    impact our business. We generally enter into agreements with
    suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish
    prices for that year. However, significant volatility in the
    prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with
    our suppliers during the year. Our manufacturing processes and
    those of our vendors include injection molding, blow molding,
    spray painting, printing, box making and assembly. We purchase
    most of the components and accessories used in our toys and
    certain of the components used in our games, as well as some
    finished items, from manufacturers in the United States and in
    other countries. However, the countries of the Far East, and
    particularly the People’s Republic of China, constitute the
    largest manufacturing center of toys in the world and the
    substantial majority of our toy products are manufactured in
    China. The 1996 implementation of the General Agreement on
    Tariffs and Trade reduced or eliminated customs duties on many
    of the products imported by us.

We believe that the manufacturing capacity of our third party
    manufacturers, together with our own facilities, as well as the
    supply of components, accessories and completed products which
    we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers, are adequate to
    meet the anticipated demand in 2009 for our products. Our
    reliance on designated external sources of manufacturing could
    be shifted, over a period of time, to alternative sources of
    supply for our products, should such changes be necessary or
    desirable. However, if we were to be prevented from obtaining
    products from a substantial number of our current Far East
    suppliers due to political, labor or other factors beyond our
    control, our operations and our ability to obtain products would
    be disrupted while alternative sources of product were secured.
    The imposition of trade sanctions by the United States or the
    European Union against a class of products imported by us from,
    or the loss of “normal trade relations” status by, the
    People’s Republic of China, or other factors which increase
    the cost of manufacturing in China, such as higher Chinese labor
    costs or an appreciation in the yuan, could significantly
    disrupt our operations

and/or

significantly increase the cost of the products which are
    manufactured in China and imported into other markets.

We purchase dies and molds from independent United States and
    international sources.

Competition

We are a worldwide leader in the design, manufacture and
    marketing of games and toys, but our business is highly
    competitive. We compete with several large toy and game
    companies in our product categories, as well as many smaller
    United States and international toy and game designers,
    manufacturers and marketers. Competition is based primarily on
    meeting consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality
    and play value of our products. To a lesser extent, competition
    is also based on product pricing.

In addition to contending with competition from other toy and
    game companies, in our business we must deal with the phenomena
    that many children have been moving away from traditional toys
    and games at a younger age. We refer to this as “children
    getting older younger.” As a result, our products not only
    compete with the offerings of other toy and game manufacturers,
    but we must compete, particularly in meeting the demands of
    older children, with the entertainment offerings of many other
    companies, such as makers of video games and consumer electronic
    products.

The volatility in consumer preferences with respect to family
    entertainment and low barriers to entry continually create new
    opportunities for existing competitors and

start-ups

to
    develop products which compete with our toy and game offerings.



Employees

At December 28, 2008, we employed approximately
    5,900 persons worldwide, approximately 3,200 of whom were
    located in the United States.

Trademarks,
    Copyrights and Patents

We seek to protect our products, for the most part, and in as
    many countries as practical, through registered trademarks,
    copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is
    available, cost effective, and meaningful. The loss of such
    rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result
    in significant harm to our business, although the loss of such
    protection for a number of significant items might have such an
    effect.

Government
    Regulation

Our toy and game products sold in the United States are subject
    to the provisions of The Consumer Product Safety Act, as amended
    by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, (as
    amended, the “CPSA”), The Federal Hazardous Substances
    Act (the “FHSA”), The Flammable Fabrics Act (the
    “FFA”), and the regulations promulgated thereunder. In
    addition, certain of our products, such as the mixes for our
    EASY-BAKE ovens, are also subject to regulation by the Food and
    Drug Administration.

The CPSA empowers the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the
    “CPSC”) to take action against hazards presented by
    consumer products, including the formulation and implementation
    of regulations and uniform safety standards. The CPSC has the
    authority to seek to declare a product “a banned hazardous
    substance” under the CPSA and to ban it from commerce. The
    CPSC can file an action to seize and condemn an “imminently
    hazardous consumer product” under the CPSA and may also
    order equitable remedies such as recall, replacement, repair or
    refund for the product. The FHSA provides for the repurchase by
    the manufacturer of articles that are banned.

Consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and
    cities within the United States and in certain foreign markets
    such as Canada, Australia and Europe. We utilize laboratories
    that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain
    compliance with the CPSA, the FHSA, the FFA, applicable
    international standards, and our own standards. Notwithstanding
    the foregoing, there can be no assurance that our products are
    or will be hazard free. Any material product recall could have
    an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
    condition, depending on the product and scope of the recall, and
    could negatively affect sales of our other products as well.

The Children’s Television Act of 1990 and the rules
    promulgated thereunder by the United States Federal
    Communications Commission, as well as the laws of certain
    foreign countries, also place limitations on television
    commercials during children’s programming.

We maintain programs to comply with various United States
    federal, state, local and international requirements relating to
    the environment, plant safety and other matters.

Forward-Looking
    Information and Risk Factors That May Affect Future
    Results

From time to time, including in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and in our annual report to shareholders, we publish
    “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the
    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These
    “forward-looking statements” may relate to such
    matters as our anticipated financial performance or business
    prospects in future periods, expected technological and product
    developments, the expected timing of new product introductions
    or our expectations concerning the future acceptance of products
    by customers, the timing of entertainment releases, marketing
    and promotional efforts, research and development activities,
    liquidity, and similar matters. Forward-looking statements are
    inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. The Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor
    for forward-looking statements. These statements may be
    identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such
    as “anticipate,” “believe,”
    “could,” “expect,” “intend,”
    “looking forward,” “may,”
    “planned,” “potential,” “should,”
    “will” and “would” or any variations of
    words with similar meanings. We note that a variety of factors
    could cause our actual results and experience to differ
    materially from the anticipated results or other expectations
    expressed or anticipated in our forward-looking statements. The
    factors listed below are illustrative and other risks and
    uncertainties may arise as are or may be detailed from time to
    time in our public announcements and our filings with the
    Securities and Exchange Commission, such as on

Forms 8-K,

We
    undertake no obligation to make any revisions to the
    forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

or in our annual report to shareholders to reflect events or
    circumstances occurring after the date of the filing of this
    report. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all dollar or
    share amounts herein are expressed in thousands of dollars or
    shares, except for per share amounts.

The
    volatility of consumer preferences, combined with the high level
    of competition and low barriers to entry in the family
    entertainment industry, make it difficult to maintain the
    success of existing products and product lines or introduce
    successful new products. In addition, an inability to develop
    and introduce planned new products and product lines in a timely
    and cost-effective manner may damage our business.

The family entertainment business is a fashion industry. Our
    success is critically dependent upon the consumer appeal of our
    products, principally games and toys. Our failure to
    successfully anticipate, identify and react to children’s
    interests and the current preferences in family entertainment
    could significantly lower sales of our products and harm our
    sales and profitability.

A decline in the popularity of our existing products and product
    lines, or the failure of our new products and product lines to
    achieve and sustain market acceptance with retailers and
    consumers, could significantly lower our revenues and operating
    margins, which would in turn harm our profitability, business
    and financial condition. In our industry, it is important to
    identify and offer what are considered to be the “hot”
    toys and games on children’s “wish lists”. Our
    continued success will depend on our ability to develop, market
    and sell popular toys and games and license our brands for
    products which are sought after by both children and their
    parents. We seek to achieve and maintain market popularity for
    our products through the redesign and extension of our existing
    family entertainment properties in ways we believe will capture
    evolving consumer interest and imagination and remain relevant
    in today’s world, and by developing, introducing and
    gaining customer interest for new family entertainment products.
    This process involves anticipating and extending successful play
    patterns and identifying entertainment concepts and properties
    that appeal to children’s imaginations. However, consumer
    preferences with respect to family entertainment are
    continuously changing and are difficult to anticipate. Evolving
    consumer tastes, coupled with an ever changing pipeline of
    entertainment properties and products which compete for consumer
    interest and acceptance, creates an environment in which
    products can be extremely popular during a certain period in
    time but then rapidly be replaced in consumer’s minds with
    other properties. As a result, individual family entertainment
    products and properties often have short consumer life cycles.

Not only must we address rapidly changing consumer tastes and
    interests but we face competitors who are also constantly
    monitoring consumer tastes, seeking ideas which will appeal to
    consumers and introducing new products that compete with our
    products for consumer purchasing. In addition to existing
    competitors, the



barriers to entry for new participants in the family
    entertainment industry are low. New participants with a popular
    product idea or entertainment property can gain access to
    consumers and become a significant source of competition for our
    products. In some cases our competitors’ products may
    achieve greater market acceptance than our products and
    potentially reduce demand for our products.

The challenge of developing and offering products that are
    sought after by children is compounded by the trend of children
    “getting older younger”. By this we mean that children
    are losing interest in traditional toys and games at younger
    ages and, as a result, at younger and younger ages, our products
    compete with the offerings of video game suppliers, consumer
    electronics companies and other businesses outside of the
    traditional toy and game industry.

There is no guarantee that:

•

Any of our current products or product lines will continue to be
    popular;

•

Any property for which we have a significant license will
    achieve or sustain popularity;

•

Any new products or product lines we introduce will be
    considered interesting to consumers and achieve an adequate
    market acceptance;

•

Any new product’s life cycle will be sufficient to permit
    us to profitably recover development, manufacturing, marketing,
    royalties (including royalty advances and guarantees) and other
    costs of producing, marketing and selling the product; or

•

We will be able to manufacture, source and ship new or
    continuing products in a timely and cost-effective basis to meet
    constantly changing consumer demands, a risk that is heightened
    by our customers’ compressed shipping schedules and the
    seasonality of our business.

In developing new products and product lines, we have
    anticipated dates for the associated product introductions. When
    we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a
    particular product or product line at a certain time in the
    future those expectations are based on completing the associated
    development and implementation work in accordance with our
    currently anticipated development schedule. Unforeseen delays or
    difficulties in the development process, or significant
    increases in the planned cost of development, may cause the
    introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or,
    in some situations, may cause a product introduction to be
    discontinued.

Similarly, the success of our products is often dependent on the
    timelines and effectiveness of related advertising and media
    efforts. Television programming, movie and DVD releases, comic
    book releases, and other media efforts are often critical in
    generating interest in our products. Not only our efforts, but
    the efforts of third parties, heavily impact the launch dates
    and success of these media efforts. When we say that products or
    brands will be supported by certain media releases, those
    statements are based on our current plans and expectations.
    Unforeseen factors may delay these media releases or even lead
    to their cancellation. Any delay or cancellation of planned
    product development work, introductions, or media support may
    decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business.

Economic
    downturns which negatively impact the retail and credit markets,
    or which otherwise damage the financial health of our retail
    customers and consumers, can harm our business and financial
    performance.

The success of our family entertainment products and our
    financial performance is dependent on consumer purchases of our
    products. Consumers may not purchase our products because the
    products do not capture consumer interest and imagination, or
    because competitor family entertainment offerings are deemed
    more attractive. But consumer spending on our products can also
    be harmed by factors that negatively impact consumers’
    budgets generally, and which are not due to our product
    offerings.

Recessions and other economic downturns, or disruptions in
    credit markets, in the markets in which we operate can result in
    lower levels of economic activity, lower employment levels, less
    consumer disposable



income, and lower consumer confidence. Any of these factors can
    reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our
    products. This in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our
    financial performance.

In addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our
    products during times of economic difficulty, in an effort to
    maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price
    of our products, increase our promotional spending, or take
    other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our
    products. Those steps may lower our net revenues, decrease our
    operating margins, increase our costs

and/or

lower
    our profitability.

Other
    economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we
    operate, including rising commodity and fuel prices, higher
    labor costs, increased transportation costs, outbreaks of SARs
    or other diseases, or third party conduct could negatively
    impact our ability to produce and ship our products, and lower
    our revenues, margins and profitability.

Various economic and public health conditions can impact our
    ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely and
    cost-effective manner, or can otherwise have a significant
    negative impact on our business.

Significant increases in the costs of other products which are
    required by consumers, such as gasoline, home heating fuels, or
    groceries, may reduce household spending on the discretionary
    entertainment products we offer. As we discussed above, weakened
    economic conditions, lowered employment levels or recessions in
    any of our major markets may significantly reduce consumer
    purchases of our products. Economic conditions may also be
    negatively impacted by terrorist attacks, wars and other
    conflicts, increases in critical commodity prices, or the
    prospect of such events. Such a weakened economic and business
    climate, as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a
    climate, could harm our revenues and profitability.

Our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand
    for our products, but also on our ability to produce and sell
    those products at costs which allow for profitable revenues.
    Rising fuel and raw material prices, for components such as
    resin used in plastics, increased transportation costs, and
    increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are
    manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and
    transport our products, which in turn may reduce our margins,
    reduce our profitability and harm our business.

Other conditions, such as the unavailability of electrical
    components, may impede our ability to manufacture, source and
    ship new and continuing products on a timely basis. Additional
    factors outside of our control could further delay our products
    or increase the cost we pay to produce such products. For
    example, work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes, an outbreak of
    SARs or another severe public health pandemic, or the occurrence
    or threat of wars or other conflicts, all could impact our
    ability to manufacture or deliver product. Any of these factors
    could result in product delays, increased costs

and/or

lost
    sales for our products.

We may
    not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed
    material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from
    the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum
    guaranteed royalties.

In addition to designing and developing products based on our
    own brands, we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and
    interests by producing products based on popular entertainment
    properties developed by other parties and licensed to us. The
    success of entertainment properties released theatrically for
    which we have a license, such as MARVEL or STAR WARS related
    products, can significantly affect our revenues and
    profitability. If we produce a line of products based on a movie
    or television series, the success of the movie or series has a
    critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the
    associated products we are offering. In addition, competition in
    our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen
    our ability to secure, maintain, and renew popular licenses to
    entertainment products on beneficial terms, if at all, and to
    attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design,
    develop and market successful products based on these
    properties. The loss of rights granted pursuant to any of our
    licensing agreements could harm our business and competitive
    position.



The license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually
    require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be
    substantial, and in some cases may be greater than what we are
    ultimately able to recoup from actual sales, which could result
    in write-offs of significant amounts which in turn would harm
    our results of operations. At December 28, 2008, we had
    $71,000 of prepaid royalties, $44,300 of which are included in
    prepaid expenses and other current assets and $26,700 of which
    are included in other assets. Under the terms of existing
    contracts as of December 28, 2008, we may be required to
    pay future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees
    totaling approximately $57,818. Acquiring or renewing licenses
    may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we
    consider to be too high to be profitable, which may result in
    losing licenses we currently hold when they become available for
    renewal, or missing business opportunities for new licenses.
    Additionally, as a licensee of entertainment based properties we
    have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will
    translate into successful toy or game products.

We anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie
    releases will make it increasingly difficult for us to
    profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment
    properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for
    these products in order to minimize their inventory risk.
    Furthermore, there can be no assurance that a successful brand
    will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales
    in the future, as new entertainment properties and competitive
    products are continually being introduced to the market. In the
    event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful
    entertainment licenses on advantageous terms, our revenues and
    profits may be harmed.

Our
    business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results
    will depend, in large part, on our sales during the relatively
    brief holiday shopping season. This seasonality is exacerbated
    as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory
    levels through quick response inventory management
    techniques.

Sales of our family entertainment products at retail are
    extremely seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring
    during the period from September through December in
    anticipation of the holiday season, including Christmas. This
    seasonality has increased over time, as retailers become more
    efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick
    response inventory management techniques. These customers are
    timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers,
    such as us, closer to the time of purchase by consumers. For
    toys, games and other family entertainment products which we
    produce, a majority of retail sales for the entire year occur in
    the fourth quarter, close to the holiday season. As a
    consequence, the majority of our sales to our customers occur in
    the period from September through December, as our customers do
    not want to maintain large on-hand inventories throughout the
    year ahead of consumer demand. While these techniques reduce a
    retailer’s investment in inventory, they increase pressure
    on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a
    significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the
    supplier.

The limited inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or
    delay retail sales, resulting in lower revenues for us. If we or
    our customers determine that one of our products is more popular
    at retail than was originally anticipated, we may not have
    sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional product to
    fully capture consumer interest in the product. Additionally,
    the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter
    time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve
    tight and compressed shipping schedules, which also may reduce
    our sales and harm our financial performance. This seasonal
    pattern requires significant use of working capital, mainly to
    manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year
    prior to the holiday season, and requires accurate forecasting
    of demand for products during the holiday season in order to
    avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing
    excess inventory of products that are less popular with
    consumers. Our failure to accurately predict and respond to
    consumer demand, resulting in our underproducing popular items

and/or

overproducing less popular items, would reduce our total sales
    and harm our results of operations. In addition, as a result of
    the seasonal nature of our business, we would be significantly
    and adversely affected, in a manner disproportionate to the
    impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the
    year, by unforeseen events, such as a terrorist attack or
    economic shock, that harm the retail environment or consumer
    buying patterns during our key selling season, or by events,
    such as strikes or port delays, that interfere with the shipment
    of goods, particularly from the Far East, during the critical
    months leading up to the holiday purchasing season.



Our
    substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the
    United States subject us to risks associated with international
    operations. Among these risks is the fact that fluctuations in
    foreign exchange rates can significantly impact our financial
    performance.

We operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries
    outside the United States. For the year ended December 28,
    2008, our net revenues from international customers comprised
    approximately 42% of our total consolidated net revenues. We
    expect our sales to international customers to continue to
    account for a significant portion of our revenues. Additionally,
    as we discuss below, we utilize third-party manufacturers
    located principally in the Far East, to produce the majority of
    our products, and we have a manufacturing facility in Ireland.
    These sales and manufacturing operations are subject to the
    risks associated with international operations, including:

•

Currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations;

•

Limitations, including taxes, on the repatriation of earnings;

•

Political instability, civil unrest and economic instability;

•

Greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and
    weaker laws protecting such rights;

•

Complications in complying with different laws in varying
    jurisdictions and changes in governmental policies;

•

Natural disasters and the greater difficulty and expense in
    recovering therefrom;

•

Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country
    to another, including port congestion, strikes and other
    transportation delays and interruptions;

•

Changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing
    business internationally; and

•

The imposition of tariffs.

Because of the importance of our international sales and
    international sourcing of manufacturing to our business, our
    financial condition and results of operations could be
    significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to
    occur.

If the exchange rate between the United States dollar and a
    local currency for an international market in which we have
    significant sales or operations changes, our financial results,
    reported in U.S. dollars, may be meaningfully impacted even
    if our business in the local currency is not significantly
    affected. As an example, if the dollar appreciates 10% relative
    to a local currency for an international market in which we had
    $200 million of net sales, the dollar value of those sales,
    as they are translated into U.S. dollars, would decrease by
    $20 million in our consolidated financial results. As such,
    we would recognize a $20 million decrease in our net
    revenues, even if the actual level of sales in the foreign
    market had not changed. Similarly, our expenses in foreign
    markets can be significantly impacted, in U.S. dollar
    terms, by exchange rates, meaning the profitability of our
    business in U.S. dollar terms can be significantly harmed
    by exchange rate movements.

The
    consolidation of our retail customer base means that economic
    difficulties or changes in the purchasing policies of our major
    customers could have a significant impact on us.

We depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell
    the majority of our products. For the fiscal year ended
    December 28, 2008, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Target
    Corporation, and Toys “R” Us, Inc., accounted for
    approximately 25%, 12% and 10%, respectively, of our
    consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers,
    including Wal-Mart, Target and Toys “R” Us, in the
    aggregate accounted for approximately 52% of our consolidated
    net revenues. In the U.S. and Canada segment, approximately
    71% of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top
    three customers. While the consolidation of our customer base
    may provide certain benefits to us, such as potentially more
    efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of
    sales and distribution, this consolidation also means that if
    one or more of our major customers were to experience
    difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us, cease doing
    business with us, significantly reduce



the amount of their purchases from us or return substantial
    amounts of our products, it could significantly harm our sales,
    profitability and financial condition. Increased concentration
    among our customers could also negatively impact our ability to
    negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result
    in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there
    were less consolidation among our customers. In addition, the
    bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our
    significant retail customers could negatively impact our
    revenues and bad debt expense.

Our
    use of third-party manufacturers to produce the majority of our
    toy products, as well as certain other products, presents risks
    to our business.

We own and operate two game and puzzle manufacturing facilities,
    one in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts and the other in
    Waterford, Ireland. However, most of our toy products, in
    addition to certain other products, are manufactured by
    third-party manufacturers, most of whom are located in the
    People’s Republic of China. Although our external sources
    of manufacturing can be shifted, over a period of time, to
    alternative sources of supply, should such changes be necessary,
    if we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or
    components for a material portion of our product line due to
    political, labor or other factors beyond our control, our
    operations would be disrupted, potentially for a significant
    period of time, while alternative sources of supply were
    secured. This delay could significantly reduce our revenues and
    profitability, and harm our business.

Given that the majority of our manufacturing is conducted by
    third-party manufacturers located in the People’s Republic
    of China, health conditions and other factors affecting social
    and economic activity in China and affecting the movement of
    people and products into and from China to our major markets,
    including North America and Europe, as well as increases in the
    costs of labor and other costs of doing business in China, could
    have a significant negative impact on our operations, revenues
    and earnings. Factors that could negatively affect our business
    include a potential significant revaluation of the Chinese yuan,
    which may result in an increase in the cost of producing
    products in China, increases in labor costs and difficulties in
    moving products manufactured in China out of Asia and through
    the ports on the western coast of North America, whether due to
    port congestion, labor disputes, product regulations

and/or

inspections or other factors. Also, the imposition of trade
    sanctions or other regulations by the United States or the
    European Union against products imported by us from, or the loss
    of “normal trade relations” status with, the
    People’s Republic of China, could significantly increase
    our cost of products imported into the United States or Europe
    and harm our business. Additionally, the suspension of the
    operations of a third party manufacturer by government
    inspectors in China could result in delays to us in obtaining
    product and may harm sales.

We require our third-party manufacturers to comply with our
    Global Business Ethics Principles, which are designed to prevent
    products manufactured by or for us from being produced under
    inhumane or exploitive conditions. The Global Business Ethics
    Principles address a number of issues, including working hours
    and compensation, health and safety, and abuse and
    discrimination. In addition, Hasbro requires that our products
    supplied by third-party manufacturers be produced in compliance
    with all applicable laws and regulations, including consumer and
    product safety laws in the markets where those products are
    sold. Hasbro has the right, both directly and through the use of
    outside monitors, to monitor compliance by our third-party
    manufacturers with our Global Business Ethics Principles and
    other manufacturing requirements. In addition, we do quality
    assurance testing on our products, including products
    manufactured for us by third parties. Notwithstanding these
    requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with
    them, there is always a risk that one or more of our third-party
    manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we
    will not immediately discover such non-compliance. Any failure
    of our third-party manufacturers to comply with labor, consumer,
    product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing
    products for us could result in damage to our reputation, harm
    sales of our products and potentially create liability for us.



Part
    of our strategy for remaining relevant to older children is to
    offer innovative children’s toy and game electronic
    products. The margins on many of these products are lower than
    more traditional toys and games and such products may have a
    shorter lifespan than more traditional toys and games. As a
    result, sales of children’s toy and game electronic
    products may lower our overall operating margins and produce
    more volatility in our business.

As children have grown “older younger” and have become
    interested in more and more sophisticated and adult products,
    such as videogames and consumer electronics, at younger and
    younger ages, we have needed to work even harder to keep our
    products relevant for these consumers. One initiative we have
    pursued to capture the interest of older children is to offer
    innovative children’s electronic toys and games. Examples
    of such products in the last few years include VIDEONOW,
    CHATNOW, ZOOMBOX, our I-branded products such as I-DOG and
    I-CAT, and our FURREAL FRIENDS line of products, including
    BUTTERSCOTCH, BISCUIT and KOTA. These products, if successful,
    can be an effective way for us to connect with consumers and
    increase sales. However, children’s electronics, in
    addition to the risks associated with our other family
    entertainment products, also face certain additional risks.

Our costs for designing, developing and producing electronic
    products tend to be higher than for many of our other more
    traditional products, such as board games and action figures.
    The ability to recoup these higher costs through sufficient
    sales quantities and to reflect higher costs in higher prices is
    constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and
    entertainment products, and can be further constrained by
    difficult economic conditions. As a consequence, our margins on
    the sales of electronic products tend to be lower than for more
    traditional products and we can face increased risk of not
    achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs. In addition,
    the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in
    the electronics area is potentially even greater than for our
    other products. This pace of change means that the window in
    which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may
    be even shorter.

We
    rely on external financing, including our credit facilities and
    accounts receivable securitization facility, to help fund our
    operations. If we were unable to obtain or service such
    financing, or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were
    too burdensome, our business would be harmed.

Due to the seasonal nature of our business, in order to meet our
    working capital needs, particularly those in the third and
    fourth quarters, we rely on our revolving credit facility and
    our other credit facilities for working capital. We currently
    have a revolving credit agreement that expires in 2011, which
    provides for a $300,000 committed revolving credit facility
    which provides the Company the ability to request increases in
    the committed facility in additional increments of $50,000,
    subject to lender agreement, up to a total of $500,000. The
    credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting
    forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other
    limitations typical of an investment grade facility. These
    restrictive covenants may limit our future actions, and
    financial, operating and strategic flexibility. In addition, our
    financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our
    credit facility. Our performance and financial condition may not
    meet our original expectations, causing us to fail to meet such
    financial covenants. Non-compliance with our debt covenants
    could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our
    revolving credit facility and other bank lines, a circumstance
    which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would
    most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue
    to fund our operations.

As an additional source of working capital and liquidity, we
    currently have a $250,000 accounts receivable securitization
    program, which is increased to $300,000 for the period from
    fiscal October through fiscal January. Under this program, we
    sell on an ongoing basis, substantially all of our domestic
    U.S. dollar denominated trade accounts receivable to a
    bankruptcy remote special purpose entity. Under this facility,
    the special purpose entity is able to sell, on a revolving
    basis, undivided ownership interests in the eligible receivables
    to bank conduits. During the term of the facility, we must
    maintain certain performance ratios. If we fail to maintain
    these ratios, we could be prevented from accessing this
    cost-effective source of working capital and short-term
    financing.

We believe that our cash flow from operations, together with our
    cash on hand and access to existing credit facilities and our
    accounts receivable securitization facility, are adequate for
    current and planned needs



in 2009. However, our actual experience may differ from these
    expectations. Factors that may lead to a difference include, but
    are not limited to, the matters discussed herein, as well as
    future events that might have the effect of reducing our
    available cash balance, such as unexpected material operating
    losses or increased capital or other expenditures, as well as
    increases in inventory or accounts receivable that are
    ineligible for sale under our securitization facility, or future
    events that may reduce or eliminate the availability of external
    financial resources.

Not only may our individual financial performance impact our
    ability to access sources of external financing, but significant
    disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our
    ability to obtain financing. Although we believe the risk of
    nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial facilities
    is not significant, in times of severe economic downturn

and/or

distress in the credit markets, it is possible that one or more
    sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to
    provide funding to us. In such a situation, it may be that we
    would be unable to access funding under our existing credit
    facilities, and it might not be possible to find alternative
    sources of funding.

We also may choose to finance our capital needs, from time to
    time, through the issuance of debt securities. Our ability to
    issue such securities on satisfactory terms, if at all, will
    depend on the state of our business and financial condition, any
    ratings issued by major credit rating agencies, market interest
    rates, and the overall condition of the financial and credit
    markets at the time of the offering. The condition of the credit
    markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated
    significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the
    future. Variations in these factors could make it difficult for
    us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher
    interest rates in order to sell new debt securities. The failure
    to receive financing on desirable terms, or at all, could damage
    our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or
    engage in other business activities.

As of December 28, 2008, we had $709,723 of total principal
    amount of indebtedness outstanding. If we are unable to generate
    sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt
    we would need to refinance such debt or face default. There is
    no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on
    favorable terms, or at all. This total indebtedness includes
    $249,828 in aggregate principal amount of 2.75% senior
    convertible debentures that we issued in 2001. On
    December 1, 2011 and December 1, 2016, and upon the
    occurrence of certain fundamental corporate changes, holders of
    the 2.75% senior convertible debentures may require us to
    purchase their debentures. At that time, the purchase price may
    be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the
    two, at our discretion, provided that we will pay accrued and
    unpaid interest in cash. We may not have sufficient cash at that
    time to make the required repurchases and may be required to
    settle in shares of common stock.

As a
    manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational
    corporation, we are subject to various government regulations
    and may be subject to additional regulations in the future,
    violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise
    harm our business. In addition, we could be the subject of
    future product liability suits or product recalls, which could
    harm our business.

As a manufacturer of consumer products, we are subject to
    significant government regulations, including, in the United
    States, under The Consumer Products Safety Act, The Federal
    Hazardous Substances Act, and The Flammable Fabrics Act, as well
    as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our
    international markets. In addition, certain of our products are
    subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration or
    similar international authorities. While we take all the steps
    we believe are necessary to comply with these acts, there can be
    no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future.
    Failure to comply could result in sanctions which could have a
    negative impact on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations. We may also be subject to involuntary product
    recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall. While costs
    associated with product recalls have generally not been material
    to our business, the costs associated with future product
    recalls individually and in the aggregate in any given fiscal
    year, could be significant. In addition, any product recall,
    regardless of direct costs of the recall, may harm consumer
    perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our
    future revenues and results of operations.



Governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we
    manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations
    relating to product safety and consumer protection in the
    future, and may also increase the penalties for failure to
    comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations.
    In addition, one or more of our customers might require changes
    in our products, such as the non-use of certain materials, in
    the future. Complying with any such additional regulations or
    requirements could impose increased costs on our business.
    Similarly, increased penalties for non-compliance could subject
    us to greater expense in the event any of our products were
    found to not comply with such regulations. Such increased costs
    or penalties could harm our business.

In addition to government regulation, products that have been or
    may be developed by us may expose us to potential liability from
    personal injury or property damage claims by the users of such
    products. There can be no assurance that a claim will not be
    brought against us in the future. Any successful claim could
    significantly harm our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

As a large, multinational corporation, we are subject to a host
    of governmental regulations throughout the world, including
    antitrust, customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott
    regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Our failure
    to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could
    subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that
    could harm our business and financial condition.

Our
    business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may
    not be able to protect such rights successfully. In addition, we
    have a material amount of acquired product rights which, if
    impaired, would result in a reduction of our net
    earnings.

Our intellectual property, including our license agreements and
    other agreements that establish our ownership rights and
    maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property, are
    of great value. We rely on a combination of trade secret,
    copyright, trademark, patent and other proprietary rights laws
    to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related
    to our brands. From time to time, third parties have challenged,
    and may in the future try to challenge, our ownership of our
    intellectual property. In addition, our business is subject to
    the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or
    infringing on our intellectual property rights. We may need to
    resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property
    rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of
    resources. Our failure to protect our intellectual property
    rights could harm our business and competitive position. Much of
    our intellectual property has been internally developed and has
    no carrying value on our balance sheet. However, as of
    December 28, 2008, we had $568,412 of acquired product and
    licensing rights included in other assets on our balance sheet.
    Declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed
    products may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of
    the related assets and could result in an impairment charge.
    Reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could
    harm our financial results.

We may
    not realize the anticipated benefits of future acquisitions or
    those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their
    realization.

Acquisitions have been a significant part of our historical
    growth and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify our
    product offerings. In making acquisitions, we target companies
    that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products
    or the ability for us to leverage our entertainment offerings.
    However, we cannot be certain that the products of companies we
    may acquire, or acquire an interest in, in the future will
    achieve or maintain popularity with consumers or that any such
    acquired companies will allow us to more effectively market our
    products. In some cases, we expect that the integration of the
    companies that we acquire into our operations will create
    production, marketing and other operating synergies which will
    produce greater revenue growth and profitability and, where
    applicable, cost savings, operating efficiencies and other
    advantages. However, we cannot be certain that these synergies,
    efficiencies and cost savings will be realized. Even if
    achieved, these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their
    realization. In other cases, we acquire companies that we
    believe have strong and creative management, in which case we
    plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully
    integrating them into our operations. We cannot be certain that
    the key talented individuals at these companies will continue to
    work for us after the acquisition or that they will develop
    popular and profitable products or services in the future.



From
    time to time, we are involved in litigation, arbitration or
    regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which
    could entail significant expense.

As is the case with many large multinational corporations, we
    are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations,
    litigation and arbitration disputes. Because the outcome of
    litigation, arbitration and regulatory investigations is
    inherently difficult to predict, it is possible that the outcome
    of any of these matters could entail significant expense for us
    and harm our business. The fact that we operate in significant
    numbers of international markets also increases the risk that we
    may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply
    with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements.

We
    have a material amount of goodwill which, if it becomes
    impaired, would result in a reduction in our net
    earnings.

Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition
    exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire. Current
    accounting standards require that goodwill no longer be
    amortized but instead be periodically evaluated for impairment
    based on the fair value of the reporting unit. At
    December 28, 2008, approximately $474,497 or 15.0%, of our
    total assets represented goodwill. Declines in our profitability
    may impact the fair value of our reporting units, which could
    result in a write-down of our goodwill. Reductions in our net
    earnings caused by the write-down of goodwill could harm our
    results of operations.

Properties

Hasbro owns its corporate headquarters in Pawtucket, Rhode
    Island consisting of approximately 343,000 square feet,
    which is used in the U.S. and Canada, Global Operations and
    Other segments as well as for corporate functions. The Company
    also owns an adjacent building consisting of approximately
    23,000 square feet that is used in the corporate function.
    In addition, the Company leases a building in East Providence,
    Rhode Island consisting of approximately 120,000 square
    feet that is used in the corporate function as well as in the
    Global Operations and Other segments. In addition to the above
    facilities, the Company also leases office space consisting of
    approximately 95,400 square feet in Renton, Washington as
    well as warehouse space aggregating approximately
    1,950,000 square feet in Georgia, California, Texas and
    Quebec that are also used in the U.S. and Canada segment.

The Company owns manufacturing plants in East Longmeadow,
    Massachusetts and Waterford, Ireland. The East Longmeadow plant
    consists of approximately 1,148,000 square feet and is used
    in the U.S. and Canada and Global Operations segments. The
    Waterford plant consists of approximately 244,000 square
    feet and is used in our Global Operations segment. The Global
    Operations segment also leases an aggregate of
    95,300 square feet of office and warehouse space in Hong
    Kong used in this segment as well as approximately
    52,300 square feet of office space leased in China.

In the International segment, the Company leases or owns
    property in over 25 countries. The primary locations in the
    International segment are in the United Kingdom, Mexico,
    Germany, France, Spain, and Australia, all of which are
    comprised of both office and warehouse space.

The above properties consist, in general, of brick, cinder block
    or concrete block buildings which the Company believes are in
    good condition and well maintained.

The Company believes that its facilities are adequate for its
    needs. The Company believes that should it not be able to renew
    any of the leases related to its leased facilities that it could
    secure similar substitute properties without a material adverse
    impact on its operations.



Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

The Company has outstanding tax assessments from the Mexican tax
    authorities relating to the years 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003.
    These tax assessments are based on transfer pricing issues
    between the Company’s subsidiaries with respect to the
    Company’s operations in Mexico. The Company has entered an
    Administrative Appeal contesting the 2000 and 2001 assessments
    and on June 3, 2008 the Company filed suit in the Federal
    Tribunal of Fiscal and Administrative Justice in Mexico
    challenging the 2002 assessment. The Company received the 2003
    assessment in December of 2008, and plans to file suit in early
    2009 challenging the 2003 assessment. The Company expects to be
    successful in sustaining its positions for all of these years.
    However, in order to challenge these outstanding tax
    assessments, as is usual and customary in Mexico in these
    matters, the Company was required to either make a deposit or
    post a bond in the full amount of the assessments. The Company
    elected to post a bond and accordingly, as of December 28,
    2008, bonds totaling approximately $67.7 million (at
    year-end 2008 exchange rates) have been posted related to the
    2000, 2001 and 2002 assessments. The Company will be required to
    either post a bond or pay a deposit of approximately
    $25.7 million (at year-end 2008 exchange rates) related to
    the 2003 assessment during the first quarter of 2009. These
    bonds guarantee the full amounts of the outstanding tax
    assessments in the event the Company is not successful in its
    challenge to them.

We are currently party to certain other legal proceedings, none
    of which we believe to be material to our business or financial
    condition.

Issuer
    Repurchases of Common Stock

In February 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million in common
    stock after three previous authorizations dated May 2005, July
    2006 and August 2007 with a cumulative authorized repurchase
    amount of $1.2 billion were fully utilized. Purchases of
    the Company’s common stock may be made from time to time,
    subject to market conditions. These shares may be repurchased in
    the open market or through privately negotiated transactions.
    The Company has no obligation to repurchase shares under the
    authorization, and the timing, actual number and value of the
    shares that are repurchased will depend on a number of factors,
    including the price of the Company’s stock. The Company may
    suspend or discontinue the program at any time and there is no
    expiration date.

There were no repurchases made by the Company in the fourth
    quarter. At December 28, 2008, $252,364,317 remained
    available under the above authorization.

Executive
    Summary

The Company earns revenue and generates cash through the sale of
    a variety of toy and game products, as well as through the
    out-licensing of rights for use of its properties in connection
    with non-competing products, including digital games, offered by
    third parties. The Company sells its products both within the
    United States and in a number of international markets. The
    Company’s business is highly seasonal with a significant
    amount of revenues occurring in the second half of the year. In
    2008, 2007 and 2006, the second half of the year accounted for
    63%, 66% and 68% of the Company’s net revenues,
    respectively. While many of the Company’s products are
    based on brands the Company owns or controls, the Company also
    offers products which are licensed from outside inventors. In
    addition, the Company licenses rights to produce products based
    on movie, television, music and other entertainment properties,
    such as MARVEL and STAR WARS properties.

The Company’s business is primarily separated into two
    business segments, U.S. and Canada and International. The
    U.S. and Canada segment develops, markets and sells both
    toy and game products in the U.S. and Canada. The
    International segment consists of the Company’s European,
    Asia Pacific and Latin and South American marketing operations,
    including Mexico. In addition to these two primary segments, the
    Company’s world-wide manufacturing and product sourcing
    operations are managed through its Global Operations segment.
    The Company’s Other segment is responsible for the
    worldwide out-licensing of the Company’s intellectual
    properties and works closely with the U.S. and Canada and
    International segments on the development and out-licensing of
    the Company’s brands. Prior to 2008, the Company’s
    Mexican operations were included with the U.S. and Canada
    in the North American segment. At the beginning of 2008 the
    Company reorganized the management and reporting structure of
    its operating segments and moved the Mexican operations into the
    International segment and the North American segment was renamed
    the U.S. and Canada segment. The management reorganization
    was the result of a realignment of the Company’s commercial
    markets and reflects its objective to leverage its Mexican
    operations in connection with its growth strategy in Latin and
    South America.

The Company seeks to make its brands relevant in all areas
    important to its consumers. Brand awareness is amplified through
    immersive traditional play, digital applications, publishing and
    lifestyle licensing experiences presented for the
    consumers’ enjoyment. The Company’s focus remains on
    growing core owned and controlled brands, developing new and
    innovative products which respond to market insights and
    optimizing efficiencies within the Company to reduce costs,
    increase operating profits and strengthen its balance sheet. The
    Company’s core brands represent Company-owned or
    Company-controlled brands, such as TRANSFORMERS, MY LITTLE PONY,
    LITTLEST PET SHOP, MONOPOLY, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, PLAYSKOOL,
    G.I. JOE, NERF and TONKA, which have been successful over the
    long term. The Company has a large portfolio of owned and
    controlled brands, which can be introduced in new formats and
    platforms over time. These brands may also be further extended
    by pairing a licensed concept with a core brand. By focusing on
    core brands, the Company is working to build a more consistent
    revenue stream and basis for future growth. During 2008 the
    Company had strong sales of core brand products, namely LITTLEST
    PET SHOP, TRANSFORMERS, PLAYSKOOL, MONOPOLY, NERF, MY LITTLE
    PONY, FURREAL FRIENDS and PLAY-DOH. This strategy of
    reimagining, reinventing and reigniting its brands has proved
    instrumental to achieving its overall growth objectives.



The Company also seeks to drive product-related revenues by
    increasing the visibility of its core brands through
    entertainment. As an example of this, in July of 2007, the
    TRANSFORMERS motion picture was released and the Company
    developed and marketed products based on the motion picture. As
    a result of pairing this core brand with this type of
    entertainment, both the movie and the product line benefited.
    The Company expects to continue this strategy and anticipates
    the theatrical releases of both TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE
    FALLEN and G.I. JOE: RISE OF COBRA motion pictures during 2009.
    In addition, the Company has entered into a six-year strategic
    relationship with Universal Pictures to produce at least four
    motion pictures based on certain of Hasbro’s core brands.
    The first movie is expected to be released in 2010 or 2011,
    followed by anticipated releases of at least one movie per year
    thereafter.

While the Company believes it has achieved a more sustainable
    revenue base by developing and maintaining its core brands and
    avoiding reliance on licensed entertainment properties, it
    continues to opportunistically enter into or leverage existing
    strategic licenses which complement its brands and key
    strengths. In 2008 and 2007, the Company had significant sales
    of products related to the Company’s license with Marvel
    Characters B.V. (“Marvel”), primarily due to the
    theatrical releases of IRON MAN in May 2008, THE INCREDIBLE HULK
    in June 2008 and SPIDERMAN-3 in May 2007. In addition, the
    Company had significant sales in 2008 of products related to the
    movie release of STAR WARS: CLONE WARS in August 2008 as well as
    sales from the movie release of INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF
    THE CRYSTAL SKULL in May 2008. During 2009 the Company expects
    to continue to have a high level of revenues from
    entertainment-based licensed properties based on the expected
    major motion picture release of X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE as well
    as products related to television programming based on
    SPIDER-MAN and STAR WARS.

While gross profits of theatrical entertainment-based products
    are generally higher than many of the Company’s other
    products, sales from these products including our owned or
    controlled brands based on a movie release also incur royalty
    expense. Such royalties reduce the impact of these higher gross
    margins. In certain instances, such as with Lucasfilm’s
    STAR WARS, the Company may also incur amortization expense on
    property right-based assets acquired from the licensor of such
    properties, further impacting profits earned on these products.

The Company’s long-term strategy also focuses on extending
    its brands further into the digital world. As part of this
    strategy, the Company entered into a multi-year strategic
    agreement with Electronic Arts Inc. (“EA”). The
    agreement gives EA the exclusive worldwide rights, subject to
    existing limitations on the Company’s rights and certain
    other exclusions, to create digital games for all platforms,
    such as mobile phones, gaming consoles and personal computers,
    based on a broad spectrum of the Company’s intellectual
    properties, including MONOPOLY, SCRABBLE, YAHTZEE, NERF, TONKA,
    G.I. JOE and LITTLEST PET SHOP. The first major game releases
    under this agreement were released in 2008, with a full line
    expected in 2009.

While the Company remains committed to investing in the growth
    of its business, it also continues to be focused on reducing
    fixed costs through efficiencies and on profit improvement. Over
    the last 6 years the Company has improved its full year
    operating margin from 7.8% in 2002 to 12.3% in 2008. The Company
    reviews it operations on an ongoing basis and seeks to reduce
    its cost structure and promote efficiency. The Company is also
    investing to grow its business in emerging markets. In 2008, the
    Company expanded its operations in China, Brazil, Russia, Korea
    and the Czech Republic. In addition, the Company is seeking to
    grow its business in entertainment, digital gaming, and will
    continue to evaluate strategic alliances and acquisitions which
    may complement its current product offerings or allow it entry
    into an area which is adjacent to and complementary to the toy
    and game business. For example, in January of 2008, the Company
    acquired Cranium, Inc., a developer and marketer of CRANIUM
    branded games and related products. In the second quarter of
    2008, the Company acquired the rights to TRIVIAL PURSUIT, a
    brand which the Company had previously licensed on a long-term
    basis. Ownership of the rights will allow the Company to further
    leverage the brand in different media.

In recent years, the Company has been seeking to return excess
    cash to its shareholders through share repurchases and
    dividends. As part of this initiative, over the last four years,
    the Company’s Board of Directors



(the “Board”) has adopted four share repurchase
    authorizations with a cumulative authorized repurchase amount of
    $1,700,000. After fully exhausting the prior three
    authorizations, the fourth authorization was approved on
    February 7, 2008 for $500,000. For the years ended 2008,
    2007 and 2006, the Company spent $357,589, $587,004 and
    $456,744, respectively, to repurchase 11,736, 20,795 and
    22,767 shares, respectively, in the open market. Also in
    2007, the Company paid $200,000 in cash to repurchase
    exercisable warrants for 15,750 shares of the
    Company’s common stock. The Company intends to, at its
    discretion, opportunistically repurchase shares in the future
    subject to market conditions. At December 28, 2008, the
    Company had $252,364 remaining under the February 2008
    authorization.

After a very strong first nine months of 2008, the Company was
    negatively impacted during the fourth quarter of 2008 by both
    the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign
    currencies as well as the broad based economic downturn that was
    experienced in most of the markets in which it operates. The
    Company worked with its retail customers to put certain
    promotional programs in place with the goal of both driving
    sales as well as managing inventory at retail given the
    weakening demand. Despite the impact of the economic conditions,
    the Company grew revenue in both the fourth quarter and for the
    full year absent the impact of foreign exchange rate changes in
    2008.

Recent issues in the credit markets have not materially impacted
    the Company’s liquidity. As of December 28, 2008 the
    Company had $630,390 in cash and had available capacity, if
    needed, under its revolving credit agreement. The Company
    believes that the funds available to it, including cash expected
    to be generated from operations and funds available through its
    available lines of credit and accounts receivable securitization
    program are adequate to meet its working capital needs for 2009.

Results
    of Operations

The fiscal years ended December 28, 2008 and
    December 30, 2007 were fifty-two week periods while the
    fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 was a fifty-three week
    period.



Net earnings for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2008
    were $306,766, or $2.00 per diluted share. This compares to net
    earnings for fiscal 2007 and 2006 of $333,003 and $230,055, or
    $1.97 and $1.29 per diluted share, respectively.

Net earnings includes non-operating expense related to the
    change in fair value of certain warrants required to be
    classified as a liability of $44,370 in 2007 and $31,770 in
    2006. These warrants were repurchased during May 2007. Net
    earnings for 2007 also includes a favorable tax adjustment of
    $29,619, or $0.17 per diluted share, related to the recognition
    of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits.

In January 2008 the Company acquired Cranium, Inc.
    (“Cranium”). The results of operations for 2008
    include the operations of Cranium from the acquisition closing
    date of January 25, 2008.

Consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 28,
    2008 were $4,021,520 compared to $3,837,557 in 2007 and
    $3,151,481 in 2006. Most of the Company’s net revenues and
    operating profits were derived from its two principal segments:
    the U.S. and Canada segment and the International segment,
    which are discussed in detail below. Consolidated net revenues
    in 2008 were negatively impacted by foreign currency translation
    of approximately $10,300 as a result of the stronger
    U.S. dollar in 2008 as compared to 2007 while consolidated
    net revenues in 2007 were positively impacted by foreign
    currency translation in the amount of $94,500 as a result of the
    overall weaker U.S. dollar in that year.

The following table presents net revenues and operating profit
    data for the Company’s two principal segments for 2008,
    2007 and 2006. Results for 2007 and 2006 have been reclassified
    to conform to the Company’s 2008 operating segment
    structure.

U.S.
    and Canada

U.S. and Canada segment net revenues for the year ended
    December 28, 2008 increased 5% to $2,406,745 from
    $2,293,742 in 2007. The impact of foreign currency translation
    on U.S. and Canada segment net revenues in 2008 was
    unfavorable and decreased net revenues by approximately $3,100.
    The increase in net revenues in 2008 was primarily due to higher
    revenues in the boys’ toys category, driven by increased
    sales of STAR WARS products and sales of INDIANA JONES products.
    Although revenues from TRANSFORMERS and MARVEL products
    decreased in 2008 compared to 2007, as a result of the
    significant sales recognized in the prior year due to the
    theatrical releases of TRANSFORMERS in July 2007 and SPIDER-MAN
    3 in May 2007, these lines remained significant contributors to
    U.S. and Canada segment net revenues in 2008. The increase
    in segment net revenues for 2008 was also due to increased
    revenues in the games and puzzles category as a result of
    increased sales of DUEL MASTERS and TRIVIAL PURSUIT games and
    the impact of the acquisition of Cranium, partially offset by
    decreased revenues from plug and play games. Revenues from the
    tweens category also increased as a result of higher sales of
    NERF products, partially offset by decreased sales of POWER TOUR
    GUITAR, which is no longer in the Company’s product line,
    as well as lower sales of I-DOG. Revenues from the preschool
    category increased slightly as higher sales of PLAYSKOOL
    products were partially offset by decreased sales of TONKA
    products. Revenues from the girls’ toys category increased
    slightly primarily as a result of of the reintroduction of
    EASY-BAKE oven, partly offset by decreased revenues from MY
    LITTLE PONY, FURREAL FRIENDS, and LITTLEST PET SHOP. Although
    revenues from LITTLEST PET SHOP decreased slightly in 2008,
    sales of these products remained a significant contributor to
    U.S. and Canada segment net revenues in 2008. Revenues in
    2008 were also negatively impacted by decreased sales of TOOTH
    TUNES.



U.S. and Canada operating profit decreased to $283,152 in
    2008 from $287,800 in 2007. Operating profit in 2008 was
    negatively impacted by approximately $1,100 due to the
    translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar.
    U.S. and Canada segment gross profits increased in dollars
    but decreased as a percentage of net revenues in 2008 primarily
    as a result of the increased promotional programs implemented by
    the Company in the fourth quarter of 2008, including the
    provision of sales allowances and markdowns, to address the weak
    retail environment. The increase in gross profit in dollars was
    more than offset by increased product development and sales and
    marketing expenses related to investments the Company is making
    in both core brands and its digital initiative related to its
    Wizards of the Coast subsidiary; increased amortization as a
    result of the acquisition of Cranium and the purchase of
    intellectual property rights related to TRIVIAL PURSUIT;
    increased royalty expense; and increased shipping and
    distribution costs, reflecting higher sales volume and higher
    transportation costs.

U.S. and Canada segment net revenues for the year ended
    December 30, 2007 increased 15% to $2,293,742 from
    $1,997,141 in 2006. The impact of foreign currency translation
    on U.S. and Canada segment net revenues in 2007 was
    favorable, due to the strength of the Canadian dollar, and
    increased net revenues by approximately $4,500. The increase was
    due primarily to increased revenues in the boys’ toys
    category driven by sales of MARVEL and TRANSFORMERS products due
    to the theatrical releases of SPIDER-MAN 3 in May 2007 and
    TRANSFORMERS in July 2007. Although STAR WARS product sales
    declined in 2007 from 2006, sales of these products were a
    significant contributor to boys’ toys revenues in 2007.
    Revenues in the girls’ toys category increased as a result
    of higher sales of LITTLEST PET SHOP and FURREAL FRIENDS
    products as well as higher revenues from the BABY ALIVE line
    which was reintroduced in the second quarter of 2006. To a
    lesser extent, revenues in the girls’ toys category were
    positively impacted by increased shipments of MY LITTLE PONY
    products. Girls’ toys revenues were negatively impacted by
    decreased sales of EASY-BAKE oven products due to the recall of
    the product in July of 2007. Revenues from the preschool
    category decreased slightly in 2007. Revenue from games and
    puzzles decreased slightly due to lower revenues from trading
    card and plug and play games partially offset by increased sales
    of traditional board games. Revenues from the tweens category
    decreased as a result of lower sales of electronic products such
    as VIDEONOW, ZOOMBOX and I-DOG partially offset by increased
    sales of NERF products. Revenues in 2007 were also positively
    impacted by increased sales of TOOTH TUNES.

U.S. and Canada operating profit increased to $287,800 in
    2007 from $254,502 in 2006. Operating profit in 2007 was
    positively impacted by approximately $1,300 due to the
    translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. The
    increase in operating profit was primarily the result of higher
    gross profits resulting from the higher revenues discussed
    above. Although U.S. and Canada gross profit increased as a
    result of higher revenues, this increase in gross profit was
    negatively impacted by approximately $10,400 of charges recorded
    in the second quarter of 2007 related to the July 2007 EASY-BAKE
    oven recall. The increase in gross profit was also partially
    offset by higher royalty expense as the result of the increased
    sales of MARVEL and TRANSFORMERS movie-related products.
    Operating profit was also negatively impacted by higher
    advertising expense as well as higher selling and distribution
    costs related to the increased sales volume. In addition,
    U.S. and Canada operating profit included increased
    investment spending in an online initiative of the
    Company’s Wizards of the Coast operation.

International

International segment net revenues for the year ended
    December 28, 2008 increased by 4% to $1,499,334 from
    $1,444,863 in 2007. In 2008 net revenues were negatively
    impacted by currency translation of approximately $7,400 as a
    result of a stronger U.S. dollar. The increase in net
    revenues was primarily the result of increased product sales in
    the girls’ toys and preschool categories primarily relating
    to LITTLEST PET SHOP in the girls’ toys category and
    PLAYSKOOL, which includes IN THE NIGHT GARDEN products, in the
    preschool category. Net revenues in the games and puzzles
    category decreased primarily as a result of decreased revenues
    from MAGIC: THE GATHERING product, TRIVIAL PURSUIT products and
    MONOPOLY products. Net revenues in the boys’ toys category
    decreased primarily as a result of decreased sales of MARVEL and
    TRANSFORMERS products, however, both product lines continued to
    be significant contributors to International segment net
    revenues in 2008. Decreased net revenues in the boys’ toys
    category were



partially offset by increased sales of STAR WARS and sales of
    INDIANA JONES products. Net revenues in the tweens category
    decreased primarily as a result of decreased revenues from POWER
    TOUR GUITAR, which is no longer in the Company’s product
    line, and I-DOG, partially offset by increased sales of NERF
    products.

International segment operating profit decreased 13% to $165,186
    in 2008 from $189,783 in 2007. Operating profit for the
    International segment in 2008 was negatively impacted by
    approximately $4,400 due to the translation of foreign
    currencies to the U.S. dollar. The decrease in
    International segment operating profit also reflects promotional
    programs implemented by the Company in the fourth quarter of
    2008 in response to weakened retail conditions; increased
    advertising expense; and increased investments in emerging
    markets; partially offset by lower royalty expense as a result
    of lower sales of entertainment-based products. In addition,
    International segment operating profit in 2008 was positively
    impacted by the recognition of a pension surplus in the United
    Kingdom.

International segment net revenues for the year ended
    December 30, 2007 increased by 32% to $1,444,863 from
    $1,092,468 in 2006. In 2007, net revenues were positively
    impacted by currency translation of approximately $88,800 as a
    result of a weaker U.S. dollar. The increase in net
    revenues was primarily the result of increased net revenues in
    the boys’ toys category. As in the U.S. and Canada
    segment, this increase was driven by higher sales of
    TRANSFORMERS products resulting from the theatrical release of
    the TRANSFORMERS movie in most countries in July of 2007 and
    MARVEL products resulting from the theatrical release of
    SPIDER-MAN 3 in May of 2007. Increased revenues in the
    girls’ toys category were principally the result of
    increased sales of LITTLEST PET SHOP products, and to a lesser
    extent, MY LITTLE PONY and BABY ALIVE products. Revenues in the
    preschool category were higher in 2007 based on increased sales
    of PLAYSKOOL products, partially due to strong revenues of IN
    THE NIGHT GARDEN in the United Kingdom. Revenues in the games
    and puzzles category increased primarily due to increased sales
    of MONOPOLY. Revenues from the tweens category increased
    primarily as a result of sales of the POWER TOUR GUITAR which
    was introduced in 2007.

International segment operating profit increased 69% to $189,783
    in 2007 from $112,350 in 2006. Operating profit for the segment
    in 2007 was positively impacted by approximately $10,600 due to
    the translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar.
    The remaining increase in operating profit was due to the higher
    revenues discussed above. The increased gross profit as a result
    of the higher revenues was partially offset by higher royalty
    expense due to higher sales of MARVEL and TRANSFORMERS products
    as well as higher advertising and selling, distribution and
    administration expenses.

Gross
    Profit

The Company’s gross profit margin decreased to 57.9% for
    the year ended December 28, 2008 from 58.9% in 2007. The
    decrease is primarily due to incremental promotional programs,
    including sales allowances and markdowns, implemented in the
    fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the weak retail
    environment, as well as changes in product mix. Decreases in
    gross profit as the result of input cost inflation were
    partially offset by cost savings initiatives and an increase in
    pricing of certain of the Company’s products. The Company
    currently does not expect to have similar incremental
    promotional programs in 2009.

The Company’s gross profit margin increased to 58.9% for
    the year ended December 30, 2007 from 58.6% in 2006. This
    increase was due to changes in product mix, primarily the
    positive impact of higher sales of licensed products. Although
    licensed products generally carry a higher gross margin, the
    increased gross margin was largely offset by higher royalty
    expense associated with these products. Gross profit in 2007 was
    also negatively impacted by approximately $10,400 in charges
    related to the recall of the Company’s EASY-BAKE oven
    product and by a charge of approximately $10,000 related to a
    restructuring and related reduction in work force at the
    Company’s manufacturing facility in East Longmeadow,
    Massachusetts. This charge consisted primarily of severance
    costs.

Amortization expense increased to $78,265 or 1.9% of net
    revenues in 2008 compared to $67,716 or 1.8% of net revenues in
    2007. The increase is primarily the result of the acquisition of
    Cranium, Inc. in January 2008 and the purchase of the
    intellectual property rights related to TRIVIAL PURSUIT in the
    second quarter of 2008. Property rights of $68,500 and $80,800
    were recorded as a result of the Cranium, Inc. acquisition and
    the purchase of TRIVIAL PURSUIT, respectively, and are each
    being amortized over fifteen years. Amortization expense
    decreased to $67,716 in 2007 from $78,934 in 2006. A portion of
    amortization expense relates to licensing rights and is based on
    expected sales of products related to those licensing rights.
    The decrease in amortization expense in 2007 primarily related
    to decreased amortization of the product rights related to STAR
    WARS.

Royalty expense decreased to $312,986 or 7.8% of net revenues in
    2008 compared to $316,807 or 8.2% of net revenues in 2007. The
    decrease in royalty expense is primarily the result of the
    impact of foreign exchange. Absent this foreign exchange impact,
    royalty expense decreased slightly as the result of slightly
    lower sales of entertainment-based products. Royalty expense
    increased to $316,807 or 8.2% of net revenues in 2007 compared
    to $169,731 or 5.4% of net revenues in 2006. This increase was
    primarily due to increased sales of entertainment-based
    products, primarily MARVEL and TRANSFORMERS movie-related
    products due to the theatrical releases of SPIDER-MAN 3 and
    TRANSFORMERS in 2007.

Research and product development expense increased in 2008 to
    $191,424 or 4.8% of net revenues from $167,194 or 4.4% of net
    revenues in 2007. The increase in 2008 reflects higher
    investments in the Company’s core brands, increased
    expenditures relating to the Company’s digital initiatives,
    as well as additional expenses as a result of the Company’s
    Cranium acquisition. Research and product development expense
    decreased in 2007 to $167,194 or 4.4% of net revenues from
    $171,358 or 5.4% of net revenues in 2006. This decrease
    reflected higher investments in the prior year, primarily as a
    result of increased expenditures related to the introduction of
    the MARVEL product lines in late 2006 and early 2007.

Advertising expense increased in dollars to $454,612 in 2008
    from $434,742 in 2007, but remained flat as a percentage of net
    revenues at 11.3%. The increase in dollars is primarily the
    result of higher spending to increase awareness of the
    Company’s brands. Advertising expense increased in dollars
    to $434,742 in 2007 from $368,996 in 2006, but decreased as a
    percentage of revenues to 11.3% from 11.7% in 2006. The decrease
    as a percentage of revenues primarily related to the mix of
    sales in 2007, which included increased sales of
    entertainment-based products, which require lower amounts of
    advertising and promotion. Revenues from properties related to
    major motion picture releases were higher in 2008 and 2007 as
    compared to 2006.

Selling, distribution and administration expenses increased to
    $797,209 or 19.8% of net revenues in 2008, compared to $755,127
    or 19.7% of net revenues in 2007. The increase reflects
    increased sales and marketing expenses to support the growth in
    the business; increased investment in the expansion into
    emerging markets, including Brazil, China, Russia, the Czech
    Republic and Korea; increased investment in the Company’s
    digital and entertainment strategies; and increased shipping and
    distribution costs associated with both increased sales volume
    and higher transportation costs. Selling, distribution and
    administration expenses increased in dollars to $755,127 in 2007
    from $682,214 in 2006 but decreased as a percentage of revenues
    to 19.7% from 21.7% in 2006. The increase in dollars reflected
    higher variable selling and distribution costs resulting from
    higher revenues in 2007, as well as higher incentive
    compensation provisions, the impact of foreign currency, and



general inflationary increases. The decrease as a percentage of
    revenues in 2008 and 2007 compared to 2006 reflects the fixed
    nature of certain of these expenses, coupled with the higher
    revenues in each of those years.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense increased to $47,143 in 2008 from $34,618 in
    2007. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result
    of higher average borrowings in 2008 primarily as a result of
    the issuance of $350,000 of notes in September 2007, partially
    offset by the repayment of $135,092 of notes in July 2008. The
    increase in the average borrowing rate for 2008 from the
    issuance of long-term debt in 2007 was more than offset by
    decreases in the average borrowing rate on short-term debt in
    2008 as well as the repayment of 6.15% notes in July 2008.

Interest expense increased to $34,618 in 2007 from $27,521 in
    2006. The increase in interest expense was due to higher average
    borrowings in 2007 primarily resulting from the issuance of
    $350,000 of notes in September 2007. The majority of the
    proceeds from the issuance of these notes were used to repay
    short-term debt resulting from increased repurchases of common
    stock as well as the repurchase of the Lucas warrants for
    $200,000.

Interest
    Income

Interest income was $17,654 in 2008 compared to $29,973 in 2007
    and $27,609 in 2006. The decrease in interest income in 2008
    from 2007 is primarily the result of lower returns on invested
    cash. Interest income in 2006 includes $5,200 related to a
    long-term deposit that was refunded during 2006. The increase in
    interest income in 2007 from 2006 primarily reflected higher
    average rates of return in 2007 compared to 2006, and, to a
    lesser extent, higher average invested balances in 2007. During
    a portion of 2007 and 2006, the Company invested excess cash in
    auction rate securities, which generated a higher rate of return
    and contributed to the higher level of interest income in 2007
    and 2006.

Other
    (Income) Expense, Net

Other (income) expense, net of $23,752 in 2008 compares to
    $52,323 in 2007 and $34,977 in 2006. In 2007 and 2006 the major
    component of other (income) expense was non-cash expense related
    to the change in fair value of the Lucas warrants, which were
    required to be classified as a liability. These warrants were
    required to be adjusted to their fair value each quarter through
    earnings. In May 2007, the Company exercised the call option on
    these warrants and repurchased them for $200,000 in cash, which
    approximated fair value at that date. As these warrants were
    repurchased in 2007, there was no fair value adjustment in 2008.
    For 2007 and 2006, expense related to the change in fair value
    of these warrants was $44,370 and $31,770, respectively. Absent
    the impact of the fair value adjustments, increased expense in
    2008 primarily relates to increased foreign exchange losses
    arising from the impact of the large downward movement in
    foreign exchange rates, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2008,
    on

non-U.S. denominated

intercompany balances.

Income
    Taxes

Income tax expense totaled 30.4% of pretax earnings in 2008
    compared with 28.0% in 2007 and 32.6% in 2006. Income tax
    expense for 2008 is net of a tax benefit of approximately
    $10,200 related to discrete tax events, primarily comprised of a
    benefit from the repatriation of certain foreign earnings, as
    well as the settlement of various tax examinations in multiple
    jurisdictions. Income tax expense for 2007 was net of a benefit
    of $29,999 related to discrete tax events, primarily relating to
    the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits. Income
    tax expense for 2006 includes a charge of approximately $7,800
    related to discrete tax events, primarily relating to the
    settlement of various tax examinations in multiple
    jurisdictions. Absent these items, potential interest and
    penalties recorded in 2008 and 2007 related to uncertain tax
    positions, and the effect of the fair value adjustment of the
    Lucas warrants, which had no tax effect in 2007 and 2006, the
    2008 effective tax rate would have been 32.8% compared to 30.5%
    in 2007 and 27.6% in 2006. The increase in the adjusted rate to
    32.8% in 2008 compared to 30.5% in 2007 primarily reflects the
    change in the mix of where the Company earned its profits. The
    increase in the adjusted rate to 30.5% in 2007 from



27.6% in 2006 primarily reflects the decision to provide for the
    repatriation of a portion of 2007 international earnings to the
    U.S.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The Company has historically generated a significant amount of
    cash from operations. In 2008, the Company funded its operations
    and liquidity needs primarily through cash flows from
    operations, and, when needed, using borrowings under its
    available lines of credit and proceeds from its accounts
    receivable securitization program. During 2009, the Company
    expects to continue to fund its working capital needs primarily
    through cash flows from operations and, when needed, using
    borrowings under its available lines of credit and proceeds from
    its accounts receivable securitization program. The Company
    believes that the funds available to it, including cash expected
    to be generated from operations and funds available through its
    available lines of credit and accounts receivable securitization
    program are adequate to meet its working capital needs for 2009,
    however, unexpected events or circumstances such as material
    operating losses or increased capital or other expenditures may
    reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial
    resources. In addition, significant disruptions to credit
    markets may also reduce or eliminate the availability of
    external financial resources. Although we believe the risk of
    nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial facilities
    is not significant, in times of severe economic downturn in the
    credit markets it is possible that one or more sources of
    external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding
    to us.

At December 28, 2008, cash and cash equivalents, net of
    short-term borrowings were $622,804 compared to $764,257 and
    $704,818 at December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006,
    respectively. Hasbro generated $593,185, $601,794, and $320,647
    of cash from its operating activities in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. In 2007 and 2006 operating cash flows were
    impacted by royalty advances paid of $70,000 and $105,000
    related to MARVEL in those respective years. In addition, 2007
    and 2006 net earnings included non-cash expense of $44,370
    and $31,770, respectively, related to the fair value adjustment
    related to the Lucas warrants that were repurchased in May of
    2007. The remaining decrease in 2008 operating cash flows was
    due to decreased net earnings in 2008 compared to 2007. The
    higher cash flows from operations in 2007 compared to 2006 were
    primarily the result of increased earnings as well as the mix of
    products in 2007 net revenues.

Accounts receivable decreased to $611,766 at December 28,
    2008 from $654,789 at December 30, 2007. The accounts
    receivable balance at December 28, 2008 includes a decrease
    of approximately $61,100 as a result of the stronger
    U.S. dollar in 2008. Absent the impact of foreign exchange,
    accounts receivable increased slightly. Accounts receivable
    increased to $654,789 at December 30, 2007 from $556,287 at
    December 31, 2006. The increase in accounts receivable was
    primarily the result of higher sales volume in 2007. The
    December 30, 2007 accounts receivable balance includes an
    increase of approximately $31,100 related to the currency impact
    of the weaker U.S. dollar. Fourth quarter days sales
    outstanding remained consistent at 45 days in 2008, 2007
    and 2006. The Company has a revolving accounts receivable
    securitization facility whereby the Company is able to sell
    undivided fractional ownership interests in qualifying accounts
    receivable on an ongoing basis. At December 28, 2008 and
    December 30, 2007, there was $250,000 sold at each
    period-end under this program.

Inventories increased to $300,463 at December 28, 2008 from
    $259,081 at December 30, 2007. The increase relates to
    lower revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the
    weak retail environment and, to a lesser extent, the
    Company’s expansion into emerging markets. The
    December 28, 2008 inventory balance includes a decrease of
    approximately $20,900 as a result of the currency impact of the
    stronger U.S. dollar in 2008. The increase in inventory to
    $259,081 at December 30, 2007 from $203,337 at
    December 31, 2006 reflected the growth of the
    Company’s business in 2007. In addition, inventories
    increased approximately $9,400 due to the weaker
    U.S. dollar in 2007.

Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased to $171,387
    at December 28, 2008 from $199,912 at December 30,
    2007. This decrease is primarily due to utilization of a portion
    of the Marvel and the remainder of the Lucas prepaid royalty
    advances. Generally, when the Company enters into a licensing
    agreement for entertainment-based properties, an advance royalty
    payment is required at the inception of the agreement. This
    payment is then recognized in the consolidated statement of
    operations as the related sales are made. At



December 28, 2008, the Company had prepaid royalties
    related to the Marvel license in both current and non-current
    assets. Each reporting period, the Company reflects as current
    prepaid expense the amount of royalties it expects to reflect in
    the statement of operations in the upcoming twelve months. The
    decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets in 2008
    was partially offset by an increase in the value of the
    Company’s foreign currency contracts as a result of the
    strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Prepaid expenses and
    other current assets decreased to $199,912 at December 30,
    2007 from $243,291 at December 31, 2006. This decrease was
    primarily due to utilization of Marvel and Lucas royalty
    advances, as well as a decrease in deferred tax assets.

Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to $792,306 at
    December 28, 2008 from $742,122 at December 30, 2007.
    The increase was primarily the result of increased accrued
    royalties as a result of the utilization of the remainder of the
    Lucas prepaid royalty advance in the third quarter of 2008 as
    well as increased accrued pension primarily due to decreases in
    the Plans’ asset values in 2008. The December 28, 2008
    accounts payable and accrued expenses balance includes a
    decrease of approximately $64,300 as a result of the currency
    impact of the stronger U.S. dollar in 2008 compared to
    2007. Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased to
    $742,122 at December 30, 2007 from $895,311 at
    December 31, 2006. The decrease was primarily due to the
    Company’s exercise of its call option related to warrants
    required to be classified as a liability and repurchasing these
    warrants for $200,000 in cash in the second quarter of 2007. At
    December 31, 2006, these warrants had a fair value of
    $155,630. The decrease was also a result of the reclassification
    to non-current liabilities of the liabilities related to
    uncertain tax positions as a result of the adoption of FASB
    Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes” at the beginning of 2007. These decreases
    were partially offset by increases in accrued royalties
    primarily due to the significant sales of TRANSFORMERS
    movie-related products, accrued advertising due to higher levels
    of advertising expense in the fourth quarter of 2007, as well as
    higher accounts payable due to higher levels of inventory and
    expenses as of December 30, 2007.

Cash flows from investing activities were a net utilization of
    $271,920, $112,465 and $83,604 in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The 2008 utilization includes the Company’s
    purchase of the intellectual property rights related to the
    TRIVIAL PURSUIT brand for a total cost of $80,800 as well as
    $65,153 in cash, net of cash acquired, used to acquire Cranium,
    Inc. in January 2008. In July 2007, with the exception of rights
    to DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, the Company reacquired the
    remaining digital gaming rights for its owned or controlled
    properties held by Infogrames Entertainment SA (Infogrames). The
    acquisition price of $19,000 included $18,000 in cash and $1,000
    of non-cash consideration in the form of the return of preferred
    stock held by the Company in a subsidiary of Infogrames. The
    rights repurchased in 2007 were previously held by Infogrames on
    an exclusive basis as a result of a licensing agreement entered
    into during 2000. The Company made no acquisitions in 2006.
    During 2008, the Company expended approximately $117,000 on
    additions to its property, plant and equipment compared to
    $92,000 during 2007 and $82,000 during 2006. Of these amounts,
    56% in 2008, 61% in 2007 and 63% in 2006 were for purchases of
    tools, dies and molds related to the Company’s products. In
    2009, the Company expects capital expenditures to decrease and
    be in the range of $90,000 to $100,000. During the three years
    ended December 28, 2008, depreciation of plant and
    equipment was $87,873, $88,804, and $67,773, respectively.

The Company commits to inventory production, advertising and
    marketing expenditures prior to the peak third and fourth
    quarter retail selling season. Accounts receivable increase
    during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their
    purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday
    season. Due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling
    period, payments for these accounts receivable are generally not
    due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of
    the subsequent year. This timing difference between expenditures
    and cash collections on accounts receivable made it necessary
    for the Company to borrow higher amounts during the latter part
    of the year. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company primarily
    utilized cash from operations, borrowings under its available
    lines of credit and its accounts receivable securitization
    program to fund its operations.

The Company is party to an accounts receivable securitization
    program whereby the Company sells, on an ongoing basis,
    substantially all of its U.S. trade accounts receivable to
    a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, Hasbro Receivables
    Funding, LLC (“HRF”). HRF is consolidated with the
    Company for financial



reporting purposes. The securitization program then allows HRF
    to sell, on a revolving basis, an undivided fractional ownership
    interest of up to $250,000 in the eligible receivables it holds
    to certain bank conduits. During the period from the first day
    of the October fiscal month through the last day of the
    following January fiscal month, this limit is increased to
    $300,000. The program provides the Company with a source of
    working capital. Based on the amount of eligible accounts
    receivable as of December 28, 2008, the Company had
    availability under this program to sell $251,100, of which
    $250,000 was utilized.

The Company has a revolving credit agreement (the
    “Agreement”) which provides it with a $300,000
    committed borrowing facility. The Company has the ability to
    request increases in the committed facility in additional
    increments of at least $50,000, subject to lender agreement, up
    to a total committed facility of $500,000. The Agreement
    contains certain financial covenants setting forth leverage and
    coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of
    an investment grade facility, including with respect to liens,
    mergers and incurrence of indebtedness. The Company was in
    compliance with all covenants as of and for the fiscal year
    ended December 28, 2008. The Company had no borrowings
    outstanding under its committed revolving credit facility at
    December 28, 2008. However, letters of credit outstanding
    under this facility as of December 28, 2008 were
    approximately $1,700. Amounts available and unused under the
    committed line at December 28, 2008 were approximately
    $298,300. The Company also has other uncommitted lines from
    various banks, of which approximately $38,700 was utilized at
    December 28, 2008. Of the amount utilized under the
    uncommitted lines, approximately $7,500 and $31,200 represent
    outstanding borrowings and letters of credit, respectively.

Net cash utilized by financing activities was $457,391 in 2008.
    Of this amount, $360,244, which includes transaction costs, was
    used to repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock. In
    February 2008 the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
    the repurchase of an additional $500,000 in common stock after
    three previous authorizations dated May 2005, July 2006 and
    August 2007 with a cumulative authorized repurchase amount of
    $1,200,000 were fully utilized. During 2008, the Company
    repurchased 11,736 shares at an average price per share of
    $30.44. At December 28, 2008, $252,364 remained under the
    February 2008 authorization. Dividends paid were $107,065 in
    2008 compared to $94,097 in 2007, reflecting the increase in the
    Company’s quarterly dividend rate to $0.20 per share in
    2008 from $0.16 per share in 2007, and net of the effect of
    decreased shares outstanding in 2008 as a result of the share
    repurchases. In addition, $135,092 was used to repay long-term
    debt. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash receipts
    of $120,895 from the exercise of employee stock options.

Net cash utilized by financing activities was $433,917 in 2007.
    Of this amount, $584,349, which includes transaction costs, was
    used to repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock.
    During 2007, the Company repurchased 20,795 shares at an
    average price per share of $28.20. In addition, the Company
    purchased certain warrants in May 2007 for $200,000 in
    accordance with the terms of the call provision of the amended
    Lucas warrant agreement. Dividends paid were $94,097 in 2007,
    compared to $75,282 in 2006, reflecting the increase in the
    Company’s quarterly dividend rate to $0.16 per share in
    2007 compared to $0.12 per share in 2006. These uses of cash
    were partially offset by net proceeds of $346,009 from the
    issuance of $350,000 of notes that are due in 2017. The proceeds
    from the notes were primarily used to repay short-term
    borrowings. The uses of cash were also partially offset by cash
    receipts of $82,661 from the exercise of employee stock options.

Net cash utilized by financing activities was $467,279 in 2006.
    Of this amount, $456,744, which includes transaction costs, was
    used to repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock.
    During 2006, the Company repurchased 22,767 shares at an
    average price per share of $20.03. In addition, $32,743 was used
    to repay long-term debt. Dividends paid were $75,282 in 2006.
    These uses of cash were partially offset by cash receipts of
    $86,257 from the exercise of employee stock options.

At December 28, 2008, the Company has outstanding $249,828
    in principal amount of senior convertible debentures due 2021.
    The senior convertible debentures bear interest at 2.75%, which
    could be subject to an upward adjustment in the rate, not to
    exceed 11%, should the price of the Company’s common stock
    trade at or below $9.72 per share for 20 of the 30 trading days
    preceding the fifth day prior to an interest payment date. This
    contingent interest feature represents a derivative instrument
    that is recorded on the balance sheet at



its fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in the
    statement of operations. If the closing price of the
    Company’s common stock exceeds $23.76 for at least 20
    trading days, within the 30 consecutive trading day period
    ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter, or upon
    other specified events, the debentures will be convertible at an
    initial conversion price of $21.60 in the next calendar quarter.
    At December 31, 2007 and each of the calendar quarters in
    2008 this conversion feature was met and the debentures were
    convertible throughout 2008. There were no debentures converted
    during 2008. At December 31, 2008, this conversion feature
    was met again and the bonds are convertible through
    March 31, 2009 at which time the requirements of the
    conversion feature will be reevaluated. In addition, if the
    closing price of the Company’s common stock exceeds $27.00
    for at least 20 trading days in any 30 day period, the
    Company has the right to call the debentures by giving notice to
    the holders of the debentures. During a prescribed notice
    period, the holders of the debentures have the right to convert
    their debentures in accordance with the conversion terms
    described above. At certain times during the year, based on the
    Company’s common stock price, the Company had the right to
    call the debentures under this provision. As of
    December 28, 2008, the Company did not have the right to
    call the debentures. The Company believes a call would result in
    conversion by the holders of the debentures and issuance of the
    shares, thereby increasing the number of shares outstanding.
    Thus far, based on the Company’s targeted capital structure
    and the low cost of the debentures, when the debentures have
    been callable the Company has believed that it was more
    economically beneficial for it to not exercise its right to call
    the debentures. Currently, this economic benefit includes a
    lower cash cost of paying interest on the debentures than the
    Company would pay in dividends on the incremental number of
    shares that would be outstanding. The Company will continue to
    assess, at times when it is available, the desirability of
    exercising the call option in the future based on the then
    existing economic circumstances and the Company’s business
    objectives. The holders of these debentures may also put the
    notes back to Hasbro in December 2011 and December 2016 at the
    original principal amount. At that time, the purchase price may
    be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the
    two, at the Company’s discretion. While the Company’s
    current intent is to settle in cash any puts exercised, there
    can be no guarantee that the Company will have the funds
    necessary to settle this obligation in cash.

The $350,000 notes due in 2017 bear interest at a rate of 6.30%,
    which may be adjusted upward in the event that the
    Company’s credit rating from Moody’s Investor
    Services, Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings
    Services or Fitch Ratings is decreased two levels below the
    Company’s credit ratings on the date of issuance of the
    notes. From the date of issuance through December 28, 2008,
    the Company’s ratings from Moody’s Investor Services,
    Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and
    Fitch Ratings were BBB, Baa2 and BBB, respectively. The interest
    rate adjustment is dependent on the degree of decrease of the
    Company’s ratings and could range from 0.25% to a maximum
    of 2%. The Company may redeem the notes at its option at the
    greater of the principal amount of the notes or the present
    value of the remaining scheduled payments discounted using the
    effective interest rate on applicable U.S. Treasury bills
    at the time of repurchase. The Company currently has an open
    authorization from its Board of Directors to issue up to an
    additional $425,000 of long-term debt.

Including the debentures and notes described above, the Company
    has remaining principal amounts of long-term debt at
    December 28, 2008 of approximately $709,723 due at varying
    times from 2017 through 2028. In addition, the Company is
    committed to guaranteed royalty and other contractual payments
    of approximately $16,041 in 2009. The Company also had letters
    of credit and other similar instruments of approximately
    $100,700 and purchase commitments of $227,673 outstanding at
    December 28, 2008. The Company believes that cash from
    operations, including the securitization facility, and, if
    necessary, its line of credit, will allow the Company to meet
    these and other obligations described above.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates

The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. As such, management is required to
    make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it
    believes are reasonable based on information available. These
    estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets
    and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods
    presented. The significant accounting policies which management
    believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and



evaluating the Company’s reported financial results include
    sales allowances, recoverability of goodwill and intangible
    assets, recoverability of royalty advances and commitments,
    pension costs and obligations, stock-based compensation and
    income taxes.

Sales
    Allowances

Sales allowances for customer promotions, discounts and returns
    are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue
    is recognized. Revenue from product sales is recognized upon
    passing of title to the customer, generally at the time of
    shipment. Revenue from product sales, less related sales
    allowances, is added to royalty revenue and reflected as net
    revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. The
    Company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance
    programs with customers. These allowances primarily relate to
    fixed programs, which the customer earns based on purchases of
    Company products during the year. Discounts and allowances are
    recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale.
    While many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts, certain
    of the allowances, such as the returns allowance, are based on
    market data, historical trends and information from customers
    and are therefore subject to estimation.

For its allowance programs that are not fixed, such as returns,
    the Company estimates these amounts using a combination of
    historical experience and current market conditions. These
    estimates are reviewed periodically against actual results and
    any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or
    decrease to net revenues. During 2008, there have been no
    material adjustments to the Company’s estimates made in
    prior years.

Recoverability
    of Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite
    lives are tested for impairment at least annually. If an event
    occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying
    value may not be recoverable, the Company will perform an
    interim test at that time. The impairment test begins by
    allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable
    reporting units. Goodwill is then tested using a two step
    process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the
    reporting unit using an income approach, which looks to the
    present value of expected future cash flows.

The first step is a screen for potential impairment while the
    second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an
    indication from the first step that one exists. Intangible
    assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by
    comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value
    which is also calculated using an income approach. The
    Company’s annual impairment test was performed in the
    fourth quarter of 2008 and no impairment was indicated. The
    estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments
    and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the
    respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those
    revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in
    anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a
    change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge.
    The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the
    selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different
    assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash
    flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment
    charge. At December 28, 2008, the Company has goodwill and
    intangible assets with indefinite lives of $550,235 recorded on
    the balance sheet.

Intangible assets, other than those with indefinite lives, are
    amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for
    indications of impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Recoverability of the value of these intangible
    assets is measured by a comparison of the assets’ carrying
    value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected
    to be generated by the asset. If such assets were considered to
    be impaired, the impairment would be measured by the amount by
    which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value
    based on estimated future discounted cash flows. The estimation
    of future cash flows requires significant judgments and
    estimates with respect to future revenues related to the
    respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those
    revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in
    anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a
    change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge.
    The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the
    selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different
    assumptions would increase or



decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or
    decrease the related impairment charge. Intangible assets
    covered under this policy were $492,674 at December 28,
    2008. During 2008, there were no impairment charges related to
    these intangible assets.

Recoverability
    of Royalty Advances and Commitments

The recoverability of royalty advances and contractual
    obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is
    assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the
    estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow
    projections to be derived from the related product. If sales
    forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do
    not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty
    or, if the Company decides to discontinue a product line with
    royalty advances or commitments, a charge to royalty expense to
    write-off the non-recoverable minimum guaranty is required. The
    preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for
    these products requires judgments and estimates. Actual revenues
    and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of
    anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products
    could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of
    remaining minimum guaranteed royalties. At December 28,
    2008, the Company had $70,982 of prepaid royalties, $44,329 of
    which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets
    and $26,653 which are included in other assets.

Pension
    Costs and Obligations

The Company, except for certain international subsidiaries, has
    pension plans covering substantially all of its full-time
    employees. Pension expense is based on actuarial computations of
    current and future benefits using estimates for expected return
    on assets and applicable discount rates. At the end of 2007 the
    Company froze benefits under its two largest pension plans in
    the U.S., with no future benefits accruing to employees. The
    Company will continue to pay benefits under the plan consistent
    with the provisions existing at the date of the plan benefit
    freeze.

The estimates for the Company’s U.S. plans are
    established at the Company’s measurement date. In
    accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans”, (“SFAS No. 158”), the Company
    uses its fiscal year-end date as its measurement date to measure
    the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the
    expense for the upcoming year.

The Company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted
    average rate based on historical market data for the investment
    classes of assets held by the plan, the allocation of plan
    assets among those investment classes, and the current economic
    environment. Based on this information, the Company’s
    estimate of expected return on U.S. plan assets used in the
    calculation of 2008 pension expense for the U.S. plans was
    8.75%. A decrease in the estimate used for expected return on
    plan assets would increase pension expense, while an increase in
    this estimate would decrease pension expense. A decrease of
    0.25% in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would
    have increased 2008 pension expense for U.S. plans by
    approximately $685.

Discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the
    measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments
    currently available and expected to be available during the
    period to maturity of the pension benefits. The Company’s
    discount rate for its U.S. plans used for the calculation
    of 2008 pension expense averaged 6.34%. A decrease in the
    discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an
    increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense. A
    decrease of 0.25% in the Company’s discount rate would have
    increased 2008 pension expense and the 2008 projected benefit
    obligation by approximately $165 and $7,972, respectively.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 87, “Employers Accounting for Pensions”,
    actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are
    accumulated and, if outside a certain corridor, amortized over
    future periods and, therefore generally affect recognized
    expense in future periods. At December 28, 2008, the
    Company’s U.S. plans had unrecognized actuarial losses
    of $87,906 included in accumulated other comprehensive income
    related to its defined benefit pension plans compared to $19,158
    at December 30, 2007. The increase primarily reflects a
    decrease in the fair value of plan assets in 2008. Pension



plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value
    on the measurement date. These changes in the fair market value
    of plan assets impact the amount of future pension expense due
    to amortization of the unrecognized actuarial losses.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company has a stock-based compensation plan for employees
    and non-employee members of the Company’s Board of
    Directors. Under this plan, the Company may grant stock options
    at or above the fair market value of the Company’s stock,
    as well as restricted stock, restricted stock units and
    contingent stock performance awards. The Company measures all
    stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and
    records such expense in its consolidated financial statements.
    Total stock-based compensation expense recognized for the years
    ended December 28, 2008, December 30, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006 was $35,221, $29,402 and $22,832,
    respectively. As of December 28, 2008, total unrecognized
    stock-based compensation cost was approximately $33,700.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value
    stock options that are granted under these plans. The
    Black-Scholes method includes four significant assumptions:
    (1) expected term of the options, (2) risk-free
    interest rate, (3) expected dividend yield, and
    (4) expected stock price volatility. For the Company’s
    2008, 2007 and 2006 stock option grants, the weighted average
    expected term was approximately 5 years. This amount is
    based on a review of employees’ exercise history relating
    to stock options as well as the contractual term of the option.
    The weighted average risk-free interest rates used for 2008,
    2007 and 2006 stock option grants were 2.71%, 4.79% and 4.98%,
    respectively. This estimate was based on the interest rate
    available on U.S. treasury securities with durations that
    approximate the expected term of the option. The weighted
    average expected dividend yields used for the 2008, 2007 and
    2006 stock option grants were 2.95%, 1.97% and 2.55%,
    respectively, which is based on the Company’s current
    annual dividend amount divided by the stock price on the date of
    the grant. The weighted average expected stock price
    volatilities used were 22% for 2008 and 2007 stock option grants
    and 24% for 2006 stock option grants. These amounts were derived
    using a combination of current and historical implied price
    volatility. Implied price volatility reflects the volatility
    implied in publicly traded options on the Company’s common
    stock, which the Company believes represents the expected future
    volatility of the Company’s stock price. The Company
    believes that since this is a market-based estimate, it provides
    a better estimate of expected future volatility as compared to
    based only on historical volatility.

In 2008, 2007 and 2006, as part of its employee stock-based
    compensation plan, the Company issued contingent stock
    performance awards, which provide the recipients with the
    ability to earn shares of the Company’s common stock based
    on the Company’s achievement of stated cumulative diluted
    earnings per share and cumulative net revenue targets over the
    three fiscal years ended December 2010 for the 2008 award, over
    the three fiscal years ended December 2009 for the 2007 award,
    and over a ten quarter period beginning July 3, 2006 and
    ending December 2008 for the 2006 award. Each award has a target
    number of shares of common stock associated with such award
    which may be earned by the recipient if the Company achieves the
    stated diluted earnings per share and net revenue targets. These
    awards are valued based on the fair market value of the
    Company’s common stock on the date of the grant and
    expensed over the performance period. The measurement of the
    expense related to this award is based on the Company’s
    current estimate of revenues and diluted earnings per share over
    the performance period. Changes in these estimates may impact
    the expense recognized related to these awards.

Income
    Taxes

The Company’s annual income tax rate is based on its
    income, statutory tax rates, changes in prior tax positions, and
    tax planning opportunities available in the various
    jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment and
    estimates are required to determine the Company’s annual
    tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions. Despite the
    Company’s belief that its tax return positions are fully
    supportable, these positions are subject to challenge and
    estimated liabilities are established in the event that these
    positions are challenged and the Company is not successful in
    defending these challenges. These estimated liabilities are
    adjusted, as well as the related interest, in light of changing
    facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit.



An estimated effective income tax rate is applied to the
    Company’s quarterly operating results. In the event there
    is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the
    Company’s quarterly operating results, the tax attributable
    to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the time.
    Changes in the Company’s estimated effective income tax
    rate during 2008 were primarily due to changes in its estimate
    of earnings by tax jurisdiction. In addition, changes in
    judgment regarding likely outcomes related to tax positions
    taken in a prior fiscal year, or tax costs or benefits from a
    resolution of such positions would be recorded entirely in the
    interim period the judgment changes or resolution occurs. During
    2008, the Company recorded a total benefit of approximately
    $10,200 related to discrete tax events primarily comprised of a
    benefit related to the repatriation of certain foreign earnings
    to the U.S., as well as the settlement of various tax
    examinations in multiple jurisdictions.

In certain cases, tax law requires items to be included in the
    Company’s income tax returns at a different time than when
    these items are recognized on the financial statements or at a
    different amount than that which is recognized in the financial
    statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as
    expenses that are not deductible on the Company’s tax
    returns, while other differences are temporary and will reverse
    over time, such as depreciation expense. These differences that
    will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and
    liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Deferred tax
    assets represent credits or deductions that have been reflected
    in the financial statements but have not yet been reflected in
    the Company’s income tax returns. Valuation allowances are
    established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is
    determined that the Company will have insufficient future
    taxable income, including capital gains, to fully realize the
    future credits, deductions or capital losses. Deferred tax
    liabilities represent expenses recognized in the Company’s
    income tax return that have not yet been recognized in the
    Company’s financial statements or income recognized in the
    financial statements that has not yet been recognized in the
    Company’s income tax return. During 2007, the Mexican
    government instituted a tax structure which results in companies
    paying the higher of an income-based tax or an alternative flat
    tax commencing in 2008. Should the Company be subject to the
    alternative flat tax, it would be required to review whether its
    net deferred tax assets would be realized. During 2008 the
    Company was subject to the income-based tax. As the Company
    believes that it will continue to be subject to the income-based
    tax in 2009, it believes that the net deferred tax assets
    related to the Mexican tax jurisdiction will be realizable.
    Should the facts and circumstances change, the Company may be
    required to reevaluate deferred tax assets related to its
    Mexican operations, which may result in additional tax expense.

Contractual
    Obligations and Commercial Commitments

In the normal course of its business, the Company enters into
    contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under
    license, which may require the payment of minimum guarantees, as
    well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and
    equipment. In addition, the Company has $709,723 in principal
    amount of long-term debt outstanding at December 28, 2008.
    Future payments required under these and other obligations as of
    December 28, 2008 are as follows:

The Company has a liability at December 28, 2008, including
    potential interest and penalties, of $92,812 for uncertain tax
    positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in
    various income tax returns. The Company does not know the
    ultimate resolution of these uncertain tax positions and as
    such, does not know



the ultimate timing of payments related to this liability.
    Accordingly, these amounts are not included in the table above.

Included in the Thereafter column above is $249,828 in principal
    amount of senior convertible debt due 2021. The holders of these
    debentures may put the notes back to the Company in December
    2011 and December 2016 at the principal amount. At that time,
    the purchase price may be paid in cash, shares of common stock
    or a combination of the two. In addition, at December 28,
    2008, these debentures may be converted to shares at an initial
    conversion price of $21.60 per share through March 31,
    2009, at which time the requirements of the contingent
    conversion feature will be reevaluated. If the closing price of
    the Company’s common stock exceeds $23.76 for at least 20
    trading days within the 30 consecutive trading day period ending
    on the last trading day of a calendar quarter, or upon other
    specified events, the debentures will be convertible at the
    initial conversion price of $21.60.

The Company’s agreement with Marvel provides for minimum
    guaranteed royalty payments and requires the Company to make
    minimum expenditures on marketing and promotional activities.
    The future minimum contractual payments in the table above
    include future guaranteed contractual royalty payments of
    $35,000 payable to Marvel that are contingent upon the
    theatrical release of SPIDER-MAN 4 which the Company currently
    expects to be paid in 2011. Subsequent to December 28,
    2008, the Company entered into an agreement with Marvel that
    resulted in the extension of the current agreement from the end
    of 2011 through the end of 2017. The extended agreement includes
    an additional $100,000 in minimum guaranteed royalties, with the
    potential for up to an additional $140,000 in guaranteed
    royalties contingent upon the release by Marvel of certain
    MARVEL character-based theatrical releases that meet certain
    defined criteria. Amounts that are or may be payable to Marvel
    under this extended agreement are not reflected in the table
    above.

In addition to the amounts included in the table above, the
    Company expects to make contributions totaling approximately
    $17,100 related to its unfunded U.S. and other
    International pension plans in 2009. The Company also has
    letters of credit and related instruments of approximately
    $100,700 at December 28, 2008.

Financial
    Risk Management

The Company is exposed to market risks attributable to
    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the
    result of sourcing products priced in U.S. dollars, Hong
    Kong dollars and Euros while marketing those products in more
    than twenty currencies. Results of operations may be affected
    primarily by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, Hong
    Kong dollar, Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and Mexican
    peso and, to a lesser extent, currencies in Latin American and
    Asia Pacific countries.

To manage this exposure, the Company has hedged a portion of its
    forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange
    forward contracts. The Company estimates that a hypothetical
    immediate 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against
    foreign currencies could result in an approximate $64,500
    decrease in the fair value of these instruments. A decrease in
    the fair value of these instruments would be substantially
    offset by decreases in the related forecasted foreign currency
    transactions.

The Company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with
    respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short-term
    borrowing positions in currencies other than the
    U.S. dollar. The Company believes, however, that the
    on-going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its
    financial condition. In addition, the Company’s revenues
    and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by
    changes in foreign currency rates. A significant change in
    foreign exchange rates can materially impact the Company’s
    revenues and earnings due to translation of foreign revenues and
    costs. The Company does not hedge against translation impacts of
    foreign exchange. From time to time, affiliates of the Company
    may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than
    their functional currency. The Company manages this exposure at
    the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts.

The Company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an
    asset or liability on the balance sheet. The Company does not
    speculate in foreign currency exchange contracts. At
    December 28, 2008, these contracts had unrealized gains of
    $72,053, of which $32,203 are recorded in prepaid expenses and
    other current assets and $39,850 are recorded in other assets.
    Included in accumulated other comprehensive income at
    December 28, 2008 are deferred gains of $63,513, net of tax.



At December 28, 2008, the Company had fixed rate long-term
    debt of $709,723. The Company estimates that a hypothetical one
    percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would
    increase or decrease the fair value of this long-term debt by
    approximately $34,300 or $30,900, respectively.

The
    Economy and Inflation

The principal market for the Company’s products is the
    retail sector. Revenues from the Company’s top five
    customers, all retailers, accounted for approximately 52% of its
    consolidated net revenues in 2008 and 2007 and 53% of its
    consolidated net revenues in 2006. In the past three years
    certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic
    difficulty. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its
    customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems
    appropriate.

The Company’s revenue pattern continues to show the second
    half of the year to be more significant to its overall business
    for the full year. In 2008, approximately 63% of the
    Company’s full year net revenues were recognized in the
    second half of the year. Although the Company expects that this
    concentration will continue, particularly as more of its
    business has shifted to larger customers with order patterns
    concentrated in the second half of the year, this concentration
    may be less in years where the Company has products related to a
    major motion picture release that occurs in the first half of
    the year. In 2008 the Company had products related to the
    mid-year major motion picture releases of IRONMAN, THE
    INCREDIBLE HULK and INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL
    SKULL. The concentration of sales in the second half of the year
    increases the risk of (a) underproduction of popular items,
    (b) overproduction of less popular items, and
    (c) failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping
    schedules. The business of the Company is characterized by
    customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely
    because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a
    product line, product availability, marketing strategies,
    inventory levels, policies of retailers and differences in
    overall economic conditions. The trend of larger retailers has
    been to maintain lower inventories throughout the year and
    purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the
    fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season, which includes
    Christmas.

Quick response inventory management practices being used by
    retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate
    delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of
    shipment. Retailers are timing their orders so that they are
    being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by
    consumers. To the extent that retailers do not sell as much of
    their year-end inventory purchases during this holiday selling
    season as they had anticipated, their demand for additional
    product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed,
    thus negatively impacting the Company’s revenues. In
    addition, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the
    Company’s significant retailers could negatively impact the
    Company’s future revenues.

The effect of inflation on the Company’s operations during
    2008 was not significant and the Company will continue its
    policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices, accordingly.

New
    Accounting Pronouncements

Effective at the beginning of 2009, the Company is required to
    prospectively adopt the provisions of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 141 (Revised 2007), “Business
    Combinations”, (“SFAS 141R”), which makes
    certain modifications to the accounting for business
    combinations. These changes include (1) the requirement for
    an acquirer to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities
    assumed at their fair value on the acquisition date;
    (2) the requirement for an acquirer to recognize assets or
    liabilities arising from contingencies at fair value as of that
    acquisition date; and (3) the requirement that an acquirer
    expense all acquisition related costs. This Statement is
    required to be applied prospectively to business combinations
    for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of
    fiscal 2009.

Effective at the beginning of 2009, the Company is required to
    prospectively adopt the provisions of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 160, “Noncontrolling
    Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements”,
    (“SFAS 160”) which requires noncontrolling
    (minority) interests in subsidiaries to be initially measured at
    fair value and presented as a separate component of
    shareholders’ equity. Current practice is to present
    noncontrolling interests as a liability or other item outside of
    equity. The presentation and disclosure provisions of
    SFAS 160 are required to be applied on a retrospective
    basis. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 160
    to have an impact on its consolidated balance sheet or results
    of operations.



In March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities”,
    (“SFAS 161”), which requires enhanced disclosures
    related to derivative instruments and hedging activities. This
    Statement is effective for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years and interim periods beginning after
    November 15, 2008, and the disclosure requirements will be
    applicable for the Company’s 2009 consolidated financial
    statements.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    No. 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosures about
    Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets”,
    (“FSP 132(R)-1”). FSP 132(R)-1 provides
    guidance on an employer’s disclosures about plan assets of
    a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. The
    disclosures required by FSP 132(R)-1 will be applicable for
    the Company’s year-end 2009 financial statements.

In 2009 the Company will adopt the remaining provisions of
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements”, (“SFAS 157”)
    for non-financial assets. The adoption of these provisions will
    not have an impact on the Company’s statements of
    operations or statement of financial position.

Other
    Information

The Company is not aware of any material amounts of potential
    exposure relating to environmental matters and does not believe
    its environmental compliance costs or liabilities to be material
    to its operating results or financial position.

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Hasbro, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Hasbro, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 28, 2008 and
    December 30, 2007, and the related consolidated statements
    of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for
    each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended
    December 28, 2008. These consolidated financial statements
    are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
    financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Hasbro, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
    December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, and the
    results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
    fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 28,
    2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Hasbro, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 28, 2008, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO), and our report dated February 24, 2009 expressed an
    unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.

(1)

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Hasbro, Inc. and all majority-owned subsidiaries
    (“Hasbro” or the “Company”). Investments
    representing 20% to 50% ownership interest in other companies
    are accounted for using the equity method. The Company had no
    equity method investments at December 28, 2008 that were
    material to the consolidated financial statements. All
    significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
    eliminated.

Preparation
    of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
    notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the 2007 and 2006 consolidated financial
    statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2008
    presentation.

Fiscal
    Year

Hasbro’s fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in December.
    The fiscal years ended December 28, 2008 and
    December 30, 2007 were fifty-two week periods while the
    fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 was a fifty-three week
    period.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and highly
    liquid investments purchased with a maturity to the Company of
    three months or less.

Marketable
    Securities

Marketable securities are comprised of investments in
    publicly-traded securities, classified as

available-for-sale,

and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses,
    net of tax, reported as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive earnings (“AOCE”) within
    shareholders’ equity until realized. Unrealized losses are
    evaluated to determine the nature of the losses. If the losses
    are determined to be other than temporary, the basis of the
    security is adjusted and the loss is recognized in earnings at
    that time. These securities are included in other assets in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Accounts
    Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Credit is granted to customers predominantly on an unsecured
    basis. Credit limits and payment terms are established based on
    extensive evaluations made on an ongoing basis throughout the
    fiscal year with regard to the financial performance, cash
    generation, financing availability and liquidity status of each
    customer. The majority of customers are formally reviewed at
    least annually; more frequent reviews are performed based on the
    customer’s financial condition and the level of credit
    being extended. For customers on credit who are experiencing
    financial difficulties, management performs additional financial
    analyses before shipping orders. The Company uses a variety of
    financial transactions based on availability and cost, to
    increase the collectibility of certain of its accounts,
    including letters of credit, credit insurance, factoring with
    unrelated third parties, and requiring cash in advance of
    shipping.

The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts at the
    time revenue is recognized based on management’s assessment
    of the business environment, customers’ financial
    condition, historical collection experience, accounts receivable
    aging and customer disputes. When a significant event occurs,
    such as a bankruptcy filing by a specific customer, and on a
    quarterly basis, the allowance is reviewed for adequacy and the
    balance or accrual rate is adjusted to reflect current risk
    prospects.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out) or market. Based upon a consideration of quantities
    on hand, actual and projected sales volume, anticipated product
    selling price and product lines planned to be discontinued,
    slow-moving and obsolete inventory is written down to its
    estimated net realizable value.

At December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, finished
    goods comprised 93% and 91% of inventories, respectively.

Long-Lived
    Assets

The Company’s long-lived assets consist of property, plant
    and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
    lives as well as other intangible assets the Company considers
    to have a defined life.

Goodwill results from acquisitions the Company has made over
    time. Substantially all of the other intangibles consist of the
    cost of acquired product rights. In establishing the value of
    such rights, the Company considers existing trademarks,
    copyrights, patents, license agreements and other
    product-related rights. These rights were valued at their
    acquisition date based on the anticipated future cash flows from
    the underlying product line. The Company has certain intangible
    assets related to the Tonka and Milton Bradley acquisitions that
    have an indefinite life.

Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives
    are not amortized and are tested for impairment at least
    annually. The annual test begins with goodwill and all
    intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units.
    Goodwill is then tested using a two-step process that begins
    with an estimation of fair value of the reporting unit using an
    income approach, which looks to the present value of expected
    future cash flows. The first step is a screen for potential
    impairment while the second step measures the amount of
    impairment if there is an indication from the first step that
    one exists. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested
    annually for impairment by comparing their carrying value to
    their estimated fair value, also calculated using the present
    value of expected future cash flows.

The remaining intangibles having defined lives are being
    amortized over periods ranging from five to twenty-five years,
    primarily using the straight-line method. At December 28,
    2008, approximately 6% of other intangibles relate to rights
    acquired in connection with a major entertainment property and
    are being amortized over the contract life, in proportion to
    projected sales of the licensed products during the same period.

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less
    accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using
    accelerated and straight-line methods to depreciate the cost of
    property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives.
    The principal lives, in years, used in determining depreciation
    rates of various assets are: land improvements 15 to 19,
    buildings and improvements 15 to 25 and machinery and equipment
    3 to 12. Depreciation expense is classified on the statement of
    operations based on the nature of the property and equipment
    being depreciated. Tools, dies and molds are depreciated over a
    three-year period or their useful lives, whichever is less,
    using an accelerated method. The Company generally owns all
    tools, dies and molds related to its products.

(Thousands

The Company reviews property, plant and equipment and other
    intangibles with defined lives for impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the
    carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future
    undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or
    asset group. If such assets were considered to be impaired, the
    impairment to be recognized would be measured by the amount by
    which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value.
    Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or
    appraised values, depending on the nature of the assets. Assets
    to be disposed of are carried at the lower of the net book value
    or their estimated fair value less disposal costs.

Financial
    Instruments

Hasbro’s financial instruments include cash and cash
    equivalents, accounts receivable, marketable securities,
    short-term borrowings, accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
    At December 28, 2008, the carrying cost of these
    instruments approximated their fair value. The Company’s
    financial instruments at December 28, 2008 also include
    long-term borrowings (see note 7 for carrying cost and
    related fair values) as well as certain assets and liabilities
    measured at fair value (see notes 10 and 14).

Securitization
    and Transfer of Financial Instruments

Hasbro has an agreement that allows the Company to sell, on an
    ongoing basis, an undivided fractional ownership interest in
    certain of its trade accounts receivable through a revolving
    securitization arrangement. The Company retains servicing
    responsibilities for, as well as a subordinate interest in the
    transferred receivables. Hasbro accounts for the securitization
    of trade accounts receivable as a sale in accordance with
    SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and
    Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of
    Liabilities” (“SFAS 140”). As a result, the
    related receivables are removed from the consolidated balance
    sheet.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue from product sales is recognized upon the passing of
    title to the customer, generally at the time of shipment.
    Provisions for discounts, rebates and returns are made when the
    related revenues are recognized. The Company bases its estimates
    for discounts, rebates and returns on agreed customer terms and
    historical experience.

The Company enters into arrangements licensing its brand names
    on specifically approved products. The licensees pay the Company
    royalties as products are sold, in some cases subject to minimum
    guaranteed amounts. Royalty revenues are recognized as they are
    reported as earned and payment becomes assured, over the life of
    the agreement. Revenue from product sales less related
    provisions for discounts, rebates and returns, as well as
    royalty revenues comprise net revenues in the consolidated
    statements of operations.

Royalties

The Company enters into license agreements with inventors,
    designers and others for the use of intellectual properties in
    its products. These agreements may call for payment in advance
    or future payment for minimum guaranteed amounts. Amounts paid
    in advance are recorded as an asset and charged to expense as
    revenue from the related products is recognized. If all or a
    portion of the minimum guaranteed amounts appear not to be
    recoverable through future use of the rights obtained under
    license, the nonrecoverable portion of the guaranty is charged
    to expense at that time.

Advertising

Production costs of commercials and programming are charged to
    operations in the fiscal year during which the production is
    first aired. The costs of other advertising, promotion and
    marketing programs are charged to operations in the fiscal year
    incurred.

Shipping
    and Handling

Hasbro expenses costs related to the shipment and handling of
    goods to customers as incurred. For 2008, 2007, and 2006, these
    costs were $178,738, $167,868 and $145,729, respectively, and
    are included in selling, distribution and administration
    expenses.

Operating
    Leases

Hasbro records lease expense in such a manner as to recognize
    this expense on a straight-line basis inclusive of rent
    concessions and rent increases. Reimbursements from lessors for
    leasehold improvements are deferred and recognized as a
    reduction to lease expense over the lease term.

Income
    Taxes

Hasbro uses the asset and liability approach for financial
    accounting and reporting of income taxes. Deferred income taxes
    have not been provided on the majority of undistributed earnings
    of international subsidiaries as the majority of such earnings
    are indefinitely reinvested by the Company.

On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation
    No. 48 (“FIN 48”), which applies to all tax
    positions accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”.
    FIN 48 prescribes a two step process for the measurement of
    uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to
    be taken in a tax return. The first step is a determination of
    whether the tax position should be recognized in the financial
    statements. The second step determines the measurement of the
    tax position. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
    derecognition of such tax positions, classification, potential
    interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and
    disclosure. The Company records potential interest and penalties
    on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.
    See note 8 for further information regarding the adoption
    of FIN 48.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into
    U.S. dollars at period-end rates, and revenues, costs and
    expenses are translated at weighted average rates during each
    reporting period. Earnings include gains or losses resulting
    from foreign currency transactions and, when required,
    translation gains and losses resulting from the use of the
    U.S. dollar as the functional currency in highly
    inflationary economies. Other gains and losses resulting from
    translation of financial statements are a component of other
    comprehensive earnings.

Pension
    Plans, Postretirement and Postemployment
    Benefits

Hasbro, except for certain international subsidiaries, has
    pension plans covering substantially all of its full-time
    employees. Pension expense is based on actuarial computations of
    current and future benefits. In December 2006, the Company
    adopted the recognition provisions of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans” (“SFAS 158”), which amends
    SFAS 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). In 2007, the Company adopted
    the measurement date provisions of SFAS 158, which required
    the Company to change the measurement date of certain of its
    defined benefit plans to the Company’s fiscal year-end
    date. Previously, the measurement date for certain of

the Company’s defined benefit plans was September 30.
    See notes 2 and 12 for the impact of adopting of this
    statement.

The Company’s policy is to fund amounts which are required
    by applicable regulations and which are tax deductible. In 2009,
    the Company expects to contribute approximately $17,100 to its
    pension plans. The estimated amounts of future payments to be
    made under other retirement programs are being accrued currently
    over the period of active employment and are also included in
    pension expense.

Hasbro has a contributory postretirement health and life
    insurance plan covering substantially all employees who retire
    under any of its United States defined benefit pension plans and
    meet certain age and length of service requirements. The cost of
    providing these benefits on behalf of employees who retired
    prior to 1993 is and will continue to be substantially borne by
    the Company. The cost of providing benefits on behalf of
    substantially all employees who retire after 1992 is borne by
    the employee. It also has several plans covering certain groups
    of employees, which may provide benefits to such employees
    following their period of employment but prior to their
    retirement. The Company measures the costs of these obligations
    based on actuarial computations.

Risk
    Management Contracts

Hasbro uses foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the
    impact of currency rate fluctuations on firmly committed and
    projected future foreign currency transactions. These

over-the-counter

contracts, which hedge future purchases of inventory and other
    cross-border currency requirements not denominated in the
    functional currency of the unit, are primarily denominated in
    United States and Hong Kong dollars, Euros and United Kingdom
    pound sterling and are entered into with a number of
    counterparties, all of which are major financial institutions.
    The Company believes that a default by a counterparty would not
    have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the
    Company. Hasbro does not enter into derivative financial
    instruments for speculative purposes.

At the inception of the contracts, Hasbro designates its
    derivatives as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The
    Company formally documents all relationships between hedging
    instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management
    objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge
    transactions. All hedges designated as cash flow hedges are
    linked to forecasted transactions and the Company assesses, both
    at the inception of the hedge and on an on-going basis, the
    effectiveness of the derivatives used in hedging transactions in
    offsetting changes in the cash flows of the forecasted
    transaction. The ineffective portion of a hedging derivative, if
    any, is immediately recognized in the consolidated statements of
    operations.

The Company records all derivatives, such as foreign currency
    exchange contracts, on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes
    in the derivative fair values that are designated effective and
    qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred and recorded as a
    component of AOCE until the hedged transactions occur and are
    then recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.
    The Company’s foreign currency contracts hedging
    anticipated cash flows are designated as cash flow hedges. When
    it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a
    hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively.
    Any gain or loss deferred through that date remains in AOCE
    until the forecasted transaction occurs, at which time it is
    reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations. To
    the extent the transaction is no longer deemed probable of
    occurring, hedge accounting treatment is discontinued and
    amounts deferred would be reclassified to the consolidated
    statements of operations. In the event hedge accounting
    requirements are not met, gains and losses on such instruments
    are included currently in the consolidated statements of
    operations. The Company uses derivatives to economically hedge
    intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies. Due to the
    short-term nature of the derivative contracts involved, the
    Company does not use hedge accounting for these contracts.

Accounting
    for Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has stock-based employee compensation plans and
    plans for non-employee members of the Company’s Board of
    Directors. Under these plans the Company may grant stock options
    at or above the fair market value of the Company’s stock,
    as well as restricted stock, restricted stock units and
    contingent stock performance awards. All awards are measured at
    fair value at the date of the grant and amortized as expense on
    a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the
    award. For awards contingent upon Company performance, the
    measurement of the expense for these awards is based on the
    Company’s current estimate of its performance over the
    performance period. See note 11 for further discussion.

Net
    Earnings Per Common Share

Basic net earnings per share is computed by dividing net
    earnings by the weighted average number of shares outstanding
    for the year. Diluted net earnings per share is similar except
    that the weighted average number of shares outstanding is
    increased by dilutive securities, and net earnings are adjusted
    for certain amounts related to dilutive securities. Dilutive
    securities include shares issuable under convertible debt, as
    well as shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and
    warrants for which the market price exceeds the exercise price,
    less shares which could have been purchased by the Company with
    the related proceeds. Dilutive securities may also include
    shares potentially issuable to settle liabilities. Options and
    warrants totaling 3,491, 3,250 and 5,148 for 2008, 2007 and
    2006, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of
    diluted earnings per share because to include them would have
    been antidilutive.

A reconciliation of net earnings and average number of shares
    for each of the three fiscal years ended December 28, 2008
    is as follows:

    well as to add back to outstanding shares the amount of shares
    potentially issuable under the contingent conversion feature of
    these debentures. See note 7 for further information on the
    contingent conversion feature.

Certain warrants containing a put feature that could be settled
    in cash or common stock were required to be accounted for as a
    liability at fair value. These warrants were repurchased by the
    Company in May of

2007. Prior to their repurchase, the Company was required to
    assess if these warrants, classified as a liability, had a more
    dilutive impact on earnings per share when treated as an equity
    contract. For the years ended December 30, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006, the warrants had a more dilutive impact
    on earnings per share assuming they were treated as a liability
    and no adjustments to net earnings or equivalent shares was
    required.

    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Income taxes related to
    reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive earnings
    of $763, $1,412 and $85 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively,
    were included in these amounts.

In the first quarter of 2007, in accordance with
    SFAS No. 158, the Company changed its measurement date
    for certain of its defined benefit pension plans and its
    postretirement plan from September 30 to the Company’s
    fiscal year-end date. As a result of this change, the assets and
    liabilities of these plans were remeasured as of
    December 31, 2006, the 2006 fiscal year-end date of the
    Company. This remeasurement resulted in an adjustment to
    accumulated other comprehensive earnings of $7,779 net of
    taxes of $4,765, during the first quarter of 2007.

At December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the recognition
    provisions of SFAS 158, which required the Company to
    recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and
    postretirement plans as an asset or liability in its statement
    of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded
    status in the year in which the changes occur through
    comprehensive income. The adoption of this statement resulted in
    an adjustment of $(26,750), net of taxes of $12,645, to
    accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2006.

Goodwill
    and Intangibles

Goodwill and certain intangible assets relating to rights
    obtained in the Company’s acquisition of Milton Bradley in
    1984 and Tonka in 1991 are not amortized. These rights were
    determined to have indefinite lives and total approximately
    $75,700. The Company’s other intangible assets are
    amortized over their remaining useful lives, and accumulated
    amortization of these other intangibles is reflected in other
    intangibles, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

The Company performs an annual impairment test on goodwill and
    intangible assets with indefinite lives. This annual impairment
    test is performed in the fourth quarter of the Company’s
    fiscal year. In addition, if an event occurs or circumstances
    change that indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable, the Company will perform an interim impairment test
    at that time. For the three fiscal years ended December 28,
    2008, no such events occurred. The Company completed its annual
    impairment tests in the fourth quarters of 2008, 2007 and 2006
    and had no impairment charges.

A portion of the Company’s goodwill and other intangible
    assets reside in the Corporate segment of the business. For
    purposes of testing pursuant to Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets”, these assets are allocated to the
    reporting units within the Company’s operating segments. In
    2008 the Company reorganized the reporting structure of its
    operating segments (see note 16). The Company has adjusted
    its prior year information to reflect the current reporting
    structure and reallocated

In January 2008 the Company acquired Cranium, Inc.
    (“Cranium”), a developer and marketer of
    children’s and adult board games, in order to supplement
    its existing game portfolio for a total cost of approximately
    $68,000. Based on the allocation of the purchase price, property
    rights related to acquired product lines of approximately
    $68,500 were recorded as intangible assets in the acquisition.
    These property rights are being amortized over a fifteen year
    estimated useful life. Goodwill of $8,822 was also recorded as a
    result of the transaction. The consolidated statement of
    operations of the Company for 2008 includes the operations of
    Cranium from the closing date of January 25, 2008.

A summary of the Company’s other intangibles, net at
    December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007 is as follows:

In the second quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company purchased all
    of the intellectual property rights related to the TRIVIAL
    PURSUIT brand from Horn Abbot Ltd. and Horn Abbot International
    Limited (together the “Seller”) for a total cost of
    approximately $80,800. Previous to this asset purchase, the
    Company licensed these rights from the Seller. The cost was
    recorded as property rights and included in other intangibles.
    These property rights are being amortized over a fifteen year
    estimated useful life.

In July 2007, with the exception of rights to
    DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, the Company reacquired the
    remaining digital gaming rights for its owned or controlled
    properties held by Infogrames Entertainment SA (Infogrames). The
    acquisition price of $19,000 included $18,000 in cash and $1,000
    of non-cash consideration in the form of the return of preferred
    stock held by the Company in a subsidiary of Infogrames. These
    rights were previously held by Infogrames on an exclusive basis
    as a result of a license agreement. The consideration to
    reacquire these rights, which represents fair value, is included
    as a component of other intangible assets in the consolidated
    balance sheets and is being amortized over a period of
    approximately 5 years.

The Company will continue to incur amortization expense related
    to the use of acquired and licensed rights to produce various
    products. The amortization of these product rights will
    fluctuate depending on related projected revenues during an
    annual period, as well as rights reaching the end of their
    useful lives. The Company currently estimates continuing
    amortization expense related to the above intangible assets for
    the next five years to be approximately:

Financing
    Arrangements

Short-Term
    Borrowings

At December 28, 2008, Hasbro had available an unsecured
    committed line and unsecured uncommitted lines of credit from
    various banks approximating $300,000 and $174,200, respectively.
    A significant portion of the short-term borrowings outstanding
    at the end of 2008, and all of the short-term borrowings
    outstanding at the end of 2007, represent borrowings made under,
    or supported by, these lines of credit. The weighted average
    interest rates of the outstanding borrowings as of
    December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007 were 10.7% and
    5.5%, respectively. The Company had no borrowings outstanding
    under its committed line of credit at December 28, 2008.
    During 2008, Hasbro’s working capital needs were fulfilled
    by cash generated from operations, borrowings under lines of
    credit, and the Company’s accounts receivable
    securitization program. Borrowings under the lines of credit
    were on terms and at interest rates generally extended to
    companies of comparable creditworthiness.

The unsecured committed line (the “Agreement”)
    provides the Company with a $300,000 committed borrowing
    facility through June 2011. The Company has the ability to
    request increases in the committed facility in additional
    increments of at least $50,000, subject to lender agreement, up
    to a total committed facility of $500,000. The Agreement
    contains certain financial covenants setting forth leverage and
    coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of
    an investment grade facility, including with respect to liens,
    mergers and incurrence of indebtedness. The Company was in
    compliance with all covenants as of and for the year ended
    December 28, 2008.

The Company pays a commitment fee (0.10% as of December 28,
    2008) based on the unused portion of the facility and
    interest equal to LIBOR or Prime plus a spread on borrowings
    under the facility. The commitment fee and the amount of the
    spread to LIBOR or Prime both vary based on the Company’s
    long-term debt ratings and the Company’s leverage. At
    December 28, 2008, the interest rate under the facility was
    equal to LIBOR plus 0.50% or Prime.

Securitization

The Company is party to a receivable securitization program
    whereby the Company sells, on an ongoing basis, substantially
    all of its U.S. trade accounts receivable to a
    bankruptcy-remote, special purpose subsidiary, Hasbro
    Receivables Funding, LLC (HRF), which is wholly-owned and
    consolidated by the Company. HRF will, subject to certain
    conditions, sell, from time to time on a revolving basis, an
    undivided fractional ownership interest in up to $250,000 of
    eligible domestic receivables to various multi-party commercial
    paper conduits supported by a committed liquidity facility.
    During the period from the first day of the October fiscal month
    through the last day of the following January fiscal month, this
    limit is increased to $300,000. Under the terms of the
    agreement, new receivables are added to the pool as collections
    reduce previously held



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

receivables. The Company expects to service, administer, and
    collect the receivables on behalf of HRF and the conduits. The
    net proceeds of sale will be less than the face amount of
    accounts receivable sold by an amount that approximates a
    financing cost.

The receivables facility contains certain restrictions on the
    Company and HRF that are customary for facilities of this type.
    The commitments under the facility are subject to termination
    prior to their term upon the occurrence of certain events,
    including payment defaults, breach of covenants, breach of
    representations or warranties, bankruptcy, and failure of the
    receivables to satisfy certain performance criteria.

As of December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007 the
    utilization of the receivables facility was $250,000. As of
    December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007 the Company
    had an additional $1,106 and $16,550, respectively, available to
    sell under the facility. The transactions are accounted for as
    sales under SFAS 140. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the loss
    on the sale of the receivables totaled $5,302, $7,982 and
    $2,241, respectively, which is recorded in selling, distribution
    and administration expenses in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of operations. The discount on interests sold is
    approximately equal to the interest rate paid by the conduits to
    the holders of the commercial paper plus other fees. The
    discount rate as of December 28, 2008 was approximately
    3.00%.

Upon sale to the conduits, HRF continues to hold a subordinated
    retained interest in the receivables. The subordinated interest
    in receivables is recorded at fair value, which is determined
    based on the present value of future expected cash flows
    estimated using management’s best estimates of credit
    losses and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved.
    Due to the short-term nature of trade receivables, the carrying
    amount, less allowances, approximates fair value. Variations in
    the credit and discount assumptions would not significantly
    impact fair value.

At December 28, 2008, as detailed above, all contractual
    maturities of long-term debt occur subsequent to 2013.

At December 28, 2008, the fair values of the
    6.30% Notes, the 6.60% Notes and the
    2.75% Debentures were approximately $335,000, $100,300 and
    $334,200, respectively.

In 2008 and 2006 the Company repaid $135,092 of 6.15% notes
    due in July 2008 and $32,743 of 8.5% notes due in March
    2006, respectively.

In September 2007 the Company issued $350,000 of notes that are
    due in 2017 (the “Notes”). The Notes bear interest at
    a rate of 6.30%, which may be adjusted upward in the event that
    the Company’s credit rating from Moody’s Investor
    Services, Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings
    Services or Fitch Ratings is decreased two levels below the
    Company’s credit ratings on the date of issuance of the
    Notes. From the date of issuance through December 28, 2008,
    the Company’s ratings from Moody’s Investor Services,
    Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and
    Fitch Ratings were BBB, Baa2 and BBB, respectively. The interest
    rate adjustment is dependent on the degree of decrease of the
    Company’s ratings and could range from 0.25% to a maximum
    of 2%. The Company may redeem the Notes at its option at the
    greater of the principal amount of the Notes or the present
    value of the remaining scheduled payments discounted using the
    effective interest rate on applicable U.S. Treasury bills
    at the time of repurchase.

The Company currently has $249,828 outstanding in principal
    amount of contingent convertible debentures due 2021. These
    debentures bear interest at 2.75%, which could be subject to an
    upward adjustment depending on the price of the Company’s
    common stock. If the closing price of the Company’s common
    stock exceeds $23.76 for at least 20 trading days, within the 30
    consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of
    the calendar quarter, the holders have the right to convert the
    notes to shares of the Company’s common stock at the
    initial conversion price of $21.60 in the next calendar quarter.
    At December 28, 2008, this contingent conversion feature
    was met and the debentures are convertible through
    March 31, 2009, at which time the requirements of the
    contingent conversion feature will be reevaluated. In addition,
    if the closing price of the Company’s common stock exceeds
    $27.00 for at least 20 trading days in any thirty day period,
    the Company has the right to call the debentures by giving
    notice to the holders of the debentures. During a prescribed
    notice period, the holders of the debentures have the right to
    convert their debentures in accordance with the conversion terms
    described above. At certain times during the year, based on the
    Company’s common stock price, the Company had the right to
    call the debentures under this provision. As of
    December 28, 2008, the Company did not have the right to
    call the debentures. The holders of these

debentures may also put the notes back to Hasbro in December
    2011 and December 2016. At these times, the purchase price may
    be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the
    two, at the discretion of the Company.

Hasbro has a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets at
    December 28, 2008 of $11,755, which is a decrease of
    $24,499 from $36,254 at December 30, 2007. The valuation
    allowance pertains to United States and International loss
    carryforwards, some of which have no expiration and others that
    would expire beginning in 2009. The decrease in the valuation
    allowance is primarily attributable to the generation of
    sufficient capital gains in 2008 to utilize prior year capital
    losses.

Based on Hasbro’s history of taxable income and the
    anticipation of sufficient taxable income in years when the
    temporary differences are expected to become tax deductions, the
    Company believes that it will realize the benefit of the
    deferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation allowance.

Deferred income taxes of $53,285 and $53,040 at the end of 2008
    and 2007, respectively, are included as a component of prepaid
    expenses and other current assets, and $53,031 and $45,855,
    respectively, are included as a component of other assets. At
    the same dates, deferred income taxes of $4,245 and $81,
    respectively, are

included as a component of accrued liabilities, and $6,054 and
    $1,683, respectively, are included as a component of other
    liabilities.

On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FIN 48, which
    applies to all tax positions accounted for under Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting
    for Income Taxes”. FIN 48 prescribes a two step
    process for the measurement of uncertain tax positions that have
    been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return. The
    first step is a determination of whether the tax position should
    be recognized in the financial statements. The second step
    determines the measurement of the tax position. FIN 48 also
    provides guidance on derecognition of such tax positions,
    classification, potential interest and penalties, accounting in
    interim periods and disclosure. The adoption of FIN 48
    resulted in a $88,798 decrease in current liabilities, a $85,773
    increase in long-term liabilities, a $5,333 increase to the
    long-term deferred tax assets and a $8,358 increase to retained
    earnings.

A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding
    potential interest and penalties, for the fiscal years ended
    December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007 is as follows:

If the $79,456 is recognized, approximately $54,300 would
    decrease the effective tax rate in the period in which each of
    the benefits is recognized. The remaining amount would be offset
    by the reversal of related deferred tax assets.

During 2008 and 2007 the Company recognized $3,357 and $4,628,
    respectively, of potential interest and penalties, which are
    included as a component of income tax in the accompanying
    statement of operations. At December 28, 2008 and
    December 30, 2007, the Company had accrued potential
    interest and penalties of $13,660 and $12,020, respectively.

The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the
    United States and various state and international jurisdictions.
    In the normal course of business, the Company is regularly
    audited by U.S. federal, state and local and international
    tax authorities in various tax jurisdictions. The Company is no
    longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for
    years before 2004. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer
    subject to U.S. state or local and

non-U.S. income

tax examinations by tax authorities in its major jurisdictions
    for years before 2003.

The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has commenced an
    examination related to the 2004 and 2005 U.S. federal
    income tax returns. The Company is also under income tax
    examination in Mexico and in several other state and foreign
    jurisdictions. The ultimate resolution of the U.S. and
    Mexican examinations, including matters that may be resolved
    within the next twelve months, is not yet determinable. In
    connection with the Mexican tax examinations for the years 2000
    to 2003, the Company has received tax assessments, which include
    interest, penalties and inflation updates, related to transfer
    pricing which the Company is vigorously defending. In order to
    continue the process of defending its position, the Company was
    required to guarantee the amount of the assessments, as is usual
    and customary in Mexico with respect to these matters.
    Accordingly, as of December 28, 2008, bonds totaling
    $67,696 (at year-end 2008 exchange rates) have been provided to
    the



HASBRO,

Mexican government related to the 2000 to 2002 assessments,
    allowing the Company to defend its positions. The Company will
    be required to either post an additional bond or pay a deposit
    of $25,688 (at year-end 2008 exchange rates) related to the 2003
    assessment. The Company expects to be successful in sustaining
    its position with respect to these assessments as well as
    similar positions that may be taken by the Mexican tax
    authorities for periods subsequent to 2003.

Upon the settlements of other examinations in various tax
    jurisdictions and the expiration of several statutes of
    limitation, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible
    that the related unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest
    may decrease income tax expense by up to approximately $3,000 in
    the next 12 months.

The cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of Hasbro’s
    international subsidiaries held for reinvestment is
    approximately $718,000 at December 28, 2008. In the event
    that all international undistributed earnings were remitted to
    the United States, the amount of incremental taxes would be
    approximately $167,000.

Capital
    Stock

Preference
    Share Purchase Rights

Hasbro maintains a Preference Share Purchase Rights Plan (the
    “Rights Plan”). Under the terms of the Rights Plan,
    each share of common stock is accompanied by a Preference Share
    Purchase Right (“Right”). Each Right is only
    exercisable under certain circumstances and, until exercisable,
    the Rights are not transferable apart from Hasbro’s common
    stock. When exercisable, each Right will entitle its holder to
    purchase until June 30, 2009, in certain merger or other
    business combination or recapitalization transactions, at the
    Right’s then current exercise price, a number of the
    acquiring company’s or Hasbro’s, as the case may be,
    common shares having a market value at that time of twice the
    Right’s exercise price. Under certain circumstances, the
    Company may substitute cash, other assets, equity securities or
    debt securities for the common stock. At the option of the Board
    of Directors of Hasbro (“the Board”), the rightholder
    may, under certain circumstances, receive shares of
    Hasbro’s common stock in exchange for Rights.

Prior to the acquisition by a person or group of beneficial
    ownership of a certain percentage of Hasbro’s common stock,
    the Rights are redeemable for $0.01 per Right. The Rights Plan
    contains certain exceptions with respect to the Hassenfeld
    family and related entities.

Common
    Stock

In February 2008 the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the repurchase of up to $500,000 in common stock
    after three previous authorizations dated May 2005, July 2006
    and August 2007 with a cumulative authorized repurchase amount
    of $1,200,000 were fully utilized. Purchases of the
    Company’s common stock may be made from time to time,
    subject to market conditions, and may be made in the open market
    or through privately negotiated transactions. The Company has no
    obligation to repurchase shares under the authorization and the
    timing, actual number, and the value of the shares which are
    repurchased will depend on a number of factors, including the
    price of the Company’s common stock. This authorization
    replaced all prior authorizations. In 2008, the Company
    repurchased 11,736 shares at an average price of $30.44.
    The total cost of these repurchases, including transaction
    costs, was $357,589. At December 28, 2008, $252,364
    remained under this authorization.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

On December 31, 2007, the first day of fiscal 2008, the
    Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements”
    (“SFAS No. 157”), for financial assets and
    liabilities and No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for
    Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands
    of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share Data)

(“SFAS No. 159”). SFAS No. 157
    defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.

The SFAS No. 157 fair value hierarchy consists of
    three levels: Level 1 fair values are valuations based on
    quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or
    liabilities that the entity has the ability to access;
    Level 2 fair values are those valuations based on quoted
    prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in
    markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable
    or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the
    full term of the assets or liabilities; and Level 3 fair
    values are valuations based on inputs that are supported by
    little or no market activity and that are significant to the
    fair value of the assets or liabilities.

SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure
    many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value
    and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements
    designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose
    different measurement attributes for similar assets and
    liabilities. The Company did not elect the fair value option for
    any assets or liabilities in 2008. The adoption of
    SFAS No. 157 and SFAS No. 159 did not have
    an impact on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet or
    statement of operations. SFAS No. 157 is not required
    to be adopted for certain non-financial assets and liabilities
    until the first day of fiscal 2009. The Company’s assets
    for which SFAS No. 157 was not adopted include the
    Company’s goodwill and property rights, including the
    property rights recorded in connection with the Company’s
    acquisition of Cranium, Inc. and TRIVIAL PURSUIT (see
    note 4).

At December 28, 2008, the Company had the following assets
    measured at fair value in its consolidated balance sheet:

For a portion of the Company’s available-for-sale
    securities, the Company is able to obtain quoted prices from
    stock exchanges to measure the fair value of these securities.
    The remaining available-for-sale securities consist of warrants
    to purchase common stock. The Company uses the Black-Scholes
    model to value these warrants. One of the inputs used in the
    Black-Scholes model, historical volatility, is considered an
    unobservable input in that it reflects the Company’s own
    assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use
    in pricing the asset or liability. The Company believes that
    this is the best information available for use in the fair value
    measurement. The Company’s derivatives are measured using
    inputs that are observable indirectly through corroboration with
    readily available market data, in this case foreign exchange
    rates. The Company’s derivatives consist of foreign
    currency forward contracts. The Company uses current forward
    rates of the respective foreign currencies to measure the fair
    value of these contracts. There were no changes in these
    valuation techniques during 2008.

Stock
    Options, Other Stock Awards and Warrants

Hasbro has reserved 16,147 shares of its common stock for
    issuance upon exercise of options and the grant of other awards
    granted or to be granted under stock incentive plans for
    employees and for non-employee members of the Board of Directors
    (collectively, the “plans”). These options and other
    awards generally vest in equal annual amounts over three to five
    years. The plans provide that options be granted at exercise
    prices not less than fair market value on the date the option is
    granted and options are adjusted for such changes as stock
    splits and stock dividends. Generally, options are exercisable
    for periods of no more than ten years after date of grant.
    Certain of the plans permit the granting of awards in the form
    of stock, stock appreciation rights, stock awards and cash
    awards in addition to stock options. Upon exercise in the case
    of stock options, grant in the case of restricted stock or
    vesting in the case of performance based contingent stock
    grants, shares are issued out of available treasury shares.

The Company on occasion will issue restricted stock and grant
    restricted stock units to certain key employees. In 2008, 2007,
    and 2006 the Company issued restricted stock and restricted
    stock units of 60, 12 and 20 shares, respectively. These
    shares or units are nontransferable and subject to forfeiture
    for periods prescribed by the Company. These awards are valued
    at the market value at the date of grant and are subsequently
    amortized over the periods during which the restrictions lapse,
    generally 3 years. Compensation expense recognized relating
    to the outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock units
    was $661, $183, and $158 in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006,
    respectively. At December 28, 2008, the amount of total
    unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock is
    $1,840 and the weighted average period over which this will be
    expensed is 28 months.

In 2008, 2007, and 2006, as part of its annual equity grant to
    executive officers and certain other employees, the Compensation
    Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors approved the
    issuance of contingent stock performance awards (the “Stock
    Performance Awards”). These awards provide the recipients
    with the ability to earn shares of the Company’s common
    stock based on the Company’s achievement of stated
    cumulative diluted earnings per share and cumulative net revenue
    targets over the three fiscal years ended December 2010 for the
    2008 award, over the three fiscal years ended December 2009 for
    the 2007 award, and over a ten quarter period beginning
    July 3, 2006 and ending December 2008 for the 2006 award.
    Each Stock Performance Award has a target number of shares of
    common stock associated with such award which may be earned by
    the recipient if the Company achieves the stated diluted
    earnings per share and revenue targets. The ultimate amount of
    the award may vary, depending on actual results, from 0% to 125%
    of the target number of shares. The Compensation Committee of
    the Company’s Board of Directors has discretionary power to
    reduce the amount of the award regardless of whether the stated
    targets are met.

    increase in the ultimate amount of the award to be issued based
    on the Company’s actual results during the performance
    period. These shares are excluded from the calculation of the
    weighted average grant-date fair value of Stock Performance
    Awards granted during 2008.

During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recognized $17,422,
    $11,122 and $2,390, respectively, of expense relating to these
    awards. If minimum targets, as detailed under the award, are not
    met, no additional compensation cost will be recognized and any
    previously recognized compensation cost will be reversed. These
    awards were valued at the market value at the dates of grant and
    are being amortized over the three fiscal years ending December
    2010, over the three fiscal years ending December 2009 and over
    the 10 quarter period from July 3, 2006 through December
    2008 for the 2008, 2007 and 2006 awards, respectively. At
    December 28, 2008, the amount of total unrecognized
    compensation cost related to these awards is approximately
    $16,600 and the weighted average period over which this will be
    expensed is 19.56 months.

Total compensation expense related to stock options and the

With respect to the 11,651 outstanding options and 6,345 options

    remaining contractual life of these options was 4.79 years
    and 4.03 years, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value
    of the options outstanding and exercisable at December 28,
    2008 was $70,437 and $55,343, respectively.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model in
    determining fair value of stock options. The weighted average
    fair value of options granted in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 was
    $4.46, $7.39 and $4.26, respectively. The fair value of each
    option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted
    average assumptions used for grants in the fiscal years 2008,
    2007, and 2006:

The intrinsic values, which represent the difference between the
    fair market value on the date of exercise and the exercise price
    of the option, of the options exercised in fiscal 2008, 2007 and
    2006 were $83,747, $54,629 and $46,684, respectively.

At December 28, 2008, the amount of total unrecognized
    compensation cost related to stock options was $15,220 and the
    weighted average period over which this will be expensed is
    20.34 months.

In 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company granted 36, 31 and
    52 shares of common stock, respectively, to its
    non-employee members of its Board of Directors. Of these shares,
    the receipt of 30 shares from the 2008 grant,
    19 shares from the 2007 grant and 43 shares from the
    2006 grant have been deferred to the date upon which the
    respective director ceases to be a member of the Company’s
    Board of Directors. These awards were valued at the market value
    at the date of grant and vested upon grant. In connection with
    these grants, compensation cost of $1,260 was recorded in 2008,
    and $990 was recorded in both 2007 and 2006.

In 2007 certain warrants previously issued by the Company
    allowing for the purchase of 1,700 shares of the
    Company’s common stock, with a weighted average exercise
    price of approximately $16.99, were

exercised. The holder of the warrants elected to settle the
    warrants through a non-cash net share settlement, resulting in
    the issuance of 779 shares. If the holder had not elected
    net share settlement, the Company would have received cash
    proceeds from the exercise totaling $28,888 and would have been
    required to issue 1,700 shares.

In addition, during 2007 the Company exercised its call option
    to repurchase warrants which allowed for the purchase of an
    aggregate of 15,750 shares of the Company’s common
    stock. The Company had a warrant amendment agreement with
    Lucasfilm Ltd. and Lucas Licensing Ltd. (together
    “Lucas”) that provided the Company with a call option
    through October 13, 2016 to purchase the warrants from
    Lucas for a price to be paid at the Company’s election of
    either $200,000 in cash or the equivalent of $220,000 in shares
    of the Company’s common stock, such stock being valued at
    the time of the exercise of the option. Also, the warrant
    amendment agreement provided Lucas with a put option through
    January 2008 to sell all of these warrants to the Company for a
    price to be paid at the Company’s election of either
    $100,000 in cash or the equivalent of $110,000 in shares of the
    Company’s common stock, such stock being valued at the time
    of the exercise of the option. In May 2007 the Company exercised
    its call option to repurchase all of the outstanding warrants
    for the Company’s common stock held by Lucas and paid
    $200,000 in cash and repurchased the warrants.

Prior to exercising the call option, the Company adjusted these
    warrants to their fair value through earnings at the end of each
    reporting period. During 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded
    other expense of $44,370 and $31,770, respectively to adjust the
    warrants to their fair value. These amounts are included in
    other (income) expense, net in the consolidated statements of
    operations. There was no tax benefit or expense associated with
    these fair value adjustments.

Pension,
    Postretirement and Postemployment Benefits

Pension
    and Postretirement Benefits

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employer’s
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans”, (“SFAS No. 158”) which amends
    Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, 88,
    106 and 132R. Under SFAS No. 158, the Company is
    required to recognize on its balance sheet actuarial gains and
    losses and prior service costs that have not yet been included
    in income as an adjustment of equity through other comprehensive
    earnings with a corresponding adjustment to prepaid pension
    expense or the accrued pension liability. In addition, within
    two years of adoption, the measurement date for plan assets and
    liabilities would be required to be the Company’s fiscal
    year-end.

In accordance with SFAS No. 158, effective
    January 1, 2007, the Company elected to change the
    measurement date of certain of its defined benefit pension plans
    and the Company’s other postretirement plan from September
    30 to the Company’s fiscal year-end date, which was
    December 30, 2007. As a result of this election, the assets
    and liabilities of these plans were remeasured as of
    December 31, 2006. The remeasurement of the assets and
    liabilities resulted in an increase in the projected benefit
    obligation of $536 and an increase in the fair value of plan
    assets of $10,872. The impact of this accounting change was a
    reduction of retained earnings of $2,143, an increase to
    accumulated other comprehensive earnings of $7,779, a decrease
    in long-term accrued pension expense of $3,619, an increase in
    prepaid pension expense of $5,482, and a decrease in long-term
    deferred tax assets of $3,465.

Expense related to the Company’s defined benefit and
    defined contribution plans for 2008, 2007 and 2006 were
    approximately $33,400, $25,900, and $31,100, respectively. Of
    these amounts, $32,400, $13,400 and $15,400 related to defined
    contribution plans in the United States and certain
    international affiliates. The remainder of the expense relates
    to defined benefit plans discussed below.

United States Plans

Substantially all United States employees are covered under at
    least one of several non-contributory defined benefit pension
    plans maintained by the Company. Benefits under the two major
    plans which principally cover non-union employees, are based
    primarily on salary and years of service. One of these major
    plans is funded. Benefits under the remaining plans are based
    primarily on fixed amounts for specified years of service. Of
    these remaining plans, the plan covering union employees is also
    funded.

In 2007, for the two major plans covering its non-union
    employees, the Company froze benefits being accrued effective at
    the end of December 2007. In connection with this, the Company
    recognized a reduction of its projected benefit obligation as a
    result of this curtailment of $18,499 and recorded a curtailment
    loss of $908. The pension benefit was replaced by additional
    employer contributions to the Company’s defined
    contribution plan beginning in 2008.

At December 28, 2008, the measurement date, the projected
    benefit obligations of the funded plans were in excess of those
    plans’ fair value of plan assets in the amount of $25,142
    while the unfunded plans of the Company had an aggregate
    accumulated and projected benefit obligation of $43,450. At
    December 30, 2007, the fair value of the plan assets of the
    funded plans were in excess of those plans’ projected
    benefit obligations.

Hasbro also provides certain postretirement health care and life
    insurance benefits to eligible employees who retire and have
    either attained age 65 with 5 years of service or
    age 55 with 10 years of service. The cost of providing
    these benefits on behalf of employees who retired prior to 1993
    is and will continue to be substantially borne by the Company.
    The cost of providing benefits on behalf of substantially all
    employees who retire after 1992 is borne by the employee. The
    plan is not funded. As noted above, in 2007, the Company adopted
    the measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158.

In fiscal 2009, the Company expects amortization of unrecognized
    net losses and unrecognized prior service cost related to its
    defined benefit pension plans of $4,574 and $266, respectively,
    to be included as a component of net periodic benefit cost. In
    addition, the Company expects amortization of unrecognized net
    losses related to its postretirement plan of $12 to be included
    as a component of net periodic benefit cost.

Hasbro’s two major funded plans (the “Plans”) are
    defined benefit pension plans intended to provide retirement
    benefits to participants in accordance with the benefit
    structure established by Hasbro, Inc. The Plans’ investment
    managers, who exercise full investment discretion within
    guidelines outlined in the Plans’ Investment Policy, are
    charged with managing the assets with the care, skill, prudence
    and diligence that a prudent investment professional in similar
    circumstance would exercise. Investment practices, at a minimum,
    must comply with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
    (ERISA) and any other applicable laws and regulations.

The Plans’ asset allocations are structured to meet a
    long-term targeted total return consistent with the ongoing
    nature of the Plans’ liabilities. The shared long-term
    total return goal, presently 8.75%, includes income plus
    realized and unrealized gains

and/or

losses on the Plans’ assets. Utilizing generally accepted
    diversification techniques, the Plans’ assets, in aggregate
    and at the individual portfolio level, are invested so that the
    total portfolio risk exposure and risk-adjusted returns best
    meet the Plans’ long-term obligations to employees. During
    2007, the Company reevaluated its investment strategy and, as a
    result, decided to change the asset allocation in order to more
    closely align changes in the value of plan assets with changes
    in the value of plan liabilities. This change in asset
    allocation resulted in a transfer of assets into alternative
    investment strategies designed to achieve a modest absolute
    return in addition to the return on an underlying asset class
    such as bond or equity indices. These alternative investment
    strategies may use derivatives to gain market returns in an
    efficient and timely manner; however, derivatives are not used
    to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of the
    underlying assets. These alternative investment strategies are
    included in other equity and fixed income asset categories at
    December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007. Plan asset
    allocations are reviewed at least quarterly and rebalanced to
    achieve target allocation among the asset categories when
    necessary.

The Plans’ investment managers are provided specific
    guidelines under which they are to invest the assets assigned to
    them. In general, investment managers are expected to remain
    fully invested in their asset class with further limitations of
    risk as related to investments in a single security, portfolio
    turnover and credit quality.

With the exception of the alternative investment strategies
    mentioned above, the Plans’ Investment Policy restricts the
    use of derivatives associated with leverage or speculation. In
    addition, the Investment Policy also restricts investments in
    securities issued by Hasbro, Inc. except through index-related
    strategies (e.g. an S&P 500 Index Fund)

and/or

commingled funds. In addition, unless specifically approved by
    the Investment Committee (which is comprised of members of
    management, established by the Board to manage and control
    pension plan assets), certain securities, strategies, and
    investments are ineligible for inclusion within the Plans.

As noted above, in 2007, the Company adopted the measurement
    date provision of SFAS 158 and, accordingly, for 2008 and
    2007, the Plans’ assets and liabilities were measured at
    December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, respectively.
    For the fiscal year 2006, the Company measured its liabilities
    and related assets at September 30. The discount rates used
    in the pension calculation were also used for the postretirement
    calculation.

Hasbro works with external benefit investment specialists to
    assist in the development of the long-term rate of return
    assumptions used to model and determine the overall asset
    allocation. Forecast returns are based on the combination of
    historical returns, current market conditions and a forecast for
    the capital markets for the next 5-7 years. All asset class
    assumptions are within certain bands around the long-term
    historical averages. Correlations are based primarily on
    historical return patterns.

If the health care cost trend rate were increased one percentage

    obligation at December 28, 2008 and the aggregate of the
    benefits earned during the period and the interest cost would
    have increased by approximately 4% and 5%, respectively.

International
    Plans

Pension coverage for employees of Hasbro’s international
    subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate,
    through separate defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
    At December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, the
    defined benefit plans had total projected benefit obligations of
    $67,437 and $72,359, respectively, and fair values of plan
    assets of $40,515 and $55,881, respectively. Substantially all
    of the plan assets are invested in equity and fixed income
    securities. The pension expense related to these plans was
    $3,226, $3,937, and $3,702 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

In fiscal 2009, the Company expects amortization of $120 of
    prior service costs, $680 of unrecognized net losses and $28 of
    unrecognized transition obligation to be included as a component
    of net periodic benefit cost.

Expected benefit payments under the international defined
    benefit pension plans for the five years subsequent to 2008 and
    in the aggregate for the five years thereafter are as follows:
    2009: $1,259; 2010: $1,326; 2011: $1,390; 2012: $1,557; 2013:
    $1,684 and 2014 through 2018: $13,869.

Postemployment
    Benefits

Hasbro has several plans covering certain groups of employees,
    which may provide benefits to such employees following their
    period of active employment but prior to their retirement. These
    plans include certain severance plans which provide benefits to
    employees involuntarily terminated and certain plans which
    continue the Company’s health and life insurance
    contributions for employees who have left Hasbro’s employ
    under terms of its long-term disability plan.

Leases

Hasbro occupies certain offices and uses certain equipment under
    various operating lease arrangements. The rent expense under
    such arrangements, net of sublease income which is not material,
    for 2008, 2007, and 2006 amounted to $43,634, $36,897, and
    $34,603, respectively.

Minimum rentals, net of minimum sublease income, which is not
    material, under long-term operating leases for the five years
    subsequent to 2008 and in the aggregate thereafter are as
    follows: 2009: $30,921; 2010: $22,118; 2011: $16,559; 2012:
    $11,923; 2013: $9,527; and thereafter: $10,522

All leases expire prior to the end of 2018. Real estate taxes,
    insurance and maintenance expenses are generally obligations of
    the Company. It is expected that in the normal course of
    business, leases that expire will be renewed or replaced by
    leases on other properties; thus, it is anticipated that future
    minimum lease commitments will not be less than the amounts
    shown for 2008.

In addition, Hasbro leases certain facilities which, as a result
    of restructurings, are no longer in use. Future costs relating
    to such facilities were accrued as a component of the original
    charge and are not included in minimum rental amounts above.

(14)

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Hasbro uses foreign currency forwards to reduce the impact of
    currency rate fluctuations on firmly committed and projected
    future foreign currency transactions. These instruments hedge a
    portion of the Company’s anticipated inventory purchases
    and other cross-border transactions through 2011. At
    December 28, 2008, these contracts had net unrealized gains
    of $72,053, of which $32,203 are recorded in prepaid expenses
    and other current assets and $39,850 are recorded in other
    assets. The Company has a master agreement with each of its
    counterparties that allows for the netting of outstanding
    forward contracts.

During 2008, 2007, and 2006, the Company reclassified net
    losses, net of tax, from other comprehensive earnings to net
    earnings of $1,409, $6,887, and $1,448, respectively, which
    included gains (losses) of $1,292, $(37), and $(68),
    respectively, as the result of hedge ineffectiveness.

The remaining balance in AOCE at December 28, 2008 of
    $63,513 represents a net unrealized gain on foreign currency
    contracts relating to hedges of inventory purchased during the
    fourth quarter of 2008 or forecasted to be purchased during 2009
    through 2011 and intercompany expenses and royalty payments
    expected to be paid or received during 2009 through 2011. These
    amounts will be reclassified into the consolidated statement of
    operations upon the sale of the related inventory or receipt or
    payment of the related royalties and expenses. Of the amount
    included in AOCE at December 28, 2008, the Company expects
    approximately $26,100 to be reclassified to the consolidated
    statement of operations within the next 12 months.

The Company also enters into derivative instruments to offset
    changes in the fair value of intercompany loans due to the
    impact of foreign currency changes. The Company recorded a net
    loss on these instruments to other (income) expense, net of
    $42,382, $2,098, and $5,501 in 2008, 2007, and 2006,
    respectively, relating to the change in fair value of such
    derivatives, substantially offsetting gains from the change in
    fair value of intercompany loans to which the contracts relate
    included in other (income) expense, net.

(15)

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Hasbro had unused open letters of credit and related instruments
    of approximately $100,700 and $70,000 at December 28, 2008
    and December 30, 2007, respectively.



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

The Company enters into license agreements with inventors,
    designers and others for the use of intellectual properties in
    its products. Certain of these agreements contain provisions for
    the payment of guaranteed or minimum royalty amounts.
    Additionally, the Company has a long-term commitment related to
    promotional and marketing activities at a U.S. based theme
    park. Under terms of existing agreements as of December 28,
    2008, Hasbro may, provided the other party meets their
    contractual commitment, be required to pay amounts as follows:
    2009: $16,041; 2010: $5,605; and 2011: $36,172. Subsequent to
    December 28, 2008, the Company entered into an agreement
    with Marvel Characters B.V. (“Marvel”) that resulted
    in the extension of the current agreement from the end of 2011
    through the end of 2017. The extended agreement includes an
    additional $100,000 in minimum guaranteed royalties, with the
    potential for up to an additional $140,000 in guaranteed
    royalties contingent upon the release by Marvel of certain
    MARVEL character-based theatrical releases that meet certain
    defined criteria.

In addition to the above commitments, certain of the above
    contracts impose minimum marketing commitments on the Company.

At December 28, 2008, the Company had approximately
    $227,673 in outstanding purchase commitments.

Hasbro is party to certain legal proceedings, none of which,
    individually or in the aggregate, is deemed to be material to
    the financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

Segment
    Reporting

Segment
    and Geographic Information

Hasbro is a worldwide leader in children’s and family
    leisure time products and services, including toys, games and
    licensed products ranging from traditional to high-tech and
    digital. At the beginning of 2008, the Company reorganized the
    reporting structure of its operating segments and moved its
    Mexican operations, previously managed and reported in the North
    American segment, to the International segment. As a result, the
    North American segment has been renamed the U.S. and Canada
    segment. The management reorganization was the result of a
    realignment of the Company’s commercial markets and
    reflects its objective to leverage its Mexican operations in
    connection with its growth strategy in Latin and South America.
    In 2008 the Company’s segments include U.S. and
    Canada, International, Global Operations and Other. Segment data
    for 2007 and 2006 has been reclassified to reflect the 2008
    segment structure.

The U.S. and Canada segment includes the development,
    marketing and selling of boys’ action figures, vehicles and
    playsets, girls’ toys, electronic toys and games, plush
    products, preschool toys and infant products, electronic
    interactive products, toy-related specialty products,
    traditional board games and puzzles, DVD-based games and trading
    card and role-playing games within the United States and Canada.
    Within the International segment, the Company develops, markets
    and sells both toy and certain game products in markets outside
    of the U.S. and Canada, primarily the European, Asia
    Pacific, and Latin and South American regions. The Global
    Operations segment is responsible for manufacturing and sourcing
    finished product for the Company’s U.S. and Canada and
    International segments. The Company’s Other segment
    licenses out the rights to certain of its toy and game
    properties in connection with the sale of non-competing toys and
    games and non-toy products, as well as consumer promotions.

Segment performance is measured at the operating profit level.
    Included in Corporate and eliminations are certain corporate
    expenses, the elimination of intersegment transactions and
    certain assets benefiting more than one segment. Intersegment
    sales and transfers are reflected in management reports at
    amounts approximating cost. Certain shared costs, including
    global development and marketing expenses, are allocated to
    segments based upon foreign exchange rates fixed at the
    beginning of the year, with adjustments to actual foreign
    exchange rates included in Corporate and eliminations. The
    accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
    referenced in note 1.

(a)

The Global Operations segment derives substantially all of its
    revenues, and thus its operating results, from intersegment
    activities. Operating profit of the Global Operations segment
    for the fiscal year 2006 includes a charge of approximately
    $11,200, primarily related to severance costs, in connection
    with the reduction of manufacturing activity at the
    Company’s facility in Ireland.

(b)

Certain intangible assets, primarily goodwill, which benefit
    multiple operating segments are reflected as Corporate assets
    for segment reporting purposes. For application of
    SFAS 142, these amounts have been allocated to the
    reporting unit which benefits from their use. In addition,
    allocations of certain expenses related to these assets to the
    individual operating segments are done at the beginning of the
    year based on budgeted amounts. Any differences between actual
    and budgeted amounts are reflected in the Corporate segment.

Other
    Information

Hasbro markets its products primarily to customers in the retail
    sector. Although the Company closely monitors the
    creditworthiness of its customers, adjusting credit policies and
    limits as deemed appropriate, a substantial portion of its
    customers’ ability to discharge amounts owed is generally
    dependent upon the overall retail economic environment.

Sales to the Company’s three largest customers, Wal-Mart
    Stores, Inc., Target Corporation and Toys “R” Us,
    Inc., amounted to 25%, 12% and 10%, respectively, of
    consolidated net revenues during 2008, 24%, 12% and 11% during
    2007 and 24%, 13% and 11% during 2006. These net revenues were
    primarily related to the U.S. and Canada segment.

Hasbro purchases certain components used in its manufacturing
    process and certain finished products from manufacturers in the
    Far East. The Company’s reliance on external sources of
    manufacturing can be shifted, over a period of time, to
    alternative sources of supply for products it sells, should such
    changes be

necessary. However, if the Company were prevented from obtaining
    products from a substantial number of its current Far East
    suppliers due to political, labor or other factors beyond its
    control, the Company’s operations would be disrupted,
    potentially for a significant period of time, while alternative
    sources of product were secured. The imposition of trade
    sanctions by the United States or the European Union against a
    class of products imported by Hasbro from, or the loss of
    “normal trade relations” status by, the People’s
    Republic of China could significantly increase the cost of the
    Company’s products imported into the United States or
    Europe.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as
    defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
    “Exchange Act”), that are designed to ensure that
    information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
    reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
    Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is
    accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,
    including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure. The Company carried out an evaluation,
    under the supervision and with the participation of the
    Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures as of December 28, 2008.
    Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and
    procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls
    and procedures were effective.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting, as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

promulgated under the Exchange Act. Hasbro’s internal
    control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance
    regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
    preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles. Hasbro’s management assessed the effectiveness
    of its internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 28, 2008. In making its assessment, Hasbro’s
    management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in
    “Internal Control-Integrated Framework”. Based on this
    assessment, Hasbro’s management concluded that, as of
    December 28, 2008, its internal control over financial
    reporting is effective based on those criteria. Hasbro’s
    independent registered public accounting firm has issued an
    audit report on internal control over financial reporting, which
    is included herein.



Report
    of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Hasbro, Inc.:

We have audited Hasbro, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 28, 2008, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Hasbro, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 28, 2008, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Hasbro, Inc. and subsidiaries as
    of December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations,
    shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal
    years in the three-year period ended December 28, 2008, and
    our report dated February 24, 2009 expressed an unqualified
    opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
