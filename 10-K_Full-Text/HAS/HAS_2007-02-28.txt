Item 1.

Business

General
    Development and Description of Business and Business
    Segments

Except as expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise
    requires, as used herein, “Hasbro”, the
    “Company”, “we”, or “us”, means
    Hasbro, Inc., a Rhode Island corporation organized on
    January 8, 1926, and its subsidiaries. Unless otherwise
    specifically indicated, all dollar or share amounts herein are
    expressed in thousands of dollars or shares, except for per
    share amounts.

Overview

We are a worldwide leader in children’s and family leisure
    time and entertainment products and services, including the
    design, manufacture and marketing of games and toys. Both
    internationally and in the U.S., our widely recognized core
    brands such as PLAYSKOOL, TONKA, SUPER SOAKER, MILTON BRADLEY,
    PARKER BROTHERS, TIGER, and WIZARDS OF THE COAST provide what we
    believe are the highest quality play experiences in the world.
    Our offerings encompass a broad variety of games, including
    traditional board, card, hand-held electronic, trading card,
    roleplaying, plug and play and DVD games, as well as electronic
    learning aids and puzzles. Toy offerings include boys’
    action figures, vehicles and playsets, girls’ toys,
    electronic toys, plush products, preschool toys and infant
    products, children’s consumer electronics, electronic
    interactive products, creative play and toy related specialty
    products. In addition, we license certain of our trademarks,
    characters and other property rights to third parties for use in
    connection with consumer promotions and for the sale of
    noncompeting toys and games and non-toy products.

Organizationally, our principal segments are North America and
    International. Both of these segments engage in the development,
    marketing and selling of various toy and game products as listed
    above. Our North American segment covers the United States,
    Canada and Mexico while the International segment primarily
    includes Europe, the Asia Pacific region and Latin and South
    America. Financial information with respect to our segments and
    geographic areas is included in note 15 to our financial
    statements, which are included in Item 8 of this

Form 10-K.

In addition, the Hasbro Products Group outlicenses our
    intellectual property to third parties on a worldwide basis and
    the Global Operations segment is responsible for arranging
    product manufacturing and sourcing for the North American and
    International segments.

North
    America

The North American segment’s strategy in 2006 continued to
    be based on growing core brands through innovation and
    reinvention, introducing new initiatives driven by consumer and
    marketplace insights and leveraging opportunistic toy and game
    lines and licenses. In recent years, a major source of
    innovation has been the incorporation of greater technology into
    our products. The use of technology has increased our ability to
    develop products that appeal to older children who have been
    shifting from traditional toys and games to consumer electronic
    products, such as MP3 players, cell phones and other
    entertainment and lifestyle products. In addition, we seek to
    grow our business and maintain our brands by refreshing and
    reintroducing products from our vast portfolio which have been
    out of the market for extended periods of time. Recent
    successful reintroductions of products include BABY ALIVE in
    2006, LITTLEST PET SHOP in 2005 and MY LITTLE PONY in 2003.
    Major 2006 brands and products included STAR WARS, PLAYSKOOL,
    LITTLEST PET SHOP, NERF, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, PLAY-DOH,
    TRANSFORMERS and MONOPOLY. In the North American segment,
    our products are organized into the following categories:
    (i) games and puzzles; (ii) boys’ toys;
    (iii) girls’ toys; (iv) preschool toys;
    (v) tween toys; and (vi) other.

Our games and puzzles category includes several well known
    brands, including MILTON BRADLEY, PARKER BROTHERS, TIGER GAMES,
    AVALON HILL, and WIZARDS OF THE COAST. The MILTON BRADLEY,
    PARKER BROTHERS, TIGER GAMES and AVALON HILL brand portfolios
    consist of a broad assortment of games for children, tweens,
    families and adults. Core game brands include MONOPOLY,



BATTLESHIP, GAME OF LIFE, SCRABBLE, CHUTES AND LADDERS, CANDY
    LAND, TROUBLE, MOUSETRAP, OPERATION, HUNGRY HUNGRY HIPPOS,
    CONNECT FOUR, TWISTER, YAHTZEE, JENGA, SIMON, CLUE, SORRY!,
    RISK, BOGGLE, and TRIVIAL PURSUIT, as well as a line of jigsaw
    puzzles for children and adults, including BIG BEN and CROXLEY,
    as well as the PUZZ-3D line. WIZARDS OF THE COAST offers a
    variety of successful trading card and roleplaying games,
    including MAGIC: THE GATHERING and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS.
    We seek to keep our core brands relevant through sustained
    marketing programs as well as by offering consumers new ways to
    experience them. In 2006, the Company introduced MONOPOLY
    HERE & NOW, a modernized version of MONOPOLY that
    reflects contemporary culture and landmarks. In 2007 we plan to
    continue this reinvention of MONOPOLY through the introduction
    of several new related products including MONOPOLY TROPICAL
    TYCOON DVD game and the MONOPOLY HERE & NOW electronic
    banking game. Other core brand extensions expected for 2007
    include a new version of the GAME OF LIFE, TWISTS AND TURNS, as
    well as a new version of the OPERATION game, OPERATION RESCUE
    KIT. In addition to our core brands strategy, we seek to develop
    new game concepts, such as the 2006 introduction of COSMIC
    CATCH. In 2007, the Company plans to introduce a new line of
    brain training games, which will include hand held electronics,
    card games, plug and play games and pocket-sized games. In
    addition to more traditional game play, in the tween category,
    we plan to introduce NET JET, a digital internet game system.

Our boys’ toys include a wide range of core properties such
    as G.I. JOE and TRANSFORMERS action figures as well as
    entertainment-based licensed products based on popular movie and
    television characters, such as STAR WARS and MARVEL toys and
    accessories. The boys’ toys category is increasingly
    competing with video games as boys become more sophisticated in
    their evaluation of entertainment. In the action figure area, a
    key part of our strategy focuses on the importance of
    reinforcing the storyline associated with these products through
    the use of media-based entertainment. In 2007, the Company
    expects to have significant sales of MARVEL and TRANSFORMERS
    products due to the anticipated major motion picture releases of
    SPIDER-MAN 3 in May of 2007 and TRANSFORMERS in July of 2007.
    There are two other MARVEL motion picture releases scheduled in
    2007, GHOST RIDER and FANTASTIC FOUR: THE RISE OF THE SILVER
    SURFER for which the Company will be offering products in 2007.
    In addition to marketing and developing action figures for
    traditional play, the Company also develops and markets products
    designed for collectors, which was a key component of the
    success of the STAR WARS brand in 2006. In 2007, in addition to
    toys designed around the MARVEL and TRANSFORMERS motion picture
    releases, the Company will offer products such as the MARVEL
    ORIGINS product line, designed for the collector market.

In our girls’ toys category, we seek to provide a
    traditional and wholesome play experience. Girls’ toys
    include the MY LITTLE PONY, LITTLEST PET SHOP, FUR REAL FRIENDS
    and BABY ALIVE brands as well as the EASY BAKE oven. In 2007, we
    will seek to continue the growth of the MY LITTLE PONY and
    LITTLEST PET SHOP brands though innovative new lines, such as
    the PONYVILLE line and the TEENIEST TINIEST PET line. The FUR
    REAL FRIENDS line combines plush toys with electronic innovation
    to provide an interactive play experience.

Our preschool toys category encompasses a range of products for
    preschoolers in the various stages of development, from infant
    to kindergarteners. Our preschool products include a portfolio
    of core brands marketed primarily under the PLAYSKOOL trademark.
    The PLAYSKOOL line includes such well-known products as MR.
    POTATO HEAD, WEEBLES, SIT ’N SPIN and GLOWORM, along
    with a successful line of infant toys including STEP START
    WALK ’N RIDE, 2-IN-1 TUMMY TIME GYM and BUSY BALL
    POPPER. In addition, starting in 2007, the PLAYSKOOL line will
    also include the TONKA line of trucks and interactive toys and
    the PLAY-DOH brand. Through our AGES & STAGES system,
    we seek to provide consumer friendly information that assists
    parents in understanding the developmental milestones their
    children will encounter as well as the role each PLAYSKOOL
    product can play in helping children to achieve these
    developmental milestones. In 2007, the Company plans to
    introduce the MADE FOR ME toy and gear line that will allow
    parents to customize activities and features to suit a
    child’s developmental needs. Our preschool toys focus on
    encouraging children to get active through the PLAYSKOOL KID
    MOTION line of indoor and outdoor toys as well as seek to
    promote the use of the child’s imagination through products
    such as the PLAY-DOH line of playsets and products such as
    DREAMTOWN, a system of role play environments and



accessories. In 2007, we plan to continue to increase the
    visibility of our PLAYSKOOL brand through an agreement with the
    CVS/pharmacy retail chain whereby PLAYSKOOL will serve as the
    private label brand for CVS’ baby care products.

Our tweens toys category generally markets products under the
    TIGER ELECTRONICS and NERF brands and seeks to target those
    children who have outgrown traditional toys. The age group
    targeted by this category is generally 8 to 12 years old.
    In recent years, we have used our consumer insights and
    electronic innovation to develop a strong line of products
    focusing on this target audience. Our major tweens toys product
    lines in 2006 included I-DOG and NERF. As demonstrated through
    our I-DOG product, an interactive pet that acts as an accessory
    to an MP3 player, we seek to draw on the popularity of
    electronic trends in our tween product offerings. In 2007, we
    will seek to leverage the interest of this age group in music
    and musical instruments through the introduction of the POWER
    TOUR GUITAR product.

International

In addition to our business in the United States, Mexico and
    Canada, in 2006 we operated in more than 20 other countries,
    selling a representative range of the toy and game products
    marketed in North America, together with some items that are
    sold only internationally. The major geographic regions included
    in the International segment are Europe, Asia Pacific, South
    America and Latin America, excluding Mexico. In addition to
    growing core brands and leveraging opportunistic toy lines and
    licenses, we seek to grow our international business by
    continuing to expand into Eastern Europe and emerging markets in
    Asia and Latin and South America. Key international brands for
    2006 included MONOPOLY, MY LITTLE PONY, PLAYSKOOL, STAR WARS,
    and LITTLEST PET SHOP.

Other
    Segments

In our Global Operations segment, we manufacture and source
    production of substantially all of our toy and game products.
    The Company operates manufacturing facilities in East
    Longmeadow, Massachusetts and Waterford, Ireland. Sourcing of
    our other production is done through unrelated manufacturers in
    various Far East countries, principally China, using a Hong Kong
    based subsidiary for quality control and order coordination
    purposes. See “Manufacturing and Importing” below for
    more details concerning overseas manufacturing.

Through our other segment, the Hasbro Products Group, we
    generate revenue through the out-licensing worldwide of certain
    of our intellectual properties to third parties for promotional
    and merchandising uses in businesses which do not compete
    directly with our own product offerings.

Other
    Information

To further extend our range of products in the various segments
    of our business, we sell our toy and game products directly to
    retailers, primarily on a direct import basis from the Far East.
    These sales are reflected in the revenue of the related segment
    where the customer resides.

Certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale
    in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct
    business presence.

No individual line of products accounted for 10% or more of our
    consolidated net revenues during our 2006 or 2004 fiscal years.
    During the 2005 fiscal year, revenues generated from the sale of
    STAR WARS products produced under our license with Lucas
    Licensing and Lucasfilm were approximately $494,000, which was
    16% of our consolidated net revenues in 2005. No other line of
    products constituted 10% or more of our consolidated net
    revenues in 2005.

Working
    Capital Requirements

Our working capital needs are primarily financed through cash
    generated from operations and, when necessary, short-term
    borrowings and proceeds from our accounts receivable
    securitization program. Our borrowings and the use of our
    accounts receivable program generally reach peak levels during
    the fourth



quarter of each year. This corresponds to the time of year when
    our receivables also generally reach peak levels as part of the
    production and shipment of product in preparation for the
    holiday shipping season. The strategy of retailers has been to
    make a higher percentage of their purchases of toy and game
    products within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer
    buying season, which includes Christmas. We expect this trend
    will continue. Our historical revenue pattern is one in which
    the second half of the year is more significant to our overall
    business than the first half and, within the second half of the
    year, the fourth quarter is more prominent. In 2006, the second
    half of the year accounted for approximately 68% of full year
    revenues with the third and fourth quarters accounting for 33%
    and 35% of full year revenues, respectively. In years where the
    Company has products tied to a major motion picture release,
    such as in 2005 with the mid-year release of STAR WARS III:
    REVENGE OF THE SITH, this concentration is not as pronounced due
    to the higher level of sales that occur around the time of the
    motion picture theatrical release. In 2007 the Company has
    products tied to two anticipated major motion picture releases,
    SPIDER-MAN 3, expected to be released in May of 2007, and
    TRANSFORMERS, which is expected to be released in July of 2007.

The toy and game business is also characterized by customer
    order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of
    differences each year in the degree of consumer acceptance of
    product lines, product availability, marketing strategies and
    inventory policies of retailers, the dates of theatrical
    releases of major motion pictures for which we have product
    licenses, and changes in overall economic conditions. As a
    result, comparisons of our unshipped orders on any date with
    those at the same date in a prior year are not necessarily
    indicative of our sales for that year. Moreover, quick response
    inventory management practices now being used result in fewer
    orders being placed significantly in advance of shipment with
    more orders being placed for immediate delivery. Unshipped
    orders at January 28, 2007 and January 29, 2006 were
    approximately $192,000 and $123,000, respectively. It is a
    general industry practice that orders are subject to amendment
    or cancellation by customers prior to shipment. The backlog of
    unshipped orders at any date in a given year can also be
    affected by programs that we may employ to incent customers to
    place orders and accept shipments early in the year. This method
    is a general industry practice. The programs that we plan to
    employ to promote sales in 2007 are substantially the same as
    those we employed in 2006.

Historically, we commit to the majority of our inventory
    production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a
    given year prior to the peak third and fourth quarter retail
    selling season. Our accounts receivable increase during the
    third and fourth quarter as customers increase their purchases
    to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season. Due to
    the concentrated timeframe of this selling period, payments for
    these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in
    the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the
    subsequent year. The timing difference between expenses paid and
    revenues collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow
    varying amounts during the year. During 2006 and 2005, we
    utilized cash from our operations, proceeds from our accounts
    receivable securitization program, borrowing under our revolving
    credit agreement as well as our uncommitted lines of credit to
    meet our cash flow requirements.

Royalties,
    Research and Development

Our success is dependent on innovation through the continuing
    development of new products and the redesign of existing
    products for continued market acceptance. In 2006, 2005, and
    2004, we spent $171,358, $150,586, and $157,162, respectively,
    on activities relating to the development, design and
    engineering of new products and their packaging (including
    products brought to us by independent designers) and on the
    improvement or modification of ongoing products. Much of this
    work is performed by our internal staff of designers, artists,
    model makers and engineers.

In addition to the design and development work performed by our
    own staff, we deal with a number of independent toy and game
    designers for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy
    and game manufacturers. Rights to such designs and ideas, when
    acquired by us, are usually exclusive and the agreements require
    us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item.
    These designer royalty agreements, in some cases, also provide
    for advance royalties and minimum guarantees.



We also produce a number of toys under trademarks and copyrights
    utilizing the names or likenesses of characters from movies,
    television shows and other entertainment media, for whose rights
    we compete with other toy and game manufacturers. Licensing fees
    for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net
    sales of the item. Licenses for the use of characters are
    generally exclusive for specific products or product lines in
    specified territories. In many instances, advance royalties and
    minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements. In
    2006, 2005, and 2004, we incurred $169,731, $247,283, and
    $223,193, respectively, of royalty expense. A portion of this
    expense relates to amounts paid in prior years as royalty
    advances. Our royalty expenses in any given year vary depending
    upon the timing of movie releases and other entertainment. In
    2005, royalty expense increased due to the release of STAR WARS
    EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH, and the corresponding
    increase of our sales of STAR WARS licensed products. In 2007,
    the Company has licensed products tied to anticipated MARVEL
    major motion picture releases, including SPIDER-MAN 3 in May of
    2007 as well as FANTASTIC FOUR: THE RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER
    and GHOSTRIDER. We will also incur royalties on products based
    on the theatrical release of TRANSFORMERS in July of 2007. As
    such, we expect higher royalty expense in 2007 then was incurred
    in 2006.

We have $116,792 of prepaid royalties, which are a component of
    prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet.
    Included in other assets is $64,769 representing the long-term
    portion of royalty advances already paid. As further detailed in
    Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations, based on
    contracts in effect at December 31, 2006, the Company may
    be required to pay approximately $164,780 of minimum guaranteed
    royalties at various times from 2007 through 2011. Amounts paid
    and advances to be paid relate to anticipated revenues from
    licensed properties to be sold in the years 2007 through 2018.

Marketing
    and Sales

Our products are sold nationally and internationally to a broad
    spectrum of customers, including wholesalers, distributors,
    chain stores, discount stores, mail order houses, catalog
    stores, department stores and other traditional retailers, large
    and small, as well as internet-based

“e-tailers.”

Our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our
    products. Remaining sales are generated by independent
    distributors who sell our products, for the most part, in areas
    of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct
    presence. Although we had more than 2,500 customers in the
    United States and Canada during 2006, including specialty
    retailers carrying trading card games and toy-related products,
    there has been significant consolidation at the retail level
    over the last several years in our industry, which we expect to
    continue. As a result, the majority of our sales are to large
    chain stores, distributors and wholesalers. While the
    consolidation of customers provides us with certain benefits,
    such as potentially more efficient product distribution and
    other decreased costs of sales and distribution, this
    consolidation also creates additional risks to our business
    associated with a major customer having financial difficulties
    or reducing its business with us. In addition, customer
    concentration may decrease the prices we are able to obtain for
    some of our products and reduce the number of products we would
    otherwise be able to bring to market. During 2006, sales to our
    three largest customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Target
    Corporation and Toys ‘R Us, Inc., represented 24%, 13% and
    11%, respectively, of consolidated net revenues, and sales to
    our top five customers accounted for approximately 53% of our
    consolidated net revenues. During 2006, 90% of the net revenues
    from our top 5 customers related to the North American segment.

We advertise many of our toy and game products extensively on
    television. Generally our advertising highlights selected items
    in our various product groups in a manner designed to promote
    the sale of not only the selected item, but also other items we
    offer in those product groups as well. We introduce many of our
    new products to major customers during the year prior to the
    year of introduction of such products for retail sale. In
    addition, we showcase many of our new products at international
    toy fairs held early in the fiscal year in Hong Kong, London,
    Nuremberg, and New York City.

In 2006 we spent $368,996 on advertising, promotion and
    marketing programs compared to $366,371 in 2005 and $387,523 in
    2004.



Manufacturing
    and Importing

During 2006 substantially all of our products were manufactured
    in third party facilities in the Far East, primarily China, as
    well as in our two owned facilities located in East Longmeadow,
    Massachusetts and Waterford, Ireland.

Most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials
    such as plastic, paper and cardboard, although certain products
    also make use of electronic components. All of these materials
    are readily available but may be subject to significant
    fluctuations in price. We generally enter into agreements with
    suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish
    prices for that year. For this reason, we are generally
    insulated, in the short-term, from increases in the prices of
    raw materials. However, severe increases in the prices of any of
    these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers
    during the year. Our manufacturing processes and those of our
    vendors include injection molding, blow molding, spray painting,
    printing, box making and assembly. We purchase most of the
    components and accessories used in our toys and certain of the
    components used in our games, as well as some finished items,
    from manufacturers in the United States and in other countries.
    However, the countries of the Far East, and particularly the
    People’s Republic of China, constitute the largest
    manufacturing center of toys in the world and the substantial
    majority of our toy products are manufactured in China.

We believe that the manufacturing capacity of our third party
    manufacturers, together with our own facilities, as well as the
    supply of components, accessories and completed products which
    we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers, are adequate to
    meet the anticipated demand in 2007 for our products. Our
    reliance on designated external sources of manufacturing could
    be shifted, over a period of time, to alternative sources of
    supply for our products, should such changes be necessary or
    desirable. However, if we were to be prevented from obtaining
    products from a substantial number of our current Far East
    suppliers due to political, labor or other factors beyond our
    control, our operations and our ability to obtain products would
    be disrupted while alternative sources of product were secured.
    The imposition of trade sanctions by the United States or the
    European Union against a class of products imported by us from,
    or the loss of “normal trade relations” status by, the
    People’s Republic of China could significantly disrupt our
    operations and increase the cost of our products imported into
    the United States or Europe.

We purchase dies and molds, principally from independent United
    States and international sources.

Competition

We are a worldwide leader in the design, manufacture and
    marketing of games and toys, but our business is highly
    competitive. We compete with several large toy and game
    companies in our product categories, as well as many smaller
    United States and international toy and game designers,
    manufacturers and marketers. Competition is based primarily on
    meeting consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality
    and play value of our products. To a lesser extent, competition
    is also based on product pricing.

In addition to contending with competition from other toy and
    game companies, in our business we must deal with the phenomena
    that many children have been moving away from traditional toys
    and games at a younger age. We refer to this as “children
    getting older younger.” As a result, our products not only
    compete with the offerings of other toy and game manufacturers,
    but we must compete, particularly in meeting the demands of
    older children, with the entertainment offerings of many other
    companies, such as makers of video games and consumer electronic
    products.

The volatility in consumer preferences with respect to family
    entertainment and low barriers to entry continually create new
    opportunities for existing competitors and

start-ups

to
    develop products which compete with our toy and game offerings.

Employees

At December 31, 2006, we employed approximately 5,800
    persons worldwide, approximately 3,200 of whom were located in
    the United States.



Trademarks,
    Copyrights and Patents

We seek to protect our products, for the most part, and in as
    many countries as practical, through registered trademarks,
    copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is
    available, cost effective, and meaningful. The loss of such
    rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result
    in significant harm to our business, although the loss of such
    protection for a number of significant items might have such an
    effect.

Government
    Regulation

Our toy and game products sold in the United States are subject
    to the provisions of The Consumer Product Safety Act (the
    “CPSA”), The Federal Hazardous Substances Act (the
    “FHSA”), The Flammable Fabrics Act (the
    “FFA”), and the regulations promulgated thereunder. In
    addition, certain of our products, such as the mixes for our
    EASY BAKE ovens, are also subject to regulation by the Food and
    Drug Administration.

The CPSA empowers the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the
    “CPSC”) to take action against hazards presented by
    consumer products, including the formulation and implementation
    of regulations and uniform safety standards. The CPSC has the
    authority to seek to declare a product “a banned hazardous
    substance” under the CPSA and to ban it from commerce. The
    CPSC can file an action to seize and condemn an “imminently
    hazardous consumer product” under the CPSA and may also
    order equitable remedies such as recall, replacement, repair or
    refund for the product. The FHSA provides for the repurchase by
    the manufacturer of articles that are banned.

Consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and
    cities within the United States and in Canada, Australia and
    Europe. We maintain laboratories that employ testing and other
    procedures intended to maintain compliance with the CPSA, the
    FHSA, the FFA, international standards, and our own standards.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that
    our products are or will be hazard free. Any material product
    recall could have an adverse effect on our results of operations
    or financial condition, depending on the product and scope of
    the recall, and could negatively affect sales of our other
    products, as well.

The Children’s Television Act of 1990 and the rules
    promulgated thereunder by the United States Federal
    Communications Commission, as well as the laws of certain
    foreign countries, place limitations on television commercials
    during children’s programming.

We maintain programs to comply with various United States
    federal, state, local and international requirements relating to
    the environment, plant safety and other matters.

Forward-Looking
    Information and Risk Factors That May Affect Future
    Results

From time to time, including in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and in our annual report to shareholders, we publish
    “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the
    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These
    “forward-looking statements” may relate to such
    matters as our anticipated financial performance or business
    prospects in future periods, expected technological
    developments, the



expected timing of new product introductions or our expectations
    concerning the future acceptance of products by customers, the
    timing of entertainment releases, marketing and promotional
    efforts, research and development activities, liquidity, and
    similar matters. Forward-looking statements are inherently
    subject to risks and uncertainties. The Private Securities
    Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for
    forward-looking statements. These statements may be identified

Volatility
    of consumer preferences, combined with the high level of
    competition and low barriers to entry in the family
    entertainment industry make it difficult to maintain the success
    of existing product lines or consistently introduce successful
    new products. In addition, an inability to develop and introduce
    planned new products and product lines in a timely and
    cost-effective manner may damage our business.

The family entertainment business is a fashion industry. Our
    success is critically dependent upon the consumer appeal of our
    products, principally games and toys. Our failure to
    successfully anticipate, identify and react to children’s
    interests and the current preferences in family entertainment
    could significantly lower sales of our products and harm our
    profitability.

A decline in the popularity of our existing products and product
    lines, or the failure of our new products and product lines to
    achieve and sustain market acceptance with retailers and
    consumers, could significantly lower our sales and operating
    margins, which would in turn harm our profitability, business
    and financial condition. In our industry, it is important to
    identify and offer what are considered to be the “hot”
    toys and games on children’s “wish lists”. Our
    continued success will depend on our ability to develop, market
    and sell popular toys, games and children’s electronic
    products which are sought after by both children and their
    parents. We seek to achieve and maintain market popularity for
    our products through the redesign and extension of our existing
    family entertainment properties in ways we believe will capture
    evolving consumer interest and imagination and remain relevant
    in today’s world, and by developing, introducing and
    gaining customer interest for new family entertainment products.
    This process involves anticipating and extending successful play
    patterns and identifying entertainment concepts and properties
    that appeal to children’s imaginations. However, consumer
    preferences with respect to family entertainment are
    continuously changing and are difficult to anticipate. Evolving
    consumer tastes, coupled with an ever changing pipeline of
    entertainment properties and products which compete for consumer
    interest and acceptance, creates an environment in which
    products can be extremely popular during a certain period in
    time but then rapidly be replaced in consumer’s minds with
    other properties. As a result, individual family entertainment
    products and properties generally, and high technology products
    in particular, often have short consumer life cycles.

Not only must we address rapidly changing consumer tastes and
    interests but we face competitors who are also constantly
    monitoring consumer tastes, seeking ideas which will appeal to
    consumers and introducing new products that compete with our
    products for consumer purchasing. In addition to existing
    competitors, the barriers to entry for new participants in the
    family entertainment industry are low. New participants with a
    popular product idea or property can gain access to consumers
    and become a significant source of competition for our products.
    In some cases our competitors’ products may achieve greater
    market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce
    demand for our products.

The challenge of developing and offering products that are
    sought after by children is compounded by the trend of children
    “getting older younger”. By this we mean that children
    are losing interest in traditional toys at younger ages and, as
    a result, at younger and younger ages, our products compete with
    the offerings of



video game suppliers, consumer electronics companies and other
    businesses outside of the traditional toy and game industry.

In addition to designing and developing products based on our
    own brands, we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and
    interests by producing products based on popular entertainment
    properties developed by other parties and licensed to us. The
    success of entertainment properties released theatrically for
    which we have a license, such as MARVEL or STAR WARS related
    products, can significantly affect our revenues. If we produce a
    line of products based on a movie or television series, the
    success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the
    level of consumer interest in the associated products we are
    offering. In addition, competition in our industry for access to
    entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure,
    maintain, and renew popular licenses to entertainment products
    on beneficial terms, if at all, and to attract and retain the
    talented employees necessary to design, develop and market
    successful products based on these properties. The loss of
    ownership rights granted pursuant to any of our licensing
    agreements could harm our business and competitive position.

There is no guarantee that:

•

Any of our current products or product lines will continue to be
    popular;

•

Any property for which we have a significant license will
    achieve or sustain popularity;

•

Any new products or product lines we introduce will be
    considered interesting to consumers and achieve an adequate
    market acceptance;

•

Any new product’s life cycle will be sufficient to permit
    us to profitably recover development, manufacturing, marketing,
    royalties (including royalty advances and guarantees) and other
    costs of producing and selling the product; or

•

We will be able to manufacture, source and ship new or
    continuing products in a timely and cost-effective basis to meet
    constantly changing consumer demands, a risk that is heightened
    by our customers’ compressed shipping schedules and the
    seasonality of our business.

In developing new products and product lines, we have
    anticipated dates for the associated product introductions. When
    we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a
    particular product or product line at a certain time in the
    future those expectations are based on completing the associated
    development and implementation work in accordance with our
    currently anticipated development schedule. Unforeseen delays or
    difficulties in the development process, or significant
    increases in the planned cost of development, may cause the
    introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or,
    in some situations, may cause a product introduction to be
    discontinued. Similarly, the success of our products is often
    dependent on the timelines and effectiveness of related
    advertising and media efforts. Television programming, movie and
    DVD releases, comic book releases, and other media efforts are
    often critical in generating interest in our products. Not only
    our efforts, but the efforts of third parties, heavily impact
    the launch dates and success of these media efforts. When we say
    that products or brands will be supported by certain media
    releases, those statements are based on our current plans and
    expectations. Unforeseen factors may delay these media releases
    or even lead to their cancellation. Any delay or cancellation of
    planned product development work, introductions, or media
    support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our
    business.

Our
    business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results
    will depend, in large part, on our sales during the relatively
    brief holiday season. This seasonality is exacerbated as
    retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory
    levels through quick response inventory management
    techniques.

Sales of our family entertainment products at retail are
    extremely seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring
    during the period from September through December in
    anticipation of the holiday season, including Christmas. This
    seasonality has increased over time, as retailers become more
    efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick
    response inventory management techniques. These customers are
    timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers,
    such as us, closer to the time of purchase by consumers. For
    toys, games and other family entertainment products which we
    produce, a majority of retail sales occur in the



fourth quarter, close to the holiday season. As a consequence,
    the majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period
    from September through December, as our customers do not want to
    maintain large on-hand inventories throughout the year to meet
    consumer demand. While these techniques reduce a retailer’s
    investment in inventory, they increase pressure on suppliers
    like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant
    portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier.

The limited inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or
    delay retail sales, resulting in lower revenues for us. If we or
    our customers determine that one of our products is more popular
    at retail than was originally anticipated, we may not have
    sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional product to
    fully capture consumer interest in the product. Additionally,
    the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter
    time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve
    tight and compressed shipping schedules, which also may reduce
    our sales and harm our financial performance. This seasonal
    pattern requires significant use of working capital, mainly to
    manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year
    prior to the holiday season, and requires accurate forecasting
    of demand for products during the holiday season in order to
    avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing
    excess inventory of products that are less popular with
    consumers. Our failure to accurately predict and respond to
    consumer demand, resulting in our underproducing popular items

and/or

overproducing less popular items, would reduce our total sales
    and harm our results of operations. In addition, as a result of
    the seasonal nature of our business, we would be significantly
    and adversely affected, in a manner disproportionate to the
    impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the
    year, by unforeseen events, such as a terrorist attack or
    economic shock, that harm the retail environment or consumer
    buying patterns during our key selling season, or by events,
    such as strikes or port delays, that interfere with the shipment
    of goods, particularly from the Far East, during the critical
    months leading up to the holiday purchasing season.

The
    continuing consolidation of our retail customer base means that
    economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing policies of
    our major customers could have a significant impact on
    us.

We depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell
    the majority of our products. For the fiscal year ended
    December 31, 2006, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Target
    Corporation, and Toys ‘R Us, Inc., accounted for
    approximately 24%, 13% and 11%, respectively, of our
    consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers,
    including Wal-Mart, Target and Toys ‘R Us, in the aggregate
    accounted for approximately 53% of our consolidated net
    revenues. These net revenues were primarily related to the North
    American segment. While the consolidation of our customer base
    may provide certain benefits to us, such as potentially more
    efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of
    sales and distribution, this consolidation also means that if
    one or more of our major customers were to experience
    difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us, cease doing
    business with us, significantly reduce the amount of their
    purchases from us or return substantial amounts of our products,
    it could harm our business, financial condition and results of
    operations. Increased concentration among our customers could
    also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales
    prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins
    than would otherwise be obtained if there were less
    consolidation among our customers. In addition, the bankruptcy
    or other lack of success of one or more of our significant
    retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and bad
    debt expense.

We may
    not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed
    material has less market appeal than expected or if sales
    revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out
    the minimum guaranteed royalties.

An important part of our business involves obtaining licenses to
    produce products based on various entertainment properties and
    theatrical releases, such as those based upon MARVEL or STAR
    WARS characters. The license agreements we enter to obtain these
    rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that
    may be substantial, and in some cases may be greater than what
    we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales, which could
    result in write-offs of significant amounts which in turn would
    harm our results of operations. At December 31, 2006, we
    had $181,561 of prepaid royalties, $116,792 of which are
    included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and
    $64,769 of which are included in other assets. Under the terms
    of existing contracts as of December 31, 2006, we may be
    required to pay future minimum



guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees totaling
    approximately $164,780. Acquiring or renewing licenses may
    require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we
    consider to be too high to be profitable, which may result in
    losing licenses we currently hold when they become available for
    renewal, or missing business opportunities for new licenses.
    Additionally, as a licensee of entertainment based properties we
    have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will
    translate into successful toy or game products.

We anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie
    releases will make it increasingly difficult for us to
    profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment
    properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for
    these products in order to minimize their inventory risk.
    Furthermore, there can be no assurance that a successful brand
    will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales
    in the future, as new entertainment properties and competitive
    products are continually being introduced to the market. In the
    event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful
    entertainment licenses on advantageous terms, our revenues and
    profits may be harmed.

Our
    substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the
    United States subject us to risks associated with international
    operations.

We operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries
    outside the United States. For the year ended December 31,
    2006, our net revenues from international customers comprised
    approximately 40% of our total consolidated net revenues. We
    expect our sales to international customers to continue to
    account for a significant portion of our revenues. Additionally,
    we utilize third-party manufacturers located principally in the
    Far East, to produce the majority of our products, and we have a
    manufacturing facility in Ireland. These sales and manufacturing
    operations are subject to the risks associated with
    international operations, including:

•

Currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations;

•

Limitations, including taxes, on the repatriation of earnings;

•

Political instability, civil unrest and economic instability;

•

Greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and
    weaker laws protecting such rights;

•

Complications in complying with different laws in varying
    jurisdictions, which laws may dictate that certain practices
    which are acceptable in some jurisdictions are not acceptable in
    others, and changes in governmental policies;

•

Natural disasters and the greater difficulty and expense in
    recovering therefrom;

•

Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country
    to another, including port congestion, strikes and other
    transportation delays and interruptions;

•

Changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing
    business internationally; and

•

The imposition of tariffs.

Our reliance on external sources of manufacturing can be
    shifted, over a period of time, to alternative sources of
    supply, should such changes be necessary. However, if we were
    prevented from obtaining products or components for a material
    portion of our product line due to political, labor or other
    factors beyond our control, our operations would be disrupted,
    potentially for a significant period of time, while alternative
    sources of products were secured. In particular, as the majority
    of our toy products, in addition to certain other products, are
    manufactured in the People’s Republic of China, health
    conditions and other factors affecting social and economic
    activity in China and affecting the movement of people and
    products into and from China to our major markets, including
    North America and Europe, and the labor and other costs of doing
    business in China, could have a significant negative impact on
    our operations, revenues and earnings. Factors that could
    negatively affect our business include a potential revaluation
    of the Chinese yuan, which may result in an increase in the cost
    of producing products in China, increases in labor costs and
    difficulties in moving products manufactured in the Far East
    through the ports on the western coast of North America, whether
    due to port congestion, labor disputes or other factors. Also,
    the imposition of trade sanctions by the United States or the
    European Union against a class of products imported by us from,
    or the loss of “normal trade relations” status



with, the People’s Republic of China, could significantly
    increase our cost of products imported into the United States or
    Europe and harm our business. Because of the importance of our
    international sales and international sourcing of manufacturing
    to our business, our financial condition and results of
    operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks
    described above were to occur.

Part
    of our strategy for remaining relevant to older children is to
    offer innovative children’s toy and game electronic
    products. The margins on many of these products are lower than
    more traditional toys and games and such products may have a
    shorter lifespan than more traditional toys and games. As a
    result, increasing sales of children’s toy and game
    electronic products may lower our overall operating margins and
    produce more volatility in our business.

As children have grown “older younger” and have become
    interested in more and more sophisticated and adult products,
    such as videogames and consumer electronics, at younger and
    younger ages, we have needed to work even harder to keep our
    products relevant for these consumers. One initiative we have
    been pursuing to capture the interest of older children is to
    offer innovative children’s electronic toys and games.
    Examples of such products in the last few years include
    VIDEONOW, CHATNOW, ZOOMBOX, our I-branded products such as I-DOG
    and I-CAT, and our FURREAL FRIENDS line of products, including
    BUTTERSCOTCH. These products, if successful, can be an effective
    way for us to connect with consumers and increase sales.
    However, children’s electronics, in addition to the risks
    associated with our other family entertainment products, also
    face certain additional risks.

Our costs for designing, developing and producing electronic
    products tend to be higher than for many of our other more
    traditional products, such as board games and action figures.
    The ability to recoup these higher costs through sufficient
    sales quantities and to reflect higher costs in higher prices is
    constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics. As a
    consequence, our margins on the sales of electronic products
    tend to be lower than for more traditional products and we can
    face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover
    our costs. In addition, the pace of change in product offerings
    and consumer tastes in the electronics area is potentially even
    greater than for our other products. This pace of change means
    that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain
    consumer interest may be even shorter.

Market
    conditions, including commodity and fuel prices, public health
    conditions and other third party conduct could negatively impact
    our revenues, margins and our other business
    initiatives.

Economic and public health conditions, including factors that
    impact the strength of the retail market and retail demand, or
    our ability to manufacture and deliver products, can have a
    significant impact on our business. The success of our family
    entertainment products is dependent on consumer purchasing of
    those products. Consumers may not purchase our products because
    the products do not capture consumer interest and imagination or
    because competitor family entertainment offerings are deemed
    more attractive. But consumer spending on our products can also
    be harmed by factors that negatively impact consumers’
    budgets generally, and which are not due to our product
    offerings. Significant increases in the costs of other products
    which are required by consumers, such as gasoline and home
    heating fuels, may reduce household spending on entertainment
    products we offer. In addition, rising fuel and raw material
    prices, for components such as resin used in plastics, or
    increased transportation costs, may increase our costs for
    producing and transporting our products, which in turn may
    reduce our margins and harm our business.

In addition, general economic conditions and employment levels
    can impact demand for our products. Economic conditions were
    significantly harmed by the September 11, 2001 terrorist
    attacks and could be similarly affected by any future attacks.
    Economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by wars and
    other conflicts, increases in critical commodity prices, or the
    prospect of such events. Such a weakened economic and business
    climate, as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a
    climate, could harm our sales and profitability.

Other conditions, such as the unavailability of electrical
    components, may impede our ability to manufacture, source and
    ship new and continuing products on a timely basis. Additional
    factors outside of our control could delay or increase the cost
    of implementing our business initiatives and product plans or
    alter our



actions and reduce actual results. For example, work stoppages,
    slowdowns or strikes, a severe public health pandemic or the
    occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts, could impact
    our ability to manufacture or deliver product, resulting in
    increased costs

and/or

lost
    sales for our products.

Our
    business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may
    not be able to protect such rights successfully. In addition, we
    have a material amount of acquired product rights which, if
    impaired, would result in a reduction of our
    income.

Our intellectual property, including our license agreements and
    other agreements that establish our ownership rights and
    maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property, are
    of great value. We rely on a combination of trade secret,
    copyright, trademark, patent and other proprietary rights laws
    to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related
    to our brands. From time to time, third parties have challenged,
    and may in the future try to challenge, our ownership of our
    intellectual property. In addition, our business is subject to
    the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or
    infringing on our intellectual property rights. We may need to
    resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property
    rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of
    resources. Our failure to protect our intellectual property
    rights could harm our business and competitive position. Much of
    our intellectual property has been internally developed and has
    no carrying value on our balance sheet. However, as of
    December 31, 2006, we had approximately $532,257 of
    acquired product and licensing rights included in other assets
    on our balance sheet. Declines in the profitability of the
    acquired brands or licensed products may impact our ability to
    recover the carrying value of the related assets and could
    result in an impairment charge. Reduction in our net income
    caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results.

We may
    not realize the anticipated benefits of future acquisitions or
    those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their
    realization.

Although we have not made any major acquisitions in the last few
    years, acquisitions have been a significant part of our
    historical growth and have enabled us to further broaden and
    diversify our product offerings. In making acquisitions, we
    target companies that we believe offer attractive family
    entertainment products. We may also target companies in markets
    where we would like to increase our local presence. However, we
    cannot be certain that the products of companies we may acquire
    in the future will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers
    or that we will be successful in a particular geographic region.
    In some cases, we expect that the integration of the product
    lines of the companies that we acquire into our operations will
    create production, marketing and other operating synergies which
    will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and, where
    applicable, cost savings, operating efficiencies and other
    advantages. However, we cannot be certain that these synergies,
    efficiencies and cost savings will be realized. Even if
    achieved, these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their
    realization. In other cases, we acquire companies that we
    believe have strong and creative management, in which case we
    plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully
    integrating them into our operations. We cannot be certain that
    the key talented individuals at these companies will continue to
    work for us after the acquisition or that they will continue to
    develop popular and profitable products or services.

From
    time to time, we are involved in litigation, arbitration or
    regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which
    could entail significant expense.

As is the case with many large multinational corporations, we
    are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations,
    litigation and arbitration disputes. Because the outcome of
    litigation, arbitration and regulatory investigations is
    inherently difficult to predict, it is possible that the outcome
    of any of these matters could entail significant expense for us
    and harm our business. The fact that we operate in significant
    numbers of international markets also increases the risk that we
    may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply
    with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements.



We
    rely on external financing, including our credit facilities and
    accounts receivable securitization facility, to fund our
    operations. If we were unable to obtain or service such
    financing, or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were
    too burdensome, our business would be harmed.

Due to the seasonal nature of our business, in order to meet our
    working capital needs, particularly those in the third and
    fourth quarters, we rely on our revolving credit facility and
    our other credit facilities for working capital. We currently
    have a five-year revolving credit agreement, which provides for
    a $300,000 committed revolving credit facility which provides
    the Company the ability to request increases in the committed
    facility in additional increments of $50,000, up to a total of
    $500,000. The credit agreement contains certain restrictive
    covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and
    certain other limitations typical of an investment grade
    facility. These restrictive covenants may limit our future
    actions, and financial, operating and strategic flexibility. In
    addition, our financial covenants were set at the time we
    entered into our credit facility. Our performance and financial
    condition may not meet our original expectations, causing us to
    fail to meet such financial covenants. Non-compliance with our
    debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize
    borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank
    lines, a circumstance which potentially could occur when
    operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings
    to enable us to continue to fund our operations.

As an additional source of working capital and liquidity, we
    currently have a $250,000 accounts receivable securitization
    program, which is increased to $300,000 from fiscal October
    through fiscal January. Under this program, we sell on an
    ongoing basis, substantially all of our U.S. dollar
    denominated trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote
    special purpose entity. Under this facility, the special purpose
    entity is able to sell, on a revolving basis, undivided
    ownership interests in the eligible receivables to bank
    conduits. During the term of the facility, we must maintain
    certain performance ratios. If we fail to maintain these ratios,
    we could be prevented from accessing this cost-effective source
    of working capital and short-term financing.

We believe that our cash flow from operations, together with our
    cash on hand and access to existing credit facilities and our
    accounts receivable securitization facility, are adequate for
    current and planned needs in 2007. However, our actual
    experience may differ from these expectations. Factors that may
    lead to a difference include, but are not limited to, the
    matters discussed herein, as well as future events that might
    have the effect of reducing our available cash balance, such as
    unexpected material operating losses or increased capital or
    other expenditures, as well as increases in inventory or
    accounts receivable that are ineligible for sale under our
    securitization facility, or future events that may reduce or
    eliminate the availability of external financial resources.

We also may choose to finance our capital needs, from time to
    time, through the issuance of debt securities. Our ability to
    issue such securities on satisfactory terms, if at all, will
    depend on the state of our business and financial condition, any
    ratings issued by major credit rating agencies, market interest
    rates, and the overall condition of the financial and credit
    markets at the time of the offering. The condition of the credit
    markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the
    past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Variations in
    these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt
    securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order
    to sell new debt securities. The failure to receive financing on
    desirable terms, or at all, could damage our ability to support
    our future operations or capital needs or engage in other
    business activities.

As of December 31, 2006, we had $494,983 of total principal
    amount of indebtedness outstanding. If we are unable to generate
    sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt
    we would need to refinance such debt or face default. There is
    no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on
    favorable terms, or at all. This total indebtedness includes
    $249,996 in aggregate principal amount of 2.75% senior
    convertible debentures that we issued in 2001. On
    December 1, 2011 and December 1, 2016, and upon the
    occurrence of certain fundamental corporate changes, holders of
    the 2.75% senior convertible debentures may require us to
    purchase their debentures. At that time, the purchase price may
    be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the
    two, at our discretion, provided that we will pay accrued and
    unpaid



interest in cash. We may not have sufficient cash at that time
    to make the required repurchases and may be required to settle
    in shares of common stock.

We previously issued warrants that provide the holder with an
    option through January 2008 to sell all of these warrants to us
    for a price to be paid, at our election, of either $100,000 in
    cash or $110,000 in our common stock, such stock being valued at
    the time of the exercise of the option. Should we be required to
    settle these warrants under this option, we believe that we will
    have adequate funds to settle in cash if necessary. However, we
    may not have sufficient funds at that time to make the required
    payment and may be required to settle the warrants in stock.

As a
    manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational
    corporation, we are subject to various government regulations,
    violation of which could subject us to sanctions. In addition,
    we could be the subject of future product liability suits or
    product recalls, which could harm our business.

As a manufacturer of consumer products, we are subject to
    significant government regulations under The Consumer Products
    Safety Act, The Federal Hazardous Substances Act, and The
    Flammable Fabrics Act. In addition, certain of our products are
    subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration. While
    we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with
    these acts, there can be no assurance that we will be in
    compliance in the future. Failure to comply could result in
    sanctions which could have a negative impact on our business,
    financial condition and results of operations. We may also be
    subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily
    conduct a product recall. While costs associated with product
    recalls have generally not been material to our business, the
    costs associated with future product recalls individually and in
    the aggregate in any given fiscal year, could be significant. In
    addition, any product recall, regardless of direct costs of the
    recall, may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a
    negative impact on our future sales and results of operations.

In addition to government regulation, products that have been or
    may be developed by us may expose us to potential liability from
    personal injury or property damage claims by the users of such
    products. There can be no assurance that a claim will not be
    brought against us in the future. While we currently maintain
    product liability insurance coverage in amounts we believe
    sufficient for our business risks, we may not be able to
    maintain such coverage or such coverage may not be adequate to
    cover all potential claims. Moreover, even if we maintain
    sufficient insurance coverage, any successful claim could
    significantly harm our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

As a large, multinational corporation, we are subject to a host
    of governmental regulations throughout the world, including
    antitrust, customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott
    regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Our failure
    to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could
    subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that
    could harm our business and financial condition.

We
    have a material amount of goodwill which, if it becomes
    impaired, would result in a reduction in our net
    income.

Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition
    accounted for using the purchase method exceeds the fair value
    of the net assets we acquire. Current accounting standards
    require that goodwill no longer be amortized but instead be
    periodically evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of
    the reporting unit. At December 31, 2006, approximately
    $469,938 or 15.2%, of our total assets represented goodwill.
    Declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our
    reporting units, which could result in a write-down of our
    goodwill. Reductions in our net income caused by the write-down
    of goodwill could harm our results of operations.

Executive
    Summary

The Company earns revenue and generates cash through the sale of
    a variety of toy and game products. The Company sells these
    products both within the United States and in a number of
    international markets. The Company’s business is highly
    seasonal with a significant amount of revenues occurring in the
    second half of the year and within that half, the fourth
    quarter. In 2006, 68% of the Company’s net revenues were
    generated in the second half of the year with 35% of annual net
    revenues generated in the fourth quarter. In both 2005 and 2004,
    percentages were comparable at 67% and 35% for the second half
    and fourth quarter. While many of the Company’s products
    are based on brands the Company owns or controls, the Company
    also offers products which are licensed from outside inventors.
    In addition, the Company licenses rights to produce products
    based on movie, television, music and other entertainment
    properties, such as MARVEL and STAR WARS properties.

In January 2006 the Company simplified its operating segment
    structure in order to better focus on consumer demands, better
    anticipate the needs of its retail customers, provide a more
    integrated toy and game marketing plan, place a greater
    company-wide focus on its core brands and thereby improve its
    overall business. The Company’s North American toy and
    games business is managed under common leadership, providing a
    combined focus on developing, marketing, and selling products in
    the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The International segment consists
    of the Company’s European, Asia Pacific and Latin American
    marketing operations, excluding Mexico. The Company’s
    world-wide manufacturing and product sourcing operations are
    managed through its Global Operations segment. The Hasbro
    Products Group continues to be responsible for the world-wide
    outlicensing of the Company’s intellectual properties and
    works closely with the North American and International segments
    on the coordinated out-licensing activities of the
    Company’s brands.

The Company’s focus remains on growing core owned and
    controlled brands, developing new and innovative products which
    respond to market insights, and optimizing efficiencies within
    the Company to reduce costs, increase operating profits and
    strengthen its balance sheet. While the Company has sought to
    achieve a more sustainable revenue base by developing and
    maintaining its core brands and avoiding reliance on licensed
    entertainment properties, it continues to opportunistically
    enter into or leverage existing strategic licenses which
    complement its brands and key strengths. Given the strength of
    its core brands, the Company may also seek to drive
    product-related revenues by increasing the visibility of its
    core brands through entertainment-based theatrical venues. As an
    example of this, in July of 2007, the TRANSFORMERS motion
    picture is expected to be released and the Company has developed
    products based on the motion picture that will be marketed in
    2007.

The Company’s core brands represent Company-owned or
    Company-controlled brands, such as G.I. JOE, TRANSFORMERS,
    MY LITTLE PONY, MONOPOLY, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, PLAYSKOOL and
    TONKA, which have been successful over the long term. The
    Company has a large portfolio of owned and controlled brands,
    which can be introduced in new formats and platforms over time.
    These brands may also be further extended by pairing a licensed
    concept with a core brand. By focusing on core brands, the
    Company is working to build a more consistent revenue stream and
    basis for future growth. In 2006, the Company had strong sales
    of core brand products, namely PLAYSKOOL, LITTLEST PET SHOP,
    MONOPOLY, NERF, and PLAY-DOH.



In addition to its focus on core brands, the Company’s
    strategy also involves trying to meet ever-changing consumer
    preferences by identifying and offering innovative products
    based on market opportunities and insights. The Company believes
    its strategy of focusing on the development of its core brands
    and continuing to identify innovative new products will help to
    prevent the Company from being dependent on the success of any
    one product line.

With the theatrical release of Lucasfilm’s STAR WARS
    EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH in May 2005, and the
    subsequent holiday season DVD release, sales of product related
    to the Company’s strategic STAR WARS license were a
    significant contributor to 2005 revenues and have continued to
    be strong in 2006. Pairing this key licensed property with the
    Company’s ability to design and produce action figures,
    role playing toys, and games, as well as its ability to launch
    an integrated marketing campaign to promote the product
    globally, was the key to this line’s success. While sales
    of product related to this license performed well in 2006, they
    were lower than 2005.

While the Company’s strategy has continued to focus on
    growing its core brands and developing innovative, new products,
    it will continue to evaluate and enter into arrangements to
    license properties when the Company believes it is economically
    attractive. In 2006, the Company entered into a license with
    Marvel Entertainment, Inc. and Marvel Characters, Inc.
    (collectively “Marvel”) to produce toys and games
    based on Marvel’s portfolio of characters. The Company will
    also incur royalties on products based on the theatrical release
    of TRANSFORMERS in July 2007. While gross profits of theatrical
    entertainment-based products are generally higher than many of
    the Company’s other products, sales from these products
    also incur royalty expenses payable to the licensor. Such
    royalties reduce the impact of these higher gross margins. In
    certain instances, such as with Lucasfilm’s STAR WARS, the
    Company may also incur amortization expense on property
    right-based assets acquired from the licensor of such
    properties, further impacting profit made on these products.

The Company remains committed to reducing fixed costs and
    increasing operating margins. Over the last 5 years the
    Company has improved its operating margin from 7.8% in 2002 to
    11.9% in 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2006, as part of its
    ongoing cost reduction efforts, the Company determined that it
    will reduce its manufacturing activity in Ireland and transition
    the manufacture of certain products to the Company’s
    suppliers in China. The Company is also investing to grow its
    business in emerging international markets. With a strong
    balance sheet, and having achieved a debt to capitalization
    ratio of between

25-30%,

the
    Company will also continue to evaluate strategic alliances and
    acquisitions which may complement its current product offerings
    or allow it entry into an area which is adjacent to and
    complementary to the toy and game business. The Company expects
    to leverage revenue to offset the impact of these investments
    and maintain 2007 operating margin levels near 2006.

In recent years, the Company has been seeking to return excess
    cash to its shareholders through share repurchase and dividends.
    As part of this initiative, in July 2006, the Company’s
    Board of Directors (the “Board’’) authorized the
    repurchase of an additional $350,000 in common stock after a
    previous authorization of $350,000 was exhausted in July 2006.
    For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, the Company
    has invested $456,744 in the repurchase of 22,767 shares of
    common stock in the open market. The Company intends to
    opportunistically repurchase shares in the future subject to
    market conditions. In addition, in February 2007, the Company
    announced an increase in its quarterly dividend to $.16 per
    share. This is the fourth consecutive year that the Board of
    Directors has increased the dividend rate.

Results
    of Operations

The fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 was a fifty-three
    week year while the fiscal years ended December 25, 2005
    and December 26, 2004 were fifty-two week years.

Net earnings for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006
    were $230,055, or $1.29 per diluted share. This compares to
    net earnings for fiscal 2005 and 2004 of $212,075 and $195,977,
    or $1.09 and $.96 per diluted share, respectively.

On December 26, 2005, the first day of fiscal 2006, the
    Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment”
    (“SFAS 123R”), which required that the Company
    measure all stock-based compensation awards using a fair value
    method and record such expense in its financial statements. The
    Company adopted this statement using the modified prospective
    method. Under this adoption method, the Company is recording
    expense related to stock option awards that were unvested as of
    the date of adoption as well as all awards made after the date
    of adoption. The adoption of this statement resulted in total
    expense, net of tax, of $14,285 in 2006.

Net earnings and basic and diluted earnings per share for 2005
    include income tax expense of approximately $25,800 related to
    the Company’s repatriation of approximately $547,000 of
    foreign earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005 pursuant to the
    special incentive provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of
    2004.

Consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31,
    2006 were $3,151,481 compared to $3,087,627 in 2005 and
    $2,997,510 in 2004. Most of the Company’s revenues and
    operating profits were derived from its two principal segments:
    North America and International, which are discussed in detail
    below. Consolidated net revenues were positively impacted by
    foreign currency translation in the amount of $27,800 in 2006
    and $1,029 in 2005 as the result of the overall weaker
    U.S. dollar in each of those years. The following table
    presents net revenues and operating profit data for the
    Company’s two principal segments for 2006, 2005 and 2004.
    Both 2005 and 2004 results have been reclassified to conform to
    the Company’s new operating segment structure. The
    operating profit for 2005 and 2004 for each of these segments
    have been adjusted to include the impact of expense related to
    stock options as disclosed under SFAS 123, consistent



with the Company’s management reporting. See notes 1
    and 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further
    details.

North American segment net revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 increased 4% to $2,130,290 from
    $2,038,556 in 2005. The impact of foreign currency translation
    on North American segment net revenues in 2006 was favorable and
    increased net revenues by approximately $3,200. Anticipated
    decreased revenues of STAR WARS products were more than offset
    primarily by increased sales of LITTLEST PET SHOP, PLAYSKOOL,
    NERF, I-DOG and MONOPOLY products, as well as revenues from the
    successful reintroduction of BABY ALIVE. 2006 revenues were also
    positively impacted, to a lesser extent, by increased sales of
    PLAY-DOH and TRANSFORMERS products. STAR WARS revenues were
    significant in 2005 due to the theatrical and DVD releases of
    STAR WARS EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH and remained strong
    in 2006. In 2007, the Company will introduce products related to
    two anticipated major motion picture releases, SPIDER-MAN 3 in
    May of 2007 and TRANSFORMERS in July of 2007.

North American operating profit increased to $275,959 in 2006
    from $165,676 in 2005. The increase in operating profit is
    primarily due to increased gross profit as a result of the
    increased sales in 2006 as well as decreases in royalty and
    amortization expense principally due to the decrease in sales of
    STAR WARS products. Operating profit for the North American
    segment was negatively impacted by higher research and product
    development costs due to higher investments in the PLAYSKOOL
    line and costs related to MARVEL products expected to be
    introduced in 2007. North American operating profit was
    negatively impacted in 2005 by a loss of approximately $23,000
    in the electronic games category, which included charges
    associated with inventory obsolescence and customer allowances
    related to plug and play games.

North American segment net revenues for the year ended
    December 25, 2005 increased 4% to $2,038,556 from
    $1,956,031 in 2004. North American revenues were positively
    impacted in 2005 by currency translation by approximately
    $11,300 due to the stronger Mexican Peso and Canadian Dollar.
    The increase in volume was predominantly due to increased
    revenues from STAR WARS related products as the result of the
    theatrical and DVD release of STAR WARS EPISODE III: REVENGE OF
    THE SITH in 2005. In addition to the increase from STAR WARS
    related products, North American net revenues were also
    positively impacted by the reintroduction of LITTLEST PET SHOP
    products as well as increased sales of NERF products. These
    increases were partially offset by decreased games sales in
    2005, primarily MAGIC: THE GATHERING and DUEL MASTERS trading
    card games. Net revenues in 2005 were also negatively impacted
    by decreased sales of VIDEONOW and FURREAL FRIENDS products as
    well as the continued decline in BEYBLADE products.

North American segment operating profit increased slightly to
    $165,676 in 2005 from $163,786 in 2004. Increased gross profit
    primarily resulting from higher net revenues was partially
    offset by higher royalty and amortization expense associated
    with higher sales of STAR WARS products. 2005 operating profit
    was also positively impacted by decreased advertising expense
    due to the high percentage of net revenues that represented STAR
    WARS products, which do not require as much advertising and
    promotion to raise awareness as an internally-developed product
    would. North American operating profit was negatively impacted
    in 2005 by a loss of approximately $23,000 in the electronic
    games category, which included charges associated with inventory
    obsolescence and customer allowances related to plug and play
    games. Currency



translation had a positive impact of approximately $1,900 on the
    operating profit of the North American segment in 2005.

International

International segment net revenues for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 decreased by 3% to $959,319 from $988,591
    in 2005. In 2006 net revenues were positively impacted by
    currency translation by approximately $24,300 as a result of a
    weaker U.S. dollar. The decrease in net revenues was
    primarily the result of decreased sales of STAR WARS products in
    2006 as well as decreased sales of FURBY and DUEL MASTERS
    products. These decreases were partially offset by increased
    revenues from LITTLEST PET SHOP, PLAYSKOOL and MONOPOLY
    products. To a lesser extent, 2006 net revenues were also
    positively impacted by increased sales of MY LITTLE PONY,
    TRANSFORMERS, and PLAY-DOH products as well as the
    reintroduction of the BABY ALIVE doll.

International segment operating profit decreased 15% to $90,893
    in 2006 from $106,435 in 2005. Operating profit in 2006 was
    positively impacted by approximately $4,900 due to the
    translation of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. The
    decrease in operating profit is the result of decreased gross
    profit primarily as the result of the decrease in net revenues,
    partially offset by decreases in royalties and amortization
    expense as a result of the decrease in sales of STAR WARS
    products.

International segment net revenues for the year ended
    December 25, 2005 increased by 1% to $988,591 from $977,128
    in 2004. In 2005, net revenues were negatively impacted by
    approximately $10,000 as a result of the stronger
    U.S. dollar. The increase in revenues was primarily the
    result of increased sales of STAR WARS products in 2005 and, to
    a lesser extent, the successful reintroduction of LITTLEST PET
    SHOP and FURBY products and the introduction of B-DAMAN
    products. These increases were partly offset by decreased sales
    of BEYBLADE and ACTION MAN products as well as decreased sales
    of FURREAL FRIENDS and VIDEONOW products. Revenues for board
    games grew internationally in 2005, while the Company
    experienced decreased revenues in its trading card games,
    primarily DUEL MASTERS and MAGIC: THE GATHERING.

International operating profit increased 13% to $106,435 in 2005
    from $94,487 in 2004. Increased gross profit as a result of
    increased revenues was partially offset by higher amortization
    and royalty expenses as a result of the higher sales of licensed
    products, primarily STAR WARS products, in 2005. International
    operating profit was negatively impacted by approximately $4,500
    due to the translation of foreign currencies to the
    U.S. dollar.

Gross
    Profit

The Company’s gross profit margin increased to 58.6% for
    the year ended December 31, 2006 from 58.3% in 2005. This
    increase is due to increased revenues from certain core brand
    products that have higher gross margins, such as LITTLEST PET
    SHOP products and traditional board games, such as MONOPOLY.
    Gross profit in 2006 was negatively impacted by a charge of
    approximately $10,300 related to the Company’s decision to
    transfer certain manufacturing activities from its Ireland
    manufacturing facility to its suppliers in China. Gross margin
    in 2005 was also negatively impacted by inventory obsolescence
    and customer allowances on plug and play games.

The Company’s gross profit margin increased slightly to
    58.3% for the year ended December 25, 2005 from 58.2% in
    2004. This increase was primarily due to increased sales of STAR
    WARS products. Gross profit margin in 2005 was also impacted by
    decreased sales of VIDEONOW products that have lower gross
    margins. These increases were largely offset by inventory
    obsolescence and customer allowances on plug and play games as
    well as lower sales of trading card games that carry a higher
    gross margin.

The Company aggressively monitors its levels of inventory,
    attempting to avoid unnecessary expenditures of cash and
    potential charges related to obsolescence. The Company’s
    failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand
    could result in overproduction of less popular items, which
    could result in higher obsolescence costs, causing a reduction
    in gross profit.

The Company’s operating expenses, stated as percentages of
    net revenues, are illustrated below for the three fiscal years
    ended December 31, 2006:

Amortization expense decreased to $78,934 in 2006 from $102,035
    in 2005. This decrease was due to decreased amortization of STAR
    WARS property rights as a result of the decrease in sales of
    STAR WARS products in 2006. Amortization of these property
    rights is based on actual sales of products as a portion of
    total expected sales of related products related to this
    licensing right. Amortization is generally higher in years where
    theatrical or DVD releases occur, such as in 2005. Amortization
    expense increased to $102,035 in 2005 from $70,562 in 2004 as a
    result of increased amortization of STAR WARS property rights
    due to the theatrical and DVD releases of STAR WARS
    EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH.

Royalty expense decreased to $169,731 or 5.4% of net revenues in
    2006 compared to $247,283 or 8.0% of net revenues in 2005. This
    decrease primarily relates to the decrease in sales of STAR WARS
    products in 2006, as a higher percentage of net revenues were
    from the Company’s core brands. Royalty expense in 2005
    increased to $247,283 or 8.0% of net revenues in 2005 from
    $223,193 or 7.4% of net revenues in 2004. Increased royalty
    expense in 2005 related primarily to increased sales of STAR
    WARS related products. The increase from STAR WARS products was
    partially offset by lower sales of BEYBLADE, SHREK and DISNEY
    products. The Company expects royalty expense to increase in
    both dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in 2007
    compared to 2006, due to significant anticipated revenues from
    MARVEL products in 2007 primarily due to the anticipated release
    of SPIDER-MAN 3 in May. In addition, in 2007, the Company will
    incur additional royalty expense on certain sales of
    TRANSFORMERS products that are related to the major motion
    picture release anticipated in July of 2007.

Research and product development expense increased in 2006 to
    $171,358 or 5.4% of net revenues from $150,586 or 4.9% of net
    revenues in 2005. This increase is the result of development
    expenses related to the MARVEL line of products as well as
    increased investment in the PLAYSKOOL line. Research and product
    development decreased in 2005 to $150,586 or 4.9% of net
    revenues from $157,162 or 5.2% of net revenues in 2004. The
    decrease reflected increased efficiencies in the product
    development of certain toy lines resulting from a realignment in
    2004. This realignment streamlined the workforce of these toy
    lines and moved certain product development activity outside of
    the U.S. While the Company strives to incur these costs in
    the most efficient manner possible, investment in research and
    product development costs is an important component to the
    Company’s strategy to grow core brands and to create new
    and innovative toy and game products.

Advertising expense in 2006 was $368,996 or 11.7% of net
    revenues which was consistent with the 2005 expense of $366,371
    or 11.8% of net revenues. Advertising expense in 2005 decreased
    in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues from $387,523 or
    12.9% of net revenues in 2004. The Company continues to focus on
    marketing to raise awareness of its core brands, as well as to
    introduce new products.

Selling, distribution and administration expenses were $682,214
    or 21.7% of net revenues in 2006 compared to $624,560 or 20.2%
    in 2005. Approximately $20,000 of this increase relates to the
    Company’s adoption of SFAS 123R in 2006 which required
    that the Company measure all stock-based compensation awards
    using a fair value method and record such expense in its
    financial statements. The remainder of the increase primarily
    relates to increased sales and marketing expense in 2006
    associated with the higher level of sales and increased bonus
    and incentive provisions due to the strong performance of the
    Company in 2006. Selling, distribution and administration
    expenses increased in dollars but decreased as a percentage of
    net revenues to $624,560 or 20.2% of net revenues in 2005, from
    $614,401 or 20.5% of net revenues in 2004. The



increase in administration costs in dollars in 2005 over 2004
    primarily reflected increased performance incentive bonus
    provisions reflecting the Company’s improved performance.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense continued to decrease in 2006 to $27,521 from
    $30,537 in 2005 and $31,698 in 2004. Decreases in interest
    expense resulting from lower levels of debt were partially
    offset by increases resulting from higher interest rates in
    2006. The decrease in interest expense mainly reflects the
    reduction in the Company’s long-term debt. The Company
    repurchased or repaid principal amounts of long-term debt of
    $32,743 in 2006, $93,303 in 2005, and $56,697 in 2004. The
    Company will continue to review the amount of long-term debt
    outstanding as part of its strategic capital structure objective
    of maintaining a debt to capitalization ratio between 25% and
    30%.

Interest
    Income

Interest income was $27,609 in 2006 compared to $24,157 in 2005
    and $7,729 in 2004. Interest income includes $5,200 in 2006
    related to a long-term deposit that was refunded during 2006 and
    approximately $4,100 in 2005 related to an IRS settlement. The
    increase in interest income reflects the Company’s strong
    financial position. During a portion of 2006, the Company
    invested excess cash in auction rate securities, which generated
    a higher rate of return and contributed to the increase in
    interest income in 2006. In recent years the Company has reduced
    its long-term debt which has reduced cash required to service
    debt and allowed the Company to retain and invest excess cash.

Other
    (Income) Expense, Net

Other (income) expense, net of $34,977 in 2006 compares to
    $(6,772) in 2005 and $8,955 in 2004. The major component of
    other (income) expense is non-cash (income) expense related to
    the change in fair value of certain warrants required to be
    classified as a liability. These warrants are required to be
    adjusted to their fair value each quarter through earnings. For
    2006, 2005 and 2004, expense (income) related to the change in
    fair value of these warrants was $31,770, $(2,080) and
    $(12,710), respectively. The fair value of these warrants is
    primarily affected by the Company’s stock price, but is
    also affected by the Company’s stock price volatility and
    dividends, as well as risk-free interest rates. Assuming the
    Company’s stock volatility and dividend payments, as well
    as risk-free interest rates remain constant, the fair value of
    the warrants would increase and the Company would recognize a
    charge to earnings as the price of the Company’s stock
    increases. If the price of the Company’s stock decreases
    and the Company’s stock volatility, dividend payments, and
    the risk-free interest rates remain constant, the fair value of
    the warrants will decrease and the Company will recognize
    income. Based on a hypothetical increase in the Company’s
    stock price to $30.00 per share at December 31, 2006
    from its actual price of $27.25 a share on that date, the
    Company would have recognized a non-cash charge of approximately
    $52,190 rather than actual non-cash charge recorded of $31,770
    for the year ended December 31, 2006, to reflect the change
    in the fair value of the warrants from their fair value of
    $123,860 at December 25, 2005.

In addition to the above, other (income) expense, net in 2006
    and 2004 also include $2,629 and $8,988, respectively,
    representing write-downs of the value of the common stock of
    Infogrames, held by the Company as an

available-for-sale

investment. This write-down resulted from an

other-than-temporary

decline in the fair value of this investment.

Income
    Taxes

Income tax expense was 32.6% of pretax earnings in 2006 compared
    with 31.8% of pretax earnings in 2005 and 24.6% of pretax
    earnings in 2004. Income tax expense for 2006 includes
    approximately $7,800 of discrete tax events, primarily relating
    to the settlement of various tax exams in multiple
    jurisdictions. Income tax expense for 2005 includes
    approximately $25,800 related to the repatriation of $547,000 of
    foreign earnings pursuant to the special incentive provided by
    the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Income tax expense for
    2005 was also reduced by approximately $4,000, due primarily to
    the settlement of an Internal



Revenue Service examination of tax years ending in December
    2001. Absent these items and the effect of the adjustment of
    certain warrants to their fair value, which has no tax effect,
    the 2006 effective tax rate would have been 27.6% compared with
    24.9% in 2005 and 25.9% in 2004. The increase in the adjusted
    rate to 27.6% in 2006 from 24.9% in 2005 was the result of
    higher earnings in jurisdictions with higher statutory tax
    rates. The decrease in the adjusted rate, to 24.9% in 2005 from
    25.9% in 2004, was due to the tax impact of higher operating
    profits in jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The Company has historically generated a significant amount of
    cash from operations. In 2006, the Company funded its operations
    and liquidity needs primarily through cash flows from
    operations, and, when needed, proceeds from its accounts
    receivable securitization program and borrowings under its
    unsecured credit facilities. During 2007, the Company expects to
    continue to fund its working capital needs primarily through
    operations and, when needed, using proceeds from the accounts
    receivable securitization program and borrowings under its
    available lines of credit. The Company believes that the funds
    available to it, including cash expected to be generated from
    operations and funds available through its securitization
    program and other available lines of credit, are adequate to
    meet its needs for 2007.

During the last five fiscal years, as part of its strategy of
    reducing long-term debt and its overall

debt-to-capitalization

ratio, the Company has repurchased or repaid approximately
    $679,000 in aggregate principal amount of long-term debt,
    primarily using cash from operations. Remaining principal
    amounts of long-term debt at December 31, 2006, were
    $494,983. The Company believes that the reduction in its

debt-to-capitalization

ratio has improved its liquidity situation by decreasing cash
    required to service outstanding debt and increasing the ability
    of the Company to obtain additional financing should the need to
    do so arise in the future.

At December 31, 2006, cash and cash equivalents, net of
    short-term borrowings, were $704,818 compared to $927,592 and
    $707,043 at December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004,
    respectively. Hasbro generated $320,647, $496,624, and $358,506
    of cash from its operating activities in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. The higher cash flows from operations in 2005
    compared to 2006 and 2004 is primarily due to the mix of
    products in 2005 net revenues. Net earnings in 2005
    included increased non-cash expenses primarily as a result of
    increased STAR WARS revenues. Increased royalty expense in 2005
    related to revenues from STAR WARS products, most of which had
    been paid in prior years. In 2006 and 2005, operating cash flows
    were impacted by royalty advances paid of $105,000 and $35,000
    related to MARVEL and STAR WARS agreements, respectively. In
    addition, the Company had increased amortization expense in
    2005, which did not impact the cash flows from operations.

Accounts receivable increased to $556,287 at December 31,
    2006 from $523,232 at December 25, 2005. Fourth quarter
    days sales outstanding increased slightly to 45 days in
    2006 from 44 days in 2005. Fourth quarter days sales
    outstanding in 2004 was 49. The increase in days sales
    outstanding from 2005 primarily reflects increases in
    international accounts receivable due to the weaker
    U.S. dollar in 2006. The December 31, 2006 accounts
    receivable balance includes an increase of approximately $18,800
    related to the currency impact of the weaker U.S. dollar.
    The Company has a revolving accounts receivable securitization
    facility whereby the Company is able to sell undivided interests
    in qualifying accounts receivable on an ongoing basis. At
    December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005, there was
    $250,000 sold at each period-end under this program.

Inventories increased to $203,337 at December 31, 2006 from
    $179,398 at December 25, 2005. The increase in inventory
    represents higher levels of inventory at December 31, 2006
    primarily due to anticipated sales of MARVEL products in early
    2007. In addition, inventories increased approximately $6,100
    due to the weaker U.S. dollar in 2006. The decrease in
    inventory to $179,398 at December 25, 2005 from $194,780 at
    December 26, 2004 reflects higher levels of inventory at
    December 26, 2004 due to lower levels of sales in the
    fourth quarter of 2004 and, to a lesser extent, lower
    international inventories in U.S. dollars as a result of
    the stronger U.S. dollar in 2005.

Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased to $243,291
    at December 31, 2006 from $185,297 at December 25,
    2005. This increase is primarily due to a royalty advance paid
    to MARVEL in 2006, of which



approximately $87,400 is recorded in prepaid assets and $12,930
    is shown in long-term assets at December 31, 2006. Prepaid
    expenses and other current assets decreased to $185,297 in 2005
    from $219,735 in 2004. This decrease is primarily related to
    decreased prepaid royalties as a result of the increased sales
    of STAR WARS products in 2005. Generally, when the Company
    enters into a licensing agreement for entertainment-based
    properties, an advance royalty payment is required at the
    inception of the agreement. This payment is then recognized in
    the consolidated statement of operations as the related sales
    are recorded. The decrease related to prepaid royalties was
    partially offset by increased deferred taxes. With respect to
    the MARVEL and STAR WARS licenses, the Company has prepaid
    royalties recorded in both current and non-current assets.

Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to $895,311 at
    December 31, 2006 from $863,280 at December 25, 2005.
    $31,770 of this increase relates to the increase in fair value
    of the Lucas warrants that the Company is required to record as
    liabilities under SFAS 150. As a result of SFAS 150,
    the Company classifies these warrants containing a put option as
    a current liability and adjusts the amount of this liability to
    its fair value on a periodic basis. Increases from higher
    accrued bonus and incentive payments as a result of the
    Company’s strong performance in 2006 were offset by
    decreases in other accrued amounts, principally accrued
    royalties. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to
    $863,280 at December 25, 2005 from $806,528 at
    December 26, 2004. This primarily reflected an increase in
    accrued income taxes primarily as a result of improved earnings
    in 2005 and, to a lesser extent, taxes payable related to
    earnings repatriated under the American Jobs Creation Act (the
    “Act”). In December 2005, the Company repatriated
    approximately $547,000 under this Act. The increase from accrued
    income taxes was partially offset by lower accrued royalties at
    December 25, 2005 due to lower sales of BEYBLADE and SHREK
    products in the fourth quarter of 2005. These contracts did not
    require the Company to prepay royalties and these amounts were
    paid in arrears.

Cash flows from investing activities were a net utilization of
    $83,604, $120,671, and $84,967 in 2006, 2005, and 2004,
    respectively. During 2005, the Company expended $65,000 to
    reacquire the digital gaming rights for its owned or controlled
    properties from Infogrames Entertainment SA (Infogrames). These
    rights were previously held by Infogrames on an exclusive basis
    as a result of a licensing agreement entered into during 2000.
    In addition, the Company expended $14,179 to purchase the assets
    of Wrebbit Inc., a Montreal-based creator and manufacturer of
    innovative puzzles. In 2005, the Company also had proceeds from
    the sales of property, plant and equipment of $33,083. These
    proceeds came primarily from the sale of the Company’s
    former manufacturing facility in Spain. During 2006, the Company
    expended approximately $82,000 on additions to its property,
    plant and equipment while during 2005 and 2004 it expended
    approximately $71,000 and $79,000, respectively. Of these
    amounts, 63% in 2006, 61% in 2005, and 58% in 2004 were for
    purchases of tools, dies and molds related to the Company’s
    products. In 2007, the Company expects capital expenditures to
    increase and be in the range of $90,000 to $110,000, primarily
    as the result of increased tooling requirements for the MARVEL
    line. During the three years ended December 31, 2006,
    depreciation and amortization of plant and equipment was
    $67,773, $78,097, and $75,618, respectively. In 2004, the
    Company acquired the remaining unowned interest in its Latin
    America operations for total consideration of $9,824. This
    purchase resulted in an increase in goodwill in the amount of
    $9,390. The Company made no acquisitions of businesses in 2006.

The Company commits to inventory production, advertising and
    marketing expenditures prior to the peak third and fourth
    quarter retail selling season. Accounts receivable increase
    during the third and fourth quarter as customers increase their
    purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday
    season. Due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling
    period, payments for these accounts receivable are generally not
    due until the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of
    the subsequent year. This timing difference between expenditures
    and cash collections on accounts receivable makes it necessary
    for the Company to borrow varying amounts during the year.
    During 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company primarily utilized cash
    from operations and its accounts receivable securitization
    program to fund its operations.

The Company is party to an accounts receivable securitization
    program, which was amended in December 2006, whereby the Company
    sells, on an ongoing basis, substantially all of its
    U.S. trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote
    special purpose entity, Hasbro Receivables Funding, LLC
    (“HRF”). HRF is consolidated with the Company for
    financial reporting purposes. The securitization program then
    allows HRF to sell, on a revolving basis, an undivided interest
    of up to $250,000 in the eligible receivables it holds to



certain bank conduits. During the period from the first day of
    the October fiscal month through the last day of the following
    January fiscal month, this limit is increased to $300,000. The
    program provides the Company with a cost-effective source of
    working capital. Based on the amount of eligible accounts
    receivable as of December 31, 2006, the Company had
    $300,000 available to sell under this program of which $250,000
    was utilized.

In June 2006, the Company entered into a five-year revolving
    credit agreement (the “Agreement”) which provides the
    Company with a $300,000 committed borrowing facility that
    replaced the prior credit facility. The Company has the ability
    to request increases in the committed facility in additional
    increments of at least $50,000, up to a total of committed
    facility of $500,000. The Company is not required to maintain
    compensating balances under the Agreement. The Agreement
    contains certain financial covenants setting forth leverage and
    coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of
    an investment grade facility, including with respect to liens,
    mergers and incurrence of indebtedness. The Company was in
    compliance with all covenants as of and for the fiscal year
    ended December 31, 2006. The Company had no borrowings
    outstanding under its committed revolving credit facility at
    December 31, 2006. The Company also has other uncommitted
    lines from various banks, of which approximately $37,755 was
    utilized at December 31, 2006. Amounts available and unused
    under the committed line at December 31, 2006 were
    approximately $297,131.

Net cash utilized by financing activities was $467,279 in 2006.
    Of this amount, $456,744, which includes transaction costs, was
    used to repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock. In
    July 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of an additional $350,000 in common stock subsequent
    to the full utilization of the Board of Director’s May 2005
    authorization of $350,000. During 2006, the Company repurchased
    22,767 shares at an average price of $20.03. In addition,
    $32,743 was used to repay long-term debt. Dividends paid were
    $75,282 in 2006 reflecting the increase in the Company’s
    quarterly dividend rate to $.12 per share in 2006 compared
    to $.09 per share in 2005. These uses of cash were partially
    offset by cash receipts of $86,257 from the exercise of employee
    stock options.

Net cash utilized by financing activities was $158,641 in 2005.
    This amount included repayments in principal amount of long-term
    debt totaling $93,303. These amounts primarily related to
    $71,970 of bonds that matured in November of 2005. The remaining
    amount related to repayment of long-term debt associated with
    the Company’s former manufacturing facility in Spain.
    Dividends paid increased to $58,901 as a result of the increase
    of the quarterly dividend rate to $0.09 in 2005 from $0.06. In
    2005, the Company repurchased 2,386 shares at an average
    price of $20.10 under the Board of Director’s May 2005
    authorization. The total cost of these repurchases, including
    transaction costs, was $48,030. The Company received $45,278 in
    2005 in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options.

Net cash utilized by financing activities was $75,824 in 2004.
    This amount included repurchases in principal amount of
    long-term debt totaling $56,697 in connection with the
    Company’s strategy of reducing its overall debt and
    improving its

debt-to-capitalization

ratio. The Company received $25,836 from the exercise of stock
    options during the year. Cash paid for dividends in 2004 was
    $37,088.

At December 31, 2006, the Company has outstanding $249,996
    in principal amount of senior convertible debentures due 2021.
    The senior convertible debentures bear interest at 2.75%, which
    could be subject to an upward adjustment in the rate, not to
    exceed 11%, should the price of the Company’s stock trade
    at or below $9.72 per share for 20 of the 30 trading days
    preceding the fifth day prior to an interest payment date. This
    contingent interest feature represents a derivative instrument
    that is recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value, with
    changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations.
    If the closing price of the Company’s stock exceeds $23.76
    for at least 20 trading days, within the 30 consecutive trading
    day period ending on the last trading day of the calendar
    quarter, or upon other specified events, the debentures will be
    convertible at an initial conversion price of $21.60 in the next
    calendar quarter. At December 31, 2006, this conversion
    feature was met and the bonds are convertible through
    March 31, 2007 at which time the conversion feature will be
    reassessed. In addition, if the closing price of the
    Company’s stock exceeds $27.00 for at least 20 trading days
    in any 30 day period, the Company has the right to call the
    debentures by giving notice to the holders of the debentures.
    During a prescribed notice period, the holders of the debentures
    have the right to convert their debentures in accordance with
    the conversion terms described above. The holders of



these debentures may also put the notes back to Hasbro in
    December 2011 and December 2016 at the original principal
    amount. At that time, the purchase price may be paid in cash,
    shares of common stock or a combination of the two, at the
    Company’s discretion. While the Company’s current
    intent is to settle in cash any puts exercised, there can be no
    guarantee that the Company will have the funds necessary to
    settle this obligation in cash. On December 1, 2005, the
    holders of these debentures had the option to put these notes
    back to Hasbro. On that date, the Company redeemed $4 of these
    notes in cash.

The Company has remaining principal amounts of long-term debt at
    December 31, 2006 of approximately $494,983. As detailed
    below in Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments,
    this debt is due at varying times from 2008 through 2028. In
    addition, the Company is committed to guaranteed royalty and
    other contractual payments of approximately $91,890 in 2007,
    which includes $70,000 of royalty commitments related to a
    contract signed in January 2006 with Marvel Entertainment, Inc.
    and Marvel Characters, Inc. Also, as detailed in Contractual
    Obligations and Commercial Commitments, the Company has certain
    warrants, currently recorded in accrued liabilities, that may be
    settleable for, at the Company’s option, $100,000 in cash
    or $110,000 in the Company’s stock, such stock being valued
    at the time of the exercise of the option. The Company believes
    that cash from operations, including the securitization
    facility, and, if necessary, its line of credit, will allow the
    Company to meet these and other obligations listed. The Company
    will continue to review the amount of long-term debt outstanding
    as part of its strategic capital structure objective of
    maintaining a debt to capitalization ratio between 25% and 30%.

In July 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
    the repurchase of up to $350,000 in common stock, replacing a
    fully utilized prior authorization of $350,000 dated May 2005.
    Purchases of the Company’s common stock may be made in the
    open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The
    Company has no obligation to repurchase shares under the open
    authorization, and the timing, actual number, and the value of
    the shares that are repurchased will depend on a number of
    factors, including the price of the Company’s stock. The
    Company may suspend or discontinue the program at any time and
    there is no expiration date. In 2006, the Company repurchased
    22,767 shares at an average price of $20.03 under these
    authorizations. The total cost of these repurchases, including
    transaction costs, was $456,744.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates

The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. As such, management is required to
    make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it
    believes are reasonable based on the information available.
    These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the
    periods presented. The significant accounting policies which
    management believes are the most critical to aid in fully
    understanding and evaluating the Company’s reported
    financial results include sales allowances, inventory valuation,
    recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets, recoverability
    of royalty advances and commitments, pension costs and
    obligations, and stock-based compensation.

Sales
    Allowances

Sales allowances for customer promotions, discounts and returns
    are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue
    is recognized. Revenue from product sales is recognized upon
    passing of title to the customer, generally at the time of
    shipment. Revenue from product sales, less related sales
    allowances, is added to royalty revenue and reflected as net
    revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. The
    Company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance
    programs with customers. These allowances primarily relate to
    fixed programs, which the customer earns based on purchases of
    Company products during the year. Discounts are recorded as a
    reduction of related revenue at the time of sale. While many of
    the allowances are based on fixed amounts, certain of the
    allowances, such as the returns allowance, are based on market
    data, historical trends and information from customers and are
    therefore subject to estimation. For its allowance programs that
    are not fixed, such as returns, the Company estimates these
    amounts using a combination of historical experience and current
    market conditions. These estimates are reviewed periodically



against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that
    time as an increase or decrease to net revenues. During 2006,
    there have been no material adjustments to the Company’s
    estimates.

Inventory
    Valuation

Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. Based upon a
    consideration of quantities on hand, actual and projected sales
    volume, anticipated product selling prices and product lines
    planned to be discontinued, slow-moving and obsolete inventory
    is written down to its net realizable value. Failure to
    accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result
    in the Company under producing popular items or overproducing
    less popular items. Management estimates are monitored on a
    quarterly basis and a further adjustment to reduce inventory to
    its net realizable value is recorded, as an increase to cost of
    sales, when deemed necessary under the lower of cost or market
    standard. During 2006, there have been no material adjustments
    to the Company’s estimates.

Recoverability
    of Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite
    lives are tested for impairment at least annually. If an event
    occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying
    value may not be recoverable, the Company will perform an
    interim test at that time. The impairment test begins by
    allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable
    reporting units. Goodwill is then tested using a two step
    process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the
    reporting unit using an income approach, which looks to the
    present value of expected future cash flows.

The first step is a screen for potential impairment while the
    second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an
    indication from the first step that one exists. Intangible
    assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by
    comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value
    which is also calculated using an income approach. The
    Company’s annual impairment test was performed in the
    fourth quarter of 2006 and no impairment was indicated. The
    estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments
    and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the
    respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those
    revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in
    anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a
    change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge.
    The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the
    selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different
    assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash
    flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment
    charge. At December 31, 2006, the Company has goodwill and
    intangible assets with indefinite lives of $545,676 recorded on
    the balance sheet.

Intangible assets, other than those with indefinite lives, are
    amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for
    indications of impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Recoverability of the value of these intangible
    assets is measured by a comparison of the assets’ carrying
    value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected
    to be generated by the asset. If such assets were considered to
    be impaired, the impairment would be measured by the amount by
    which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value
    based on estimated future discounted cash flows. The estimation
    of future cash flows requires significant judgments and
    estimates with respect to future revenues related to the
    respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those
    revenues. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in
    anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a
    change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge.
    The estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the
    selection of an appropriate discount rate. The use of different
    assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash
    flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment
    charge. Intangible assets covered under this policy were
    $456,519 at December 31, 2006. During 2006, there were no
    impairment charges related to these intangible assets.

Recoverability
    of Royalty Advances and Commitments

The recoverability of royalty advances and contractual
    obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is
    assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the
    estimated future sales forecasts and



related cash flow projections to be derived from the related
    product. If sales forecasts and related cash flows from the
    particular product do not support the recoverability of the
    remaining minimum guaranty or, if the Company decides to
    discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments,
    a charge to royalty expense to write-off the remaining minimum
    guaranty is required. The preparation of revenue forecasts and
    related cash flows for these products requires judgments and
    estimates. Actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in
    the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to
    these products could result in a change to the assessment of
    recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties. At
    December 31, 2006, the Company had $181,561 of prepaid
    royalties, $116,792 of which are included in prepaid expenses
    and other current assets and $64,769 which are included in other
    assets.

Pension
    Costs and Obligations

The Company, except for certain international subsidiaries, has
    pension plans covering substantially all of its full-time
    employees. Pension expense is based on actuarial computations of
    current and future benefits using estimates for expected return
    on assets, expected compensation increases, and applicable
    discount rates.

The estimates for the Company’s domestic plans are
    established at the Company’s measurement date of
    September 30 to measure the liabilities and assets of the
    plans as of that date and to establish the expense for the
    upcoming year. As a result of the Company’s adoption of
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans”,
    (“SFAS No. 158”) in December 2006, the
    Company will be required to change the measurement date for its
    pension plans to match its year-end date by 2008.

The Company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted
    average rate based on historical market data for the investment
    classes of assets held by the plan, the allocation of plan
    assets among those investment classes, and the current economic
    environment. Based on this information, the Company’s
    estimate of expected return on domestic plan assets was 8.75% in
    2006, 2005 and 2004. A decrease in the estimate used for
    expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense,
    while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension
    expense. A decrease of .25% in the estimate of expected return
    on plan assets would have increased 2006 pension expense for
    U.S. plans by approximately $550.

Expected compensation increases are estimated using a
    combination of historical and expected compensation increases.
    Based on this analysis, the Company’s estimate of expected
    long-term compensation increases for its U.S. plans was
    4.0% in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Increases in estimated compensation
    increases would result in higher pension expense while decreases
    would lower pension expense.

Discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the
    measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments
    currently available and expected to be available during the
    period to maturity of the pension benefits. Based on this
    long-term corporate bond yield at September 30, 2006, the
    Company’s measurement date for its pension assets and
    liabilities, the Company’s discount rate for its domestic
    plans used for the calculation of 2007 pension expense was 5.75%
    compared to a rate of 5.50% used in the calculation of 2006
    pension expense and 5.75% used in the calculation of 2005
    pension expense. A decrease in the discount rate would result in
    greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate
    would decrease pension expense. A decrease of .25% in the
    Company’s discount rate would have increased 2006 pension
    expense and the 2006 projected benefit obligation by
    approximately $756 and $9,395, respectively.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 87, “Employers Accounting for Pensions”,
    actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are
    accumulated and, if outside a certain corridor, amortized over
    future periods and, therefore generally affect recognized
    expense in future periods. In December 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 158, which required that the funded status of
    the plans be recognized on the Company’s balance sheet and
    any unrecognized gains or losses be recorded to accumulated
    other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2006, the
    Company has unrecognized actuarial losses of $48,879 included in
    accumulated other comprehensive income related to its defined
    benefit pension plans. Assets in the plan are valued on the
    basis of their fair market value on the measurement date.



Stock-Based
    Compensation

The Company has a stock-based compensation plan for employees
    and non-employee members of the Company’s Board of
    Directors. Under this plan, the Company grants stock options at
    or above the fair market value of the Company’s stock. On
    December 26, 2005, the first day of fiscal 2006, the
    Company adopted SFAS 123R, which requires the Company to
    measure all stock-based compensation awards using a fair value
    method and record such expense in its consolidated financial
    statements. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing
    model to value the stock options that are granted under these
    plans. The Black-Scholes method includes four significant
    assumptions: (1) expected term of the options,
    (2) risk-free interest rate, (3) expected dividend
    yield, and (4) expected stock price volatility. For the
    Company’s 2006 stock option grant, the weighted average
    expected term was approximately 5 years. This amount is
    based on a review of employees’ exercise history relating
    to stock options as well as the contractual term of the option.
    The weighted average risk-free interest rate used for 2006 stock
    option grants was 4.98%. This estimate was based on the interest
    rate available on U.S. treasury securities with durations
    that approximate the expected term of the option. For 2006 stock
    option grants, the weighted average expected dividend yield used
    was 2.55% which is based on the Company’s current annual
    dividend amount divided by the stock price on the date of the
    grant. The weighted average expected stock price volatility used
    for 2006 stock option grants was 24%. This amount was derived
    using a combination of historical price volatility over the most
    recent period approximating the expected term of the option and
    implied price volatility. Implied price volatility represents
    the volatility implied in publicly traded options on the
    Company’s stock, which the Company believes represents the
    expected future volatility of the Company’s stock price.
    The Company believes that since this is a market-based estimate,
    it can provide a better estimate of expected future volatility.

In July 2006, as part of its employee stock-based compensation
    plan, the Company issued contingent stock performance awards,
    which provide the recipients with the ability to earn shares of
    the Company’s common stock based on the Company’s
    achievement of stated cumulative diluted earnings per share and
    cumulative net revenue targets over a ten quarter period
    beginning July 3, 2006 and ending December 28, 2008.
    Each award has a target number of shares of common stock
    associated with such award which may be earned by the recipient
    if the Company achieves the stated diluted earnings per share
    and net revenue targets. The measurement of the expense related
    to this award is based on the Company’s current estimate of
    revenues and diluted earnings per share over the performance
    period. Changes in these estimates may impact the expense
    recognized related to these awards.

Contractual
    Obligations and Commercial Commitments

In the normal course of its business, the Company enters into
    contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under
    license, which may require the payment of minimum guarantees, as
    well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and
    equipment. In addition, the Company has $494,983 in principal
    amount of long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2006,
    excluding fair value adjustments. Future payments required under
    these and other obligations as of December 31, 2006 are as
    follows:

The Company’s agreement with MARVEL also requires the
    Company to make minimum expenditures on marketing and
    promotional activities, including the spending of at least
    $15,000 associated with the motion



picture SPIDER-MAN 3, which is included in purchase
    commitments above. Certain of the future minimum guaranteed
    contractual royalty payments are contingent upon the theatrical
    release of the related entertainment property.

Included in the Thereafter column above is $249,996 in principal
    amount of senior convertible debt due 2021. The holders of these
    debentures may put the notes back to the Company in December
    2011 and December 2016 at the principal amount. At that time,
    the purchase price may be paid in cash, shares of common stock
    or a combination of the two. In addition, at December 31,
    2006, these debentures may be converted to shares at an initial
    conversion price of $21.60 per share through March 31,
    2007, at which time the contingent conversion feature will be
    reassessed. If the Company’s stock exceeds $23.76 for at
    least 20 trading days, within the 30 consecutive trading day
    period ending on the last trading day of a calendar quarter, or
    upon other specified events, the debentures will be convertible
    at the initial conversion price of $21.60.

In addition to the above, the Company has certain warrants
    outstanding at December 31, 2006 that contain a put option
    that would require the Company to repurchase the warrants for a
    price to be paid, at the Company’s election, of either
    $100,000 in cash or $110,000 in shares of the Company’s
    common stock, such stock being valued at the time of the
    exercise of the option. The Company’s current intent is to
    settle this put option in cash if exercised. In accordance with
    SFAS 150, these warrants are recorded as a current
    liability in the amount of $155,630, which represented the fair
    value of these warrants at December 31, 2006.

In addition, the Company expects to make contributions totaling
    approximately $7,100 to its pension plans in 2007. The Company
    also has letters of credit and related instruments of
    approximately $71,000 at December 31, 2006.

Financial
    Risk Management

The Company is exposed to market risks attributable to
    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as the
    result of sourcing products priced in U.S. dollars, Hong
    Kong dollars and Euros while marketing those products in more
    than twenty currencies. Results of operations may be affected
    primarily by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar, Hong
    Kong dollar, Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and
    Mexican peso and, to a lesser extent, currencies in Latin
    American and Asia Pacific countries.

To manage this exposure, the Company has hedged a portion of its
    forecasted foreign currency transactions using forward foreign
    exchange contracts. The Company estimates that a hypothetical
    immediate 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against
    foreign currencies could result in an approximate $22,000
    decrease in the fair value of these instruments. A decrease in
    the fair value of these instruments would be substantially
    offset by decreases in the related forecasted foreign currency
    transaction.

The Company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with
    respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short-term
    borrowing positions in currencies other than the
    U.S. dollar. The Company believes, however, that the
    on-going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its
    financial condition. In addition, the Company’s revenues
    and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by
    changes in foreign currency rates. From time to time, affiliates
    of the Company may make or receive intercompany loans in
    currencies other than their functional currency. The Company
    manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using
    foreign exchange contracts. Other than as set forth above, the
    Company does not hedge foreign currency exposures. The Company
    reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or
    liability on the balance sheet. The Company does not speculate
    in foreign currency exchange contracts. At December 31,
    2006, these contracts had unrealized losses of $2,574, which are
    recorded in accrued liabilities. Included in accumulated other
    comprehensive income at December 31, 2006 are deferred
    losses of $2,116, net of tax.

At December 31, 2006, the Company had fixed rate long-term
    debt, excluding fair value adjustments, of $494,983. At
    December 31, 2006, the Company had

fixed-for-floating

interest rate swaps with notional amounts of $75,000. The
    interest rate swaps are designed to adjust a portion of the
    Company’s debt subject to a fixed interest rate. The
    interest rate swaps are matched with specific long-term debt
    issues and are designated and effective as hedges of the change
    in the fair value of the associated debt. Changes in fair value
    of these contracts are wholly offset in earnings by changes in
    the fair value of the related long-term debt. At



December 31, 2006, the fair value of these contracts were a
    liability of $66, which is included in long-term liabilities,
    with a corresponding fair value adjustment to decrease long-term
    debt. Changes in interest rates affect the fair value of fixed
    rate debt not hedged by interest rate swap agreements while
    affecting the earnings and cash flows of the long-term debt
    hedged by the interest rate swaps. The Company estimates that a
    hypothetical one percentage point decrease or increase in
    interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this
    long-term debt by approximately $15,600 or $12,800,
    respectively. A hypothetical one percentage point change in
    interest rates would increase or decrease 2007 pretax earnings
    and cash flows by $731 and $377, respectively.

The
    Economy and Inflation

The principal market for the Company’s products is the
    retail sector. Revenues from the Company’s top
    5 customers, all retailers, accounted for approximately
    53%, 53%, and 50% of its consolidated net revenues in 2006, 2005
    and 2004, respectively. In the past three years certain
    customers in the retail sector have experienced economic
    difficulty. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its
    customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems
    appropriate.

The Company’s revenue pattern continues to show the second
    half of the year to be more significant to its overall business
    for the full year. In 2006, approximately 68% of the
    Company’s full year net revenues were recognized in the
    second half of the year. Although the Company expects that this
    concentration will continue, particularly as more of its
    business shifts to larger customers with order patterns
    concentrated in the second half of the year, this concentration
    may be less in years where the Company has products related to a
    major motion picture release that occurs in the first half of
    the year. In 2007, the Company will have products related to two
    major motion picture releases, SPIDER-MAN 3 in May of 2007 and
    TRANSFORMERS in July of 2007. The concentration of sales in the
    second half of the year increases the risk of
    (a) underproduction of popular items,
    (b) overproduction of less popular items, and
    (c) failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping
    schedules. The business of the Company is characterized by
    customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely
    because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a
    product line, product availability, marketing strategies,
    inventory levels, policies of retailers and differences in
    overall economic conditions. The trend of larger retailers has
    been to maintain lower inventories throughout the year and
    purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the
    fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season, which includes
    Christmas.

Quick response inventory management practices now being used
    result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and
    fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment. To the
    extent that retailers do not sell as much of their year-end
    inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they
    had anticipated, their demand for additional product earlier in
    the following fiscal year may be curtailed, thus negatively
    impacting the Company’s revenues. In addition, the
    bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the Company’s
    significant retailers could negatively impact the Company’s
    future revenues.

The effect of inflation on the Company’s operations during
    2006 was not significant and the Company will continue its
    policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices, accordingly.

Other
    Information

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”
    (“FIN 48”), which applies to all tax positions
    accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”.
    FIN 48 prescribes a two step process for the measurement of
    uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to
    be taken in a tax return. The first step is a determination of
    whether the tax position should be recognized in the financial
    statements. The second step determines the measurement of the
    tax position. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
    derecognition of such tax positions, classification, interest
    and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure.
    FIN 48 was applicable to the Company as of January 1,
    2007, the first day of fiscal 2007. The adoption of FIN 48
    is expected to decrease the Company’s current liabilities
    and increase the Company’s long-term liabilities. Overall,
    tax liabilities are not expected to change by a material amount.



In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements”, (“SFAS No. 157”) which
    defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands
    disclosures about fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 is applicable for the Company as of
    December 31, 2007, the first day of fiscal 2008. The
    Company is currently evaluating SFAS No. 157 and the
    potential effect it will have on its consolidated balance sheet
    and results of operations.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 159, “The Fair Value Option
    for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”
    (“SFAS No. 159”). SFAS No. 159
    permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments
    and certain other items at fair value and establishes
    presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate
    comparisons between entities that choose different measurement
    attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities.
    SFAS No. 159 is effective for the Company beginning
    January 1, 2008. The Company has not yet determined the
    impact, if any, from the adoption of SFAS No. 159.

The Company is not aware of any material amounts of potential
    exposure relating to environmental matters and does not believe
    its environmental compliance costs or liabilities to be material
    to its operating results or financial position.

HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

(Thousands of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share
    Data)

(1)

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
    of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Hasbro, Inc. and all majority-owned subsidiaries
    (“Hasbro” or the “Company”). Investments
    representing 20% to 50% ownership interest in other companies
    are accounted for using the equity method. The Company had no
    equity method investments at December 31, 2006 that were
    material to the consolidated financial statements. All
    significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
    eliminated.

Preparation
    of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
    notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial
    statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2006
    presentation.

Fiscal
    Year

Hasbro’s fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in December.
    The fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 was a fifty-three
    week period while the fiscal years ended December 25, 2005
    and December 26, 2004 were fifty-two week periods.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and highly
    liquid investments purchased with a maturity to the Company of
    three months or less.

Marketable
    Securities

Marketable securities are comprised of investments in
    publicly-traded securities, classified as

available-for-sale,

and are recorded at market value with unrealized gains or
    losses, net of tax, reported as a component of accumulated other
    comprehensive earnings within shareholders’ equity until
    realized. Unrealized losses are evaluated to determine the
    nature of the losses. If the losses are determined to be other
    than temporary, the basis of the security is adjusted and the
    loss is recognized in earnings at that time. These securities
    are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheets.

Accounts
    Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Credit is granted to customers predominantly on an unsecured
    basis. Credit limits and payment terms are established based on
    extensive evaluations made on an ongoing basis throughout the
    fiscal year with regard to the financial performance, cash
    generation, financing availability and liquidity status of each
    customer. The majority of customers are reviewed at least
    annually; more frequent reviews are performed based on the
    customer’s financial condition and the level of credit
    being extended. For customers on credit who are experiencing
    financial difficulties, management performs additional financial
    analyses before shipping orders. The Company uses a variety of
    financial transactions based on availability and cost, to
    increase the collectibility of certain of its accounts,
    including letters of credit, credit insurance, factoring with
    unrelated third parties, and requiring cash in advance of
    shipping.



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share
    Data)

The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts at the
    time revenue is recognized based on management’s assessment
    of the business environment, customers’ financial
    condition, historical collection experience, accounts receivable
    aging and customer disputes. When a significant event occurs,
    such as a bankruptcy filing by a specific customer, and on a
    quarterly basis, the allowance is reviewed for adequacy and the
    balance or accrual rate is adjusted to reflect current risk
    prospects.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out) or market. Based upon a consideration of quantities
    on hand, actual and projected sales volume, anticipated product
    selling price and product lines planned to be discontinued,
    slow-moving and obsolete inventory is written down to its net
    realizable value.

At December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005, finished
    goods comprised 92% and 89% of inventories, respectively.

Long-Lived
    Assets

The Company’s long-lived assets consist of property, plant
    and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
    lives as well as other intangible assets the Company considers
    to have a defined life.

Goodwill results from purchase method acquisitions the Company
    has made over time. Substantially all of the other intangibles
    consist of the cost of acquired product rights. In establishing
    the value of such rights, the Company considers, but does not
    individually value, existing trademarks, copyrights, patents,
    license agreements and other product-related rights. These
    rights were valued at their acquisition date based on the
    anticipated future cash flows from the underlying product line.
    The Company has certain intangible assets related to the Tonka
    and Milton Bradley acquisitions that have an indefinite life,
    and amortization of these assets has been suspended until a
    remaining useful life can be determined.

Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives
    are not amortized and are tested for impairment at least
    annually. The annual test begins with goodwill and all
    intangible assets being allocated to applicable reporting units.
    Goodwill is then tested using a two-step process that begins
    with an estimation of fair value of the reporting unit using an
    income approach, which looks to the present value of expected
    future cash flows. The first step is a screen for potential
    impairment while the second step measures the amount of
    impairment if there is an indication from the first step that
    one exists. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested
    annually for impairment by comparing their carrying value to
    their estimated fair value, also calculated using the present
    value of expected future cash flows.

The remaining intangibles having defined lives are being
    amortized over three to twenty-five years, primarily using the
    straight-line method. Approximately 9% of other intangibles
    relate to rights acquired in connection with a major motion
    picture entertainment property and are being amortized over the
    contract life, in proportion to projected sales of the licensed
    products during the same period.

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less
    accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and
    amortization are computed using accelerated and straight-line
    methods to amortize the cost of property, plant and equipment
    over their estimated useful lives. The principal lives, in
    years, used in determining depreciation rates of various assets
    are: land improvements 15 to 19, buildings and improvements
    15 to 25 and machinery and equipment 3 to 12. Tools, dies and
    molds are amortized over a three-year period or their useful
    lives, whichever is less, using an accelerated method. The
    Company generally owns all tools, dies and molds related to its
    products.

The Company reviews property, plant and equipment and other
    intangibles with defined lives for impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be
    recoverable.



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share
    Data)

Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying
    amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows
    expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets were
    considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized would
    be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the
    assets exceeds their fair value. Fair value is determined based
    on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending on the
    nature of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the
    lower of the net book value or their fair value less disposal
    costs.

Financial
    Instruments

Hasbro’s financial instruments include cash and cash
    equivalents, accounts receivable, marketable securities, short-
    and long-term borrowings, accounts payable and accrued
    liabilities. At December 31, 2006, the carrying cost of
    these instruments approximated their fair value, with the
    exception of the Company’s contingent convertible
    debentures due 2021. At December 31, 2006, these debentures
    had a carrying value of $249,996 and an approximate fair value
    of $318,700. The Company’s financial instruments also
    include foreign currency forwards (see note 13) as
    well as interest rate swap agreements (see note 7). At
    December 31, 2006, the carrying value of these instruments
    approximated their fair value based on quoted or publicly
    available market information.

Securitization
    and Transfer of Financial Instruments

Hasbro has an agreement that allows the Company to sell, on an
    ongoing basis, an undivided interest in certain of its trade
    accounts receivable through a revolving securitization
    arrangement. The Company retains servicing responsibilities for,
    as well as a subordinate interest in the transferred
    receivables. Hasbro accounts for the securitization of trade
    accounts receivable as a sale in accordance with
    SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and
    Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of
    Liabilities” (“SFAS 140”). As a result, the
    related receivables are removed from the consolidated balance
    sheet.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue from product sales is recognized upon the passing of
    title to the customer, generally at the time of shipment.
    Provisions for discounts, rebates and returns are made when the
    related revenues are recognized. The Company bases its estimates
    for discounts, rebates and returns on agreed customer terms and
    historical experience.

The Company enters into arrangements licensing its brand names
    on specifically approved products. The licensees pay the Company
    royalties as products are sold, in some cases subject to annual
    minimum guaranteed amounts. Royalty revenues are recognized as
    they are reported as earned and payment becomes assured, over
    the life of the agreement. Revenue from product sales less
    related provisions for discounts, rebates and returns, as well
    as royalty revenues comprise net revenues in the consolidated
    statements of operations.

Royalties

The Company enters into license agreements with inventors,
    designers and others for the use of intellectual properties in
    its products. These agreements may call for payment in advance
    or future payment for minimum guaranteed amounts. Amounts paid
    in advance are recorded as an asset and charged to expense as
    revenue from the related products is recognized. If all or a
    portion of the minimum guaranteed amounts appear not to be
    recoverable through future use of the rights obtained under
    license, the nonrecoverable portion of the guaranty is charged
    to expense at that time.



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share
    Data)

Advertising

Production costs of commercials and programming are charged to
    operations in the fiscal year during which the production is
    first aired. The costs of other advertising, promotion and
    marketing programs are charged to operations in the fiscal year
    incurred.

Shipping
    and Handling

Hasbro expenses costs related to the shipment and handling of
    goods to customers as incurred. For 2006, 2005, and 2004, these
    costs were $145,729, $144,953 and $144,620, respectively, and
    are included in selling, distribution and administration
    expenses.

Operating
    Leases

Hasbro records lease expense in such a manner as to recognize
    this expense on a straight-line basis inclusive of rent
    concessions and rent increases. Reimbursements from lessors for
    leasehold improvements are deferred and recognized as a
    reduction to lease expense over the lease term.

Income
    Taxes

Hasbro uses the asset and liability approach for financial
    accounting and reporting of income taxes. Deferred income taxes
    have not been provided on undistributed earnings of
    international subsidiaries as substantially all of such earnings
    are indefinitely reinvested by the Company.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into
    U.S. dollars at period-end rates, and revenues, costs and
    expenses are translated at weighted average rates during each
    reporting period. Earnings include gains or losses resulting
    from foreign currency transactions and, when required,
    translation gains and losses resulting from the use of the
    U.S. dollar as the functional currency in highly
    inflationary economies. Other gains and losses resulting from
    translation of financial statements are a component of other
    comprehensive earnings.

Pension
    Plans, Postretirement and Postemployment
    Benefits

Hasbro, except for certain international subsidiaries, has
    pension plans covering substantially all of its full-time
    employees. Pension expense is based on actuarial computations of
    current and future benefits. In December 2006, the Company
    adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined
    Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans”
    (“SFAS 158”), which amends SFAS 87, 88, 106
    and 132(R). See footnotes 2 and 11 for the impact of
    adoption of this statement.

The Company’s policy is to fund amounts which are required
    by applicable regulations and which are tax deductible. In 2007,
    the Company expects to contribute approximately $7,100 to its
    pension plans. The estimated amounts of future payments to be
    made under other retirement programs are being accrued currently
    over the period of active employment and are also included in
    pension expense.

Hasbro has a contributory postretirement health and life
    insurance plan covering substantially all employees who retire
    under any of its United States defined benefit pension plans and
    meet certain age and length of service requirements. It also has
    several plans covering certain groups of employees, which may
    provide benefits to such employees following their period of
    employment but prior to their retirement. The Company measures
    the costs of these obligations based on actuarial computations.



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share
    Data)

Risk
    Management Contracts

Hasbro uses foreign currency forward and option contracts,
    generally purchased for terms of not more than eighteen months,
    to mitigate the impact of adverse currency rate fluctuations on
    firmly committed and projected future foreign currency
    transactions. These

over-the-counter

contracts, which hedge future purchases of inventory and other
    cross-border currency requirements not denominated in the
    functional currency of the unit, are primarily denominated in
    United States and Hong Kong dollars, Euros and United Kingdom
    pound sterling and are entered into with counterparties who are
    major financial institutions. The Company believes any risk
    related to default by a counterparty to be remote. Hasbro does
    not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative
    purposes.

At the inception of the contracts, Hasbro designates its
    derivatives as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The
    Company formally documents all relationships between hedging
    instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management
    objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge
    transactions. All hedges designated as cash flow hedges are
    linked to forecasted transactions and the Company assesses, both
    at the inception of the hedge and on an on-going basis, the
    effectiveness of the derivatives used in hedging transactions in
    offsetting changes in the cash flows of the forecasted
    transaction. The ineffective portion of a hedging derivative, if
    any, is immediately recognized in the consolidated statements of
    operations.

The Company records all derivatives, such as foreign currency
    exchange contracts, on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes
    in the derivative fair values that are designated effective and
    qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred and recorded as a
    component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings
    (“AOCE”) until the hedged transactions occur and are
    then recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.
    The Company’s foreign currency contracts hedging
    anticipated cash flows are designated as cash flow hedges. When
    it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a
    hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively.
    Any gain or loss deferred through that date remains in AOCE
    until the forecasted transaction occurs, at which time it is
    reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations. To
    the extent the transaction is no longer deemed probable of
    occurring, hedge accounting treatment is discontinued
    prospectively and amounts deferred would be reclassified to the
    consolidated statements of operations. In the event hedge
    accounting requirements are not met, gains and losses on such
    instruments are included currently in the consolidated
    statements of operations. The Company uses derivatives to hedge
    intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies. Due to the
    short-term nature of the contracts involved, the Company does
    not use hedge accounting for these contracts.

The Company also uses interest rate swap agreements to adjust
    the amount of long-term debt subject to fixed interest rates.
    The interest rate swaps are matched with specific long-term debt
    obligations and are designated and effective as fair value
    hedges of the change in fair value of those debt obligations.
    These agreements are recorded at their fair value as an asset or
    liability. Gains and losses on these contracts are included
    currently in the consolidated statements of operations and are
    wholly offset by changes in the fair value of the related
    long-term debt. These hedges are considered to be perfectly
    effective under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities,” as amended by Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 138 (collectively
    “SFAS 133”). The interest rate swap contracts are
    with a number of major financial institutions in order to
    minimize counterparty credit risk. The Company believes that it
    is unlikely that any of its counterparties will be unable to
    perform under the terms of the contracts.

Accounting
    for Stock-Based Compensation

At December 31, 2006, the Company had stock-based employee
    compensation plans and plans for non-employee members of the
    Company’s Board of Directors, which are described more
    fully in note 10. Effective December 26, 2005, the
    first day of fiscal 2006, the Company adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting

(Thousands of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share
    Data)

Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based
    Payment” (“SFAS 123R”), which amends
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, as
    amended by No. 148, and Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows”. The
    Company adopted SFAS 123R under the modified prospective
    basis as defined in the statement. In 2006, the Company recorded
    stock option expense based on all unvested stock options as of
    the adoption date as well as all stock-based compensation awards
    granted subsequent to the adoption date. See footnote 10
    for further information related to the adoption of this
    statement. Prior to 2006, as permitted by Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 123, as amended by No. 148,
    “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”,
    (collectively “SFAS 123”), Hasbro accounted for
    those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of
    Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
    “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”, and
    related interpretations. As required by the Company’s
    existing stock plans, stock options are granted at or above the
    fair market value of the Company’s stock and, accordingly,
    no compensation expense was recognized for these grants in the
    consolidated statements of operations in 2005 and 2004.

Had compensation expense been recorded under the fair value
    method as set forth in the provisions of SFAS 123 for stock
    options awarded, the impact on the Company’s net earnings
    and earnings per share for 2005 and 2004 would have been:

Earnings
    Per Common Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings by
    the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the year.
    Diluted earnings per share is similar except that the weighted
    average number of shares outstanding is increased by dilutive
    securities, and net earnings are adjusted for certain amounts
    related to dilutive securities. Dilutive securities include
    shares issuable under convertible debt, as well as shares
    issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants for which
    market price exceeds exercise price, less shares which could
    have been purchased by the Company with the related proceeds.
    Dilutive securities may also include shares potentially issuable
    to settle liabilities. Options and warrants totaling 5,148,
    6,018 and 10,207 for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, were
    excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share
    because to include them would have been antidilutive.

In December 2004, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force
    (“EITF”) Issue

04-8,

“The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on
    Diluted Earnings per Share”, which states that the dilutive
    effect of contingent convertible debt instruments must be
    included in dilutive earnings per share regardless of whether
    the triggering contingency has been satisfied. The earnings per
    share calculations for the three years ended December 31,
    2006 include adjustments to add back to earnings the interest
    expense, net of tax, incurred on the Company’s Senior
    Convertible Debentures due 2021, as well as add back to
    outstanding shares the amount of shares potentially issuable as
    if the contingent conversion features were met.

Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments
    with Characteristics of Liabilities and Equity”
    (note 6), certain warrants containing a put feature that
    may be settled in cash or common stock are required to be
    accounted for as a liability at fair value. The Company is
    required to assess if these warrants, classified as a liability,
    have a more dilutive impact on earnings per share when treated
    as an equity contract. As of December 31, 2006, the
    warrants had a more dilutive impact on earnings per share
    assuming they were treated as a liability and no adjustments to
    net earnings or equivalent shares was required. As of
    December 25, 2005 and December 26, 2004, the warrants
    had a more dilutive impact on earnings per share assuming they
    were treated as an equity contract. Accordingly for those years,
    the numerator includes an adjustment to earnings for the income
    included therein related to the fair market value adjustment and
    the denominator includes an adjustment for the shares issuable
    as of those dates.

Reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive earnings
    to earnings in 2006, 2005 and 2004 were net of related income
    taxes of $85, $89, and $1,724, respectively. The
    reclassification adjustments for 2006 and 2004 includes an
    impairment charge relating to other than temporary decreases in
    the value of the Company’s

available-for-sale

securities. In accordance with Hasbro’s marketable
    securities accounting policy, as the result of the decline in
    the fair value of the Company’s investment in Infogrames
    Entertainment SA common stock, the Company adjusted the basis of
    this investment and recorded a pretax charge to earnings in the
    amounts of $2,629 and $8,988 in 2006 and 2004, respectively. The
    remainder of the reclassification adjustments in 2006 and 2004,
    as well as the 2005 reclassification adjustment, include net
    losses on cash flow hedging derivatives for which the related
    transaction has impacted earnings and was reflected in cost of
    sales.

The related tax benefit (expense) of other comprehensive
    earnings items was $273, $3,960, and $(283) for the years 2006,
    2005, and 2004, respectively.

At December 31, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 158,
    which required the Company to recognize the over or underfunded
    status of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as an
    asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to
    recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the
    changes occur through comprehensive income. The adoption of this
    statement resulted in an adjustment of $(26,750) to accumulated
    other comprehensive income at December 31, 2006.

Goodwill
    and Intangibles

Goodwill and certain intangible assets relating to rights
    obtained in the Company’s acquisition of Milton Bradley in
    1984 and Tonka in 1991 are not amortized. These rights were
    determined to have indefinite lives and total approximately
    $75,700. The Company’s other intangible assets are
    amortized over their remaining useful lives, and accumulated
    amortization of these other intangibles is reflected in other
    intangibles, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

The Company performs an annual impairment test for goodwill and
    intangible assets with indefinite lives. This annual impairment
    test is performed in the fourth quarter of the Company’s
    fiscal year. In addition, if an event occurs or circumstances
    change that indicate that the carrying value may not be
    recoverable, the Company will perform an interim impairment test
    at that time. For the three fiscal years ended December 31,
    2006, no such events occurred. The Company completed its annual
    impairment tests in the fourth quarters of 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    which indicated that there was no impairment.

A portion of the Company’s goodwill and other intangible
    assets reside in the Corporate segment of the business. For
    purposes of testing pursuant to Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 142, these assets are allocated to
    the reporting units within the Company’s operating
    segments. In 2006, the Company realigned its business, which
    resulted in a change in the Company’s operating segments
    (see note 15). The Company has adjusted its prior year
    information to reflect the current reporting structure and
    reallocated Corporate segment amounts. Changes in carrying
    amount of goodwill, by operating segment for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005 are as follows:

On September 9, 2005, the Company purchased the assets and
    assumed certain liabilities of Wrebbit Inc., a Montreal-based
    creator and manufacturer of innovative puzzles. The purchase
    price was approximately $14,200. Based on the allocation of the
    purchase price, property rights related to acquired product
    lines of approximately $10,900 were recorded in connection with
    this acquisition. These property rights are being amortized over
    a ten year life. No goodwill was recorded as a result of this
    acquisition.

During June 2005, the Company reacquired the digital gaming
    rights for all its owned or controlled properties from
    Infogrames Entertainment SA (Infogrames) for $65,000. These
    rights were previously held by Infogrames on an exclusive basis
    as a result of a license agreement entered into during 2000 with
    an expiration date in 2016. The consideration paid to reacquire
    these rights, which represents fair value, is included as a
    component of acquired product rights and is being amortized over
    a

10-year

period. In addition, the Company and Infogrames entered into a
    new licensing agreement that provides Infogrames exclusive
    rights to DUNGEONS & DRAGONS and rights to nine other
    properties for a limited number of platforms. Under the new
    license agreement, the Company will receive royalty income on
    Infogrames sales.

The Company will continue to incur amortization expense related
    to the use of acquired and licensed rights to produce various
    products. The amortization of these product rights will
    fluctuate depending on related projected revenues during an
    annual period, as well as rights reaching the end of their
    useful lives. The Company currently estimates continuing
    amortization expense for the next five years to be approximately:

Financing
    Arrangements

Short-Term
    Borrowings

At December 31, 2006, Hasbro had available an unsecured
    committed line and unsecured uncommitted lines of credit from
    various banks approximating $300,000 and $203,600, respectively.
    A significant portion of the short-term borrowings outstanding
    at the end of 2006 and 2005 represents borrowings made under, or
    supported by, these lines of credit. The weighted average
    interest rates of the outstanding borrowings as of
    December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005 were 4.7% and
    4.2%, respectively. The Company had no borrowings outstanding
    under its committed line of credit at December 31, 2006.
    During 2006, Hasbro’s working capital needs were fulfilled
    by cash generated from operations, the Company’s accounts
    receivable

    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to

    Data)

securitization program, and borrowing under lines of credit.
    Borrowings under the lines of credit were on terms and at
    interest rates generally extended to companies of comparable
    creditworthiness.

In June 2006, the Company entered into a five-year revolving
    credit agreement (the “Agreement”) which replaced the
    prior amended and restated credit agreement. The Agreement
    provides the Company with a $300,000 committed borrowing
    facility. The Company has the ability to request increases in
    the committed facility in additional increments of at least
    $50,000, up to a total committed facility of $500,000. The
    Company is not required to maintain compensating balances under
    the Agreement. The Agreement contains certain financial
    covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and
    certain other limitations typical of an investment grade
    facility, including with respect to liens, mergers and
    incurrence of indebtedness. The Company was in compliance with
    all covenants as of and for the year ended December 31,
    2006.

The Company pays a fee (currently .10%) based on the unused
    portion of the facility and interest equal to Libor or Prime
    plus a spread on borrowings under the facility. The amount of
    the spread to Libor or Prime varies based on the Company’s
    long-term debt ratings and the Company’s leverage. At
    December 31, 2006, the interest rate under the facility was
    equal to Libor plus 0.50% or Prime.

Securitization

As of December 31, 2006, the Company is party to a
    receivable securitization program whereby the Company sells, on
    an ongoing basis, substantially all of its U.S. trade
    accounts receivable to a bankruptcy-remote, special purpose
    subsidiary, Hasbro Receivables Funding, LLC (HRF), which is
    wholly owned and consolidated by the Company. HRF will, subject
    to certain conditions, sell, from time to time on a revolving
    basis, an undivided fractional ownership interest in up to
    $250,000 of eligible domestic receivables to various multi-party
    commercial paper conduits supported by a committed liquidity
    facility. Under the terms of the agreement, new receivables are
    added to the pool as collections reduce previously held
    receivables. The Company expects to service, administer, and
    collect the receivables on behalf of HRF and the conduits. The
    net proceeds of sale will be less than the face amount of
    accounts receivable sold by an amount that approximates the
    purchaser’s financing costs. In December 2006, this
    agreement was amended. Under the amended agreement, the
    expiration date is December 1, 2011, subject to an annual
    renewal process. Also under the amended agreement, the maximum
    aggregate outstanding purchase limit for interest in receivables
    which may be sold is raised to $300,000 during the period from
    fiscal October to fiscal January of each year.

The receivables facility contains certain restrictions on the
    Company and HRF that are customary for facilities of this type.
    The commitments under the facility are subject to termination
    prior to their term upon the occurrence of certain events,
    including payment defaults, breach of covenants, breach of
    representations or warranties, bankruptcy, and failure of the
    receivables to satisfy certain performance criteria.

As of December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005 the
    utilization of the receivables facility on both dates was
    $250,000, which was the maximum available to the Company to sell
    under this program at December 25, 2005. As of
    December 31, 2006, the Company had an additional $50,000
    available to sell under the facility. The transactions are
    accounted for as sales under SFAS 140. During 2006 and
    2005, the loss on the sale of the receivables totaled $2,241 and
    $6,925, respectively, which is recorded in selling, distribution
    and administration expenses in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of operations. The discount on interests sold is
    approximately equal to the interest rate paid by the conduits to
    the holders of the commercial paper plus other fees. The
    discount rate as of December 31, 2006 was approximately
    5.73%.

Upon sale to the conduits, HRF continues to hold a subordinated
    retained interest in the receivables. The subordinated interest
    in receivables is recorded at fair value, which is determined
    based on the present value of future expected cash flows
    estimated using management’s best estimates of credit
    losses and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved.
    Due to the short-term nature of trade receivables, the carrying
    amount,

    credit and discount assumptions would not significantly impact
    fair value.

The Company currently has a warrant amendment agreement with

    Company with a call option through October 13, 2016 to
    purchase all of these warrants from Lucas for a price to be paid
    at the Company’s election of either $200,000 in cash or the
    equivalent of $220,000 in shares of the Company’s common
    stock, such stock being valued at the time of the exercise of
    the option. Also, the warrant amendment agreement provides Lucas
    with a put option through January 2008 to sell all of these
    warrants to the Company for a price to be paid at the
    Company’s election of either $100,000 in cash or the
    equivalent of $110,000 in shares of the Company’s common
    stock, such stock being valued at the time of the exercise of
    the option.

The Company adjusts these warrants to their fair value through
    earnings at the end of each reporting period. During 2006, 2005,
    and 2004, the Company recorded (income) expense of $31,770,
    $(2,080), and $(12,710), respectively, to adjust the warrants to
    their fair value. This (income) expense is included in other
    (income) expense, net in the consolidated statement of
    operations. There is no tax benefit or expense associated with
    the fair value adjustments.

Should either the put or call option be required to be settled,
    the Company believes that it will have adequate funds available
    to settle them in cash if necessary. Had this option been
    exercised at December 31, 2006 and the Company had elected
    to settle this option in the Company’s stock, the Company
    would have been required to issue 4,078 shares. If the
    share price of the Company’s common stock were higher as of
    December 31, 2006 the number of shares issuable would have
    decreased. If the share price were lower as of December 31,
    2006, the number of shares issuable would have increased.

In 2006, the Company repaid in principal amount $32,743 of
    8.50% Notes due in March 2006.

During 2004, the Company repurchased an aggregate of $55,658 in
    principal amount of long-term debt, comprised of $19,105 in
    principal amount of 6.60% Debentures due 2028, $10,908 in
    principal amount of 6.15% Notes due 2008, and $25,645 in
    principal amount of 5.60% Notes due 2005. The Company
    recorded a loss on repurchase of $1,277, which is included in
    other (income) expense, net in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of operations.

The Company is party to interest rate swap agreements in order
    to adjust the amount of total debt that is subject to fixed
    interest rates. The interest rate swaps are matched with
    specific long-term debt obligations and accounted for as fair
    value hedges of those debt obligations. At December 31,
    2006, these interest rate swaps had a total notional amount of
    $75,000 with maturities in 2008. In each of the contracts, the
    Company receives payments based upon a fixed interest rate that
    matches the interest rate of the debt being hedged and makes
    payments based upon a floating rate based on Libor. These
    contracts are designated and effective as hedges of the change
    in the fair value of the associated debt. At December 31,
    2006, these contracts had unrealized losses of $66, which are
    included in other liabilities, with a corresponding fair value
    adjustment to decrease long-term debt.

The Company currently has $249,996 outstanding in principal
    amount of contingent convertible debentures due 2021. These
    debentures bear interest at 2.75%, which could be subject to an
    upward adjustment commencing in December 2005 depending on the
    price of the Company’s stock. If the closing price of the
    Company’s stock exceeds $23.76 for at least 20 trading
    days, within the 30 consecutive trading

day period ending on the last trading day of the calendar
    quarter, the holders have the right to convert the notes to
    shares of the Company’s common stock at the initial
    conversion price of $21.60 in the next calendar quarter. At
    December 31, 2006, this contingent conversion feature was
    met and the debentures are convertible through March 31,
    2007, at which time the contingent conversion feature will be
    reassessed. In addition, if the closing price of the
    Company’s stock exceeds $27.00 for at least 20 trading days
    in any 30 day period, the Company has the right to call the
    debentures by giving notice to the holders of the debentures.
    During a prescribed notice period, the holders of the debentures
    have the right to convert their debentures in accordance with
    the conversion terms described above. The holders of these
    debentures may also put the notes back to Hasbro in December
    2011 and December 2016. At these times, the purchase price may
    be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the
    two, at the discretion of the Company.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
    (the “Act”) was signed into law. The Act created a
    one-time incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate
    undistributed earnings from their international subsidiaries by
    providing an 85% dividends-received deduction for certain
    international earnings. The deduction was available to
    corporations during the tax year that includes October 22,
    2004 or in the immediately subsequent tax year. In the fourth
    quarter of 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors approved
    a plan to repatriate approximately $547,000 in foreign earnings,
    which was completed in December 2005. The tax expense related to
    this repatriation was $25,844.

Certain tax benefits (expenses) are not reflected in income
    taxes in the statements of operations. Such benefits of $27,876
    in 2006, $8,426 in 2005, and $6,675 in 2004, relate primarily to
    stock options. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, the deferred tax portion
    of the total benefit (expense) was $12,917, $4,563, and $(283),
    respectively.

Hasbro has a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets at
    December 31, 2006 of $27,808, which is an increase of
    $4,475 from $23,333 at December 25, 2005. The valuation
    allowance pertains to United States and International loss
    carryforwards, some of which have no expiration and others that
    would expire beginning in 2007. The increase in the valuation
    allowance is primarily attributable to the investment in
    Infogrames Entertainment S.A. If the operating loss
    carryforwards are fully realized, $210 will reduce goodwill and
    the balance will reduce future income tax expense.

Based on Hasbro’s history of taxable income and the
    anticipation of sufficient taxable income in years when the
    temporary differences are expected to become tax deductions, it
    believes that it will realize the benefit of the deferred tax
    assets, net of the existing valuation allowance.

Deferred income taxes of $83,854 and $103,209 at the end of 2006
    and 2005, respectively, are included as a component of prepaid
    expenses and other current assets, and $66,276 and $58,075,
    respectively, are included as a component of other assets. At
    the same dates, deferred income taxes of $122 and $200,
    respectively, are included as a component of accrued
    liabilities, and $1,839 and $1,630, respectively, are included
    as a component of other liabilities.

The cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of Hasbro’s
    international subsidiaries held for reinvestment is
    approximately $625,000 at December 31, 2006. In the event
    that all international undistributed earnings were remitted to
    the United States, the amount of incremental taxes would be
    approximately $135,000.

In June of 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation
    No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes” (“FIN 48”), which applies to all tax
    positions accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standard No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”.
    FIN 48 prescribes a two step process for the measurement of
    uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to
    be taken in a tax return. The first step is a determination of
    whether the tax position should be recognized in the financial
    statements. The second step determines the measurement of the
    tax position. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
    derecognition of such tax positions, classification, interest
    and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure.
    FIN 48 was applicable to the Company as of January 1,
    2007, the first day of fiscal 2007. The adoption of FIN 48
    is expected to decrease the Company’s current liabilities
    and increase the Company’s long-term liabilities. Overall,
    tax liabilities are not expected to change by a material amount.

Preference
    Share Purchase Rights

Hasbro maintains a Preference Share Purchase Rights Plan (the
    “Rights Plan”). Under the terms of the Rights Plan,
    each share of common stock is accompanied by a Preference Share
    Purchase Right (“Right”). Each Right is only
    exercisable under certain circumstances and, until exercisable,
    the Rights are not transferable apart from Hasbro’s common
    stock. When exercisable, each Right will entitle its holder to
    purchase until June 30, 2009, in certain merger or other
    business combination or recapitalization transactions, at the
    Right’s then current exercise price, a number of the
    acquiring company’s or Hasbro’s, as the case may be,
    common shares having a market value at that time of twice the
    Right’s exercise price. Under certain circumstances, the
    Company may substitute cash, other assets, equity securities or
    debt securities for the common stock. At the option of the Board
    of Directors of Hasbro (“the Board”), the rightholder
    may, under certain circumstances, receive shares of
    Hasbro’s stock in exchange for Rights.

Prior to the acquisition by a person or group of beneficial
    ownership of a certain percentage of Hasbro’s common stock,
    the Rights are redeemable for $.01 per Right. The Rights Plan
    contains certain exceptions with respect to the Hassenfeld
    family and related entities.

Common
    Stock

In May 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
    the repurchase of up to $350,000 in common stock. In 2006, the
    remaining portion of this authorization was fully utilized and
    an additional $350,000 was authorized by the Board of Directors
    in July 2006. Purchases of the Company’s common stock may
    be made from time to time, subject to market conditions, and may
    be made in the open market or through privately negotiated
    transactions. The Company has no obligation to repurchase shares
    under the authorization and the timing, actual number, and the
    value of the shares which are repurchased will depend on a
    number of factors, including the price of the Company’s
    common stock. These authorizations replace all prior
    authorizations. In 2006, the Company repurchased
    22,767 shares at an average price of $20.03. The total cost
    of these repurchases, including transaction costs, was $456,744.

Stock
    Options, Restricted Stock and Warrants

Hasbro has reserved 19,291 shares of its common stock for
    issuance upon exercise of options and the grant of other awards
    granted or to be granted under stock incentive plans for
    employees and for non-employee members of the Board of Directors
    (collectively, the “plans”). These options generally
    vest in equal annual amounts over three to five years. The plans
    provide that options be granted at exercise prices not less than
    fair market value on the date the option is granted and options
    are adjusted for such changes as stock splits and stock
    dividends. Generally, options are exercisable for periods of no
    more than ten years after date of grant. Certain of the plans
    permit the granting of awards in the form of stock options,
    stock appreciation rights, stock awards and cash awards in
    addition to options. Upon exercise in the case of stock options,
    grant in the case of restricted stock or vesting in the case of
    performance based contingent stock grants, shares are issued out
    of available treasury shares. Additionally, the Company has
    reserved 17,450 shares of its common stock for issuance
    upon exercise of outstanding warrants.

The Company on occasion will issue restricted stock and grant
    deferred restricted stock units to certain key employees. In
    2006, the Company issued restricted stock of 20 shares. No
    restricted stock or deferred restricted stock awards were
    granted in 2005 or 2004. These shares or units are
    nontransferable and subject to forfeiture for periods prescribed
    by the Company. These awards are valued at the market value at
    the date of grant and are subsequently amortized over the
    periods during which the restrictions lapse, generally
    3 years. Amortization of unearned compensation expense
    relating to the outstanding restricted stock and deferred
    restricted stock was $158, $74, and $138 in fiscal 2006, 2005,
    and 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2006, the amount of
    total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock
    is $293 and the weighted average period over which this will be
    expensed is 24.5 months.

In July 2006, as part of its annual equity grant to executive
    officers and certain other employees, the Company’s Board
    of Directors approved the issuance of contingent stock
    performance awards (the “Stock Performance Awards”),
    which provide the recipients with the ability to earn shares of
    the Company’s common stock based on the Company’s
    achievement of stated cumulative diluted earnings per share and
    cumulative net revenue targets over a ten quarter period
    beginning July 3, 2006 and ending December 28, 2008.
    Each Stock Performance Award has a target number of shares of
    common stock associated with such award which may be earned by
    the recipient if the Company achieves the stated diluted
    earnings per share and revenue targets. The Compensation
    Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors has
    discretionary power to reduce the amount of the award regardless
    of whether the stated targets are met. If the Company achieves
    100% of the stated targets, it would expect to issue
    738 shares under these awards.

During 2006, the Company recognized $2,390 of expense relating
    to these awards. If minimum targets, as detailed under the
    award, are not met, no additional compensation cost will be
    recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost will
    be reversed. These awards were valued at the market value at the
    date of grant and are being amortized over the 10 quarter period
    from July 3, 2006 through December 28, 2008. The

weighted average grant-date fair value of each Stock Performance
    Awards was $19.00. Forfeitures of these awards during 2006 were
    24. At December 31, 2006, the amount of total unrecognized
    compensation cost related to these awards is approximately
    $11,317 and the weighted average period over which this will be
    expensed is 24 months.

Prior to fiscal 2006, Hasbro used the intrinsic-value method of
    accounting for stock options granted to employees and
    non-employee members of the Board of Directors. Effective
    December 26, 2005, the first day of fiscal 2006, the
    Company adopted SFAS 123R under the modified prospective
    transition method as defined in the statement. Under this
    adoption method, the Company recorded stock option expense in
    2006 based on all unvested stock options as of the adoption date
    and any stock option awards made subsequent to the adoption
    date. Stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-line
    basis over the requisite service period of the award. In
    accordance with the modified prospective transition method, the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements for prior years
    have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the
    impact of SFAS 123R.

Total compensation expense related to stock options and the
    stock performance awards recognized under SFAS 123R for the

The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model in
    determining fair value of stock-based awards. The weighted
    average fair value of options granted in fiscal 2006, 2005 and
    2004 were $4.26, $5.41 and $6.32, respectively. The fair value
    of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted

    2004 were $46,684, $16,898 and $11,113, respectively.

In addition to the above, the Company currently has 17,450
    warrants outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2006,
    which have a weighted average exercise price, weighted average
    remaining life and intrinsic value at December 31, 2006 of
    $20.11, 11.46 years, and $124,624, respectively.

At December 31, 2006, the amount of total unrecognized
    compensation cost related to stock options is $20,008 and the
    weighted average period over which this will be expensed is
    21.9 months.

In May 2006, the Company granted 52 shares of common stock
    to its non-employee members of its Board of Directors, of which
    the receipt of 43 shares have been deferred to the date
    upon which the respective director ceases to be a member of the
    Company’s Board of Directors. This award was valued at the

    Plans”, (“SFAS No. 158”) which amends
    Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, 88,
    106 and 132R. Under SFAS No. 158, the Company is
    required to recognize on its balance sheet actuarial gains and
    losses and prior service costs that have not yet been included
    in income as an adjustment of equity through other comprehensive
    earnings with a corresponding adjustment to prepaid pension
    expense or the accrued pension liability. In addition, within
    two years of adoption, the measurement date for plan assets and
    liabilities would be required to be the Company’s fiscal
    year end. SFAS No. 158 was effective for the Company
    in the fourth quarter of 2006. The effect of this statement on
    the Company’s defined benefit pension and postretirement
    plans was an increase in accrued pension liability of $36,287, a
    decrease in intangible assets of $3,108, an increase in deferred
    tax assets of $12,645 and a decrease in accumulated other
    comprehensive earnings, net of tax, of $26,750.

Expense related to the Company’s defined benefit and
    defined contribution plans for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were
    approximately $31,100, $28,800, and $26,300, respectively. Of
    these amounts, $15,400, $13,900 and $12,100 related to defined
    contribution plans in the United States and certain
    international affiliates. The remainder of the expense relates
    to defined benefit plans discussed below.

United
    States Plans

Substantially all United States employees are covered under at
    least one of several non-contributory defined benefit pension
    plans maintained by the Company. Benefits under the two major
    plans which principally cover non-union employees, are based
    primarily on salary and years of service. One of these major
    plans is funded. Benefits under the remaining plans are based
    primarily on fixed amounts for specified years of service. Of
    these remaining plans, the plan covering union employees is also
    funded. At September 30, 2006, the measurement date, all
    individual plans had projected and accumulated benefit
    obligations in excess of the fair value of each plan’s
    assets. By the fiscal year ending December 28, 2008, the
    Company will be required under SFAS 158 to change the
    measurement dates for its pension plans to its fiscal year-end.

Hasbro also provides certain postretirement health care and life
    insurance benefits to eligible employees who retire and have
    either attained age 65 with 5 years of service or
    age 55 with 10 years of service. The cost of providing
    these benefits on behalf of employees who retired prior to 1993
    is and will continue to be substantially borne by the Company.
    The cost of providing benefits on behalf of substantially all
    employees who retire after 1992 is borne by the employee. The
    plan is not funded.

Of the pension amount recognized at December 31, 2006,
    $3,065 is recognized in current liabilities and the remaining
    $44,941 is recognized in non-current liabilities. Of the
    postretirement amount recognized at December 31, 2006,
    $2,396 is recognized in current liabilities and the remaining
    $33,343 is recognized in non-current liabilities.

In connection with the adoption of SFAS 158 at
    December 31, 2006 described above, the Company’s
    unamortized prior service costs of $2,954 and unrecognized net
    loss of $66,781 were recorded as a reduction of accumulated
    other comprehensive earnings. In fiscal 2007, the Company
    expects amortization of $592 and $2,914, respectively, of these
    amounts to be included as a component of net periodic benefit
    cost.

The provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Pensions”, prior to the statement being amended by
    SFAS 158, required the Company to record an additional
    minimum pension liability for certain of the Company’s
    plans of $53,329 at December 25, 2005. This liability
    represented the amount by which the accumulated benefit
    obligation exceeds the sum of the fair market value of plan
    assets and accrued amounts previously recorded. The additional
    minimum pension liability was offset by an intangible asset to
    the extent of previously unrecognized prior service cost. An
    intangible asset in the amount of $3,550 is included in other
    intangibles on the balance sheet as of December 25, 2005.
    The remaining amount of $49,779 was recorded as components of
    accumulated other comprehensive earnings, along with related
    deferred taxes of $18,916 at December 25, 2005.

The assets of the funded plans are managed by investment

Hasbro’s two major funded plans (the “Plans”) are
    defined benefit pension plans intended to provide retirement
    benefits to participants in accordance with the benefit
    structure established by the Company. The Plans’ investment
    managers, who exercise full investment discretion within
    guidelines outlined in the Plans’ Investment Policy, are
    charged with managing the assets with the care, skill, prudence
    and diligence that a prudent investment professional in similar
    circumstance would exercise. Investment practices, at a minimum,
    must comply with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
    (ERISA) and any other applicable laws and regulations.

The Plans’ shared primary investment goal is maximum total
    return, consistent with prudent investment management. The
    Plans’ asset allocations are structured to meet a long-term
    targeted total return consistent with the ongoing nature of the
    Plans’ liabilities. The shared long-term total return goal,
    presently 8.75%, includes income plus realized and unrealized
    gains

and/or

losses on the Plans’ assets. Utilizing generally accepted
    diversification techniques, the Plans’ assets, in aggregate
    and at the individual portfolio level, are invested so that the
    total portfolio risk exposure and risk-adjusted returns best
    meet the Plans’ long-term liabilities to employees. Plan
    asset allocations are reviewed at least quarterly and rebalanced
    to achieve target allocation among the asset categories when
    necessary.

The Plans’ investment managers are provided specific
    guidelines under which they are to invest the assets assigned to
    them. In general, investment managers are expected to remain
    fully invested in their asset class with further limitations of
    risk as related to investments in a single security, portfolio
    turnover and credit quality.

The Plans’ Investment Policy restricts the use of
    derivatives associated with leverage and speculation, or
    investments in securities issued by Hasbro, Inc., except through
    index-related strategies (e.g. an S&P 500 Index Fund)

and/or

commingled funds. In addition, unless specifically approved by
    the Investment Committee (which is comprised of members of
    management, established by the Board to manage and control
    pension plan assets), certain securities, strategies, and
    investments are ineligible for inclusion within the Plans.

Hasbro works with external benefit investment specialists to
    assist in the development of the long-term rate of return
    assumptions used to model and determine the overall asset
    allocation. Forecast returns are based on the combination of
    historical returns, current market conditions and a forecast for
    the capital markets for the next 5-7 years. Approximately
    75% of the return assumption is based on the historical
    information and 25% is based on current or forward-looking
    information. All asset class assumptions are within certain
    bands around the long-term historical averages. Correlations are
    based primarily on historical return patterns.

    benefits earned during the period and the interest cost would
    have each increased by approximately 5% and 5%, respectively.

International
    Plans

Pension coverage for employees of Hasbro’s international
    subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate,
    through separate defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
    At December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005, the
    defined benefit plans had total projected benefit obligations of
    $73,333 and $58,206, respectively, accumulated benefit
    obligations of $62,893 and $46,557, respectively, and fair
    values of plan assets of $55,429 and $40,397, respectively.
    Substantially all of the plan assets are invested in equity and
    fixed income securities. The pension expense related to these
    plans was $3,702 for fiscal 2006 and $3,073 for fiscal 2005. In
    connection with the adoption of SFAS 158 at
    December 31, 2006 described above, the Company’s
    unamortized prior service costs of $443, unrecognized net loss
    of $9,710 and unrecognized transition obligation of $277 were
    recorded as a reduction of accumulated other comprehensive
    earnings. In fiscal 2007, the Company expects amortization of
    $96, $231 and $45, respectively, of these amounts to be included
    as a component of net periodic benefit cost. At
    December 25, 2005, the Company had recorded an additional
    minimum pension liability related to these international plans
    of $3,100. This additional minimum pension liability was
    partially offset by an intangible asset in the amount of $206 at
    December 25, 2005. The remaining amount of $2,894 was
    recorded as a separate component of accumulated other
    comprehensive earnings, along with related deferred taxes of
    $902. Assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligations and
    pension expense for these plans vary depending on each plan and
    are based on factors specific to each country.

Postemployment
    Benefits

Hasbro has several plans covering certain groups of employees,
    which may provide benefits to such employees following their
    period of active employment but prior to their retirement. These
    plans include certain severance plans which provide benefits to
    employees involuntarily terminated and certain plans which
    continue the Company’s health and life insurance
    contributions for employees who have left Hasbro’s employ
    under terms of its long-term disability plan.

(12)

Leases

Hasbro occupies certain offices and uses certain equipment under
    various operating lease arrangements. The rent expense under
    such arrangements, net of sublease income which is not material,
    for 2006, 2005, and 2004 amounted to $34,603, $35,570, and
    $36,576, respectively.

Minimum rentals, net of minimum sublease income, which is not
    material, under long-term operating leases for the five years

All leases expire prior to the end of 2018. Real estate taxes,
    insurance and maintenance expenses are generally obligations of
    the Company. It is expected that in the normal course of
    business, leases that expire will be renewed or replaced by
    leases on other properties; thus, it is anticipated that future
    minimum lease commitments will not be less than the amounts
    shown for 2006.

In addition, Hasbro leases certain facilities which, as a result
    of restructurings, are no longer in use. Future costs relating
    to such facilities were accrued as a component of the original
    charge and are not included in the table above.

(13)

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Hasbro uses foreign currency forwards and options, generally
    purchased for terms of not more than eighteen months, to reduce
    the impact of currency rate fluctuations on firmly committed and
    projected future foreign currency transactions.



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to

    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share
    Data)

During 2006, 2005, and 2004, the Company reclassified net
    losses, net of tax, from other comprehensive income to earnings
    of $1,448, $2,005, and $9,111, respectively, which included
    gains (losses) of $(68), $509, and $(163), respectively, as the
    result of ineffectiveness.

The remaining balance in accumulated other comprehensive
    earnings at December 31, 2006 of $2,116 represents a net
    unrealized loss on foreign currency contracts relating to hedges
    of inventory purchased during the fourth quarter of 2006 or
    forecasted to be purchased during 2007 and intercompany expenses
    and royalty payments expected to be paid or received during
    2007. These amounts will be transferred to the consolidated
    statement of operations upon the sale of the related inventory
    and receipt or payment of the related royalties and expenses.
    The Company expects substantially all of the balance in
    accumulated other comprehensive earnings to be reclassified to
    the consolidated statement of operations within the next
    12 months.

The Company also enters into derivative instruments to offset
    changes in the fair value of intercompany loans due to the
    impact of foreign currency changes. The Company recorded a net
    loss on these instruments to other (income) expense, net of
    $5,501, $60,014, and $30,882 in 2006, 2005, and 2004,
    respectively, relating to the change in fair value of such
    derivatives, substantially offsetting gains from the change in
    fair value of intercompany loans to which the contracts relate
    included in other (income) expense, net.

(14)

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Hasbro had unused open letters of credit and related instruments
    of approximately $71,000 and $33,600 at December 31, 2006
    and December 25, 2005, respectively.

The Company enters into license agreements with inventors,
    designers and others for the use of intellectual properties in
    its products. Certain of these agreements contain provisions for
    the payment of guaranteed or minimum royalty amounts.
    Additionally, the Company has a long-term commitment related to
    promotional and marketing activities at a U.S. based theme
    park. Under terms of currently existing agreements as of
    December 31, 2006, Hasbro may, provided the other party
    meets their contractual commitment, be required to pay amounts
    as follows:


$

91,890


12,380


13,900


41,810


4,800

$

164,780

In addition to the above commitments, certain of the above
    contracts impose minimum marketing commitments on the Company,
    including the Company’s agreement with MARVEL, which
    requires the expenditure of $15,000 in connection with the
    theatrical release of SPIDER-MAN 3 expected to occur in May of
    2007.

In addition, the Company has $116,792 of prepaid royalties
    included as a component of prepaid expenses and other current
    assets in the balance sheet. The long-term portion of advances
    paid of $64,769 is included in other assets. Advanced royalties
    paid and guaranteed or minimum royalties to be paid relate to
    anticipated revenues in the years 2007 through 2018.

At December 31, 2006, including the $15,000 marketing
    commitment mentioned above, the Company had approximately
    $249,554 in outstanding purchase commitments.

Segment
    Reporting

Segment
    and Geographic Information

Hasbro is a worldwide leader in children’s and family
    leisure time and entertainment products, including the
    development, manufacture and marketing of games and toys ranging
    from traditional to high-tech. In 2006 the Company restructured
    its business by combining the U.S. Toys and Games
    operations, previously reported as separate segments, with the
    Canadian and Mexican operations, previously managed as part of
    the International segment, into one segment, the North American
    segment. The International segment is now comprised of
    operations in the Europe, Asia Pacific, South America and Latin
    America, excluding Mexico. The Company’s manufacturing
    facilities in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts and Waterford,
    Ireland, which were previously included in the Games and
    International segments, respectively, along with the
    Company’s Far East sourcing operations, are now managed as
    part of the Global Operations segment.

The North American segment includes the development, marketing
    and selling of boys’ action figures, vehicles and playsets,
    girls’ toys, electronic toys and games, plush products,
    preschool toys and infant products, electronic interactive
    products, tween electronic products, toy-related specialty
    products, traditional board games and puzzles, DVD- based games,
    fiction books, and trading card and role-playing games within
    the United States, Canada and Mexico. Within the International
    segment, the Company develops, markets and sells both toy and
    certain game products in non-North American markets, primarily
    the European, Asia Pacific, and Latin and South American
    regions. The Global Operations segment is responsible for
    manufacturing and sourcing finished product for the
    Company’s North American and International segments. The
    Company has another segment that licenses out certain toy and
    game properties.

Segment performance is measured at the operating profit level.
    Included in Corporate and eliminations are certain corporate
    expenses, the elimination of intersegment transactions and
    certain assets benefiting more than one segment. Intersegment
    sales and transfers are reflected in management reports at
    amounts approximating cost. Certain shared costs are allocated
    to segments based upon foreign exchange rates fixed at the
    beginning of the year, with adjustment to actual foreign
    exchange rates included in Corporate and eliminations.

The 2005 and 2004 segment data has been restated to reflect the
    2006 segment structure. In 2006 the Company adopted
    SFAS 123R, which requires the Company to record expense
    related to stock options in its consolidated financial
    statements. Consistent with management’s approach in
    evaluating segment results, the 2005 and 2004 segment operating
    profit (loss) has been adjusted to include stock-based
    compensation as disclosed under SFAS 123. The amount of
    2005 and 2004 stock option expense is subtracted from the total
    segment operating profit (loss) in order to reconcile to the
    operating profit (loss) in the consolidated financial statements.

With the exception of the treatment of stock-based compensation
    expense for 2005 and 2004 management financial statements, the
    accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
    referenced in Note 1.

Results shown for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004 are not
    necessarily those which would be achieved were each segment an
    unaffiliated business enterprise.

(a)

The Global Operations segment derives substantially all of its
    revenues, and thus its operating results, from intersegment
    activities. Operating profit of the Global Operations segment
    for the fiscal year 2006 includes a charge of approximately
    $11,200, primarily related to severance costs, in connection
    with the reduction of manufacturing activity at the Company
    facility in Ireland.

(b)

Certain intangible assets, primarily goodwill, which benefit
    operating segments are reflected as Corporate assets for segment
    reporting purposes. For application of SFAS 142, these
    amounts have been allocated to the reporting unit which benefits
    from their use. In addition, allocations of certain expenses
    related to



HASBRO,
    INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to

    Statements — (Continued)

(Thousands of Dollars and Shares Except Per Share
    Data)

these assets to the individual operating segments are done prior
    to the start of the year based on budgeted amounts. Any
    difference between actual and budgeted amounts are reflected in
    the Corporate segment.

(c)

As noted in footnote 10, on December 26, 2005, the
    first day of fiscal 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R
    using the modified prospective method. Under this method, the
    Company recorded stock option compensation in 2006 related to
    unvested options as of that date as well as grants made in 2006.
    The Company did not restate any of the prior years but has
    adjusted the operating profit (loss) of each of its segments for
    2005 and 2004 to reflect compensation for those periods based on
    the Company’s 2005 and 2004 pro forma disclosures under
    SFAS 123. As such, the above amounts represents the removal
    of the amounts included in the segment disclosures to reconcile
    to the 2005 and 2004 reported consolidated operating profit for
    2005 and 2004. The $23,044 of 2005 pro forma stock option
    expense was allocated as follows: $15,417 to North America,
    $4,309 to International, $1,774 to Global Operations and $1,544
    to Other Segment. The $22,164 of 2004 pro forma stock option
    expense was allocated as follows: $14,535 to North America,
    $4,187 to International, $1,824 to Global Operations and $1,618
    to Other Segment.

Other
    Information

Hasbro markets its products primarily to customers in the retail
    sector. Although the Company closely monitors the
    creditworthiness of its customers, adjusting credit policies and
    limits as deemed appropriate, a substantial portion of its
    customers’ ability to discharge amounts owed is generally
    dependent upon the overall retail economic environment.

Sales to the Company’s three largest customers, Wal-Mart
    Stores, Inc., Target Corporation and Toys ‘R Us, Inc.,
    amounted to 24%, 13% and 11%, respectively, of consolidated net
    revenues during 2006, 24%, 12% and 12% during 2005 and 21%, 10%
    and 15% during 2004. These net revenues were primarily related
    to the North American segment.

Hasbro purchases certain components and accessories used in its
    manufacturing process and certain finished products from
    manufacturers in the Far East. The Company’s reliance on
    external sources of manufacturing can be shifted, over a period
    of time, to alternative sources of supply for products it sells,
    should such changes be necessary. However, if the Company were
    prevented from obtaining products from a substantial number of
    its current Far East suppliers due to political, labor or other
    factors beyond its control, the Company’s operations would
    be disrupted, potentially for a significant period of time,
    while alternative sources of product were secured. The
    imposition of trade sanctions by the United States or the
    European Union against a class of products imported by Hasbro
    from, or the loss of “normal trade relations” status
    by, the People’s Republic of China could significantly
    increase the cost of the Company’s products imported into
    the United States or Europe.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as
    defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
    “Exchange Act”), that are designed to ensure that
    information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
    reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
    Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is
    accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,
    including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure. The Company carried out an evaluation,
    under the supervision and with the participation of the
    Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2006.
    Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and
    procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls
    and procedures were effective.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting, as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

promulgated under the Exchange Act. Hasbro’s internal
    control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance
    regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
    preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
    Hasbro’s management assessed the effectiveness of its
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006. In making its assessment, Hasbro’s
    management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (“COSO”) in “Internal Control-Integrated
    Framework”. Based on this assessment, Hasbro’s
    management concluded that, as of December 31, 2006, its
    internal control over financial reporting was effective based on
    those criteria. Hasbro’s independent registered public
    accounting firm has issued an audit report on management’s
    assessment of its internal control over financial reporting,
    which appears below.



Report
    of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Hasbro, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting, that Hasbro, Inc. maintained effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Hasbro, Inc.
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006 is fairly stated, in all material
    respects, based on criteria established in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
    of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
    Also, in our opinion, Hasbro, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2006 based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Hasbro, Inc. and subsidiaries as
    of December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations,
    shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal
    years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, and
    our report dated February 27, 2007, expressed an
    unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Report
    of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Hasbro, Inc.:

Under date of February 27, 2007, we reported on the
    consolidated balance sheets of Hasbro, Inc. and subsidiaries as
    of December 31, 2006 and December 25, 2005, and the
    related consolidated statements of operations,
    shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal
    years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006,
    which are included in the

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2006. Our report refers to
    a change in the accounting for pensions and other postretirement
    benefits other than pensions and a change in the accounting for
    share-based payments. In connection with our audits of the
    aforementioned consolidated financial statements, we also
    audited the related consolidated financial statement schedule of
    Valuation and Qualifying Accounts in the

Form 10-K.

This financial statement schedule is the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on this financial statement schedule based on our audits.

In our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.
