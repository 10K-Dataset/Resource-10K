Item 1.

Business

Lam Research Corporation (Lam or the Company), a Delaware corporation, was founded in 1980 and
is headquartered in Fremont, California. The mailing address for our principal executive offices is
4650 Cushing Parkway, Fremont, California 94538, and our telephone number is (510) 572-0200.
Additional information about Lam is available on our web site at http://www.lamrc.com. Our Forms
10-K, Forms 10-Q, and Forms 8-K are available online at the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) web site on the Internet. The address of that site is http://www.sec.gov. We also make
available free of charge the Forms 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and Forms 8-K and any amendments to those
reports on our corporate web site at http://www.lamrc.com as soon as reasonably possible after we
file them with or furnish them to the SEC.

We design, manufacture, market, and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the
fabrication of integrated circuits and are recognized as a major supplier of such equipment to the
worldwide semiconductor industry. Semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process
steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits. Our products
selectively remove portions of various films from the wafer to create semiconductors. We leverage
our expertise in these areas to develop intellectual property (IP) for integrated processing
solutions.

Etch Process

Etch processes, which are repeated numerous times during the wafer fabrication cycle, are
required to manufacture every type of semiconductor device produced today. To etch devices designed
at current and future technology nodes, our etch systems employ Lam’s TCP™ high density and Dual
Frequency Confined™ (DFC™) medium density plasma sources.

The etch process defines linewidths and other microscopic and sub-microscopic features on
integrated circuits. Plasma etching was developed to meet the demand for device geometries smaller
than 3 microns. Plasma consists of charged and neutral species that react with exposed portions of
the wafer surface to
remove dielectric, metal, or polysilicon material and produce the finely delineated features
and patterns of an integrated circuit.



Advanced integrated circuit manufacturing requires etch systems capable of creating structures
for the 110/90 nanometer (nm) technology node for current-generation products and for the 90 nm and
below technology nodes for future semiconductor products. At this time, memory manufacturers are
continuing to transition from aluminum to copper conductive lines, while leading logic
manufacturers are progressing with the implementation of more fragile insulating dielectric
materials (low k and porous low k). In addition to these changes, advanced manufacturing facilities
are now producing integrated circuits on 300 millimeter (mm) (12 inch) silicon wafers while other
facilities use wafer diameters of 200 mm (8 inch) and smaller. Semiconductor manufacturers will
continue to require more precise control over the etching process in order to accommodate these
decreasing linewidths and increasing wafer diameters. Lam is focused on providing solutions to meet
or exceed the changing process control requirements, including service and software products.

Our etch products and services are defined around the Alliance

®

and 2300™ Etch
Series platforms.

Dielectric Etch Products

Exelan

®

, Exelan High Performance, Exelan HPT, 2300 Exelan, and 2300 Exelan Flex™
Systems

. The Exelan family of products improves productivity and lowers the cost of ownership for
our customers. These systems, based on Lam’s patented DFC technology, can be extended to keep pace
with the semiconductor industry’s roadmap for etching smaller features and newer dielectric
materials. Exelan was introduced to meet the requirements for manufacturing copper conductive lines
using dual damascene etch schemes. Exelan has been extended through a series of performance
improvement upgrades, Exelan High Performance and Exelan HPT, to meet the etch requirements for the
sub-130 nm technology node. The 2300 Exelan, which was introduced to address the industry’s
transition to 300 mm wafers, is a 200 mm and 300 mm capable product. The 2300 Exelan Flex extends the capability of the 2300 Exelan family of products to address
the requirements for the 65 nm and below technology node.

Conductor Etch Products

TCP

®

9400 and TCP

®

9600 Series and 2300 Versys

®

Series
Systems

. The first TCP products were introduced in late 1992. They use Lam’s patented Transformer
Coupled Plasma™ source technology, a high-density, low-pressure plasma source that can etch
features for the 130 nm and below technology nodes. For 200 mm wafer sizes, we offer the
TCP

®

9400PTX and TCP

®

9400DFM for silicon etch applications, the
TCP

®

9400DSiE™ for MEMS (micro-electromechanical structures)-based deep silicon etch,
and the TCP

®

9600PTX and TCP

®

9600DFM for metal etch applications. These
systems are used in the production of a broad range of advanced logic and memory devices as well as
MEMS.

The 2300 Versys system for etching silicon and metal films employs a scaled design of TCP
technology to address leading-edge device structure requirements. The 2300 Versys system has the
capability to process 200 mm and 300 mm wafer sizes. The 2300 Versys Star™ silicon etch system
enables sequential step tuning of gas flow and wafer temperature, which provides the critical
dimension uniformity required for sub-110 nm technology nodes, while the 2300 Versys Kiyo™ enables
processing at sub-65 nm with demonstrated capability to 45 nm and below.

Lam 2300 process chambers can be converted within our customers’ facilities from 200 mm to 300
mm, which has the advantage of providing customers with greater flexibility and lower costs. This
capability, combined with an overall system footprint comparable to 200 mm systems, allows
semiconductor manufacturers to develop integrated circuits using 200 mm wafers instead of more
expensive 300 mm wafers and later scale up to 300 mm wafer processing.



Resist Strip Products

Lam offers integrated strip modules that remove the photoresist following metal and silicon
etch for both 200 mm and 300 mm manufacturing. Stripping the resist on the same system prevents
exposure to air, protecting the wafers from corrosion.

For 65 nm technologies and below, resist stripping after ion implantation is becoming a
critical step because of the difficulty in fully cleaning resist residues without removing too much
of the silicon. To address this emerging market, Lam has extended its successful silicon etch
product line used in combination with a microwave resist stripper for both 200 mm and 300 mm
processing.

Clean Products

Synergy cleaning products

. Synergy products combine DSS™ technology and Chemical Mechanical
Cleaning™ (CMC™) technology to perform mechanical and chemical cleaning in a single-step process.
The Synergy Integra™ incorporates Synergy’s cleaning technology with a platform that can be
integrated with other suppliers’ Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) systems. Certain integrated
systems in the industry are the result of development relationships between Lam and CMP suppliers.
The Synergy standalone clean system is used to clean wafers both before and after a range of
semiconductor processing steps.

2300, 9400, 9600, Chemical Mechanical Cleaning, CMC, DFC, DFM, DSiE, Dual Frequency Confined, Flex, Integra, Kiyo, PTX, Star, Synergy, and Transformer Coupled Plasma are trademarks of
Lam Research Corporation. Alliance, DSS, Exelan, the Lam logo, Lam Research, TCP, and Versys are registered trademarks
of Lam Research Corporation.

Research and Development

The market for semiconductor capital equipment is characterized by rapid technological change
and product innovation. Our ability to maintain competitive advantage depends in part on our
continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products.
Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to R&D
programs and seek to maintain close and responsive relationships with our customers and suppliers.

Our R&D expenses during fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $194.1 million, $170.5 million,
and $160.5 million, respectively. Expenditures are targeted at developing new product areas and
continued enhancements to our existing products. We believe current challenges for customers in
the pre- and post-etch applications present opportunities for us. Many of these challenges are new
and are a result of the transition to sub 90-nanometer device structures. We plan to leverage our
extensive production experience in etch, strip, and clean applications into new products and new
capabilities for our customers at the 65, 45, and 32-nanometer nodes.

We expect to continue to make substantial investments in R&D to meet our customers’ product
needs and enhance our competitive position.

Marketing, Sales, and Service

Our marketing and sales efforts are focused on building long-term relationships with our
customers. These efforts are supported by a team of product marketing and sales professionals as
well as equipment and process engineers that work closely with individual customers to develop
solutions to their processing needs. We maintain ongoing support relationships with our customers
and have an extensive network of field service personnel in place throughout the United States,
Europe, Japan, Korea and Asia Pacific. We believe that comprehensive support programs and close
working relationships with customers are essential
to maintaining high customer satisfaction and our competitiveness in the marketplace. We have
39 sales and support locations around the world, through which technical personnel sell and/or
service our products.



We offer standard warranties for our systems that generally run for a period of 12 months from
system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer. The
warranty provides that systems shall be free from defects in material and workmanship and conform
to our published specifications. The warranty is limited to repair of the defect or replacement
with new or like-new equivalent goods and is valid when the buyer provides prompt notification
within the warranty period of the claimed defect or non-conformity and also makes the items
available for inspection and repair. We also offer extended warranty packages to our customers to
purchase as desired.

Export Sales

A significant portion of our sales and operations occur outside the United States and,
therefore, may be subject to certain risks, including but not limited to tariffs and other
barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing non-U.S. operations, adverse tax consequences,
exchange rate fluctuations, changes in currency controls and economic and political conditions.
There can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial position, and results of operations and cash flows.

Customers

Our customers include many of the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers. Increasingly,
customers have established joint ventures, alliances and technology licensing arrangements, which
have the potential to positively or negatively impact our competitive position. In fiscal year
2005, revenues from Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd., accounted for approximately 13% of total
revenues. In fiscal year 2004, revenues from ST Microelectronics accounted for approximately 15%
of total revenues, and, in fiscal year 2003, revenues from Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd.,
accounted for approximately 15% of total revenues.

A material reduction in orders from our customers in the semiconductor industry could
adversely affect our results of operations and projected financial condition. Our business depends
upon the expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers. Semiconductor manufacturers’ business, in
turn, depends on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and the
availability of equipment capacity to support that demand.

Backlog

Our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems, spares, and services where
written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services
is anticipated within the next 12 months. Our policy is to make adjustments to our backlog to
reflect, among other things, customer delivery date changes as well as order cancellations. We
schedule production of our systems based upon purchase orders in backlog and our customers’
delivery requirements. Included in our systems backlog are orders for
which written requests have been accepted, prices
and product specifications have been agreed upon, and shipment of systems is expected within one
year. The spares and services backlog includes customer orders for products that have not yet
shipped and for services that have not yet been provided. Where specific spare parts and customer
service purchase contracts do not contain discrete delivery dates, we use volume estimates at the
contract price and over the contract period, not exceeding 12 months, in calculating backlog
amounts.

As of June 26, 2005 and June 27, 2004, our backlog was approximately $351 million and $403
million, respectively. Generally, orders for our products and services are subject to cancellation
by our customers with limited penalties. Because some orders are received for shipments in the same
quarter and due to possible customer changes in delivery dates and cancellations of orders, our
backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual revenue
levels for succeeding periods.



Manufacturing

Our manufacturing operations consist mainly of assembling and testing components,
sub-assemblies, and modules that are then integrated into finished systems prior to shipment to our
customers. Most of the assembly and testing of our products is conducted in cleanroom environments.

We have agreements with third parties to outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing,
production warehousing, and logistics functions. We continue to believe that these outsourcing
contracts provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a more timely and cost
effective manner, enabling us to respond to the cyclical nature of our business. We believe that we
have selected reputable providers and have secured their performance on terms documented in written
contracts. However, it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we
expect, and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, the expanded
role of outsource providers has required us to implement changes to our supply chain management
processes, including the adoption of new procedures to effectively manage performance risk. We
believe that we have implemented adequate oversight procedures. Even so, any delay or failure in
the implementation of our operational changes could adversely affect our customer relationships and
have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. Overall, we believe we
have effective mechanisms to manage risks associated with our outsourcing relationships. Refer to
Note 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 herein, for further
information concerning our outsourcing commitments.

Certain components and subassemblies included in our products are only obtained from a single
supplier. We believe that, in many cases, alternative sources could be obtained and qualified to
supply these products. Nevertheless, a prolonged inability to obtain these components could have an
adverse short-term effect on our operating results and could unfavorably impact our customer
relationships.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the management of hazardous
materials. We are currently not aware of any pending notices of violation, fines, lawsuits, or
investigations arising from environmental matters that would have any material effect on our
business. We believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have
obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise addressing) all necessary environmental permits to
conduct our business. Nevertheless, the failure to comply with present or future regulations could
result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, and cessation of our operations or
reduction in our customers’ acceptance of our products. These regulations could require us to alter
our current operations, to acquire significant equipment, or to incur substantial other expenses to
comply with environmental regulations. Our failure to control the use, sale, transport or disposal
of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities.

Employees

As of August 8, 2005, we had approximately 2,200 regular full-time employees.

Each
of our employees is required to sign an agreement to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary
information, and most of our employees have Lam stock-based compensation arrangements with us that
generally provide for the stock-based award vesting over multiple years. All employees are
required to sign an acknowledgement that they have read and agree to abide by a statement of
standards of business conduct.

In the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, competition for highly skilled
employees is intense. Our future success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability
to attract and retain qualified employees, particularly in the R&D and customer support functions.
We continue to believe that the ability to offer stock compensation is an important component of
our employee retention programs.



Competition

The semiconductor capital equipment industry is characterized by rapid change and is highly
competitive throughout the world. In order to compete effectively, we invest significant financial
resources to continue to strengthen and enhance our product and services portfolio and to maintain
customer service and support locations globally. Semiconductor manufacturers evaluate capital
equipment suppliers in many areas, including, but not limited to, process performance,
productivity, customer support, defect control, and overall cost of ownership, which can be
affected by many factors such as equipment design, reliability, software advancements, etc. Our
ability to succeed in the marketplace will depend upon our ability to maintain existing products
and introduce product enhancements and new products on a timely basis. In addition, semiconductor
manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate new capital equipment
into semiconductor production lines. As a result, once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a
particular supplier’s equipment and qualified it for production, the manufacturer generally
maintains that selection for that specific production application. Accordingly, we may experience
difficulty in selling to a given customer if that customer has qualified a competitor’s equipment.

We face significant competition with all of our products and services. Certain of our existing
and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive
engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support organizations. We expect
our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and
processes and to introduce new products and processes with enhanced price/performance
characteristics. If our competitors make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with
leading semiconductor manufacturers, or other entities, covering products similar to those we sell,
our ability to sell our products to those customers could be adversely affected. There can be no
assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future. Our primary competitors in
the etch market are Tokyo Electron, Ltd. and Applied Materials, Inc.

Patents and Licenses

Our policy is to seek patents on inventions relating to new or enhanced products and processes
developed as part of our ongoing research, engineering, manufacturing, and support activities. We
currently hold a number of United States and foreign patents covering various aspects of our
products and processes. We believe that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the useful
life of the technologies and processes disclosed and claimed therein. Our patents, which cover
material aspects of our past and present core products, have current durations ranging from
approximately 4 to 17 years. We believe that, although the patents we own and may obtain in the
future will be of value, they will not alone determine our success, which depends principally upon
our engineering, marketing, support, and delivery skills. However, in the absence of patent
protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to imitate our products, manufacturing
techniques, and processes. In addition, other companies and inventors may receive patents that
contain claims applicable or similar to our products and processes. The sale of products covered by
patents of others could require licenses that may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.
For further discussion of legal matters, see Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” of this Form 10-K.

Other Cautionary Statements

See the discussion of risks in the section of this Form 10-K entitled Item 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

We changed our revenue recognition policy in the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2001, effective
June 26, 2000, based on guidance provided in Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 101 (SAB No. 101), “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.” Refer to our
discussion of “Critical Accounting Policies” for additional information about our revenue
recognition policy and see item (4) below.

(2)

Restructuring charges, net exclude restructuring charges (recoveries) included in cost of goods
sold and reflected in gross margin of ($1.7) million, ($1.0) million,
$5.9 million, and $4.0 million, for fiscal years 2004, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. These amounts
primarily relate to the write-off of selected, older product line inventories in connection with
our restructuring plans and the partial recovery of the charges from the subsequent sale of a
portion of such inventories. These restructuring charges/(recoveries) are included as a component
of cost of goods sold in accordance with Emerging Issues



Task Force 96-9, “Classification of
Inventory Markdowns and Other Costs Associated with a Restructuring” (EITF 96-9). There were no
restructuring charges included in cost of goods sold in fiscal year 2005. Fiscal year 2005
restructuring charges consist only of additional liabilities related to prior restructuring plans.

(3)

We recorded a non-cash gain of $33.1 million (no related tax), or $0.25 per diluted share, to
reflect the cumulative effect of the accounting change as of June 24, 2001 related to the adoption
of Emerging Issues Task Force 00-19, “Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially
Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock” (EITF 00-19).

(4)

We recorded a non-cash charge of $122.1 million, after reduction for income tax benefits of
$81.4 million, or ($0.92) per diluted share, to reflect the cumulative effect of the accounting
change as of June 26, 2000 related to the adoption of SAB No. 101.

(5)

Diluted net income per share for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2004 includes the assumed
conversion of the convertible subordinated 4% notes. Accordingly, interest expense, net of taxes,
of $3.2 million must be added back to net income for computing diluted net earnings per share.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains
forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition,
significance, value and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated
in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to
those discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and other
documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See “Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

).

Results of Operations

Lam Research Corporation (Lam or the Company) is a major supplier of wafer fabrication
equipment and services to the world’s semiconductor industry. We actively market and sell product
offerings that include single-wafer plasma etch systems with a wide range of applications, wafer
cleaning systems, and an array of services designed to optimize the utilization of these systems by
our customers.

The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic
downturns and upturns. Over recent business cycles, the severity of these fluctuations has
increased, and today’s leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns may not be any
more reliable than in prior years. Demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to
period as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, economic conditions, supply,
demand, and prices for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and our ability to develop
and market competitive products. For these and other reasons, our results of operations for fiscal
years 2005, 2004, and 2003 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results.

Executive Summary

We believe our business model continues to set a standard for the industry. Our business
model is focused on new product development, sales and marketing, and customer support which are the core competencies of
the Company.

Indicators of customer demand began to improve in our quarter ended September 28, 2003. This
trend continued through the quarter ended September 26, 2004, then declined and stabilized over the
course of the March 2005 and June 2005 quarters.

Fiscal year 2005 revenues increased 61% compared to fiscal year 2004 revenues reflecting the
increase in customer demand which we believe included market share gains in both the dielectric and conductor
product segments of the etch market, with particularly strong performance in Asia.

The progression in
our gross margin of five percentage points from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2005 was
achieved on increased sales volume, improvements in product mix, and
effective asset management.

Total operating expenses increased by $48.2 million, or 15% during fiscal year 2005 compared
to fiscal year 2004. Increases in operating expenses were primarily driven by increases in salary and benefits costs for planned increases of employee base
compensation as well as increases for incentive-based compensation triggered by higher profits. Fiscal year 2005 operating expenses included restructuring charges of $14.2
million in connection with our guaranteed residual value guarantee obligation on certain leased
facilities included in prior restructuring plans.

Unshipped orders in backlog as of June 26, 2005 were approximately $351 million. The basis
for recording new orders is defined in our backlog policy. Our unshipped orders backlog
includes orders for systems, spares, and services where written customer requests have been
accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12
months. Our policy is to make adjustments to our backlog to reflect, among other things, customer
delivery date changes as well as order cancellations. Please refer to “Backlog” in Part I Item 1,
“Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our backlog policy.

Indicators of customer demand for wafer processing equipment improved in the quarter ended
September 28, 2003 and continued through the quarter ended September 26, 2004. Since that time,
new orders have declined and stabilized in the March 2005 and June 2005 quarters, which reflects
the investment decisions of our customers.

We expect new orders for the quarter ending September 25, 2005 to range from flat to down 5%
compared with the quarter ended June 26, 2005. This expectation
is a forward-looking statement and actual results could differ
materially as a result of certain factors as referred to on page 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Revenue increased significantly during fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004. This
increase reflected an improved market environment which was evidenced by expanded levels of capital
investments by semiconductor manufacturers. We believe we have gained market share in both the
dielectric and conductor product segments of the etch market, with particularly strong performance in Asia.
Our deferred revenue



balance was $150.5 million as of June 26, 2005. The anticipated future revenue value of orders
shipped from backlog to Japanese customers that are not recorded as deferred revenue was
approximately $53 million as of June 26, 2005. These shipments are classified as inventory and
carried at cost.

The increase in revenues for fiscal year 2005 continued the trends noted for fiscal year 2004
compared to fiscal year 2003, which were reflective of a market environment that had improved,
evidenced by expanded levels of capital investments by semiconductor manufacturers.

The overall Asia region has historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenues
as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity for semiconductor manufacturing is shifting
toward this region; this trend continued through fiscal year 2005. The growth in Asia Pacific
revenues during fiscal year 2004 predominantly occurred in Taiwan and Singapore.

Our current estimate for revenues for the quarter ending September 25, 2005 ranges
from $310 million to $330 million. This is a
forward-looking statement and actual results could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to on page 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The increase in gross margin during fiscal year 2005 compared with fiscal year 2004 was driven
primarily by improved product mix and effective asset management on higher sales volume. The increase in gross
margin during fiscal year 2004 compared with fiscal year 2003
was primarily due to improved utilization of factory and field resources,
expense management programs, and improved sales volumes throughout
the year.

We expect that gross margin as a percent of total
revenue will be approximately 47% for the
quarter ending September 25, 2005 which includes approximately $3 million, or one percentage point, in stock-based
compensation expense associated with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123R).
This expectation is a forward-looking statement and actual results
could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to

We continue to invest significantly in research and development in business cycle upturns
and downturns. Our investments have been aimed at strengthening our product and services portfolio
via the introduction of next-generation products as well as enhancing our existing offerings. The
growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 is
primarily due to increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately $5 million for planned
increases of employee base compensation as well as roughly $9 million for incentive-based
compensation triggered by higher profits. The remainder of the increase was primarily the result of
an increase in R&D supplies expense of approximately
$6 million. Approximately 51% of fiscal year 2005
systems revenues were derived from products introduced over the previous two years.

The growth in spending between fiscal years 2004 and 2003 was primarily due to increases in
salary and benefits costs of approximately $10 million, a result of planned increases of employee
compensation and incentive-based compensation triggered by higher profits. These costs were
partially offset by reductions in facilities-related expenses, largely reflected in reduced
depreciation costs of roughly $2 million, due to infrastructure rationalization and consolidation.

The
increase in SG&A expenses during the year ended June 26, 2005 compared with the prior year was driven by
increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately $5 million due to planned increases of
employee base compensation as well as roughly $14 million due to incentive-based compensation
triggered by higher profits. Also included in the increase was approximately $10 million in
professional services which included, among other items, expenditures
for certain discretionary
information technology projects designed to contribute to
productivity improvements across the Company. These increases were partially offset by the receipt in fiscal
year 2005 of a net $8 million tax refund from the California State Board of Equalization for
previously paid sales and use tax and approximately $3 million
in stock-based compensation expense
recorded in fiscal year 2004 in connection with the modification of terms of a fixed stock option
award.

Expenses in fiscal year 2004 were $13 million higher than fiscal year 2003 because employee
compensation costs increased by nearly $12 million, a result of planned increases of employee
compensation and incentive-based compensation triggered by higher profits. Also contributing to the
fiscal year 2004 SG&A expense growth was a rise in outside services of approximately $5 million
primarily due to costs incurred for discretionary information
technology projects. Additionally, the $3 million stock-based compensation
charge noted above contributed to the increase in fiscal year 2004. A decrease of approximately $4
million, primarily in depreciation expense, due to infrastructure rationalization and consolidation
partially offset the rise in expenses noted above.



We expect total operating
expenses (R&D and SG&A) in the quarter ending September 25, 2005
will be approximately $100 million which includes an estimated $6 million of stock-based
compensation expense associated with the adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),
“Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123R). These estimates
are forward-looking statements and actual results could differ
materially as a result of certain factors as referred to on page 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Restructuring Charges

We distinguish regular operating cost management activities from restructuring activities.
Accounting for restructuring activities requires an evaluation of formally committed and approved
plans. Restructuring activities have comparatively greater strategic significance and materiality
and may involve exit activities, whereas regular cost containment activities are more tactical in
nature and are rarely characterized by formal and integrated action plans or exiting a particular
product, facility, or service.

We have historically developed plans and incurred restructuring charges to respond to the high
level of volatility and, at times, depressed levels of capital investment by the semiconductor
industry. We systematically reviewed our revenue outlook and forecasts and assessed their impact
on required employment levels, facilities utilization, and outsourcing activities scope. Based on
these evaluations, our senior management committed to cost reduction and exit activities in the
quarters ended March 28, 2004 (the March 2004 Plan), December 28, 2003 (the December 2003 Plan),
September 28, 2003 (the September 2003 Plan), June 29, 2003 (the June 2003 Plan), March 30, 2003
(the March 2003 Plan), December 29, 2002 (the December 2002 Plan), December 30, 2001 (the December
2001 Plan), and September 23, 2001 (the September 2001 Plan).

Prior to the end of each quarter noted above, we initiated the announced restructuring
activities and management with the proper level of authority approved specific actions under the
respective Plan. Severance packages to potentially impacted employees were communicated in enough
detail such that the employees could determine their type and amount of benefit. The termination of
the affected employees occurred as soon as practical after the restructuring plans were announced.
The amount of remaining future lease payments recorded in the restructuring charges include
facilities for which a contract was terminated in accordance with its terms and charges for
facilities, or a portion of facilities we ceased to use. Expenses were based on management’s
estimates using known prevailing real estate market conditions at that time based, in part, on the
opinions of independent real estate experts. Leasehold improvements relating to the vacated
buildings were written off, where these items were determined to have no future economic benefit to
us and have been abandoned.

As of June 26, 2005, the overall restructuring reserve balance consisted of the following:

Fiscal Year 2005 Activity

During the quarter ended March 27, 2005, we recognized additional liabilities of $14.2 million
in connection with our guaranteed residual value obligation on certain leased facilities included
in prior restructuring plans. The $14.2 million was the difference between our remaining guaranteed
residual value of $17.4 million less $3.2 million previously accrued
under prior restructuring plans for these facilities. During the March 2005 quarter, we contacted
the lessor regarding the marketing of these facilities for sale. We concluded, under the provisions
of SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”, that the likelihood that a liability had been
incurred was probable and estimable. This transaction resulted in an increase of $10.2 million and
$4.0 million to our fiscal year 2004 and fiscal year 2002 restructuring plans accruals,
respectively. During the quarter ended June 26, 2005 we received a notice of approval from a
designated buyer under a contract to purchase these facilities and upon closing of the sale in the
same quarter, the lessor deeded the purchased properties to the
buyer. We exited these leases to avoid future cash expenditures for
these facilities, which had been abandoned in prior periods. Pursuant to the lease and
participation agreements, our obligation to the lessor for the properties being purchased by the
designated buyer was $27.4 million. The net proceeds of the sale, equal to approximately $10.0
million, were applied against this obligation. The remainder of the obligation, our remaining
guaranteed residual value of the two properties of approximately $17.4 million, was paid during the
quarter ended June 26, 2005. This transaction is reflected in the fiscal year 2004 and fiscal year
2002 restructuring plan accrual tables below.

Fiscal Year 2004 Restructuring Activities

Our fiscal year 2004 restructuring activities included reducing our workforce by less than 40
employees, primarily in North America and Europe and by vacating selected facilities located in
North America and Asia deemed to be no longer necessary to our operations. The employees were from
a range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization.

We recorded net restructuring charges during fiscal year 2004 of approximately $6.7 million,
consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees of $1.2 million,
charges for the present value of remaining lease payments on vacated facilities of $2.8 million,
and the write-off of related leasehold improvements of $1.6 million. We also recorded a charge of
approximately $1.0 million due to the cancellation of a lease agreement related to one of our
facilities in Japan and $2.1 million for the write-off of related leasehold improvements.

We recognized $1.9 million of additional facilities-related expenses due to changes in
estimates of restructuring plans initiated prior to fiscal year 2004. Charges during the year were
partially offset by the recovery of $1.5 million of previously accrued expenses related to the
remaining lease payments on vacated facilities in Japan. Additional offsetting items include
recovery of $0.7 million due to lower than previously estimated employee severance and benefits
costs and $1.7 million of recovered inventory from unanticipated sales to our installed base of
certain portions of inventory previously written off as part of our September 2001 restructuring.
The inventory recovery was recorded as a credit in cost of goods sold.

As a result of the fiscal year 2004 restructuring activities, we expected quarterly savings,
relative to the cost structure immediately preceding the activities, in total expenses of
approximately $0.3 million from the March 2004 Plan, $0.7 million from the December 2003 Plan and
$0.5 million from the September 2003 Plan. The majority of the savings were expected to be realized
within Operating Expenses, mainly Selling, General and Administrative expenses. These estimated
savings from the Plans’ discrete actions were primarily related to lower employee payroll, rent,
and depreciation expenses. Actual savings may vary from these forecasts, depending upon future
events and circumstances, such as differences in actual sublease income versus estimated amounts.
Through June 26, 2005, we believe actual savings from these Plans are largely consistent with
original estimated quarterly savings.

The fiscal year 2005 restructuring charge of $10.2 million in the table below is for the
additional liabilities for unoccupied facilities discussed above in Fiscal Year 2005 Activity.

Fiscal Year 2003 Restructuring Activities

Our senior management committed to cost reduction and exit activities during fiscal year 2003
through our June 2003, March 2003 and December 2002 Plans and recorded restructuring charges during
fiscal year 2003 of approximately $18.1 million. Our fiscal year 2003 restructuring activities
included reducing our workforce in North America, Europe, and Asia by approximately 200 people and
vacating selected sales and administrative facilities located in North America, Europe, and Asia
deemed to be no longer required for our operations. The employees included in the Plans were from a
broad range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization, with the majority of the
reductions in North America.

The $18.1 million restructuring charges consisted of $5.7 million of severance and benefits
for involuntarily terminated employees and $12.4 million of facilities-related charges. The
facilities-related charges consisted of the present value of remaining lease payments on vacated
facilities, a loss on the fair value of a vacated facility and the write-off of related leasehold
improvements. In June 2003, a lease covering one of our vacated facilities at our Fremont,
California campus was amended, combined, restated, and transferred to a new lessor under a single
lease structure. At the time of the amendment, the leased facility’s fair value was less than its
original cost by approximately $1 million. Accordingly, this amount was recorded as a loss on the
fair value of the vacated facility and included in the $18.1 million of restructuring charges.

As a result of the fiscal year 2003 restructuring activities, we expected quarterly savings,
relative to the cost structure immediately preceding the activities, of approximately $1.0 million
from the June 2003 Plan, $1.0 million from the March 2003 Plan, and $3.0 million from the December
2002 Plan. The majority of the savings were expected to be realized within Operating Expenses,
mainly Selling, General and Administrative expenses. These estimated savings were primarily from
lower payroll, facilities, and depreciation expenses. Through June 26, 2005, we believe realized
savings are consistent with original forecasts. However, other factors may significantly influence
our future cost structure and, consequently, partially or totally offset savings from these Plans.

Fiscal Year 2002 Restructuring Activities

Our senior management committed to cost reduction and exit activities during fiscal year 2002
through our December 2001 and September 2001 Plans and recorded restructuring charges during fiscal
year 2002 of approximately $54.8 million. Our fiscal year 2002 restructuring activities included
reducing our workforce in North America, Europe, and Asia by approximately 1,020 people, vacating
selected facilities at our Fremont, California campus deemed to be no longer required for our
operations, the closure of certain offices in Asia, and discontinuance of the manufacture of
specific products within our etch product lines. The employees were from a broad range of functions
and at multiple levels of the organization, with approximately 83% from North America and
approximately 17% from Europe and Asia locations.

The
restructuring charges included $25.0 million in severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated
employees, $11.4 million in charges for remaining lease payments
on vacated facilities, $10.8 million in write-offs of related
leasehold improvements and fixed assets, and $7.6 million in inventory write-downs. The inventory charge of
approximately $7.6 million related to our decision to discontinue manufacture of specific systems
within our etch product lines. We recovered approximately $1.7 million during fiscal year 2004,
$1.0 million during fiscal year 2003, and $0.7 million during fiscal year 2002, from unanticipated
subsequent sales of these inventories to our installed base. We physically disposed of
approximately $1.0 million of this inventory during fiscal year 2004 and $2.7 million during fiscal
years 2003 and 2002. During fiscal year 2002, we also recovered approximately $1.0 million of the
$54.8 million due to lower than estimated employee termination costs of $0.7 million and lower than
planned expenses related to a vacated facility of $0.3 million. During fiscal year 2004, we
recorded approximately $0.4 million of additional restructuring charges due to a revision in
estimates for one of our vacated facilities and we recovered approximately $1.4 million, net, due
to the difference between costs previously accrued and actual costs to terminate a lease agreement
for a facility for which we entered into a lease cancellation agreement during fiscal year 2004.

During fiscal year 2003, we recovered approximately $2.7 million for benefits offered that
were not utilized by terminated employees and $2.0 million was recovered due to revisions to the
net amount of lease payments remaining on vacated facilities. We also recorded additional
restructuring charges during fiscal year 2003 of $3.1 million due to revisions we made in sublease
assumptions for two of our vacated buildings in Fremont, California, $0.1 million due to additional
facility restoration costs, and $0.4 million for revisions that we made in our estimates for
employee termination costs.

The fiscal year 2005 restructuring charge of $4.0 million in the table below is for the
additional liabilities for unoccupied facilities discussed above in Fiscal Year 2005 Activity.

Fiscal Year 2001 Restructuring Activities

During the second quarter of fiscal year 2003, we completed the remaining elements of our
restructuring activities under the June 2001 Plan. A final $1.1 million of restructuring charges
was recovered due to lower than estimated employee termination costs. The remaining $0.5 million
facilities balance as of June 26, 2005 is expected to be paid by January, 2006.



Other Income (Expense), net

Other income (expense), net, was $8.1 million, $4.5 million and ($10.3) million in fiscal
years 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively, and consisted of the following:

The sequential increase in interest income during fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal
year 2004 was due primarily to the increase in interest rate yields. Interest expense and debt
issue cost amortization decreased due to the early retirement of our
convertible subordinated $300.0 million 4% notes (4% Notes) in June 2004. We elected to make charitable contributions of $5.5 million during
fiscal year 2005.

During
fiscal year 2004, our total cash balances, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments, and restricted cash, increased each quarter through March 2004. These
increases in cash balances allowed us to repay, in the June 2004 quarter, our 4% Notes prior to
maturity. Although cash balances increased throughout the first three quarters of the year,
interest income decreased during fiscal year 2004 as a result of lower market rates. The decline in
interest expense and debt issue cost amortization in fiscal year 2004 is largely due to the
redemption of our 5% $300.0 million subordinated debentures (5% Notes) in September 2002.

Tax Expense (Benefit)

Our annual income tax expense (benefit) was $99.8 million, $27.7 million, and ($7.9) million,
in fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The fiscal year 2005 tax rate was 25%, which
primarily reflects the impact of R&D tax credits and the proportion of foreign income taxed at
lower than U.S. statutory tax rates. In fiscal year 2004, we released a valuation allowance on
specific deferred tax assets after we determined that the valuation allowance was no longer
required. This resulted in a $12.7 million credit recorded to income tax expense, during fiscal
year 2004. In April 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) closed its examination of our tax
returns for fiscal years up to and including the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998. Resolution was
reached on a number of issues including adjustments related to R&D tax credits resulting in our
recording a $24.9 million tax benefit in June 2003. In addition, a tax expense of approximately
$17.0 million associated with implementing strategies to, in the longer-term, limit our tax
liability on the sale of our products worldwide was recorded in June 2003.



Deferred Income Taxes

We had gross deferred tax assets arising from non-deductible temporary differences, net
operating losses, and tax credit carryforwards of $248.0 million and $303.3 million in fiscal years
2005 and 2004. The gross deferred tax assets are offset by valuation allowances of $106.0 million
and $67.8 million and deferred tax liabilities of $22.2 million and $26.3 million in fiscal years
2005 and 2004, respectively.

We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more
likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future
taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however,
ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not
known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to
realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in
the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than
not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation
allowance would be reversed. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and
will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances, if any. Our current
valuation allowance of $106.0 million includes the tax benefit from the exercise of
employee stock options. When the stock option tax benefits are realized, a portion of the valuation
allowance will be reversed and credited to capital in excess of par value. During fiscal year
2004, we released a valuation allowance of $12.7 million as
discussed above.

On October 22, 2004 the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) was signed into law. The AJCA
provides for a deduction of 85% of certain non-U.S. earnings that are repatriated to the U.S., as
defined in the AJCA. On January 13, 2005 and May 10, 2005 the U.S. Treasury published Notice
2005-10 and Notice 2005-38, respectively, providing guidance on the implementation of the
repatriation deduction. Based on our current understanding of the AJCA, we believe the range of
possible amounts that we may consider for repatriation under this provision is between zero and
$500 million. The potential range of related income tax that may be incurred as a result of the
repatriation is between zero and $26 million. We may elect to apply this provision to qualifying
earnings repatriations in fiscal year 2006.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We based our estimates
and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be
applicable, and evaluated them on an on-going basis to ensure they remained reasonable under
current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.

The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are
described in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of these significant
accounting polices are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy
is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of
operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often as a
result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.

We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant
judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

: We recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling
price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have
completed our system installation obligations, received customer acceptance or are otherwise
released from our installation or



customer acceptance obligations. In the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing
customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance
period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. In circumstances where the practices of a
customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing
acceptance provision, we recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered
system meets all of the agreed to customer specifications. In situations with multiple
deliverables, revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and
when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance
obligations. Revenue from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate elements
based on their relative fair values, provided the elements have value on a stand alone basis, there
is objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the arrangement does not include a general right
of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is
considered probable and substantially in our control. The maximum revenue recognized on a delivered
element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items.
Revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits is generally recognized upon
shipment. Revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of the services
requested by a customer order. Revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed
payment amount is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.

Inventory Valuation

: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard
costs, which approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. We maintain a perpetual
inventory system and continuously record the quantity on-hand and standard cost for each product,
including purchased components, subassemblies and finished goods. We maintain the integrity of
perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand. Finished goods
are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. Generally, title
transfer is documented in the terms of sale. When the terms of sale do not specify, we assume title
transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other
customer practices prevail. Transfer of title for shipments to Japanese customers generally occurs
at time of customer acceptance.

Standard costs are re-assessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs,
generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts, currently obtainable assembly
and test labor performance levels, and overhead for internally manufactured products. Manufacturing
labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to
absorb spending at average utilization volumes. All intercompany profits related to the sales and
purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial
statements.

Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least
quarterly. Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories, including manufacturing raw
materials, work-in-process, finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete
inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to
36 months is written down to its estimated market value, if less than cost. Inherent in the
estimates of market value are management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules,
customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions,
possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory. If future customer demand
or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may
be required, and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made.

Warranty

: Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and
service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. We offer standard
warranties for our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance, not
to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer. When appropriate, we record a
provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue
recognition. The amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity, which uses factors
such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such as tool reliability
trends. All actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those
established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping.



Actual warranty expenses are incurred on a system-by-system basis, and may differ from our
original estimates. While we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities,
if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to
provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. Accordingly, actual
costs that exceed the estimates are expensed as incurred, and at the same time, additional probable
and estimable liabilities may be recorded.

We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to
specific systems.

In addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer customer-paid extended warranty
services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are
recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded
either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable.

Stock-Based
Compensation — Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Incentive Plans

: We account for our employee
stock purchase plan (ESPP) and stock option plans under the provisions of Accounting Principles
Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 “Accounting For Stock
Issued to Employees” (APB No. 25) and Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation
No. 44, “Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation — an Interpretation of
APB Opinion No. 25” and make pro forma footnote disclosures as required by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 148, “Accounting For Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and
Disclosure”, which amends SFAS No. 123, “Accounting For Stock-Based Compensation”. Our ESPP is a
non-compensatory plan, and our stock option plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value
method under the provisions of APB No. 25. Please see “Recent
Accounting Pronouncements” below regarding
the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) which will become
effective during our quarter ending September 25, 2005.

Pro forma net income (loss) and pro forma net income (loss) per share disclosed in the
footnotes to our consolidated financial statements are estimated using a Black-Scholes option
valuation model. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and which are fully transferable.
In addition, the Black-Scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including
expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each option.

Income Taxes

: Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between
the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used
for income tax purposes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the
amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is
dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be
realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other
variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not
be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to
earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more
likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided
valuation allowance would be reversed.

We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that
could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent
year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified, which is generally in the
third quarter of the subsequent year for U.S. federal and state provisions.

We provide for income taxes on the basis of annual estimated effective income tax rates. Our
estimated effective income tax rate reflects the underlying profitability of the Company, the level
of R&D spending, the regions where profits are recorded and the respective tax rates imposed. We
carefully monitor these factors and adjust the effective income tax rate, if necessary. If actual
results differ from estimates, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance on
deferred tax assets or adjust our effective
income tax rate, which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations,
and financial condition.



The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application
of complex tax laws. Our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly
judgmental. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner
inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on
our results of operations and financial
condition. We account for income tax contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5,
“Accounting for Contingencies.”

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on recognition and
measurement guidance previously discussed under EITF 03-01. The consensus clarifies the meaning of
other-than-temporary impairment and its application to investments classified as either
available-for-sale or held-to-maturity under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” and investments accounted
for under the cost method or the equity method. In September 2004, the FASB issued a final FASB Staff Position (FSP), EITF Issue 03-01-1, which
indefinitely delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance of EITF 03-01.
We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting EITF 03-01.

In
November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,
“Inventory Costs — An Amendment of Accounting Research
Bulletin (ARB No. 43),
Chapter 4,” which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
handling costs and wasted material (spoilage). We are required to adopt SFAS No. 151 in fiscal
year 2006 and its adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on our results of
operations or financial position.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment.” This
Statement is a revision of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”, and supersedes
APB No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”, and its related implementation guidance. In
March, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107
(SAB No. 107) which provides the Staff’s views regarding interactions between SFAS No. 123(R) and
certain SEC rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share-based
payments for public companies. SFAS No. 123(R) requires that compensation cost relating to
share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements. That cost will be
measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. SFAS No. 123(R)
will be effective for us beginning with the quarter ended September 25, 2005. The effects of the
adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on our results of operations and financial position are dependent upon
a number of factors, including the number of employee stock options outstanding and unvested, the
number of stock-based awards which may be granted in the future, the life and vesting features of
stock-based awards which may be granted in the future, the future market value and volatility of
our stock, movements in the risk free rate of interest, award exercise and forfeiture patterns, and
the valuation model used to estimate the fair value of each award. We are currently evaluating
these variables in the design of our stock-based compensation program as well as the accounting
requirements under SFAS No. 123(R) and SAB No. 107. In
addition, we intend to utilize restricted stock units as a key
component of our ongoing employee incentive-based compensation plan.
These awards generally are recorded at their fair value, equal to the
quoted market price of our common stock on the date of issuance, and
this amount is subsequently amortized ratably over the vesting period
of the shares of restricted stock held by the employee. Based on the
expense for our ESPP, our outstanding unvested options, and any
outstanding unvested restricted stock units, we believe that the
expense for stock-based compensation for the quarter ending September 25, 2005 will range
from $8 million to $10 million, pre-tax.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment
of APB Opinion No. 29.” The amendments made by SFAS No. 153 are based on the principle that
exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged.
SFAS No. 153 also eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets
and replaces it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have
commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal
periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We will apply its provisions prospectively upon adoption,
and its adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations or
financial position.



In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.” This
statement replaces APB No. 20 and SFAS No. 3 and changes the requirements for the accounting for
and
reporting of a change in accounting principle. APB No. 20 previously required that most
voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of
the change the cumulative effect of changing to the accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 requires
retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting
principle. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 154 will
have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

We have certain obligations, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some which
are not, to make future payments under various contracts. Obligations are recorded on our balance
sheet in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The obligations recorded on
our consolidated balance sheet include restructuring liabilities which are outlined in the
following table and are discussed below. Our off-balance sheet arrangements include contractual
relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below.

Operating Leases

We lease most of our administrative, R&D and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service
offices and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases, which expire at various dates
through 2021. Certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our Fremont, California
headquarters and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for
additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on
the general rate of inflation.

Included in the operating leases 4-5 years section of the table above is $75.0 million in
guaranteed residual values for lease agreements relating to certain
properties at our Fremont, California campus. Please see the Guarantees section below for additional information.

The
remaining balances primarily relate to non-cancelable facility-related operating leases
expiring at various dates through 2021.

Purchase Obligations

Purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis
or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments,
including vendor-consigned inventories. We continue to enter into new agreements and maintain
existing agreements to outsource certain activities, including elements of our manufacturing,
warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance, certain information technology functions, and
certain transactional general and administrative functions. The contractual cash obligations and
commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 26, 2005 under these
arrangements and others. Actual expenditures will vary based on
the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition to minimum
spending commitments, certain of these agreements provide for potential cancellation charges.



Consignment inventories, which are owned by vendors but located in our storage locations and
warehouses, are not reported as our inventory until title is transferred to us or our purchase
obligation is determined. At June 26, 2005, vendor-owned inventories held at our locations and not
reported as our inventory were approximately $14.8 million.

Restructuring Liabilities

Our total restructuring reserves as of June 26, 2005 were $5.6 million, including $0.2 million
of severance and benefits-related costs and $5.4 million related to lease payments on vacated buildings. Through cash generated from operations, we expect
$3.3 million to be paid over the next twelve months and
$2.3 million to be paid between fiscal year 2007
and fiscal year 2011. Please see the related discussion in “Restructuring Activities” within
Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

Guarantees

We account for our guarantees in accordance with FASB Interpretation 45 “Guarantor’s
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others” (FIN No. 45). FIN No. 45 requires a company that is a guarantor to make specific
disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. FIN No. 45 also requires
a company (the Guarantor) to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the
obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee.

During fiscal year 2005 we recognized additional liabilities of $14.2 million in connection
with our guaranteed residual value obligation on certain leased facilities included in prior
restructuring plans. The $14.2 million was the difference between our remaining guaranteed
residual value of $17.4 million less $3.2 million previously
accrued under prior restructuring plans for these facilities. During fiscal year 2005 we contacted
the lessor regarding the marketing of these facilities for sale and we received a notice of
approval from a designated buyer under a contract to purchase these facilities and upon closing of
the sale in the same quarter, the lessor deeded the purchased properties to the buyer. Pursuant to
the lease and participation agreements, our obligation to the lessor for the properties being
purchased by the designated buyer was $27.4 million. The net proceeds of the sale, equal to
approximately $10.0 million, were applied against this obligation. The remainder of the
obligation, our remaining guaranteed residual value of the two properties of approximately $17.4
million, was paid in the quarter ended June 26, 2005. We exited
these leases to avoid
future cash expenditures for these facilities which were abandoned in
prior periods.

The facilities noted above were among several facilities for which lease agreements were
transferred to a new lessor, amended, combined and restated in March and June of 2003. As part of
the lease agreements, we have the option to purchase the remaining buildings at any time for a
total purchase price for all remaining properties related to these leases of approximately $85.0
million. We are required to guarantee the lessors a residual value on the properties of up to
$75.0 million at the end of the lease terms in fiscal year 2008 (in the case that the leases are not
renewed, we do not exercise the purchase options, the lessor sells the properties and the sale
price is less than the lessor’s costs). We maintain cash collateral of $85.0 million as part of
the lease agreements as of June 26, 2005 in separate, specified interest-bearing accounts which is
recorded as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet. The lessor under the lease
agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a
variable interest entity (VIE) as defined by FASB Interpretation 46, “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities” and is therefore not consolidated by us.

We have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors under some of our operating lease
agreements, including indemnification for various environmental matters. We have entered into
certain insurance contracts to minimize our exposure related to such indemnifications. As of June
26, 2005, we have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection with these
indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that
any amounts will be paid under these guarantees.



We
have agreements with two financial institutions that guarantee payment of our Japanese
subsidiary’s overdraft protection obligation. At June 26, 2005, the maximum potential amount of
future payments we could be required to make under these agreements was approximately $2.8 million,
although our Japanese subsidiary did not owe any amounts under these
agreements.

We have an agreement enabling us to sell to a financial institution certain U.S.
dollar-denominated receivables generated from the sale of our systems, subject to recourse
provisions. We discontinued the use of this program during the quarter ended June 26, 2005 and
have no current plans to continue usage. At June 26, 2005 we had no outstanding and uncollected
receivables under this agreement.

Generally, we indemnify, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, our customers for
infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products or services. We seek to
limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products
or services subject to our indemnification obligations. We do not believe, based on information
available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these guarantees.

We offer standard warranties on our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from
system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from the date of shipment of the system to the customer.
The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system,
customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as the impact of system
reliability improvements.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

As of June 26, 2005, we had $894.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments,
and restricted cash compared with $541.9 million at June 27, 2004. During fiscal year 2005, cash
and cash equivalents increased by $318.8 million, including cash provided by operating activities
of $425.9 million, partially offset by cash used for investing activities $58.7 million and cash
used for financing activities of $52.3 million.

Cash Flows From Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities of $425.9 million during fiscal year 2005, consisted
of (in millions):

Net income

$

299.3

Non-cash charges:

Restructuring

Depreciation and amortization

25.5

Other, net

5.8

Decrease in deferred tax assets

89.4

Change in other working capital accounts

(8.3

)

$

425.9

Significant changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal year 2005 include a decrease
of $13.5 million in net accounts receivable reflecting our focus on timely customer payments. We
discontinued use of our program to sell certain U.S. dollar-denominated accounts receivable during
the quarter ended June 26, 2005, and we have no current plans to continue usage of the program.
There were no uncollected sold receivables remaining as of June 26, 2005. The change in deferred
tax assets was primarily due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred
profit decreased by $18.9 million reflecting marginally higher
revenues as compared to shipments during fiscal year 2005.



Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2005 was $58.7 million and consisted
of net purchases of $63.3 million of short-term investments and net capital expenditures of $22.8
million which consisted primarily of engineering equipment. Restricted cash decreased by $27.4
million as a result of the closing of the property sale of certain lease facilities discussed in
the “Guarantees” section above.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2005 was $52.3 million including
stock repurchases of $167.1 million partially offset by net proceeds of $114.3 million from the
issuance of our common stock from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases
and $0.5 million of reissuance of treasury stock.

In October, 2004, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up
to $250 million of our common stock from the public market or in private purchases. The terms of
the repurchase program permit us to repurchase shares through September 30, 2007. During fiscal
year 2005, we repurchased 5,855,000 shares of common stock at a total price of $167.1 million. As
of June 26, 2005, the total amount available for repurchase under this program was $82.9 million.
We expect to continue to purchase shares under this program.

Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining
sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and
capital infrastructure. Based upon our current business outlook, we believe our levels of cash,
cash equivalents, and short-term investments at June 26, 2005 are sufficient to support our
presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, and capital expenditures, through at least
the next 12 months.

In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our
ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products. Should additional
funding be required, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or
private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, in the event of such requirements, we
will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives.
However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be
no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us.



Risk Factors

In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be
carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business because such factors may
significantly impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. As a result of these
risk factors, as well as other risks discussed in our other SEC filings, our actual results could
differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. No priority or
significance is intended, or should be attached, to the order in which the risk factors appear.

Our Quarterly Revenues and Operating Results are Unpredictable

Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to
a number of factors, not all of which are in our control. We manage our expense levels based in
part on our expectations of future revenues. If revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet
our expectations, our operating results may be adversely affected. Because our operating expenses
are based in part on anticipated future revenues, and a certain amount of those expenses are
relatively fixed, a change in the timing of recognition of revenue and/or the level of gross profit
from a single transaction can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter. Factors
that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include, but are not limited to:

Further, because a significant amount of our R&D and administrative operations and capacity is
located at our Fremont, California campus, natural, physical, logistical or other events or
disruptions affecting these facilities (including labor disruptions, earthquakes and power
failures) could adversely impact our financial performance.

We Derive Our Revenues Primarily from a Relatively Small Number of High-Priced Systems

System sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue. Our systems can typically
range in price from approximately $0.4 million to $5.7 million per unit, and our revenues in any
given quarter are dependent upon the acceptance of a rather limited number of such systems. As a
result, the inability to declare revenue on even a few systems can cause a significant adverse
impact on our revenues for that quarter.



Variations in the Amount of Time it Takes for Our Customers to Accept Our Systems May Cause
Fluctuation in Our Operating Results

We generally recognize revenue for new system sales on the date of customer acceptance or the
date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse. As a result, the fiscal period in which
we are able to recognize new systems revenues is typically subject to the length of time that our
customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation,
which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate.

The Semiconductor Equipment Industry Is Volatile and Reduced Product Demand Has a Negative Impact
on Shipments

Our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers,
which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and
products using integrated circuits. The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and
historically experiences periodic downturns. Business conditions historically have changed rapidly
and unpredictably.

Fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers could continue to materially
affect our aggregate shipments, revenues and operating results. We will attempt to respond to these
fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated
revenue streams, which sometimes result in restructuring charges. Even during periods of reduced
revenues, we must continue to invest in research and development and maintain extensive ongoing
worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive, which may temporarily
harm our financial results.

We Depend on New Products and Processes for Our Success. Consequently, We are Subject to Risks
Associated with Rapid Technological Change

Rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased
pressure to develop technological advances enabling such processes. We believe that our future
success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved
capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products. If new products have reliability or
quality problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs,
delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses.
We may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully, or new products that we
introduce may fail in the marketplace. Our failure to complete commercialization of these new
products in a timely manner could result in unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence, which
would adversely affect our financial results.

In order to develop new products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant
investments in R&D and to pursue joint development relationships with customers, suppliers or other
members of the industry. We must manage product transitions and joint development relationships
successfully, as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing
products. Moreover, future technologies, processes or product developments may render our current
product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive products, or obsolete inventory, or
both.

We Are Subject to Risks Relating to Product Concentration and Lack of Product Revenue
Diversification

We derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products, and we
expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near
term. Continued market acceptance of our primary products is, therefore, critical to our future
success. Our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could therefore be
adversely affected by:

•

a decline in demand for even a limited number of our products;

•

a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our key products;

•

export restrictions or other regulatory or legislative
actions which limit our ability to sell those products to key customer or market segments;



•

an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the market we participate in;

•

increased pressure from competitors that offer broader product lines;

•

technological change that we are unable to address with our products; and

•

a failure to release new enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis.

In addition, the fact that we offer a more limited product line creates the risk that our
customers may view us as less important to their business than are our competitors that offer
additional products as well. This may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with
certain customers. Such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated
with technology changes. Since we are primarily a provider of etch equipment, our business is
affected by our customers’ use of etching steps in their processes. Should technologies change so
that the manufacture of semiconductor chips requires fewer etching steps, this might have a larger
impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors.

We Have a Limited Number of Key Customers

Sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall
revenue, new orders and profitability. As a result, the actions of even one customer may subject us
to revenue swings that are difficult to predict. Similarly, significant portions of our credit risk
may, at any given time, be concentrated among a limited number of customers, so that the failure of
even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our
financial results.

Strategic Alliances May Have Negative Effects on our Business

Increasingly, semiconductor companies are entering into strategic alliances with one another
to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies. Often, one of the
outcomes of such an alliance is the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function or a
series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment. While this could work
to our advantage if Lam’s equipment becomes the basis for the function or process, it
could work to our disadvantage if a competitor’s tools or equipment become the standard equipment
for such function or process. In the latter case, even if Lam’s equipment was previously used by a
customer, that equipment may be displaced in current and future applications by the tools
standardized by the alliance.

Similarly, our customers may team with, or follow the lead of, educational or research
institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps. If
those institutions utilize a competitor’s equipment when they establish those processes, it is
likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing
lines. These actions could adversely impact our market share and subsequent business.

We Are Dependent Upon a Limited Number of Key Suppliers

We obtain certain components and sub-assemblies included in our products from a single
supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We have established long-term contracts with many of
these suppliers. These long-term contracts can take a variety of forms. We may renew these
contracts periodically. In some cases, these suppliers sold us products during at least the last
four years, and we expect that we will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we
will otherwise replace them with competent alternative suppliers. However, several of our
outsourced assembly suppliers are relatively new providers to us so that our experience with them
and their performance is limited. Where practical, our intent is to establish alternative sources
to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single supplier will adversely affect our business.
Nevertheless, a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could impair our ability to ship
products, lower our revenues and thus adversely affect our operating results and result in damage
to our customer relationships.



Our Outsource Providers May Fail to Perform as We Expect

Outsource providers have played and will play key roles in our manufacturing operations and in
many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology, facilities
management, and certain elements of our finance organization. Although we aim at selecting
reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts, it is
possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure
could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, the expansive role of outsource
providers has required and will continue to require us to implement changes to our existing
operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with and manage the performance of these outsource
providers. Any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes and new procedures
could adversely affect our customer relationships and/or have a negative effect on our operating
results.

Once a Semiconductor Manufacturer Commits to Purchase a Competitor’s Semiconductor Manufacturing
Equipment, the Manufacturer Typically Continues to Purchase That Competitor’s Equipment, Making It
More Difficult for Us to Sell our Equipment to That Customer

Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer
processing equipment into a semiconductor production line. We believe that once a semiconductor
manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment, the manufacturer generally
relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application. Accordingly, we expect it
to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor’s
equipment.

We Are Subject to Risks Associated with Our Competitors’ Strategic Relationships and Their
Introduction of New Products and We May Lack the Financial Resources or Technological Capabilities
of Certain of Our Competitors Needed to Capture Increased Market Share

We expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future competitors. We
believe that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and
are planning to introduce new products, which may affect our ability to sell our existing products.
We face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading
semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this
could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers.

We believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer
a broad range of products, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to
invest in product and process R&D. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial
resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and
support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the
semiconductor equipment industry. These competitors may deeply discount or give away products
similar to those that we sell, challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar
accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products. For these reasons, we may fail
to continue to compete successfully worldwide.

In addition, our competitors may provide innovative technology that may have performance
advantages over systems we currently, or expect to, offer. They may be able to develop products
comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving
customer requirements. In particular, while we currently are developing additional product
enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely
manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements
successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive.
Accordingly, we may be unable to continue to compete in our markets, competition may intensify, or
future competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial
condition, and/or cash flows.



Our Future Success Depends on International Sales and the Management of Global Operations

Non-U.S.
sales, accounted for approximately 84% in fiscal year 2005, 82% in fiscal
year 2004 and 72% in
fiscal year 2003 of our total revenue. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a
significant portion of our total revenue in future years. We are subject to various challenges
related to the management of global operations, and international sales are subject to risks
including, but not limited to:

Certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the U.S.
Government. Our failure or inability to obtain such licenses would substantially limit our markets
and severely restrict our revenues. Many of the challenges noted above are applicable in China,
which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of
potential significant growth for our business. As the business volume between China and the rest of
the world grows, there is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships between China, Taiwan,
Japan, and the United States, that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade
disruptions which would adversely affect our business with China and/or Taiwan and perhaps the
entire Asia region. A significant trade disruption in these areas could have a material,
adverse impact on our future revenue and profits.

We currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact
of the exchange rate fluctuations on Japanese Yen-denominated assets and forecasted Japanese Yen-denominated revenue and will continue to enter
into hedging transactions, for the purposes outlined, in the foreseeable future. However, these
hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual
timing of customer acceptances and our forecasts of those acceptances may leave us either over- or
under-hedged on any given transaction Moreover, by hedging our Yen-denominated assets with currency
forward contracts, we may miss favorable currency trends, that would have been advantageous to us
but for the hedges. Additionally, we currently do not enter into such forward contracts for
currencies other than the Yen, and we therefore are subject to both favorable and unfavorable
exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we have business (such as the payment of wages and
leases) in other currencies.

Our Financial Results May Be Adversely Impacted By Higher Than Expected Tax Rates Or Exposure To
Additional Income Tax Liabilities

As a global company, our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic
composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region. We are subject to
income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and significant judgment
is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities. Our effective tax rate could be adversely
affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates,
in the valuation of deferred tax assets, in tax laws or by material audit assessments, which could
affect our profitability. In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are
predominantly in the United States, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income
in the United States. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits
in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our
profitability. Further, if we elect to repatriate cash held outside the United States pursuant to
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, our tax rate may increase, even if by a lesser amount than
without such legislation.

Changes
in Accounting Standards for Stock-Based Compensation May Adversely
Affect our Operating Results, Our Stock Price, and Our
Competitiveness in the Employee Marketplace

The
adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) requires us to expense all
stock-based compensation provided to employees beginning with our
quarter ending September 25, 2005. The environment for skilled
employees that are knowledgeable about our products and services is a
competitive one, and we believe that stock-based compensation is an
important part of the overall compensation that we offer to attract
and retain such employees. SFAS No. 123(R) will decrease
our earnings based on its measure of the value of stock-based
compensation. There is some risk that the design of our compensation
plans is ineffective at balancing our profitability and employee
retention objectives. Moreover, as we will be adopting these rules
before certain other companies in our industry, there may be, for
some period of time, an appearance that our earnings are lower than
those of comparable companies that have not yet adopted
SFAS No. 123(R), which could have a negative effect on our
stock price.



A Failure to Comply with Environmental Regulations May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results

We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal
of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals. We believe that we are in general compliance
with these regulations and that we have obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise addressing) all
necessary environmental permits to conduct our business. These permits generally relate to the
disposal of hazardous wastes. Nevertheless, the failure to comply with present or future
regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, cessation of our
operations or reduction in our customers’ acceptance of our products. These regulations could
require us to alter our current operations, to acquire significant equipment or to incur
substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Our failure to control the
use, sale, transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities.

If We Are Unable to Adjust the Scale of Our Business in Response to Rapid Changes in Demand in the
Semiconductor Equipment Industry, Our Operating Results and Our Ability to Compete Successfully May
Be Impaired

The business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry has historically been characterized
by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our management to adjust spending and
resources allocated to operating activities. During periods of rapid growth or decline in demand
for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and
business controls, management processes, information systems and procedures and in training,
managing, and appropriately sizing our supply chain, our work force and other components of our
business on a timely basis. Our success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our
executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these
challenges effectively. If we do not adequately meet these challenges, our gross margins and
earnings may be impaired during periods of demand decline, and we may lack the infrastructure and
resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during
periods of demand growth.

If We Choose to Acquire or Dispose of Product Lines and Technologies, We May Encounter Unforeseen
Costs and Difficulties That Could Impair Our Financial Performance

An important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would
complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, or enhance
our technological capabilities. As a result, we may make acquisitions of complementary companies,
products or technologies, or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies,
which no longer fit our long-term strategies. Managing an acquired business, disposing of product
technologies or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks, including
difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business
or product groups, diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns,
amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of
acquired or disposed operations among others. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of
product lines or technologies, or reduction in personnel or that our management, personnel, or
systems will be adequate to support continued operations. Any such inabilities or inadequacies
could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and
cash flows.

In addition, any acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances
of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of
related intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and/or the price of our Common
Stock.



The Market for Our Common Stock is Extremely Volatile, Which May Affect Our Ability to Raise
Capital or Make Acquisitions

The market price for our Common Stock is extremely volatile and has fluctuated significantly
over the past years. The trading price of our Common Stock could continue to be highly volatile and
fluctuate widely in response to factors, including but not limited to the following:

In addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations.
Historically, we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our Common Stock due in part
to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for
semiconductors. These broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the
price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following
volatile periods in the price of stock, many companies became the object of securities class action
litigation. If we are sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs, and it
could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on the price for
our Common Stock.

We Rely Upon Certain Critical Information Systems for the Operation of our Business

We maintain and rely upon certain critical Information Systems for the effective operation of
our business. These Information Systems include telecommunications, the internet, our corporate
intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, network communications, and e-mail.
These Information Systems may be owned by us or by our outsource providers or even third parties
such as vendors and contractors and may be maintained by us or by such providers and third parties.
These Information Systems are subject to attacks, failures, and access denials from a number of
potential sources including viruses, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, and physical
damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines, and networking equipment. To the extent that
these Information Systems are under our control, we have implemented security procedures, such as
virus protection software and emergency recovery processes, to address the outlined risks; however,
security procedures for Information Systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability
to use or access these Information Systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the
timely and efficient operation of our business.

The Potential Anti-Takeover Effects of Our Certificate of Incorporation May Inhibit a Change of
Control Desired by Some of Our Stockholders

Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes issuance of 5,000,000 shares of undesignated
Preferred Stock. Our Board of Directors, without further stockholder approval, may issue this
Preferred Stock on such terms as the Board of Directors may determine, which also could have the
effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Lam. The issuance of Preferred Stock could
also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our Common Stock, including causing the
loss of voting control. Moreover, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law restricts
certain business combinations with “interested
stockholders”, as defined by that statute. Such factors might deter certain acquirers from
making takeover proposals or tender offers, even if such takeover proposals or control changes
could improve our short-term stock price.



Intellectual Property and Other Claims Against Us Can Be Costly and Could Result in the Loss of
Significant Rights Which Are Necessary to Our Continued Business and Profitability

Third parties may assert infringement, unfair competition or other claims against us. From
time to time, other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or
other intellectual property rights. In addition, our Bylaws and indemnity obligations provide that
we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings
resulting from their service to Lam. In such cases, it is our policy either to defend the claims or
to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms. However, we may be
unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on
commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and any litigation resulting from these claims by other
parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Moreover, although we
seek to obtain insurance to protect us from claims and cover losses to our property, there is no
guarantee that such insurance will fully indemnify us for any losses that we may incur.

We May Fail to Protect Our Proprietary Technology Rights, Which Would Affect Our Business

Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology. While we attempt to protect our
proprietary technology through patents, copyrights and trade secret protection, we believe that our
success also depends on increasing our technological expertise, continuing our development of new
systems, increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base, and providing
comprehensive support and service to our customers. However, we may be unable to protect our
technology in all instances, or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology
independently. We currently hold a number of United States and foreign patents and pending patent
applications. However, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any
patents the United States or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue
patents for pending applications. In addition, the rights granted or anticipated under any of these
patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or, in fact provide no
competitive advantages.

We Are Subject to the Internal Control Evaluation and Attestation Requirements of Section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required, beginning with our
fiscal year ended June 26, 2005, to include in our annual report our assessment of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our audited financial statements
as of the end of each fiscal year. Furthermore, our independent registered public accounting firm
(Firm) is required to attest to whether our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting is fairly stated in all material respects and separately report on whether
it believes we maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of the end of each fiscal year. We have successfully completed our assessment and
obtained our Firm’s attestation as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of June 26, 2005. In future years, if we fail to timely complete this assessment, or
if our Firm cannot timely attest to our assessment, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and
a loss of public confidence in our internal control. In addition, any failure to implement required
new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our
operating results or cause us to fail to timely meet our regulatory reporting obligations.

Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Must Confirm Its Independence in Order for Us to
Meet Our Regulatory Reporting Obligations on a Timely Basis

Our independent registered public accounting firm communicates with us at least annually
regarding any relationships between the Firm and Lam that, in the Firm’s professional
judgment, might have a bearing on the Firm’s independence with
respect to us. If, for
whatever reason, our independent registered public accounting firm finds that it cannot confirm
that it is independent of Lam based
on existing securities laws and registered public accounting firm independence standards, we
could experience delays or other failures to meet our regulatory reporting obligations.



Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment
portfolio. We maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and
preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, and reinvestment risk.
The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted-average interest rates by year of
maturity for our investment portfolio at June 26, 2005 and June 27, 2004:

We mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by constantly
positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of
any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active
secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of
diversification.

We conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As
such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency
exchange rates. The majority of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars except for certain of
our revenues in Japan that are denominated in Japanese Yen, and certain of our spares and service
contracts which are denominated in other currencies. The majority of our expenses are denominated
in U.S. dollars except for expenses related to our non U.S. sales and support offices which are
denominated in these countries’ local currency. As a result, we believe that our primary exposure
to foreign exchange rate fluctuation is naturally hedged (the revenue in local currency partially
offsets the exposure to local currency expenses) except for our Japanese Yen revenue exposure in
Japan. For this reason, we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign
currency forward contracts. We defer the gains and losses on these contracts and recognize them in
income during the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income. We also enter
into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the
remeasurement of Japanese Yen-denominated receivable balances. The change in fair value of these
contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income and offsets the change in fair
value of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables assuming the hedge
contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances.

On June 26, 2005, the notional amount of outstanding Japanese Yen forward contracts that are
designated as balance sheet hedges was $32.6 million. The unrealized loss on the contracts on June
26, 2005, was $0.4 million. A 15% appreciation of the Japanese Yen would result in an unrealized
loss of $5.8 million. Depreciation in the exchange rate of the Japanese Yen of approximately 15%
would result in an unrealized gain of $4.2 million. On June 26, 2005, the notional amount of
outstanding Japanese Yen forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges was $66.2
million. A 15% appreciation of the Japanese Yen would result in an unrealized loss of $11.7
million. Depreciation in the exchange rate of the Japanese Yen of approximately 15% would result
in an unrealized gain of $8.6 million.

Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

The Consolidated Financial Statements required by this Item are set forth on the pages
indicated at Item 15(a). The unaudited quarterly results of our operations for our two most recent
fiscal years are incorporated herein by reference under Item 6, “Selected Consolidated Financial
Data”.

Item 9.

None.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), as of the close of fiscal year June 26, 2005, we
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer along with our
Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the
reasonable assurance level.

We intend to review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures on an ongoing basis and to correct any material deficiencies that we may discover. Our
goal is to ensure that our senior management has timely access to material information that could
affect our business.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control—Integrated
Framework” published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to
evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, management has
concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of June 26, 2005 at providing
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Ernst
& Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm,
has audited management’s assessment of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report, which is included at the end of Part II, Item 8 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most
recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.

Effectiveness of Controls

While we believe the present design of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting is effective, future events affecting our business may cause us to
modify our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting. The
effectiveness of controls cannot be absolute because the cost to design and implement a control to
identify errors or mitigate the risk of errors occurring should not outweigh the potential loss
caused by the errors that would likely be detected by the control. Moreover, we believe that a
control system cannot be guaranteed to be 100% effective all of the time. Accordingly, a control
system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met.



Item 9B. Other Information

Termination of Lease Supplements under Master Lease in Connection With Transfer of Properties
by Lessor.

On June 10, 2005, Lam filed a Form 8-K disclosing that it had received a notice of approval
from a designated buyer under a contract to purchase two properties at its Fremont, California
campus. Lam had vacated these properties in connection with previously disclosed restructuring
plans. The properties being purchased were two of four properties leased by Lam from SELCO Services
Corporation under the Amended and Restated Master Lease and Deed of Trust, dated as of June 1,
2003, between SELCO, as lessor, and Lam, as lessee (the “

Master Lease

”) and the related
Participation Agreement among Lam, SELCO, and Key Equipment Finance, Inc. (formerly known as Key
Corporation Capital Inc.), as lender and administrative agent.

At the closing of the sale of the two properties, which occurred on June 21, 2005, the lessor
deeded the purchased properties to the buyer and Lam was released from its obligations under the
June 2003 lease agreements with respect to the properties covered by Lease Supplements No. 4, No.
5, No. 6 and No. 7, each dated as of June 1, 2003, between Lam and the lessor. The remaining June
1, 2003 lease agreements shall continue in effect with respect to the two properties remaining
subject to the Master Lease.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JUNE 26, 2005

Note 1: Company and Industry Information

Lam Research Corporation (Lam or the Company) is a major supplier of wafer fabrication
equipment and services to the world’s semiconductor industry. The Company markets and sells
product offerings that include single-wafer plasma etch systems with a wide range of applications,
wafer cleaning systems, and an array of services designed to optimize the utilization of these
systems by its customers. The Company sells its products and services primarily to companies
involved in the production of semiconductors in the United States, Europe, Japan, Korea and Asia
Pacific.

The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic
downturns and upturns. Over the recent business cycles, the severity of these fluctuations has
increased, and today’s leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns may not be any
more reliable than in prior years. Demand for the Company’s equipment can vary significantly from
period to period as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, economic
conditions, supply, demand, and prices for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and the
Company’s ability to develop and market competitive products. For these and other reasons, the
Company’s results of operations for fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003 may not necessarily be
indicative of future operating results.

Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that could affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company based its estimates and
assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable,
and evaluates them on an on-going basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions.
Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

: The Company recognizes all revenue when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the
selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and it
has completed its system installation obligations, received customer
acceptance or is otherwise
released from its installation or customer acceptance obligations. In the event that terms of the
sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, the Company recognizes revenue upon the
expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. In
circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the
terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, the Company recognizes revenue where
it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed to customer
specifications. In situations with multiple deliverables, revenue is recognized upon the delivery
of the separate elements to the customer and when the Company receives customer acceptance or is
otherwise released from its customer acceptance obligations. Revenue from multiple element
arrangements is allocated among the separate elements based on their relative fair values, provided
the elements have value on a stand alone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of fair
value, the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item
and delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in
the Company’s control. The maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the
amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. Revenue related to sales of
spare parts and system upgrade kits is generally recognized upon shipment. Revenue related to
services is generally recognized upon completion of the services requested by a customer order.
Revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the term of the contract.



Inventory Valuation

: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard
costs, which approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company maintains a
perpetual inventory system
and continuously records the quantity on-hand and standard cost for each product, including
purchased components, subassemblies and finished goods. The Company maintains the integrity of
perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand. Finished goods
are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. Generally, title
transfer is documented in the terms of sale. When the terms of sale do not specify, the Company
assumes title transfers when it completes physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier
unless other customer practices prevail. Transfer of title for shipments to Japanese customers
generally occurs at time of customer acceptance.

Standard costs are re-assessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs,
generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts, currently obtainable assembly
and test labor performance levels, and overhead for internally manufactured products. Manufacturing
labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to
absorb spending at average utilization volumes. All intercompany profits related to the sales and
purchases of inventory between the Company’s legal entities are eliminated from the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least
quarterly. The Company’s policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories, including
manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods and spare parts in each reporting
period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over
the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value, if less than cost. Inherent
in the estimates of market value are management’s forecasts related to the Company’s future
manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general
semiconductor market conditions, possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess
inventory. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than the Company’s
projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required, and would be reflected in cost of
sales in the period the revision is made.

Warranty

: Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and
service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. The Company offers
standard warranties for its systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system
acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer. When appropriate,
the Company records a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system
upon revenue recognition. The amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity, which
uses factors such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such as
tool reliability trends. All actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are
charged to those established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping.

Actual warranty expenses are incurred on a system-by-system basis, and may differ from the
Company’s original estimates. While the Company periodically monitors the performance and cost of
warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than its estimates, the Company may
recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are
identified. Accordingly, actual costs that exceed the estimates are expensed as incurred, and at
the same time, additional probable and estimable liabilities may be recorded.

The Company does not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are
related to specific systems.

In addition to the provision of standard warranties, the Company offers customer-paid extended
warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment
amount are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are
recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and
estimable.

Stock-Based
Compensation — Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock
Incentive Plans

: The Company accounts for its
employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) and stock option plans under the provisions of Accounting
Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 “Accounting For Stock Issued to Employees” (APB No. 25) and
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 44, “Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation — an
Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25” (FIN No. 44) and makes pro forma footnote disclosures as
required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 148, “Accounting For Stock-Based



Compensation — Transition and Disclosure”, which amends SFAS No. 123, “Accounting For
Stock-Based Compensation”. The Company’s ESPP is a non-compensatory plan, and its stock option
plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of APB No. 25. Please
see Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 3 below regarding the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R)
which will become effective during the Company’s fiscal quarter ending September 25, 2005.

Pro forma information regarding net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share is required
by SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”, as amended by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure” as if the Company had accounted for its
stock option and stock purchase plans under the fair value method of SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148.
Pro forma net income (loss) and pro forma net income (loss) per share disclosed below are
estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes option valuation model
was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting
restrictions and which are fully transferable. In addition, the Black-Scholes model requires the
input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated
life of each option. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and net income per
share if the Company had accounted for its stock option and stock purchase plans under the fair
value method of accounting under SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148:

For pro forma purposes, the estimated fair value of the Company’s stock compensation is
amortized over the options’ vesting period (for options) and the respective four, eight, or
twelve-month purchase periods (for stock purchases under the employee stock purchase plan.) The
fair value of all of the Company’s stock compensation was estimated assuming no expected dividends
and estimates of expected life, volatility and risk-free interest rate at the time of grant. The
fair value of the Company’s stock-based awards granted and stock purchases under the ESPP during
fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003 was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:

Income Taxes

: Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences
between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the
amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its
deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of the
Company’s net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. The Company believes it is
more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be
negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time.
In the event that the Company determines that it would not be able to realize all or part of its
net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such
determination is made. Likewise, if the Company later determines that it is more likely than not
that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance
would be reversed.

The Company calculates its current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and
assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during
the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified, which is
generally in the third quarter of the subsequent year for U.S. federal and state provisions.

The Company provides for income taxes on the basis of annual estimated effective income tax
rates. Lam’s estimated effective income tax rate reflects the underlying profitability of the
Company, the region where profits are recorded and the respective tax rates imposed. The Company
carefully monitors these factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate, if necessary. If
actual results differ from estimates, the Company could be required to record an additional
valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate, which could
have a material impact on its business, results of operations, and financial condition.

The calculation of the Company’s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the
application of complex tax laws. The Company’s estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain
tax issue is highly judgmental. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with
the Company’s expectations could have a material impact on the
Company’s results of operations and
financial condition. The Company accounts for the income tax contingencies in accordance with
SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”.

Fiscal Year:

The Company follows a 52/53-week fiscal reporting calendar and its fiscal year
ends on the last Sunday of June each year. The Company’s most recent fiscal year ended on June 26,
2005 and included 52 weeks. The fiscal year ended June 27, 2004 also included 52 weeks. The
Company’s next fiscal year, ending on June 25, 2006, will include 52 weeks.

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments:

All investments purchased with an original
maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. All of the Company’s
short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale at the respective balance sheet dates.
The Company accounts for its investment portfolio at fair value. The investments classified as
available-for-sale are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices, and any material
temporary difference between the cost and fair value of an investment is presented as a separate
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss.) The specific identification method is
used to determine the realized gains and losses on investments.

Property and Equipment:

Property and equipment is stated at cost. Equipment is depreciated by
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to seven
years. Leasehold improvements are amortized by the straight-line method over the shorter of the
life of the related asset or the term of the underlying lease.



Restructuring Charges:

In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146 “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities” (SFAS No. 146). SFAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for
costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit
an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)” (EITF 94-3). The Company
early-adopted SFAS No. 146 in the quarter ended December 29, 2002. SFAS No. 146 requires that a
liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability
is incurred, rather than when the exit or disposal plan is approved. Accordingly, restructuring
accruals are recorded when management, with the proper level of authority, approves the specific
actions under a plan, communicates the reduction activities and severance packages to the affected
employees, and vacates the facilities, or otherwise terminates a contract in accordance with its
terms, included in the plan. Accruals related to vacated facilities are calculated net of estimated
sublease income, and leasehold improvements related to vacated facilities are written off as these
items have no future economic benefit. Sublease income is estimated based on current market
estimates. If the Company is unable to sublet the vacated properties on a timely basis, the Company
adjusts the accrual accordingly.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

: The Company routinely considers whether indicators of
impairment of long-lived assets are present. If such indicators are present, the Company determines
whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is
less than their carrying value. If the sum is less, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based
on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is
determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. If the assets determined
to be impaired are to be held and used, the Company recognizes an impairment charge to the extent
the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset’s
carrying value. The fair value of the asset then becomes the asset’s new carrying value, which the
Company depreciates over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. Assets to be disposed of
are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Derivative Financial Instruments:

The Company carries derivative financial instruments
(derivatives) on the balance sheet at their fair values in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (SFAS
No. 133). The Company has a policy that allows the use of derivative financial instruments,
specifically foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts, to hedge foreign currency exchange
rate fluctuations on forecasted revenue transactions denominated in Japanese Yen and other foreign
currency denominated assets. The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative
purposes.

The Company’s policy is to attempt to minimize short-term business exposure to foreign
currency exchange rate risks using an effective and efficient method to eliminate or reduce such
exposures. In the normal course of business, the Company’s financial position is routinely
subjected to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. To protect
against the reduction in value of forecasted Japanese Yen-denominated revenues, the Company has
instituted a foreign currency cash flow hedging program. The Company enters into foreign currency
forward exchange rate contracts that generally expire within 12 months, and no later than 24
months. These foreign currency forward exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and
are carried on the Company’s balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the
contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and
subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue is recognized. Each
period, hedges are tested for effectiveness by comparing the change in value of the derivative with
the change in the value of the anticipated sales transactions. To qualify for hedge accounting,
the hedge relationship must meet criteria relating both to the derivative instrument and the hedged
item. These include identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the
risk being hedged and how the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to
changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows will be measured.



When derivative instruments are designated and qualify as effective hedges of identified fair
value exposures, the Company is able to offset changes in the fair value of the identified
exposures by changes in
the fair value of the hedging instruments. When derivative instruments are designated and qualify
as effective cash flow hedges, the Company is able to defer changes in the fair value of the
hedging instrument within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged exposure
is realized. Consequently, with the exception of hedge ineffectiveness recognized, the Company’s
results of operations are not subject to fluctuation as a result of changes in the fair value of
the derivative instruments. If hedges are not highly effective or if the Company does not believe
that forecasted transactions would occur, the Company may not be able to account for its
investments in derivative instruments as hedges. If this were to occur in a future period, changes
in the fair values of the Company’s derivative instruments would be recognized in operations
without the benefits of offsets or deferrals of changes in fair value arising from hedge accounting
treatment.

The Company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts to hedge the
gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of Japanese Yen-denominated receivable balances.
Under SFAS No. 133, these forward contracts are not designated
accounting hedges. Therefore, the change in
fair value of these derivatives is recorded into earnings as a component of other income and
expense and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and
trade receivables assuming the hedge contract fully covers the
intercompany and trade receivable balances.

To hedge foreign currency risks, the Company uses foreign currency exchange forward contracts,
where possible and practical. These forward contracts are valued using standard valuation formulas
with assumptions about future foreign currency exchange rates derived from existing exchange rates
and interest rates observed in the market.

The Company considers its most current outlook in determining the level of foreign currency
denominated intercompany revenues to hedge. The Company combines these forecasts with historical
trends to establish the portion of its expected volume to be hedged. The revenues are hedged for
exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Should the level of revenues expected
not occur, the Company’s investments in derivatives used to hedge changes in foreign currency
exchange rates may not qualify for hedge accounting.

The Company does not believe that it is or was exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit
risk in its interest rate and foreign currency hedges, as counterparties are established and
well-capitalized financial institutions. The Company’s exposures are in liquid currencies (Japanese
Yen), so there is minimal risk that appropriate derivatives to
maintain the Company’s hedging program would
not be available in the future.

Guarantees:

The Company accounts for guarantees in accordance with FASB Interpretation No.
45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees to Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and a rescission of
FASB Interpretation No. 34” (FIN No. 45). Accordingly, the Company evaluates its guarantees to
determine whether (a) the guarantee is specifically excluded from the scope of FIN No. 45, (b) the
guarantee is subject to FIN No. 45 disclosure requirements only, but not subject to the initial
recognition and measurement provisions, or (c) the guarantee is required to be recorded in the
financial statements at fair value. The Company has recorded a liability for certain guaranteed
residual values related to specific facility lease agreements. The Company has evaluated its
remaining guarantees and has concluded that they are either not within the scope of FIN No. 45 or
do not require recognition in the financial statements. These guarantees generally include certain
indemnifications to its lessors under operating lease agreements for environmental matters,
potential overdraft protection obligations to financial institutions related to one of the
Company’s subsidiaries, recourse provisions related to sales of accounts receivable,
indemnifications to the Company’s customers for certain infringement of third-party intellectual
property rights by its products and services, and the Company’s warranty obligations under sales of
its products. Please see Note 16 for additional information on the Company’s guarantees.

Foreign Currency:

Throughout
fiscal year 2005, the functional currencies of the Company’s
European, Japanese, Korean, and Asia Pacific subsidiaries were generally the individual subsidiaries’ local
currencies. The Company’s subsidiaries primarily generate and
expend cash in their local currency. Billings and receipts for their labor and services are primarily denominated in the local currency
and the workforce is paid in local currency. Their individual assets and liabilities are primarily
denominated in the local foreign currency and



do not materially impact the Company’s cash flows. Accordingly, all balance sheet accounts of
these local functional currency subsidiaries are translated at the fiscal period-end exchange rate,
and income statement accounts are translated at an average rate for the period. The resulting
translation adjustments are recorded as cumulative translation adjustments, and are a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Reclassifications:

Certain amounts presented in the comparative financial statements for prior
years have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal year 2005 presentation.

Note 3: Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on recognition and
measurement guidance previously discussed under EITF 03-01. The consensus clarifies the meaning of
other-than-temporary impairment and its application to investments classified as either
available-for-sale or held-to-maturity under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” and investments accounted
for under the cost method or the equity method. In September 2004, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued a final FASB Staff Position (FSP), EITF Issue 03-01-1, which
indefinitely delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance of EITF 03-01.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting EITF 03-01.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory
Costs — An Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43
(ARB No. 43),
Chapter 4,” which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
handling costs and wasted material (spoilage). The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 151 in
fiscal year 2006 and its adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s
results of operations or financial position.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123
(revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment.” This
Statement is a revision of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”, and supersedes
APB No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”, and its related implementation guidance. In
March, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107
(SAB No. 107) which provides the Staff’s views regarding interactions between SFAS No. 123(R) and
certain SEC rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share-based
payments for public companies. SFAS No. 123(R) requires that compensation cost relating to
share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements. That cost will be
measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. SFAS No. 123(R)
will be effective for the Company beginning with the quarter ended September 25, 2005.

The effects of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on the Company’s results of operations and
financial position are dependent upon a number of factors, including the number of employee stock
options outstanding and unvested, the number of stock-based awards which may be granted in the
future, the life and vesting features of stock-based awards which may be granted in the future, the
future market value and volatility of the Company’s stock, movements in the risk free rate of
interest, award exercise and forfeiture patterns, and the valuation model used to estimate the fair
value of each award. The Company is currently evaluating these variables in the design of its
stock-based compensation program as well as the accounting requirements under SFAS No. 123(R) and
SAB No. 107. In addition, the Company intends to utilize
restricted stock units as a key component of its ongoing employee
incentive-based compensation plan. These awards generally are
recorded at their fair value, equal to the quoted market price of the
Company’s common stock on the date of issuance, and this amount
is subsequently amortized ratably over the vesting period of the
shares of restricted stock held by the employee. Based on the expense for the Company’s ESPP, its outstanding unvested options, and
any outstanding unvested restricted stock units, the Company believes
that the expense for stock-based compensation for the quarter ending September 25, 2005 will
range from $8 million to $10 million, pre-tax.



In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment
of APB Opinion No. 29.” The amendments made by SFAS No. 153 are based on the principle that
exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged.
SFAS No. 153 also eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets
and replaces it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have
commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal
periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company will apply its provisions prospectively upon
adoption, and its adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s results of
operations or financial position.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.” This
statement replaces APB No. 20 and SFAS No. 3 and changes the requirements for the accounting for
and reporting of a change in accounting principle. APB No. 20 previously required that most
voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of
the change the cumulative effect of changing to the accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 requires
retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting
principle. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS
No. 154 will have a significant impact on its results of operations or financial position.

The Company accounts for its investment portfolio at fair value. Realized gains and
(losses) from investments sold were approximately $0.1 million and ($0.9) million in fiscal year
2005 and approximately $0.2 million and ($0.3) million in fiscal year 2004. Realized gains and
(losses) for investments sold are specifically identified. Management assesses the fair value of
investments in debt securities that are not actively traded through consideration of interest rates
and their impact on the present value of the cash flows to be received from the investments. The
Company also considers whether changes in the credit ratings of the issuer could impact the
assessment of fair value. The fair value of the Company’s investments in auction rate preferred
securities is based upon par value, which approximates fair value due to the nature of the
instruments.



The Company’s available-for-sale securities are invested in financial instruments with a
minimum rating of A2 / A, as rated by two of the following three rating agencies: Moody’s, Standard
& Poor’s (S&P), or Fitch.

The amortized cost and fair value of investments in debt securities with contractual
maturities is as follows:

Management has the ability and intent, if necessary, to liquidate any of its investments in
order to meet the Company’s liquidity needs in the next 12 months. Accordingly, those investments
with contractual maturities greater than one year from the date of purchase have been classified as
short-term on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk
consist principally of cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade accounts receivable and
derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities.

As noted above, the Company’s available-for-sale securities are invested in financial
instruments with a minimum rating of A2 / A, as rated by two of the following three rating
agencies: Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s (S&P), or Fitch, respectively and its policy limits the amount
of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer.

Credit risk evaluations, including trade references, bank references and Dun & Bradstreet
ratings are performed on all new customers, and subsequent to credit application approval, the
Company monitors its customers’ financial statements and payment performance. In general, the
Company does not require collateral on sales.

The fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts is estimated based upon the
Japanese Yen exchange rates at June 26, 2005 and June 27, 2004, respectively.

At June 26, 2005, the notional amount of outstanding Japanese Yen forward contracts that are
designated as cash flow hedges was $66.2 million. The Company had no cash flow hedges at June 27,
2004. At June 26, 2005 and June 27, 2004, the notional amount of Japanese Yen forward contracts
that are designated as balance sheet hedges was $32.6 million and $48.1 million, respectively.

The Company has an agreement to sell specific U.S. dollar-denominated receivables. The
Company discontinued use of this program during the quarter ended June 26, 2005 and currently has
no plans to continue usage of the program. None of these receivables remained uncollected at June
26, 2005. At June 27, 2004, $60.0 million of these receivables remained uncollected, of which $6.0
million were subject to recourse provisions.



Note 5: Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging

The Company carries derivative financial instruments (derivatives) on the balance sheet at
their fair values in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (SFAS No. 133). See Note 2 for
information on the Company’s policies with respect to derivative financial instruments and hedging.
The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted Japanese Yen-denominated revenues, the
Company has instituted a foreign currency cash flow hedging program. The Company enters into
foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts that generally expire within 12 months, and no
later than 24 months. These foreign currency forward exchange contracts are designated as cash flow
hedges and are carried on the Company’s balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of
the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and
subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue is recognized. Each
period, hedges are tested for effectiveness by comparing the change in value of the derivative with
the change in the value of the anticipated sales transactions. There were no gains or losses during
fiscal year 2005 associated with forecasted transactions that failed to occur. A net gain of $0.3
million for fiscal year 2004 was recognized in Other Income and Expense associated with cash flow
hedges where the original forecasted transactions did not occur within the specified hedge period.

At June 26, 2005, the Company expects to reclassify the entire amount of $0.8 million
accumulated in other comprehensive income to earnings during the next 12 months due to the
recognition in earnings of the hedged forecasted transactions.

The Company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts to hedge the
gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of Japanese Yen-denominated receivable balances.
Under SFAS No. 133, these forward contracts are not designated hedges. Therefore, the change in fair
value of these derivatives is recorded into earnings as a component of other income and offsets the
change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables
assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade
receivable balances.

9: Stockholders’ Equity

In October, 2004, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the
repurchase of up to $250 million of Company common stock from the public market or in private
purchases. The terms of the repurchase program permit the Company to repurchase shares through
September 30, 2007. The Company plans to continue to execute the
program. Consistent with the authorization, share repurchases for the
fiscal year ended June 26, 2005 were as follows:

During fiscal year 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of approximately 469,000 employee
stock options. The Company decided to accelerate vesting of these options as the expense
recognized in fiscal year 2005 as a result of this decision was lower than the expense that would be recognized in
future periods upon the adoption of SFAS No. 123R in July 2005. There were no Section 16 officers
or directors included in this acceleration. Included in this acceleration of vesting were
approximately 258,000 in-the-money options, which resulted in a compensation charge of $0.4 million
recorded in the Company’s fiscal year 2005 Consolidated Statements of Operations. This
compensation charge was calculated in accordance with APB No. 25 and FIN No. 44 and was based on
the options’ intrinsic value on the date of modification.

As of June 26, 2005, the Company had $1.2 million remaining in deferred
stock-based compensation. This balance relates to restricted stock units granted to certain of the
Company’s employees. The grant of these units has been accounted for in accordance with APB No. 25
and EITF 00-23, “Issues Related to the Accounting for Stock Compensation under APB Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”, and FASB Interpretation No. 44, “Accounting for Certain
Transactions involving Stock Compensation.”” Accordingly, these units were valued using the
intrinsic value as calculated by the market price at the date of grant. This resulted in a fixed
non-cash compensation charge which is being recognized on a straight-line basis in earnings over
the related service period.

Note 11: Net Income (Loss) Per Share

Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per
share is computed, using the treasury stock method, as though all potential common shares that are
dilutive were outstanding during the period. Potential common shares are excluded from the diluted
net loss per share calculations as the effect would be antidilutive due to the net loss for the
period. The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the

basic and diluted computations for net income (loss) per share.

Note 13: Stock Plans and Stock Purchase Plan

The Company has adopted stock plans that provide for the grant to key employees of stock-based
awards to purchase shares of the Company’s Common Stock. In addition, the plans permit the grant of
nonstatutory stock-based awards to paid consultants and employees, and provide for the automatic
grant of nonstatutory stock-based awards to outside directors. The stock-based award price is
determined by the Board of Directors or its designee, the plan administrator, but in no event will
it be less than the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant.
Stock-based awards granted under the plans vest over a period determined by the Board of Directors
or the plan administrator. Under the automatic grant program, each outside director receives an
option immediately exercisable for 15,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock during December of
each year during which the outside director serves, with the exercise price equal to the fair
market value on the date of grant.

The 1997 Stock Incentive Plan and the 1999 Stock Option Plan provide for the grant of
non-qualified stock-based awards to eligible employees, consultants and advisors, and non-employee
directors of the Company and its subsidiaries. Initially, 9.0 million shares were reserved for
issuance under each plan. During fiscal year 2005, an additional 6.0 million shares were reserved
for issuance under the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan evergreen provision. During the last three fiscal
years, the Board of Directors approved an additional 3.0 million
shares under the 1999 Stock Option Plan in fiscal year 2003.

The 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the 1999 ESPP) allows employees to designate a portion
of their base compensation to be used to purchase the Company’s Common Stock at a purchase price
per share of the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the first
or last day of the applicable offering period. Typically, each offering period lasts 12 months and
comprises three interim purchase dates. The 1999 ESPP, approved by the Company’s stockholders at
the Annual Meeting of Stockholders on November 5, 1998, replaced the existing 1984 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (1984 ESPP). At June 29, 2003 the Company had 9.0 million shares of Lam Common Stock
reserved for issuance under the 1999 ESPP: 3.0 million shares may be issued at any time and
additional shares (previously 6.0 million total additional shares) may be issued for each share of
the Company’s Common Stock which the Company redeems in
public-market or private purchases and
designated for this purpose. In fiscal year 2004, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment
to the 1999 ESPP to (i) each year automatically increase the number of shares available for
issuance under the Plan by a specific amount on a one-for-one basis with shares of Common Stock
that the Company will redeem in public market and private purchases for such purpose and (ii) to
authorize the Plan Administrator (the Compensation Committee of the Board) to set a limit on the
number of shares a Plan participant can purchase on any single Plan exercise date. The automatic
annual increase provides that the number of shares in the Plan reserve available for issuance shall
be increased on the first business day of each calendar year commencing with 2004, on a one-for-one
basis with each share of Common Stock that the Company redeems, in public-market or private
purchases, and designates for this purpose, by a number of shares equal to the lesser of (i)
2,000,000, (ii) one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the number of shares of all classes of common
stock of the Company outstanding on the first business day of such calendar year, or (iii) a lesser
number determined by the Plan Administrator. During fiscal year 2004, the number of shares of Lam
Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 1999 ESPP increased by 2.0 million shares to 11.0
million shares, subject to repurchase of an equal number of shares in public market or private
purchases. There were no increases to the reserve during fiscal year 2005.

During fiscal year 2005, 764,608 shares of the Company’s Common Stock were sold to employees
under the 1999 ESPP. A total of 9,023,111 shares of the Company’s Common Stock have been issued
under the 1999 ESPP Plan through June 26, 2005, at prices
ranging from $4.11 to $31.84 per share.
At June 26, 2005, 1,970,717 shares were available for purchase under the 1999 ESPP Plan.

Note 14: Profit Sharing and Benefit Plans

Profit sharing is awarded to certain employees based upon performance against specific
corporate financial and operating goals. Distributions to employees by the Company are based upon a
percentage of earned compensation, provided that a threshold level of the Company’s financial and
performance goals are met. In addition to profit sharing the Company has other bonus plans based on
achievement of profitability and other specific performance criteria. Charges to expense under
these plans were $63.1 million, $30.9 million, and $9.7 million during fiscal years 2005, 2004, and
2003, respectively.

The Company maintains a 401(k)-retirement savings plan for its full-time employees in North
America. Each participant in the plan may elect to contribute from 2% to 20% of his or her annual
salary to the plan, subject to statutory limitations. The Company makes matching employee
contributions in cash to the plan at the rate of 50% of the first 6% of salary contributed.
Employees participating in the 401(k)-retirement savings plan are 100% vested in the Company
matching contributions and investments are directed by participants. The Company made matching
contributions of approximately $3.2 million, $3.0 million, and $3.1 million in fiscal years 2005,
2004, and 2003, respectively.



Note 15: Commitments

Operating Leases

The Company leases most of its administrative, research and development (R&D) and
manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service offices and certain equipment under non-cancelable
operating leases, which expire at various dates through 2021. Certain of the Company’s facility
leases for buildings located at its Fremont, California headquarters and certain other facility
leases provide it with an option to extend the leases for additional
periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of the
Company’s facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of
inflation.

Included in the operating leases 4-5 years section of the table above is $75.0 million in
guaranteed residual values for lease agreements relating to certain properties at the Company’s
Fremont, California campus. Please see Note 16 for additional information.

The
remaining balances primarily relate to non-cancelable facility-related operating leases
expiring at various dates through 2021.

Purchase Obligations

Purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis
or over multi-year periods related to the Company’s outsourcing activities or other material
commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories. The Company continues to enter into new
agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain activities, including elements of
its manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance, certain information technology
functions, and certain transactional general and administrative functions. The contractual cash
obligations and commitments table presented above contains the Company’s minimum obligations at
June 26, 2005 under these arrangements and others. Actual expenditures will vary based on the
volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition to minimum spending
commitments, certain of these agreements provide for potential cancellation charges.



Consignment inventories, which are owned by vendors but located in the Company’s storage
locations and warehouses, are not reported as Lam inventory until title is transferred to the
Company or its purchase obligation is determined. At June 26,
2005, vendor-owned inventories held
at the Company’s locations and not reported as Lam inventory
were approximately $14.8 million.

Restructuring Liabilities

The Company’s total restructuring reserves as of June 26, 2005 were $5.6 million, including
$0.2 million of severance and benefits-related costs and $5.4 million related to lease payments on vacated buildings. Through cash generated from operations, the
Company expects $3.3 million to be paid over the next twelve months and $2.3 million to be paid
between fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2011. See the related discussion in “Restructuring
Activities” within Note 19.

Note 16: Guarantees

The Company accounts for its guarantees in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees
of Indebtedness of Others” (FIN No. 45). FIN No. 45 requires a company that is a guarantor to make
specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. FIN No. 45
also requires a company (the Guarantor) to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability
for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee.

During fiscal year 2005 the Company recognized additional liabilities of $14.2 million in
connection with its guaranteed residual value obligation on certain leased facilities included in
prior restructuring plans. The $14.2 million was the difference between the Company’s remaining
guaranteed residual value of $17.4 million less $3.2 million
previously accrued under prior restructuring plans for these facilities. During fiscal year 2005
Lam contacted the lessor regarding the marketing of these facilities for sale and received a notice
of approval from a designated buyer under a contract to purchase these facilities and upon closing
of the sale in the same quarter, the lessor deeded the purchased properties to the buyer. Pursuant
to the lease and participation agreements, the Company’s obligation to the lessor for the
properties being purchased by the designated buyer was $27.4 million. The net proceeds of the
sale, equal to approximately $10.0 million, were applied against this obligation. The remainder of
the obligation, Lam’s remaining guaranteed residual value of the two properties of approximately
$17.4 million, was paid in the quarter ended June 26, 2005.

The facilities noted above were among several facilities for which lease agreements were
transferred to a new lessor, amended, combined and restated in March and June of 2003. As part of
the lease agreements, the Company has the option to purchase the remaining buildings at any time
for a total purchase price for all remaining properties related to these leases of approximately
$85.0 million. The Company is required to guarantee the lessors a residual value on the properties
of up to $75.0 million at the end of the lease terms in fiscal
year 2008 (in the case that the leases
are not renewed, the Company does not exercise the purchase options, the lessor sells the
properties and the sale price is less than the lessor’s costs). The Company maintains cash
collateral of $85.0 million as part of the lease agreements as of June 26, 2005 in separate,
specified interest-bearing accounts which is recorded as restricted cash in the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent
leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity (VIE) as
defined by FASB Interpretation 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” and is therefore
not consolidated by Lam.

The Company has issued certain indemnifications to its lessors under some of its operating
lease agreements, such as, indemnification for various environmental matters. The Company has
entered into certain insurance contracts to minimize its exposure related to such indemnifications.
As of June 26, 2005, the Company has not recorded any liability on its financial statements in
connection with these indemnifications, as the Company does not believe, based on information
available, that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees.

The
Company has agreements with two financial institutions that guarantee payment of its
Japanese subsidiary’s overdraft protection obligation. At June 26, 2005, the maximum potential
amount of future



payments
the Company could be required to make under these agreements was
approximately $2.8 million, although the Company’s Japanese subsidiary did not owe any amounts
under these agreements.

The Company has an agreement enabling it to sell to a financial institution certain U.S.
dollar-denominated receivables generated from the sale of its systems, subject to recourse
provisions. The Company discontinued the use of this program during the quarter ended June 26, 2005
and has no current plans to continue usage. At June 26, 2005 the Company had no outstanding and
uncollected receivables under this agreement.

Generally, the Company indemnifies, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, its
customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property
rights by the Company’s products or services.
The Company seeks to limit its liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales
price of the products or services subject to the Company’s indemnification obligations. The Company
does not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any material amounts
will be paid under these guarantees.

The Company offers standard warranties on its systems that run generally for a period of 12
months from system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from the date of shipment of the system to
the customer. The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type
of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as the impact
of system reliability improvements.

Realization of the Company’s net deferred tax assets is based upon the weight of
available evidence, including such factors as the recent earnings history and expected future
taxable income. The Company believes it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized;
however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables
not known or anticipated at this time.

The valuation allowance for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 is attributable to stock
option deductions and tax credit carryforwards, the benefit of which will be credited to equity
when realized. The change in valuation allowance year over year was $38.2 million, $31.1 million,
and ($15.6) million for fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

The Company has net tax benefit carryforwards of $175.4 million as of June 26, 2005. At June
26, 2005, the Company has pre-tax federal tax loss carryforwards of
approximately $219.4 million,
which will expire between 2019 and 2024. The Company also has federal and state tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $97.4 million of which
approximately $76.5 million will expire in
varying amounts between 2010
and 2025. The remaining balance of $20.9 million of tax carryforwards may be carried forward
indefinitely.

In April 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) closed its examination of the Company’s
tax returns for fiscal years up to and including the fiscal year ended June 30, 1998. Resolution
was reached on a number of issues including adjustments related to research and development tax
credits, resulting in a reported approximate $24.9 million tax
benefit recorded in fiscal year 2003.

Consistent with the proportion of earnings outside of the U.S., the Company has negotiated a
tax holiday on certain of those foreign earnings which is effective from fiscal year 2003 through
June 2013. The tax holiday is conditional upon the Company meeting certain employment and
investment thresholds. The impact of the tax holiday decreased income taxes by approximately $12.4
million in fiscal year 2005. The benefit of the tax holiday on net income per share (diluted) was
approximately $.09 in fiscal year 2005. Tax expense of approximately $17.0 million associated with implementing strategies to, in
the longer term, limit the Company’s liability on the sale of the Company’s products worldwide, was
recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003. These tax strategies are structured to align the
asset ownership and functions of the Company’s various legal entities around the world with the
Company’s expectations of the level, timing, and sources of future revenues and profits.

Unremitted earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries included in consolidated retained
earnings aggregated to approximately $117.1 million at June 26, 2005. These earnings, which
reflect full provisions for foreign income taxes, are indefinitely invested in foreign operations.
If these earnings were remitted to the United States, they would be subject to U.S. taxes of
approximately $33.1 million at current statutory rates. The Company’s federal income tax provision
includes U.S. income taxes on certain foreign-based income.

The American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) of 2004 was signed into law on October 22, 2004. The
AJCA provides for a deduction of 85% of certain non-U.S. earnings that are repatriated to the U.S.
On January 13, 2005 and May 10, 2005, the U.S. Treasury published Notice 2005-10 and Notice
2005-38, respectively, providing guidance on the implementation of the repatriation deduction.
Based on the Company’s current understanding of the AJCA, the Company believes the range of
possible amounts that Lam may consider for repatriation under this provision is between zero and
$500 million. The potential range of related income tax that may be incurred as a result of the
repatriation through the end of fiscal year 2006 is between zero and $26 million.

Note 18: Segment, Geographic Information and Major Customers

The Company operates in one business segment: manufacturing and servicing of front-end wafer
processing semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The Company’s material operating units qualify
for aggregation under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, “Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,” due to their identical customer base and
similarities in economic characteristics, nature of products and services, and processes for
procurement, manufacturing and distribution.



The Company operates in five geographic regions: the United States, Europe, Korea, Asia
Pacific, and Japan. For geographical reporting, revenues are attributed to the geographic location
in which the customers’ facilities are located while long-lived assets are attributed to the
geographic locations in which the assets are located.

Note 19: Restructuring Activities

The Company distinguishes regular operating cost management activities from restructuring
activities. Accounting for restructuring activities requires an evaluation of formally committed
and approved plans. Restructuring activities have comparatively greater strategic significance and
materiality and may involve exit activities, whereas regular cost containment activities are more
tactical in nature and are rarely characterized by formal and integrated action plans or exiting a
particular product, facility, or service.

The Company has historically developed plans and incurred restructuring charges to respond to
the high level of volatility and, at times, depressed levels of capital investment by the
semiconductor industry. The Company systematically reviewed its revenue outlook and forecasts and
assessed their impact on required employment levels, facilities utilization, and outsourcing
activities scope. Based on these evaluations, the Company’s senior management committed to cost
reduction and exit activities in the quarters ended March 28, 2004 (the March 2004 Plan), December
28, 2003 (the December 2003 Plan), September 28,
2003 (the September 2003 Plan), June 29, 2003 (the June 2003 Plan), March 30, 2003 (the March
2003 Plan), December 29, 2002 (the December 2002 Plan), December 30, 2001 (the December 2001 Plan),
and September 23, 2001 (the September 2001 Plan).



Prior to the end of each quarter noted above, the Company initiated the announced
restructuring activities and management with the proper level of authority approved specific
actions under the respective Plan. Severance packages to potentially impacted employees were
communicated in enough detail such that the employees could determine their type and amount of
benefit. The termination of the affected employees occurred as soon as practical after the
restructuring plans were announced. The amount of remaining future lease payments recorded in the
restructuring charges include facilities for which a contract was terminated in accordance with its
terms and charges for facilities, or a portion of facilities the Company ceased to use. Expenses
were based on management’s estimates using known prevailing real estate market conditions at that
time based, in part, on the opinions of independent real estate experts. Leasehold improvements
relating to the vacated buildings were written off, where these items were determined to have no
future economic benefit to the Company and have been abandoned.

As of June 26, 2005, the overall restructuring reserve balance consisted of the following:

buildings and is expected to be utilized by the end of fiscal year 2011.

Fiscal Year 2005 Activity

During the quarter ended March 27, 2005, the Company recognized additional liabilities of
$14.2 million in connection with its guaranteed residual value obligation on certain leased
facilities included in prior restructuring plans. The $14.2 million was the difference between the
Company’s guaranteed residual value of $17.4 million less $3.2 million previously accrued under prior restructuring plans for these facilities. During the March
2005 quarter, the Company contacted the lessor regarding the marketing of these facilities for
sale. The Company concluded, under the provisions of SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”,
that the likelihood that a liability had been incurred was probable and estimable. This transaction
resulted in an increase of $10.2 million and $4.0 million to the Company’s fiscal year 2004 and
fiscal year 2002 restructuring plans accruals, respectively. During the quarter ended June 26,
2005, the Company received a notice of approval from a designated buyer under a contract to
purchase these facilities and upon closing of the sale in the same quarter, the lessor deeded the
purchased properties to the buyer. Pursuant to the lease and participation agreements, Lam’s
obligation to the lessor for the properties being purchased by the designated buyer was $27.4
million. The net proceeds of the sale, equal to approximately $10.0 million, were applied against
this obligation. The remainder of the obligation, Lam’s remaining guaranteed residual value of the
two properties of approximately $17.4 million, was paid
during the quarter ended June 26, 2005. This transaction is reflected in the fiscal year 2004
and fiscal year 2002 restructuring plan accrual tables below.



Fiscal Year 2004 Restructuring Activities

The
Company’s fiscal year 2004 restructuring activities included reducing its workforce by less
than 40 employees, primarily in North America and Europe and by vacating selected facilities
located in North America and Asia deemed to be no longer necessary to its operations. The employees
were from a range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization.

The Company recorded net restructuring charges during fiscal year 2004 of approximately $6.7
million, consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees of $1.2
million, charges for the present value of remaining lease payments on vacated facilities of $2.8
million, and the write-off of related leasehold improvements of $1.6 million. The Company also
recorded a charge of approximately $1.0 million due to the cancellation of a lease agreement
related to one of its facilities in Japan and $2.1 million for the write-off of related leasehold
improvements.

The Company recognized $1.9 million of additional facilities-related expenses due to changes
in estimates of restructuring plans initiated prior to fiscal year 2004. Charges during the year
were partially offset by the recovery of $1.5 million of previously accrued expenses related to the
remaining lease payments on vacated facilities in Japan. Additional offsetting items include
recovery of $0.7 million due to lower than previously estimated employee severance and benefits
costs and $1.7 million of recovered inventory from unanticipated sales to the Company’s installed
base of certain portions of inventory previously written off as part of its September 2001
restructuring. The inventory recovery was recorded as a credit in cost of goods sold.

The fiscal year 2005 restructuring charge of $10.2 million in the table below is for the
additional liabilities for unoccupied facilities discussed above in Fiscal Year 2005 Activity.

Fiscal Year 2003 Restructuring Activities

The
Company’s senior management committed to cost reduction and exit
activities during fiscal year 2003 through its June 2003, March 2003 and December 2002 Plans and recorded restructuring
charges during fiscal year 2003 of approximately $18.1 million.
The Company’s fiscal year 2003
restructuring activities included reducing its workforce in North America, Europe, and Asia by
approximately 200 people and vacating selected sales and administrative facilities located in North
America, Europe, and Asia deemed to be no longer required for its operations. The employees
included in the Plans were from a broad range of functions and at multiple levels of the
organization, with the majority of the reductions in North America.

The $18.1 million restructuring charges consisted of $5.7 million of severance and benefits
for involuntarily terminated employees and $12.4 million of facilities-related charges. The
facilities-related charges consisted of the present value of remaining lease payments on vacated
facilities, a loss on the fair value of a vacated facility and the write-off of related leasehold
improvements. In June 2003, a lease covering one of the Company’s vacated facilities at its
Fremont, California campus was amended, combined, restated, and transferred to a new lessor under a
single lease structure. At the time of the amendment, the leased facility’s fair value was less than its original cost by approximately
$1 million. Accordingly, this amount was recorded as a loss on the fair value of the vacated
facility and included in the $18.1 million of restructuring charges.

Fiscal Year 2002 Restructuring Activities

The Company’s senior management committed to cost reduction and exit activities during fiscal
year 2002 through its December 2001 and September 2001 Plans and recorded restructuring charges
during fiscal year 2002 of approximately $54.8 million. The Company’s fiscal year 2002
restructuring activities included reducing its workforce in North America, Europe, and Asia by
approximately 1,020 people, vacating selected facilities at its Fremont, California campus deemed
to be no longer required for its operations, the closure of certain offices in Asia, and
discontinuance of the manufacture of specific products within its etch product lines. The employees
were from a broad range of functions and at multiple levels of the organization, with approximately
83% from North America and approximately 17% from Europe and Asia locations.

The
restructuring charges included $25.0 million in severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated
employees, $11.4 million in charges for remaining lease payments
on vacated facilities, $10.8 million in write-offs of related
leasehold improvements and fixed assets, and $7.6 million in inventory write-downs. The inventory charge of
approximately $7.6 million related to the Company’s decision to discontinue manufacture of specific
systems within its etch product lines. The Company recovered approximately $1.7 million during
fiscal year 2004, $1.0 million during fiscal year 2003, and $0.7 million during fiscal year 2002,
from unanticipated subsequent sales of these inventories to its installed base. The Company
physically disposed of approximately $1.0 million of this inventory during fiscal year 2004 and
$2.7 million during fiscal years 2003 and 2002. During fiscal year 2002, the Company also recovered
approximately $1.0 million of the $54.8 million due to lower than estimated employee termination
costs of $0.7 million and lower than planned expenses related to a vacated facility of $0.3
million. During fiscal year 2004, the Company recorded approximately $0.4 million of additional
restructuring charges due to a revision in estimates for one of its vacated facilities and the
Company recovered approximately $1.4 million, net, due to the difference between costs previously
accrued and actual costs to terminate a lease agreement for a facility for which it entered into a
lease cancellation agreement during fiscal year 2004.

During fiscal year 2003, the Company recovered approximately $2.7 million for benefits offered
that were not utilized by terminated employees and $2.0 million was recovered due to revisions to
the net amount of lease payments remaining on vacated facilities. The Company also recorded
additional restructuring charges during fiscal year 2003 of $3.1 million due to revisions the
Company made in sublease assumptions for two of its vacated buildings in Fremont, California, $0.1
million due to additional facility restoration costs, and $0.4 million for revisions that the
Company made in its estimates for employee termination costs.



The fiscal year 2005 restructuring charge of $4.0 million in the table below is for the
additional liabilities for unoccupied facilities discussed above in Fiscal Year 2005 Activity.

its restructuring activities under the June 2001 Plan. A final $1.1 million of restructuring
charges was recovered due to lower than estimated employee termination costs. The remaining $0.5
million facilities balance as of June 26, 2005 is expected to be paid by January, 2006.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lam Research Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lam Research Corporation as of
June 26, 2005 and June 27, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 26, 2005.
Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a).
These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Lam Research Corporation as of June 26, 2005 and
June 27, 2004, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended June 26, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Lam Research Corporation’s internal control
over financial reporting as of June 26, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated August 16, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Lam Research Corporation

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Lam Research Corporation maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of June 26, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Lam Research Corporation’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Lam Research Corporation maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 26, 2005, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Lam Research Corporation
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
June 26, 2005, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Lam Research Corporation as of
June 26, 2005 and June 27, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 26, 2005
of Lam Research Corporation and our report dated August 16, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.
