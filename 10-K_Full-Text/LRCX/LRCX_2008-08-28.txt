Item 1.

Business

Lam Research Corporation (“Lam Research,” “Lam,” “we,” or the “Company”) is a leading
supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the worldwide semiconductor industry. Our
wafer fabrication equipment, services, and extensive technical expertise have contributed to
advancing semiconductor manufacturing and producing some of the world’s most advanced semiconductor
devices for more than 25 years. We are recognized as the market share leader in plasma etch and,
leveraging our etch expertise, we are addressing some of today’s most advanced semiconductor
processing challenges with an expanded product portfolio beyond etch.

We design, manufacture, market, and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the
fabrication of integrated circuits. Semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of
process and preparation steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual
integrated circuits. We leverage our expertise in these areas to develop integrated processing
solutions which typically benefit our customers through reduced cost, lower defect rates, enhanced
yields, or faster processing time. Many of the technical advances that we introduce in our newest
products are also available as upgrades to our installed base of equipment, a benefit that can
provide customers with a cost-effective strategy for extending the performance and capabilities of
their existing wafer fabrication lines.

Our innovative etch technologies enable customers to build some of the world’s
highest-performing integrated circuits. Our etch systems shape the microscopic conductive and
dielectric layers into circuits that define a chip’s final use and function. We also offer a broad
portfolio of single-wafer clean technologies which allow our customers to implement customized
yield-enhancing solutions. With each new technology node, additional requirements and challenges
drive the need for advanced manufacturing solutions. We strive to consistently deliver these
advanced capabilities with cost-effective production performance as we understand the close
relationship between customer trust and the timely delivery of new solutions that leads to shared
success with our customers.

Incorporated in 1980, Lam Research is headquartered in Fremont, California, and maintains a
network of facilities throughout the United States, Japan, Europe, and Asia in order to meet the
needs of its global customer base.

In March 2008, we completed our acquisition of SEZ Holding AG (“SEZ”), a leading supplier of
single-wafer wet clean technology and products, founded in 1986, with primary operations based in
Austria. SEZ’s proprietary Spin-Processor™ technology (single-wafer spin clean technology)
forms part of our broad equipment portfolio for wafer cleaning solutions. The single-wafer
clean market is central to our adjacent market growth strategy. As approximately 50% of the wafer
cleaning steps in a fab immediately follow an etch process, acquiring a major wafer clean company
is a natural and logical step to growing our business. The combination of the two companies allows
us to offer a full spectrum of single-wafer cleaning and surface preparation solutions, with
products incorporating proprietary single-wafer spin, linear, plasma-based bevel clean, and strip
technologies.

Additional information about Lam Research is available on our web site at
http://www.lamresearch.com. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q,
Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports are available on our website as
soon as reasonably practicable after we filed them with or furnish them to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and are also available online at the SEC web site at
http://www.sec.gov.



ETCH PROCESS

Etch processes, which are repeated numerous times during the wafer fabrication cycle, are
required to manufacture every type of semiconductor device produced today. Our etch products
selectively remove portions of various films from the wafer in the creation of semiconductor
devices by utilizing various plasma-based technologies to create critical device features at
current and future technology nodes. Plasma consists of charged and neutral species that react with
exposed portions of the wafer surface to remove dielectric or conductive materials and produce the
finely delineated features and patterns of an integrated circuit.

Dielectric Etch

For dielectric etch, new materials integration often requires etching multi-layer film stacks.
In addition to the challenges introduced by new materials and scaling, device manufacturers’
desire to reduce overall cost per wafer has placed an increased emphasis on the ability to etch
multiple films in the same chamber (

in situ)

.

DFC Technology

Production-proven in high-volume manufacturing for more than 13 years, our patented Dual
Frequency Confined™ technology has been extended to incorporate multi-frequency power with a
physically confined plasma. The application of power at different frequencies provides enhanced
process flexibility and allows different materials to be etched in the same chamber. Physical
confinement of the plasma to an area directly above the wafer minimizes chemical interaction with
the chamber walls, eliminating potential polymer build-up that could lead to defects on the wafer.
Confinement also enables our proprietary

in situ

Waferless Autoclean™ technology to clean chamber
components after each wafer has been etched. Used together, multi-frequency and WAC™ technologies
provide a consistent process environment for every wafer, preventing process drift and ensuring
repeatable process results wafer-to-wafer and chamber-to-chamber.

Flex45™ Dielectric
Etch Systems

Our 2300 Exelan Flex dielectric etch products represent a continuous evolution of the
productivity and performance benefits of DFC technology. The Exelan Flex family allows a single
chamber design to meet the requirements of a wide range of applications through multiple technology
generations. Advances in system design, such as multiple frequencies, meet the more demanding
uniformity and profile requirements for applications at the 45 nm node and beyond.

Conductor Etch

As the semiconductor industry continues to shrink critical feature sizes and improve device
performance, a variety of new etch challenges have emerged. For conductor etch, these challenges
include processing smaller features, new materials, and new transistor structures on the wafer. Due
to decreasing feature sizes, the etch process can now require atomic-level control across a 300 mm
wafer. The incorporation of new metal gates and high-k dielectric materials in the device stack
requires advanced multi-film etching capability. Furthermore, the adoption of double patterning
techniques to address lithography challenges at the 45 nm node and beyond is driving the etch
process to define the feature on the wafer as well as to transfer the pattern into the film. All
of these challenges require today’s conductor etch systems to provide advanced capabilities, while
still providing high productivity.

TCP Technology

Introduced in 1992, our Transformer Coupled Plasma™ technology continues to provide
leading-edge capability for advanced conductor etch applications at the 45 nm node and beyond. By
efficiently coupling radio frequency power into plasma at low pressures, the TCP technology
provides capability to etch nanoscale features into silicon and metal films. The advanced TCP
source design ensures a uniform, high-density plasma across the wafer, without requiring magnetic
enhancements that could cause device damage. With a wide process window over a range of power,
chemistry, and pressure combinations, TCP technology provides the flexibility required to perform
multiple etch steps in the same chamber.

System Conductor Etch Systems

Now in its third generation, the 2300 Versys product family combines iterative advances in
technology to provide critical dimension (“CD”) uniformity and productivity for a wide range of
conductor and metal etch applications. Our etch products perform production-proven

in situ

etch of
complex features. In addition, proprietary pre-coat and post-etch chamber clean techniques provide
the same environment for superior repeatability, as well as high uptime and yield wafer after
wafer.

MEMS and Deep Silicon Etch

Micro-electromechanical systems (“MEMS”) devices are increasingly being used in consumer
applications, such as ink jet printer heads and inertial sensors. This is driving a number of MEMS
applications to transition into high-volume manufacturing, which requires the high levels of
cost-effective production typically seen in commodity semiconductor memory devices. To achieve high
yield in mass production, the MEMS etch process requires wafer-to-wafer repeatability.

TCP

®

9400DSiE™ Deep Silicon Etch System

The TCP 9400DSiE system is based on our production-proven TCP 9400 silicon etch series. The
system’s patented high-density TCP plasma source provides a configuration to meet the challenges of
silicon deep reactive ion etch (“Si DRIE”), offering broad process capability and flexibility for a
wide range of MEMS, advanced packaging, and power semiconductor applications. Incorporation of our
proprietary

in situ

chamber cleaning technology provides etch rate stability.

Three-Dimensional Integrated Circuits (“3-D IC”) Etch

The semiconductor industry is developing advanced, 3-D IC using through-silicon vias (“TSV”)
to provide interconnect capability for die-to-die and wafer-to-wafer stacking. In addition to a
reduced form factor, 3-D ICs can enhance device performance through increased speed and decreased
power consumption. Manufacturers are currently considering a wide variety of 3-D integration
schemes that present an equally broad range of TSV etch requirements. Plasma etch technology, which
has been used extensively for deep silicon etching in memory devices and MEMS production, is well
suited for TSV creation.


®

Syndion™ Through-Silicon Via Etch System

The 2300 Syndion etch system is based on our patented TCP technology and the production-proven
2300 Versys Kiyo conductor etch system. The Syndion system can etch multiple film stacks in the
same chamber, including silicon, dielectric, and conducting materials, thereby addressing multiple
TSV etch requirements.

Pattern Enhancement

Lithography challenges at the 45 nm node and beyond provide opportunities for non-lithographic
solutions to continue device scaling. Innovative patterning methods are needed to produce the ever
smaller feature sizes and tighter pitches (the center-to-center distance between features of an
integrated circuit) demanded of today’s advanced chip designs. We believe that patterning solutions
offer opportunities to address the challenges of current and next-generation lithography systems
and that the adoption of

in-situ

shrinks and double-patterning techniques may allow manufacturers
to postpone investments in new lithography equipment.




®

Motif™ Pattern Enhancement System

The 2300 Motif post-lithography pattern enhancement system enables cost-effective production
of next-generation feature sizes using current lithography. Using a proprietary plasma-assisted
process, the system reduces the original printed CD of a feature by as much as 50 nm for holes and
100 nm for trenches and delivers well-controlled final CDs as small as 10 nm.

CLEAN PROCESS

The manufacture of semiconductor devices involves a series of processes such as etch and
deposition, which leave particles and residues on the surface of the wafer. The wafer must
generally be cleaned after these steps to remove residues that could adversely impact the processes
that immediately follow them and degrade device performance. Common wafer cleaning steps include
post-etch and post-strip cleans and pre-diffusion and pre-deposition.

Specific challenges at 45 nm and beyond include thorough particle removal, protecting
structures with fragile new materials and smaller feature sizes, achieving effective residue
removal and drying, while minimizing substrate material loss. In addition, management of potential
defect sources at the wafer’s edge will become increasingly challenging as new materials are
introduced in the process flow.

Single-Wafer Wet Clean

As device geometries shrink and new materials are introduced, the number of wafer cleaning
steps is increasing. In addition, each step has different selectivity and defectivity requirements
that add to manufacturing complexity. The need to clean fragile structures without causing damage
is a reason why chipmakers are turning to single-wafer wet clean processing technology for
next-generation devices.

Over the past decade, a transition from batch to single-wafer has occurred for BEOL wet clean
applications and a similar migration for front-end-of-line (“FEOL”) wet clean applications appears
to be occurring as the need for higher particle removal efficiency without device structure damage
becomes more critical. Single-wafer wet processing is particularly advantageous for those
applications where improved defect performance (removing particles without damaging the wafer
pattern) or enhanced selectivity and CD control can improve yield.

Single-Wafer Spin Clean Products: SP Series, Da Vinci

®

, DV-Prime™, Esanti

®

With the acquisition of SEZ in March 2008, we have expanded our portfolio to include
single-wafer spin systems, in addition to gaining more than 20 years of experience in clean
technology and a substantial installed customer base. This single-wafer Spin-Processor technology
for cleaning and removing films has assisted the industry transition from batch to single-wafer wet
processing. By offering advanced dilute chemistry and solvent solutions in our systems, our
single-wafer spin clean systems address certain defectivity and material integrity requirements.

Single-Wafer Linear Clean Product: C3™ Technology

To meet the challenges of smaller critical dimensions, increasing aspect ratios, and new
materials integration, our Confined Chemical Cleaning™ (“C3”) technology is targeted at
applications requiring high-selectivity residue removal without damaging sensitive device
structures. The C3 technology combines linear wafer motion with chemically-driven single-wafer
cleaning to remove residues with chemical exposure times as short as a few seconds. The cleaning
exposure time is optimized for efficient removal of the target materials, while limiting the impact
on critical materials. This technology addresses applications that require high-selectivity
cleaning, such as high-k metal gate post-etch clean.



Plasma-Based Bevel Clean

Semiconductor manufacturers are paying increasing attention to the wafer’s edge as a source of
yield-limiting defects. New materials like porous low-k and organic films often do not adhere as
well as traditional silicon or polymer-based films and have the potential to be significant defect
sources. By including cleaning steps that target the bevel region, the number of good die at the
wafer’s edge can be increased to maximize yield.


®

Coronus™ Plasma-Based Bevel Clean System

The 2300 Coronus plasma-based bevel clean system incorporates plasma technology to remove
yield-limiting defect sources. The system combines the ability of plasma to selectively remove a
wide variety of materials with a proprietary confinement technology that protects the die area.
Incorporating our Dynamic Alignment technology on the production-proven 2300 platform, the Coronus
system provides highly accurate wafer placement for reproducible results and superior encroachment
control and is designed to remove a wide range of material types, in multiple applications
throughout the manufacturing process flow.

Research and Development

The market for semiconductor capital equipment is characterized by rapid technological change
and product innovation. Our ability to obtain and maintain our competitive advantage depends in
part on our continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products.
Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to R&D
programs and seek to maintain close and responsive relationships with our customers and suppliers.

Our R&D expenses during fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006 were $323.8 million, $285.3 million,
and $229.4 million, respectively. The majority of spending is targeted at etch and plasma-based
technology applications with an increasing proportion focused on adjacent markets including
single-wafer spin wet clean, pre- and post-etch step opportunities, consistent with our
multi-product growth strategy. We believe current challenges for customers in the pre- and
post-etch applications present opportunities for us. We plan to leverage our extensive production
experience in etch and strip into new products and new capabilities for our customers at the 65,
45, and 32 nm nodes, including post ion implantation strip, clean, and patterning.

We expect to continue to make substantial investments in R&D to meet our customers’ product
needs, support our growth strategy, and enhance our competitive position.

Marketing, Sales, and Service

Our marketing, sales, and service efforts are focused on building long-term relationships with
our customers and targeting product and service solutions designed to meet our customers’ needs.
These efforts are supported by a team of product marketing and sales professionals as well as
equipment and process engineers who work closely with individual customers to develop solutions for
their wafer processing needs. We maintain ongoing service relationships with our customers and have
an extensive network of field service engineers in place throughout the United States, Europe,
Taiwan, Korea, Japan, and Asia Pacific. We believe that comprehensive support programs and close
working relationships with customers are essential to maintaining high customer satisfaction and
our competitiveness in the marketplace.



We offer standard warranties for our systems that generally run for a period of 12 months from
system acceptance. The warranty provides that systems shall be free from defects in material and
workmanship and conform to our published specifications. The warranty is limited to repair of the
defect or replacement with new or like-new equivalent goods and is valid when the buyer provides
prompt notification within the warranty period of the claimed defect or non-conformity and also
makes the items available for inspection and repair. We also offer extended warranty packages to
our customers to purchase as desired.

International Sales

A significant portion of our sales and operations occur outside the United States and,
therefore, may be subject to certain risks, including but not limited to tariffs and other
barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing non-U.S. operations, adverse tax consequences,
exchange rate fluctuations, changes in currency controls, compliance with U.S. and international
laws and regulations, including U.S. export restrictions, and economic and political conditions.
Any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and
results of operations and cash flows. Revenue by region was as follows:

Customers

Our customers include many of the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers. Customers
continue to establish joint ventures, alliances and licensing arrangements which have the
potential to positively or negatively impact our competitive position and market opportunity. In
fiscal year 2008, revenues from Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd. and Toshiba Corporation accounted
for approximately 19% and 13%, respectively, of total revenues. In fiscal year 2007, revenues from Hynix
Semiconductor and Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd., each accounted for approximately 14% of total
revenues. In fiscal year 2006, revenues from Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd., accounted for
approximately 15% of total revenues and revenues from Toshiba Corporation accounted for
approximately 12% of total revenues.

A material reduction in orders from our customers in the semiconductor industry could
adversely affect our results of operations and projected financial condition. Our business depends
upon the expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers. Semiconductor manufacturers’ businesses, in
turn, depend on many factors, including their economic capability, the current and anticipated
market demand for integrated circuits and the availability of equipment capacity to support that
demand.

Backlog

Our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems, spares, and services where written
customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is
anticipated within the next 12 months. Our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations
and to make adjustments to reflect, among other things, spares volume estimates and customer
delivery date changes. In general, we schedule production of our systems based upon purchase orders
in backlog and our customers’ delivery requirements. Included in our systems backlog are orders for
which written requests have been accepted, prices and product specifications have been agreed upon,
and shipment of systems is expected within one year. The spares and services backlog includes
customer orders for products that have not yet shipped and for services that have not yet been
provided. Where specific spare parts and customer service purchase contracts do not contain
discrete delivery dates, we use volume estimates at the contract price and over the contract
period, not exceeding 12 months, in calculating backlog amounts.

As
of June 29, 2008 and June 24, 2007, our backlog was
approximately $410 million and $643
million, respectively. Generally, orders for our products and services are subject to cancellation
by our customers with limited penalties. Because some orders are received for shipments



in the same quarter and due to possible customer changes in delivery dates and cancellations
of orders, our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes nor
actual revenue levels for succeeding periods.

Manufacturing

Our manufacturing operations consist mainly of assembling and testing components,
sub-assemblies, and modules that are then integrated into finished systems prior to shipment to or
at the location of our customers. Most of the assembly and testing of our products is conducted in
cleanroom environments.

We have agreements with third parties to outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing,
production warehousing, and logistics functions. We believe that these outsourcing contracts
provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a more timely and cost effective
manner, enabling us to respond to the cyclical nature of our business. We believe that we have
selected reputable providers and have secured their performance on terms documented in written
contracts. However, it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we
expect, and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business and have a negative effect on
our operating results and financial condition. Overall, we believe we have effective mechanisms to
manage risks associated with our outsourcing relationships. Refer to Note 14 of our Consolidated
Financial Statements, included in Item 8 herein, for further information concerning our outsourcing
commitments.

Certain components and sub-assemblies included in our products are only obtained from a single
supplier. We believe that, in many cases, alternative sources could be obtained and qualified to
supply these products. Nevertheless, a prolonged inability to obtain these components could have an
adverse effect on our operating results and could unfavorably impact our customer relationships.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the management of hazardous
materials. We are currently not aware of any pending notices of violation, fines, lawsuits, or
investigations arising from environmental matters that would have any material effect on our
business. We believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have
obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise addressing) all necessary environmental permits to
conduct our business. Nevertheless, the failure to comply with present or future regulations could
result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, and cessation of our operations or
reduction in our customers’ acceptance of our products. These regulations could require us to alter
our current operations, to acquire significant equipment, or to incur substantial other expenses to
comply with environmental regulations. Our failure to control the use, sale, transport or disposal
of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities.

Employees

As
of August 15, 2008, we had approximately 3,800 regular employees.

Each of our employees is required to comply with our policies relating to maintaining the
confidentiality of our proprietary information and with our statement of standards of business
conduct. In the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, competition for highly
skilled employees is intense. Our future success depends, to a significant extent, upon our
continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees particularly in the R&D and customer
support functions.

Competition

The semiconductor capital equipment industry is characterized by rapid change and is highly
competitive throughout the world. To compete effectively, we invest significant financial resources
to continue to strengthen and enhance our product and services portfolio and to maintain customer
service and support locations globally. Semiconductor manufacturers evaluate capital equipment
suppliers in many areas, including, but not limited to, process performance, productivity, customer
support, defect control, and overall cost of ownership, which can be affected by many factors such
as equipment design, reliability, software advancements, etc. Our ability to succeed in the
marketplace will depend upon our ability to maintain existing products and introduce product
enhancements and new products on a timely basis. In addition, semiconductor manufacturers must make
a substantial investment to qualify and integrate new capital equipment into semiconductor
production lines. As a result, once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular
supplier’s equipment and qualified it for production, the manufacturer generally maintains that
selection for that specific production application and technology node provided that there is
demonstrated performance to specification by the installed base. Accordingly, we may experience
difficulty in selling to a given customer if that customer has qualified a competitor’s equipment.
We must also continue to meet the expectations of our installed base of customers through the
delivery of high-quality and cost-efficient spare parts in the presence of third-party spares
provider competition. We face significant competition with all of our products and services.
Certain of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources
and larger engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support organizations
than we do. In addition, we face competition from a number of emerging companies in the industry.
We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current
products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with enhanced price/performance
characteristics. If our competitors make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with
leading semiconductor manufacturers, or other entities, covering products similar to those



we sell, our ability to sell our products to those customers could be adversely affected.
There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future. Our primary
competitors in the etch market are Tokyo Electron, Ltd. and Applied Materials, Inc. Our primary
competitor in the single-wafer wet clean market is Dainippon Screen Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (“DNS”).

Patents and Licenses

Our policy is to seek patents on inventions relating to new or enhanced products and processes
developed as part of our ongoing research, engineering, manufacturing, and support activities. We
currently hold a number of United States and foreign patents covering various aspects of our
products and processes. We believe that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the useful
life of the technologies and processes disclosed and claimed therein. Our patents, which cover
material aspects of our past and present core products, have current durations ranging from
approximately one to twenty years. We believe that, although the patents we own and may obtain in
the future will be of value, they will not alone determine our success, which depends principally
upon our engineering, marketing, support, and delivery skills. However, in the absence of patent
protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to imitate our products, manufacturing
techniques, and processes. In addition, other companies and inventors may receive patents that
contain claims applicable or similar to our products and processes. The sale of products covered by
patents of others could require licenses that may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at
all. For further discussion of legal matters, see Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended June 29, 2008 (the “2008 Form 10-K).

Recent Acquisitions

During fiscal year 2008, we acquired approximately 99% of the outstanding shares of SEZ
Holding AG (“SEZ”), a major supplier of single-wafer wet clean technology and products to the
global semiconductor manufacturing industry. The acquisition was an all-cash transaction. We expect
to take additional steps as necessary to acquire the SEZ shares that remain outstanding. The
acquisition of these shares was conducted pursuant to the terms of a Transaction Agreement entered
into on December 10, 2007 by and between the Company and SEZ. SEZ’s Spin-Process single-wafer
technology forms part of a broad equipment solution portfolio for wafer cleaning and
decontamination, a key process adjacent to etch.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

In addition to the other information in this 2008 Form 10-K, the following risk factors should
be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business because such factors may
significantly impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. As a result of these
risk factors, as well as other risks discussed in our other SEC filings, our actual results could
differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. No priority or
significance is intended, nor should be attached, to the order in which the risk factors appear.

Our Quarterly Revenues and Operating Results Are Unpredictable

Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to
a number of factors, not all of which are in our control. We manage our expense levels based in
part on our expectations of future revenues. If revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet
our expectations, our operating results may be adversely affected. Because our operating expenses
are based in part on anticipated future revenues, and a certain amount of those expenses are
relatively fixed, a change in the timing of recognition of revenue and/or the level of gross profit
from a single transaction can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter. Factors
that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include, but are not limited to:

Further, because a significant amount of our R&D and administrative operations and capacity is
located at our Fremont, California campus, natural, physical, logistical or other events or
disruptions affecting these facilities (including labor disruptions, earthquakes, and power
failures) could adversely impact our financial performance.



We Derive Our Revenues Primarily from a Relatively Small Number of High-Priced Systems

System sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue. Our systems can range in
price up to approximately $6 million per unit, and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent
upon the acceptance of a rather limited number of such systems. As a result, the inability to
declare revenue on even a few systems can cause a significant adverse impact on our revenues for
that quarter.

Variations in the Amount of Time it Takes for Our Customers to Accept Our Systems May Cause
Fluctuation in Our Operating Results

We generally recognize revenue for new system sales on the date of customer acceptance or the
date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse. As a result, the fiscal period in which
we are able to recognize new systems revenues is typically subject to the length of time that our
customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation,
which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate.

The Semiconductor Equipment Industry is Volatile and Reduced Product Demand Has a Negative Impact
on Shipments

Our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers,
which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and
products using integrated circuits. The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and
historically experiences periodic downturns. Business conditions historically have changed rapidly
and unpredictably.

Fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers could continue to materially
affect our aggregate shipments, revenues and operating results. Where appropriate, we will attempt
to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures
with anticipated revenue streams, which sometimes result in restructuring charges. Even during
periods of reduced revenues, we must continue to invest in research and development and maintain
extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive, which
may temporarily harm our financial results.

We Depend on New Products and Processes for Our Success. Consequently, We are Subject to Risks
Associated with Rapid Technological Change

Rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased
pressure to develop technological advances enabling such processes. We believe that our future
success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved
capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products. If new products have reliability or
quality problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs,
delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses.
We may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully or new products that we
introduce may fail in the marketplace. Our failure to complete commercialization of these new
products in a timely manner could result in unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence, which
would adversely affect our financial results.

In order to develop new products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant
investments in R&D and to pursue joint development relationships with customers, suppliers or other
members of the industry. We must manage product transitions and joint development relationships
successfully, as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing
products. Moreover, future technologies, processes or product developments may render our current
product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive products, or obsolete inventory, or
both.

We are Subject to Risks Relating to Product Concentration and Lack of Product Revenue
Diversification

We derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products, and we
expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near
term. Continued market acceptance of these products is, therefore, critical to our future success.
Our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could therefore be adversely
affected by:



In addition, the fact that we offer a more limited product line creates the risk that our
customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer
additional products as well. This may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with
certain customers. Such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated
with technology changes. Since we are primarily a provider of etch equipment, our business is
affected by our customers’ use of etching steps in their processes. Should technologies change so
that the manufacture of semiconductor chips requires fewer etching steps, this might have a larger
impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors.

We Have a Limited Number of Key Customers

Sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall
revenue, new orders and profitability. As a result, the actions of even one customer may subject us
to revenue swings that are difficult to predict. Similarly, significant portions of our credit risk
may, at any given time, be concentrated among a limited number of customers, so that the failure of
even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our
financial results.

Strategic Alliances May Have Negative Effects on Our Business

Increasingly, semiconductor companies are entering into strategic alliances with one another
to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies. Often, one of the
outcomes of such an alliance is the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function or a
series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment. While this could work
to our advantage if Lam Research’s equipment becomes the basis for the function or process, it
could work to our disadvantage if a competitor’s tools or equipment become the standard equipment
for such function or process. In the latter case, even if Lam Research’s equipment was previously
used by a customer, that equipment may be displaced in current and future applications by the tools
standardized by the alliance.

Similarly, our customers may team with, or follow the lead of, educational or research
institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps. If
those institutions utilize a competitor’s equipment when they establish those processes, it is
likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing
lines. These actions could adversely impact our market share and subsequent business.

We are Dependent Upon a Limited Number of Key Suppliers

We obtain certain components and sub-assemblies included in our products from a single
supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We have established long-term contracts with many of
these suppliers. These long-term contracts can take a variety of forms. We may renew these
contracts periodically. In some cases, these suppliers sold us products during at least the last
four years, and we expect that we will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we
will otherwise replace them with competent alternative suppliers. However, several of our suppliers
are relatively new providers to us so that our experience with them and their performance is
limited. Where practical, our intent is to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that
the failure of any single supplier will adversely affect our business. Nevertheless, a prolonged
inability to obtain certain components could impair our ability to ship products, lower our
revenues and thus adversely affect our operating results and result in damage to our customer
relationships.

Our Outsource Providers May Fail to Perform as We Expect

Outsource providers have played and will play key roles in our manufacturing operations and in
many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology, facilities
management, and certain elements of our finance organization. Although we aim at selecting
reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts, it is
possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure
could have an adverse impact on our business.

In addition, the expansive role of outsource providers has required and will continue to
require us to implement changes to our existing operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with
and manage the performance of these outsource providers. Any delay or failure in the implementation
of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely affect our customer relationships
and/or have a negative effect on our operating results.

Once a Semiconductor Manufacturer Commits to Purchase a Competitor’s Semiconductor Manufacturing
Equipment, the Manufacturer Typically Continues to Purchase that Competitor’s Equipment, Making it
More Difficult for Us to Sell Our Equipment to that Customer

Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer
processing equipment into a semiconductor production line. We believe that once a semiconductor
manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment, the manufacturer generally
relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application. Accordingly, we expect it
to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor’s
equipment.



We are Subject to Risks Associated with Our Competitors’ Strategic Relationships and Their
Introduction of New Products and We May Lack the Financial Resources or Technological Capabilities
of Certain of Our Competitors Needed to Capture Increased Market Share

We expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future competitors. We
believe that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and
are planning to introduce new products, which may affect our ability to sell our existing products.
We face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading
semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this
could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers.

We believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer
a broad range of products, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to
invest in product and process R&D. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial
resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and
support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the
semiconductor equipment industry. These competitors may deeply discount or give away products
similar to those that we sell, challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar
accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products. For these reasons, we may fail
to continue to compete successfully worldwide.

In addition, our competitors may provide innovative technology that may have performance
advantages over systems we currently, or expect to, offer. They may be able to develop products
comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving
customer requirements. In particular, while we currently are developing additional product
enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely
manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements
successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive.
Accordingly, we may be unable to continue to compete in our markets, competition may intensify, or
future competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial
condition, and/or cash flows.

Our Future Success Depends on International Sales and the Management of Global Operations

Non-U.S. sales accounted for approximately 83% in fiscal year 2008, 84% in fiscal year 2007
and 86% in fiscal year 2006 of our total revenue. We expect that international sales will continue
to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in future years.

We are subject to various challenges related to the management of global operations, and
international sales are subject to risks including, but not limited to:

Certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the U.S.
Government. Our failure or inability to obtain such licenses would substantially limit our markets
and severely restrict our revenues. Many of the challenges noted above are applicable in China,
which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of
potential significant growth for our business. As the business volume between China and the rest of
the world grows, there is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships between China, Taiwan,
Japan, and the United States. Political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions
which would adversely affect our business with China and/or Taiwan and perhaps the entire Asia
region. A significant trade disruption in these areas could have a material, adverse impact on our
future revenue and profits.

We are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency
exchange rates. The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars except for
certain of our revenues that are denominated in Japanese yen, certain of our revenues and
expenses denominated in the Euro, certain of our spares and service contracts which are
denominated in various currencies, and expenses related to our non-U.S. sales and support offices
which are denominated in these countries’ local currency.



We currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact
of the exchange rate fluctuations on Japanese yen-denominated assets and forecasted Japanese
yen-denominated revenue and also on U.S. dollar-denominated assets where the Euro is the functional
currency. We currently believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation. We
expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions, for the purposes outlined, in the
foreseeable future. However, these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect
because differences between the actual timing of customer acceptances and our forecasts of those
acceptances may leave us either over- or under-hedged on any given transaction. Moreover, by
hedging our yen-denominated assets and U.S. dollar-denominated assets with currency forward
contracts, we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for
the hedges. Additionally, we currently do not enter into such forward contracts for currencies
other than the yen, and we therefore are subject to both favorable and unfavorable exchange rate
fluctuations to the extent that we transact business (including intercompany transactions) in other
currencies.

Our Financial Results May be Adversely Impacted by Higher Than Expected Tax Rates or Exposure to
Additional Income Tax Liabilities

As a global company, our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic
composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region. We are subject to
income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and significant judgment
is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities. Our effective tax rate could be adversely
affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates,
in the valuation of deferred tax assets, in tax laws or by material audit assessments, which could
affect our profitability. In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are
predominantly in the United States, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income
in the United States. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits
in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our
profitability.

A Failure to Comply with Environmental Regulations May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results

We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal
of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals. We believe that we are in general compliance
with these regulations and that we have obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise addressing) all
necessary environmental permits to conduct our business. These permits generally relate to the
disposal of hazardous wastes. Nevertheless, the failure to comply with present or future
regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, cessation of our
operations or reduction in our customers’ acceptance of our products. These regulations could
require us to alter our current operations, to acquire significant equipment or to incur
substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Our failure to control the
use, sale, transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities.

If We are Unable to Adjust the Scale of Our Business in Response to Rapid Changes in Demand in the
Semiconductor Equipment Industry, Our Operating Results and Our Ability to Compete Successfully May
be Impaired

The business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry has historically been characterized
by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our management to adjust spending and
resources allocated to operating activities. During periods of rapid growth or decline in demand
for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and
business controls, management processes, information systems and procedures and in training,
managing, and appropriately sizing our supply chain, our work force, and other components of our
business on a timely basis. Our success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our
executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these
challenges effectively. If we do not adequately meet these challenges, our gross margins and
earnings may be impaired during periods of demand decline, and we may lack the infrastructure and
resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during
periods of demand growth.



If We Choose to Acquire or Dispose of Product Lines and Technologies, We May Encounter Unforeseen
Costs and Difficulties That Could Impair Our Financial Performance

An important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would
complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, or enhance
our technological capabilities. As a result, we may make acquisitions of complementary companies,
products or technologies, such as our March 2008 acquisition of SEZ, or we may reduce or dispose of
certain product lines or technologies, that no longer fit our long-term strategies. Managing an
acquired business, disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entails numerous
operational and financial risks, including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new
personnel or separating existing business or product groups, diversion of management’s attention
away from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of
key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations among others. We anticipate that our
recent acquisition of SEZ will give rise to risks like these, as we integrate its operations with
ours. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such
integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of product lines or technologies, or reduction
in personnel or that our management, personnel, or systems will be adequate to support continued
operations. Any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our
business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.

In addition, any acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances
of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of
related intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and/or the price of our Common
Stock.

The Market for Our Common Stock is Volatile, Which May Affect Our Ability to Raise Capital or Make
Acquisitions

The market price for our Common Stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the
past years. The trading price of our Common Stock could continue to be highly volatile and
fluctuate widely in response to factors, including but not limited to the following:

In addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations.
Historically, we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our Common Stock due in part
to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for
semiconductors. These broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the
price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following
volatile periods in the price of stock, many companies became the object of securities class action
litigation. If we are sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs, and it
could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on the price for
our Common Stock.



We Rely Upon Certain Critical Information Systems for the Operation of Our Business

We maintain and rely upon certain critical Information Systems for the effective operation of
our business. These Information Systems include telecommunications, the internet, our corporate
intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, network communications, and e-mail.
These Information Systems may be owned by us or by our outsource providers or even third parties
such as vendors and contractors and may be maintained by us or by such providers and third parties.
These Information Systems are subject to attacks, failures, and access denials from a number of
potential sources including viruses, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, and physical
damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines, and networking equipment. To the extent that
these Information Systems are under our control, we have implemented security procedures, such as
virus protection software and emergency recovery processes, to address the outlined risks. However,
security procedures for Information Systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability
to use or access these Information Systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the
timely and efficient operation of our business.

Intellectual Property and Other Claims Against Us Can be Costly and Could Result in the Loss of
Significant Rights Which are Necessary to Our Continued Business and Profitability

Third parties may assert infringement, unfair competition or other claims against us. From
time to time, other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or
other intellectual property rights. In addition, our Bylaws and indemnity obligations provide that
we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings
resulting from their service to Lam Research. In such cases, it is our policy either to defend the
claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms. However, we
may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements
on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and any litigation resulting from these claims by
other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Moreover,
although we seek to obtain insurance to protect us from claims and cover losses to our property,
there is no guarantee that such insurance will fully indemnify us for any losses that we may incur.

We May Fail to Protect Our Proprietary Technology Rights, Which Could Affect Our Business

Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology. While we attempt to protect our
proprietary technology through patents, copyrights and trade secret protection, we believe that our
success also depends on increasing our technological expertise, continuing our development of new
systems, increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base, and providing
comprehensive support and service to our customers. However, we may be unable to protect our
technology in all instances, or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology
independently. We currently hold a number of United States and foreign patents and pending patent
applications. However, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any
patents the United States or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue
patents for pending applications. In addition, the rights granted or anticipated under any of these
patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect
or, in fact, provide no
competitive advantages.

We are Subject to the Internal Control Evaluation and Attestation Requirements of Section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include in our
annual report our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
and our audited financial statements as of the end of each fiscal year. Furthermore, our
independent registered public accounting firm (the “Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm”)
is required to report on whether it believes we maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year. We have successfully
completed our assessment and obtained our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm’s
attestation as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 29,
2008. In future years, if we fail to timely complete this assessment, or if our Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm cannot timely attest to our assessment, we could be subject to
regulatory sanctions and a loss of public confidence in our internal control. In addition, any
failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their
implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to timely meet our regulatory
reporting obligations.

Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Must Confirm Its Independence in Order for Us to
Meet Our Regulatory Reporting Obligations on a Timely Basis

Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm communicates with us at least annually
regarding any relationships between the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm and Lam
Research that, in the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm’s professional judgment, might
have a bearing on the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm’s independence with respect to
us. If, for whatever reason, our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm finds that it cannot
confirm that it is independent of Lam Research based on existing securities laws and registered
public accounting firm independence standards, we could experience delays or other failures to meet
our regulatory reporting obligations.



The Results of Our Independent Committee Review of Our Historical Stock Option Practices and
Resulting Restatements May Continue to Have Adverse Effects on Our Financial Results.

The review by a special committee of our Board of Directors consisting of two independent
Board members (the “Independent Committee”) of our historical stock option practices and the
resulting restatement of our historical financial statements have required us to expend significant
management time and incur significant accounting, legal, and other expenses during fiscal year
2008. The resulting restatements have had a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
We have restated our historical results of operations to record additional non-cash, stock-based
compensation expense of $95.2 million in the aggregate for the periods from fiscal 1997 to fiscal
2006 (excluding the impact of related payroll and income taxes). We amortized less than $0.1
million of compensation expense under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R (“SFAS
No. 123R”) in periods subsequent to fiscal year 2006 to properly account for previously issued
stock options with deemed incorrect measurement dates. Furthermore, to address potential adverse
tax consequences certain of our employees have incurred or may incur as a result of the issuance
and/or exercise of misdated stock options, we have taken and will continue to take remedial actions
to make such employees including our Chief Executive Officer and other affected executive officers,
whole for any or all such additional tax liabilities which were approximately $50 million as of
June 29, 2008. Such actions have caused and in the future may cause us to incur additional cash or
noncash compensation expense. See the “Explanatory Note” immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and
Note 3, “Restatements of Consolidated Financial Statements,” to Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements of our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended June 24, 2007 (“2007 Form
10-K”) for further discussion.

We May Be Subject to the Risks of Lawsuits in Connection With Our Historical Stock Option
Practices, the Resulting Restatements, and the Remedial Measures We Have Taken.

We, and our current and former directors and officers, may become the subject of shareholder
derivative and/or class action lawsuits and other legal proceedings relating to our historical
stock option practices and resulting restatements in the future. We may also be subject to other
kinds of lawsuits. Should any of these events occur, they could require us to expend significant
management time and incur significant accounting, legal and other expenses. This could divert
attention and resources from the operation of our business and adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations. In addition, the ultimate outcome of these potential actions
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,
cash flows and the trading price for our securities. Litigation may be time-consuming, expensive
and disruptive to normal business operations, and the outcome of litigation is difficult to
predict. The defense of these potential lawsuits could result in significant expenditures.

Subject to certain limitations, we are obliged to indemnify our current and former directors,
officers and employees in connection with any government inquiry or litigation related to our
historical stock option practices that may arise. We currently hold insurance policies for the benefit of our directors and officers, although there can be no assurance that the
insurance would cover all of the expenses that would be associated with any proceedings.

Judgment and Estimates Utilized by Us in Determining Stock Option Grant Dates and Related
Adjustments May Be Subject to Change due to Subsequent SEC Guidance or Other Disclosure
Requirements.

In determining the restatement adjustments in connection with the stock option review,
management used all reasonably available relevant information to form conclusions it believes are
appropriate as to the most likely option granting actions that occurred, the dates when such
actions occurred, and the determination of grant dates for financial accounting purposes based on
when the requirements of the accounting standards were met. We considered various alternatives
throughout the course of the review and restatement, and we believe the approaches used were the
most appropriate, and that the choices of measurement dates used in our review of stock option
grant accounting and restatement of our financial statements were reasonable and appropriate in our
circumstances. However, the SEC may issue additional guidance on disclosure requirements related to
the financial impact of past stock option grant measurement date errors that may require us to
amend this filing or other filings with the SEC to provide additional disclosures pursuant to such
additional guidance. Any such circumstance could also lead to future delays in filing our
subsequent SEC reports. Furthermore, if we are subject to adverse findings in any of these matters,
we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us which could
harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We Recently Regained Compliance with SEC Reporting Requirements. If We are Unable to Remain in
Compliance, There May Be a Material Adverse Effect on our Business and Our Stockholders.

As a consequence of the Independent Committee review of our historical stock option practices
and resulting restatements of our financial statements, for several quarters, we were not able to
file our periodic reports with the SEC on a timely basis and faced the possibility of delisting of
our stock from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. We have filed all of our tardy filings, which
remediated the Company’s non-compliance with Marketplace Rule
4310(c) (14), and believe we are we
are in compliance with all applicable reporting requirements. However, if the SEC disagrees with
the manner in which the financial impact of past stock option grants has been accounted for and
reported, or not reported, there could be delays in filing future SEC reports. See the “Explanatory
Note” immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 3, “Restatements of Consolidated Financial
Statements,” to Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2007 Form 10-K for further discussion.



As a result of the delayed filings of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters
ended September 23, 2007 and December 23, 2007, as well as of the 2007 Form 10-K, we are ineligible
to register our securities on Form S-3 for sale by us or resale by others until one year from March
31, 2008, the date the last delinquent filing was made. We may use Form S-1 to raise capital or
complete acquisitions, but doing so could increase transaction costs and adversely impact our
ability to raise capital or complete acquisitions of other companies in a timely manner.

Item 2.

Properties

Our executive offices and principal operating and R&D facilities are located in Fremont,
California, and are held under operating leases expiring from fiscal years 2010 to 2014. These
leases generally include options to renew or purchase the facilities. In addition, we lease
properties for our service, technical support and sales personnel throughout the United States,
Europe, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, and Asia Pacific and own manufacturing facilities located in Eaton,
Ohio and Villach, Austria. Our fiscal year 2008 rental expense for the space occupied during that
period aggregated approximately $11 million. Our facilities lease obligations are subject to
periodic increases, and we believe that our existing facilities are well-maintained and in good
operating condition.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

From time to time, we have received notices from third parties alleging infringement of such
parties’ patent or other intellectual property rights by our products. In such cases it is our
policy to defend the claims, or if considered appropriate, negotiate licenses on commercially
reasonable terms. However, no assurance can be given that we will be able to negotiate necessary
licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any litigation resulting from such
claims would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity,
operating results, or our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

Fiscal year 2008 amounts include the operating results of SEZ from the acquisition date of
March 11, 2008. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, “Business Combinations”. Please see
Note 16 “Acquisitions” of Note to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.

(2)

Restructuring charges and asset impairments, net exclude restructuring charges (recoveries)
included in cost of goods sold and reflected in gross margin of $12.6 million and $(1.7)
million for fiscal years 2008 and 2004, respectively. Restructuring amounts included in cost
of goods sold and reflected in gross margin during fiscal year 2008 primarily relate to the
integration of SEZ while the amounts in fiscal year 2004 primarily relate to the partial
recovery of the charges from the subsequent sale of a portion of inventories associated with
the write-off of selected, older product line inventories in connection with our prior
restructuring plans. These restructuring recoveries are included as a component of cost of
goods sold in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force 96-9, “Classification of Inventory
Markdowns and Other Costs Associated with a Restructuring” (EITF 96-9). There were no
restructuring charges or recoveries included in cost of goods sold in fiscal years 2007, 2006,
and 2005. Fiscal year 2005 restructuring charges consist only of additional liabilities
related to prior restructuring plans.

(3)

409A expense excludes the expense included in cost of goods sold and reflected in gross
margin of $6.4 million during fiscal year 2008. As a result of the determinations from a
voluntary independent stock option review, the Company considered the application of
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“IRC”) and similar provisions
of state law to certain stock option grants where, under Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”, intrinsic value was deemed to exist at the
time of grant. In the event such stock option grants are not considered as issued at fair
market value at the original grant date under the IRC and applicable regulations thereunder,
these options are subject to Section 409A. On March 30, 2008, the Board of Directors of the
Company authorized the Company to assume the tax liability
of certain employees, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and certain other
executive officers, with options subject to Section 409A and similar provisions of state law.



(4)

Operating income during the fiscal years ended June 29, 2008, June 24, 2007 and June 25, 2006
includes $42.6 million, $35.6 million and $24.0 million, respectively, of equity-based
compensation expense as a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment” at the beginning of fiscal year 2006.

(5)

Diluted net income per share for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2004 includes the assumed
conversion of the convertible subordinated 4% notes. Accordingly, interest expense, net of
taxes, of $3.2 million has been added back to net income for computing diluted earnings per
share.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains
forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition,
significance, value and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated
in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to
those discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this 2008

Form 10-K

and other documents we file
from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See “Cautionary Statement Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this 2008

Form 10-K

).

The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic
downturns and upturns. Today’s leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns may
not be any more reliable than in prior years. Demand for our equipment can vary significantly from
period to period as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, economic conditions
(generally and in the semiconductor industry), supply, demand, and prices for semiconductors,
customer capacity requirements, and our ability to develop, acquire, and market competitive
products. For these and other reasons, our results of operations for fiscal years 2008, 2007, and
2006 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A)
provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our
Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in this 2008 Form 10-K. MD&A consists of the following sections:

Executive Summary

provides a summary of the key highlights of our results of operations

Results of Operations

provides an analysis of operating results

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

discusses accounting policies that reflect the more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial
statements

Liquidity and Capital Resources

provides an analysis of cash flows, contractual obligations
and financial position

Executive Summary

We design, manufacture, market, and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the
fabrication of integrated circuits and are recognized as a major provider of such equipment to the
worldwide semiconductor industry. Semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process
and preparation steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated
circuits. We leverage our expertise in these areas to develop integrated and standalone processing
solutions which typically benefit our customers through reduced cost, lower defect rates, enhanced
yields, or faster processing time as well as by facilitating their ability to meet more stringent
performance and design standards.

Our business model, which utilizes the capabilities of outsource providers, enables us to
focus on new and existing product and process development, sales and marketing, and customer
support. Although there are near-term challenges from declining customer investment levels, we
continue to target to expand our leadership position in etch, leverage our etch expertise into
adjacent markets and meet our objective of delivering best-in-class financial performance over the
long term.

Fiscal year 2008 shipments were approximately $2.4 billion. Fiscal year 2008 revenues
decreased 4% compared to fiscal year 2007 revenues reflecting a reduction in customer demand in the
latter portion of the year.



Gross margin as a percent of revenues was 47.4% for fiscal year 2008 and decreased
sequentially compared to fiscal year 2007 gross margin of 50.8%. This reduction was primarily due
to customer concentration and product mix challenges and decreased factory utilization as a result
of reduced shipment volumes on declining customer investment levels.

Fiscal year 2008 operating expenses include the assumption of Section 409A employee
liabilities of $43.8 million and $19.3 million of costs related to our voluntary internal stock
option review. Included in operating expenses is $29.5 million from the operations of SEZ since
the date of acquisition. We also continue to invest significantly in research and development
focused on leading-edge plasma etch, single-wafer clean, and other new products and technologies.
Although there are near term pressures on our business from declining customer investment levels,
we are targeting the longer term benefit of our product development activities. These factors,
along with decreased revenues and gross margins noted above, contributed to the fiscal 2008
operating margin decrease to 20.6% compared with 30.3% in fiscal year 2007.

Our cash performance remained strong during fiscal year 2008 as our cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments and restricted cash and investments balances increased sequentially during
fiscal year 2008 by $174.1 million after the cash acquisition of SEZ for $482.6 million, net of
cash acquired. Cash flows from operating activities were $590.3 million during fiscal year 2008.

Unshipped orders in backlog as of June 29, 2008 were approximately $410 million and
decreased from approximately $643 million as of June 24, 2007 consistent with reduced spending
commitments of our customers in the semiconductor industry. The basis for recording new orders is
defined in our backlog policy. Our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems, spares,
and services where written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or
provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months. Our policy is to revise our backlog
for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect, among other things, spares volume
estimates and customer delivery date changes. Please refer to “Backlog” in Part I Item 1,
“Business” of this 2008 Form 10-K for additional information on our backlog policy.

The slight decrease in revenues during fiscal year 2008 from fiscal year 2007 reflects our
customers’ response to balancing supply and demand in the semiconductor industry. The increase in
revenues during fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 reflected an improved market
environment which was evidenced by expanded levels of capital investments by semiconductor
manufacturers and our market share expansion. Our revenue levels are correlated to the amount of
shipments and our installation and acceptance timelines. The overall Asia region continued to
account for a significant portion of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity
additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in that region. Our deferred revenue
balance decreased to $193.6 million as of June 29, 2008 compared to $295.5 million as of June 24,
2007, consistent with the decline in customer spending levels during fiscal year 2008. The
anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped from backlog to Japanese customers that are not
recorded as deferred revenue was approximately $52 million as of June 29, 2008; these shipments are
classified as inventory at cost until title transfers.

Gross margin as a percent of revenue during fiscal year 2008 was 47.4%. The decrease in gross
margin as a percent of revenue for fiscal year 2008 compared with fiscal year 2007 was primarily
due to decreased factory utilization as a result of reduced shipment volumes, as well as customer
concentration and product mix challenges, $12.6 million of one-time restructuring and asset
impairment expenses related to the streamlining of our combined clean product group, post SEZ
acquisition, and $6.4 million of expense associated with the assumption of the employee tax
liabilities as a result of the determinations from our voluntary independent stock option review.

The increase in gross margin as a percent of revenue during fiscal year 2007 compared
with fiscal year 2006 was primarily driven by improved utilization of factory and field resources
on higher business volumes partially offset by product and customer mix and implementation of a
targeted consumable spare parts price-reduction strategy focused on preserving and building market
share and strengthening customer trust in our efforts to support their cost-reduction roadmaps.

Although there are near term pressures on our business from declining customer investment
levels, given the targeted longer term benefit of our product development activities, we continue
to invest significantly in research and development focused on leading-edge plasma etch,
single-wafer clean, and new products and technologies. The fiscal year 2008 R&D expenses included
approximately $14 million from the operations of SEZ. Including SEZ since March 11, 2008, the
growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year 2008 compared to fiscal year 2007 reflect our
commitment towards our near-term and longer-term product growth objectives and included increases
of approximately $22 million in salary and benefits costs for planned increases in headcount and
employee base compensation supporting that same strategy, $9 million in engineering material
supplies and outside services targeting etch, and new product growth objectives, and a $3 million
decrease in incentive-based compensation driven by reduced profit levels. Approximately 74% and 33%
of fiscal years 2008 and 2007 systems revenues, respectively, were derived from products introduced
over the previous two years and is reflective of our continued investments in new products and
technologies.

The growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006
included expected increases of approximately $22 million in engineering material supplies and
outside services targeting etch, new and product growth objectives, $18 million in salary and
benefits costs for planned increases in headcount and employee base compensation supporting that
same strategy, $6 million in incentive-based compensation driven by higher profit levels and
$6 million in equity-based compensation.

Fiscal year 2008 SG&A expenses included approximately $15 million of SEZ SG&A expenses. The
increase in SG&A expenses during fiscal year 2008 compared with the prior year was driven by
increases of approximately $24 million in salary and benefit costs for planned increases in
headcount, including SEZ since March 11, 2008, and employee base compensation, $19 million in legal
and accounting cost incurred as a result of the voluntary stock option review, and $3 million in
equity-based compensation partially offset by a decrease of $5 million in incentive-based
compensation triggered by lower profit levels.

The increase in SG&A expenses during fiscal year 2007 compared with the prior year was driven
by increases of $20 million in incentive-based compensation triggered by higher profits and stock
price, approximately $15 million in salary and benefit costs for planned increases in headcount and
employee base compensation, and $5 million in equity-based compensation.

409A Expense

As a result of the determinations from the voluntary independent stock option review, we
considered the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and similar provisions of
state law to certain stock option grants where, under APB No. 25, intrinsic value existed at the
time of grant. In the event such stock option grants are not considered as issued at fair market
value at the original grant date under the IRC, these options are subject to Section 409A and
similar provisions of state law. Due to this, taxes and penalties are levied not on the intrinsic
value increase, but on the entire stock option gain for exercised options. On March 30, 2008, our
Board of Directors authorized us to assume the tax liability of certain employees, including our
Chief Executive Officer and certain executive officers, with options subject to Section 409A and
similar provisions of state law. The 409A liability totaled $50.2 million; $43.8 million was
recorded in operating expenses and $6.4 million in cost of goods sold in our consolidated
statements of operations for fiscal year 2008. The determinations from the voluntary independent
stock option review are more fully described in Note 3, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial
Statements” to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of our 2007 Form 10-K.

In Process Research and Development

We incurred a charge of $2.1 million related to the required expensing of in process research
and development following our acquisition of SEZ which is reported in operating expenses during
fiscal year 2008. There remains no additional in process research and development on our balance
sheet.

Restructuring and Asset Impairments

During the June 2008 quarter we incurred expenses for restructuring and asset impairment
charges related to the integration of SEZ and overall streamlining of our combined clean product
group (“June 2008 Plan”). These charges included severance and related benefits costs, excess
facilities-related costs and certain asset impairments associated with our initial product line
integration road maps.



Prior to the end of the June 2008 quarter, we initiated the announced restructuring
activities and management, with the proper level of authority, approved specific actions under the
June 2008 Plan. Severance packages to affected employees were communicated in enough detail such
that the employees could determine their type and amount of benefit. The termination of the
affected employees occurred as soon as practical after the restructuring plans were announced. The
amount of remaining future lease payments for facilities we ceased to use and included in the
restructuring charges is based on management’s estimates using known prevailing real estate market
conditions at that time based, in part, on the opinions of independent real estate experts.
Leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings were written off, as these items will have
no future economic benefit to us and have been abandoned.

We distinguish regular operating cost management activities from restructuring
activities. Accounting for restructuring activities requires an evaluation of formally committed
and approved plans. Restructuring activities have comparatively greater strategic significance and
materiality and may involve exit activities, whereas regular cost containment activities are more
tactical in nature and are rarely characterized by formal and integrated action plans or exiting a
particular product, facility, or service.

We recorded net restructuring charges and asset impairments during fiscal year 2008 of
approximately $19.0 million, consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated
employees of $5.5 million, charges for the present value of remaining lease payments on vacated
facilities of $0.9 million, and the write-off of related fixed assets of $1.9 million. We also
recorded asset impairments related to initial product line integration road maps of $10.7 million.
Of the total $19.0 million in charges, $12.6 million was recorded in cost of goods sold and $6.4
million was recorded in operating expenses in our fiscal year 2008 consolidated statement of
operations.

As a result of the fiscal year 2008 restructuring activities, we expect annual savings,
relative to the cost structure immediately preceding the activities, in total expenses of
approximately $25 million. These estimated savings from the June 2008 Plan’s discrete actions are
primarily related to lower employee payroll, facilities, and depreciation expenses. Actual savings
may vary from these forecasts, depending upon future events and circumstances.

The decrease in interest income during fiscal year 2008 compared with the prior year is
primarily due to decreases in our average balances of cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments, and restricted cash and investments throughout fiscal year 2008 and to a lesser
extent, decreases in interest rate yields. The decrease in average balances was due to share
repurchase activity of $1.1 billion during fiscal year 2007, of which $768.0 million was
repurchased during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, and the acquisition of SEZ in fiscal
year 2008 in the amount of $482.6 million, net of cash acquired. The sequential increase in
interest income during fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 was due to the combined effect
of increased cash and cash equivalents, short-term securities, and restricted cash and investments
balances as well as increases in interest rate yields.

The decrease in interest expense during fiscal year 2008 as compared with the prior year was
due to a $100 million repayment on our long-term debt during the December and March quarters of
fiscal year 2007 and a decline in interest rates. The balance of our long-term debt and capital
lease obligations as of June 29, 2008 was $306.3 million. The current portion of long-term debt
and capital leases was $30.2 million as of June 29, 2008. Consolidated debt and capital lease
obligations increased during fiscal year 2008 as a result of the SEZ acquisition. Debt and capital
lease balances related to the SEZ acquisition were $56.3 million in total with $5.2 million
representing the current portion as of June 29, 2008. The debt obligations consist of various bank
loans and government grants supporting operating needs and capital leases reflect building lease
obligations. The increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2007 as compared with fiscal year
2006 was due to the $350 million of long-term debt entered into by our wholly-owned subsidiary on
June 16, 2006 to facilitate the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation
Act of 2004 (AJCA). The balance of our long-term debt was $250 million as of June 24, 2007.

Included in foreign exchange gains during fiscal year 2008 are gains associated with the
acquisition of SEZ of $42.7 million relating primarily to the settlement of a hedge of the Swiss
franc. These acquisition-related net foreign exchange gains were partially offset by other foreign
exchange losses of approximately $11.2 million during fiscal year 2008 which were primarily due to
our foreign currency denominated liabilities with non-U.S. dollar functional subsidiaries where the
U.S. dollar weakened against certain currencies, primarily the Euro and Taiwan dollar resulting in
the foreign exchange loss. A description of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates can be
found in the Risk Factors section of this 2008 Form 10-K under the heading “Our Future Success
Depends on International Sales and Management of Global Operations.”

In June 2007 we recognized a gain of $3.0 million related to the sale of a private equity
investment.

The favorable legal judgment of $15.8 million during fiscal year 2007 was obtained in a
lawsuit filed by us alleging breach of purchase order contracts by one of our customers. The
Supreme Court of California denied review of lower and appellate court judgments in favor of Lam
Research during the quarter ended September 24, 2006.

Income Tax Expense

Our annual income tax expense was $137.6 million, $161.9 million, and $104.6 million in fiscal
years 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2008, 2007, and
2006 was 23.9%, 19.1%, and 23.8%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal
year 2008 is primarily due to the application of certain foreign tax rulings, a decrease in the
proportion of income in low tax jurisdictions, as well as the expiration of the federal research
tax credit which expired on December 31, 2007. The increase was partially offset by certain
discrete events resulting in a net tax benefit of $11.6 million. These discrete events included
favorable adjustments for previously estimated tax liabilities upon the filing of our U.S. and
certain foreign income tax returns, and the reversal of tax reserves with respect to certain
transfer pricing items now settled.

The fiscal year 2007 effective tax rate was 19.1%, compared to the fiscal year 2006 effective
tax rate of 23.8%, and reflects the increase in income in jurisdictions with a lower tax rate as
well as certain discrete events resulting in a net tax benefit of $21.5 million. These discrete
events included favorable adjustments for previously estimated tax liabilities upon the filing of
our U.S. and certain
foreign income tax returns, the reversal of tax reserves with respect to certain transfer
pricing items now settled and an increased benefit related to the extension of the federal research
credit as it pertains to our fiscal year 2006. These favorable adjustments were partially offset by
an increase in tax expense related to the application of foreign tax rulings.

Deferred Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income
tax purposes. Our gross deferred tax assets, primarily comprised of reserves and accruals that are
not currently deductible and tax credit carryforwards, were $173.0 million and $123.3 million at
the end of fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively. These gross deferred tax assets were offset by
deferred tax liabilities of $53.1 million and $34.2 million at the end of fiscal years 2008 and
2007, respectively, and a valuation allowance of $3.4 million at the end of fiscal year 2008.
There was no such valuation allowance at the end of fiscal year 2007.



Deferred tax assets increased in fiscal year 2008 primarily due to the accrual related to the
Section 409A employee liability and the deferred tax assets from the acquisition of SEZ. The
increase in deferred tax liability in fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to the acquisition of SEZ.

We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more
likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future
taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however,
ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not
known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to
realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in
the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than
not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation
allowance would be reversed. Our current valuation allowance of $3.4 million relates to deferred
tax assets acquired in the SEZ acquisition. Any subsequently recognized tax benefits associated
with valuation allowances recorded in the SEZ acquisition will be recorded as an adjustment to
goodwill. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to
assess the need for additional valuation allowances, if any.

FIN 48

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation
Number 48, “Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting
for income taxes, by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet
before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on
derecognizing, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006.
We adopted FIN 48 as of June 25, 2007. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, we decreased the
recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $26.2 million as well as
reclassed approximately $64.4 million from current to non-current income taxes payable. The
cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 was a $17.6 million increase to our opening retained earnings
in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008.

We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on
factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law,
effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or
measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax
provision.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We based our estimates
and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable
and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions.
Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.

The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are
described in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of these significant accounting
policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined
as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and
requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need
to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.

We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant
judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition:

We recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling
price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have
completed our system installation obligations, received customer acceptance or are otherwise
released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations. In the event that terms of the
sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of
the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. In circumstances
where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do
not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue where it can be reliably
demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed-to customer specifications. In
situations with multiple deliverables, revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate
elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our
customer acceptance obligations. Revenue from multiple-element arrangements is allocated among the
separate elements based on their relative fair values, provided the elements have value on a
stand-alone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the arrangement does not
include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the
undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. The maximum revenue
recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent



upon the delivery
of additional items. Revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits is generally
recognized upon shipment. Revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of
the services requested by a customer order. Revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with
a fixed payment amount is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.

Inventory Valuation

: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using
standard costs which generally approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. We maintain
a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on-hand and standard cost for
each product, including purchased components, subassemblies, and finished goods. We maintain the
integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand.
Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer.
Generally, title transfer is documented in the terms of sale. When the terms of sale do not
specify, we assume title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the
freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail. Transfer of title for shipments to
Japanese customers generally occurs at time of customer acceptance.

Standard costs are reassessed as needed but annually at a minimum, and reflect achievable
acquisition costs, generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts, currently
obtainable assembly and test labor utilization levels, methods of manufacturing, and overhead for
internally manufactured products. Manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to
individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization
volumes. All intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal
entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements.

Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least
quarterly. Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw
materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete
inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to
36 months is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost. Inherent in the
estimates of market value are management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules,
customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions,
possible alternative uses, and ultimate realization of excess inventory. If future customer demand
or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may
be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made.

Warranty

: Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and
service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. We offer standard
warranties for our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance.
When appropriate, we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each
system upon revenue recognition. The amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity
which uses factors such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such
as tool reliability trends. All actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are
charged to those established reserves on a system-by-system basis.

Actual warranty expenses are incurred on a system-by-system basis, and may differ from
our original estimates. While we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty
activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments
to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. We do not maintain
general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems.

In addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer customer-paid extended
warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment
amount are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are
recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and
estimable.

Equity-based Compensation — Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Plans

: We
account for our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) and stock plans under the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R (“SFAS No. 123R”). SFAS No. 123R requires the
recognition of the fair value of equity-based compensation in net income. The fair value of our
restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair market value of Company stock at the date
of grant. The fair value of our stock options and ESPP awards was estimated using a Black-Scholes
option valuation model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions and
elections in adopting and implementing SFAS No. 123R, including expected stock price volatility and
the estimated life of each award. The fair value of equity- based awards is amortized over the vesting
period of the award and we have elected to use the straight-line method for awards granted after
the adoption of SFAS No. 123R and continue to use a graded vesting method for awards granted prior
to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R.

We make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool related to equity-based
compensation to determine if there are any deficiencies that require recognition in our
consolidated statements of operations. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we will only
recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in paid-in-capital if an incremental tax benefit
is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In
addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the
research tax credit through the income statement (continuing operations) rather than through
paid-in-capital. We have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation
allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock
award tax benefits determined under Accounting Principles Board No. 25 for income tax footnote
disclosure purposes. We will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize
these attributes through paid-in-capital in accordance with Footnote 82 of SFAS No. 123R.



Income Taxes:

Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences
between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the
amounts used for income tax purposes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax
assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred
tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such
assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market
conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we
determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an
adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we
later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized,
then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed.

We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that
can differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent
year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified.

We provide for income taxes on the basis of annual estimated effective income tax rates.
Our estimated effective income tax rate reflects our underlying profitability, the level of R&D
spending, the regions where profits are recorded and the respective tax rates imposed. We carefully
monitor these factors and adjust the effective income tax rate, if necessary. If actual results
differ from estimates, we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance on deferred
tax assets or adjust our effective income tax rate, which could have a material impact on our
business, results of operations, and financial condition.

The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application
of complex tax laws. Our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly
judgmental. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could
have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation 48, “Accounting for Income Tax
Uncertainties” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return
positions in the financial statements as “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained by the taxing
authority. The recently issued literature also provides guidance on the derecognition, measurement
and classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and penalties. FIN
48 also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and
increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties.     We
adopted FIN 48 in the first quarter of 2008. See Note 15: “Income Taxes” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements of this 2008 Form 10-K for further discussion.

We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for
financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax
credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities,
which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and
financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax
positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax
provision in a subsequent period.

We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If
recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance
against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe
that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our
consolidated balance sheets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our
deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the
recovery was not probable.

In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties
in the application of complex tax regulations. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we
recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process prescribed within
the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining
if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position
will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if
any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that
is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and
subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various
possible outcomes. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This
evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances,
changes in tax law, effectively
settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement
would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in
the period.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

We account for goodwill and other intangible assets in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets”, (“SFAS No. 142”). SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and identifiable intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least
annually. SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be
amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and
reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets”.

We review goodwill at least annually for impairment. Should certain events or indicators of
impairment occur between annual impairment tests, we perform the impairment test of goodwill at
that date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) allocate goodwill to our
various reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of our



reporting units; and (3) determine the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units, as
some of the assets and liabilities related to those reporting units are not held by those reporting
units but by corporate headquarters. Furthermore, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit
is less than the carrying value, we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and
liabilities of that reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an
acquired business. This can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and
unrecognized intangible assets such as in-process research and development and developed
technology. Only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, be
determined.

The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires
significant judgment at many points during the analysis. In estimating the fair value of a
reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses, we make estimates and judgments
about the future cash flows of that reporting unit. Although our cash flow forecasts are based on
assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying
businesses, there is significant exercise of judgment involved in determining the cash flows
attributable to a reporting unit over its estimated remaining useful life. In addition, we make
certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting
units. We also consider our and our competitor’s market capitalization on the date we perform the
analysis. Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill
impairment charge.

The value assigned to intangible assets is based on estimates and judgments regarding
expectations such as the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If actual
product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, we may be required to record an
impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation Number 48, “Accounting for Income Tax
Uncertainties” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes, by prescribing a
minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the
financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognizing, measurement, classification,
interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We adopted FIN 48 as of June 25,
2007. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, the Company decreased the recorded liability for
unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $26.2 million, and reclassed approximately $64.4 million
from current to non-current income taxes payable. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 resulted
in an increase to the Company’s opening retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008
of approximately $17.6 million.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157,
“Fair Value Measurements,” (“SFAS No. 157”), which defines fair value, establishes guidelines for
measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does
not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found
in various prior accounting pronouncements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
No. 157-2 delaying the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis.
We will adopt the delayed portions of SFAS No. 157 during fiscal year 2010, while all other
portions of the standard will be adopted during fiscal year 2009, as required. SFAS No. 157 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Earlier adoption is permitted,
provided the company has not yet issued financial statements, including interim periods, for that
fiscal year. Our financial assets and liabilities impacted by SFAS No. 157 relate primarily to
derivatives, short-term investments and restricted investments balances. We do not believe there
will be any material impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity as a
result of adopting the provisions of SFAS No. 157.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159,
“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — Including an amendment of
FASB Statement No. 115” (“SFAS No. 159”). This statement permits entities to choose to measure many
financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be
measured at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to
facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar
types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of
an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007, provided the entity also elects
to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 157. We do not believe there will be any material impact on our
financial position, results of operations and liquidity as a result of adopting the provisions of
SFAS No. 159.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141
(revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS No. 141R”). SFAS 141R establishes principles and
requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the
identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree
and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No. 141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the
evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141R is
effective as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2008. We
expect to adopt SFAS No. 141R in the beginning of fiscal year 2010 and are currently evaluating the
potential impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS No. 141R on our consolidated results of
operations and financial condition.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160,
“Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — An Amendment of ARB 51”
(“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting



standards for the treatment of
noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary. Noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary will be reported
as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements and any retained noncontrolling
equity investment upon deconsolidation of a subsidiary is initially measured at fair value.
SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 160
will result in the reclassification of minority interests to stockholders’ equity. We are currently
assessing any further impacts of SFAS 160 on our results of operations and financial condition.

In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161,
“Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities — An Amendment of FASB Statement
133” (“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161 requires expanded and enhanced disclosure for derivative instruments,
including those used in hedging activities. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim
periods beginning after November 15, 2008. We are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of
SFAS 161 on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards 142-3, “Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets” (“FSP SFAS 142-3”). FSP
SFAS 142-3 provides guidance with respect to estimating the useful lives of recognized intangible
assets acquired on or after the effective date and requires additional disclosure related to the
renewal or extension of the terms of recognized intangible assets. FSP SFAS 142-3 is effective for
fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008. We are currently assessing the
impact of the adoption of FSP SFAS 142-3 on our results of operations and financial condition.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

During fiscal year 2008 we grew our gross cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments,
and restricted cash and investments balance to $1.2 billion compared with $1.0 billion at June 24,
2007. During fiscal year 2008, we generated $590.3 million in cash from operating activities. In
addition, we acquired SEZ for $482.6 million, net of cash acquired, in an all cash transaction.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities of $590.3 million during fiscal year 2008 consisted
of (in millions):

Significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts , net of amounts acquired from
SEZ, included the following sources of cash: a decrease in accounts receivable of $99.9 million on
lower business volumes, an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $80.6 million that
was primarily due to an increase in accrued compensation, including an accrual for the assumption
of 409A liabilities of $50.2 million, and a decrease in inventories of $19.7 million on lower
business volumes. These sources of cash
were partially offset by decreases in deferred profit and accounts payable of $64.0 million
and $40.1 million, respectively, on lower business volumes, and an increase in prepaid expenses and
other assets of $22.0 million primarily due to an increase in income taxes receivable.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2008 was $495.8 million which was
primarily due to our acquisition of SEZ for $482.6 million, net of cash acquired. In addition, our
capital expenditures were $76.8 million and we purchased Swiss franc call options related to the
acquisition of SEZ totaling $13.5 million. These expenditures were partially offset by net
sales/maturities of investments of $18.8 million, proceeds from the settlement of the call options
related to the SEZ acquisition of $47.3 million and the reclassification of restricted cash of
$15.5 million.



Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2008 was $65.8 million which was
primarily due to $58.9 million of excess tax benefit on equity-based compensation plans
representing the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized, $21.3
million from the issuance of our Common Stock related to employee equity-based plans, partially
offset by $14.6 million in share repurchases related to shares withheld through net share
settlements upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards under our equity compensation plans.

Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining
sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and
capital infrastructure. Based upon our current business outlook, our levels of cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments at June 29, 2008 are expected to be sufficient to support
our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, and capital
expenditures through at least the next 12 months.

In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our
ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products. Should additional
funding be required, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or
private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, in the event of such requirements, we
will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives.
However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be
no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

We have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of which are
recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not. Obligations are recorded on our balance
sheet in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and include our long-term
debt which is outlined in the following table and discussed below. Our off-balance sheet
arrangements include contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase
obligations in the table below. Our contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to these
agreements, and our guarantees are included in the following table. The amounts in the table below
exclude $109.5 million of liabilities under FIN 48 as we are unable to reasonably estimate the
ultimate amount or time of settlement. See Note 15, “Income Taxes” of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion.

Operating Leases

We lease most of our administrative, R&D and manufacturing facilities, regional
sales/service offices and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases, which expire at
various dates through 2016. Certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our Fremont,
California headquarters and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the
leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide
for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation.

Included in the Operating Leases Over 5 years section of the table above is $141.8
million in guaranteed residual values for lease agreements relating to certain properties at our
Fremont, California campus and properties in Livermore, California.

On December 18, 2007, we entered into a series of two operating leases (the “Livermore
Leases”) regarding certain improved properties in Livermore, California. On December 21, 2007, we
entered into a series of four amended and restated operating leases (the “New Fremont Leases,” and
collectively with the Livermore Leases, the “Operating Leases”) with regard to certain improved
properties at our headquarters in Fremont, California. Each of the Operating Leases is an
off-balance sheet arrangement. The
Operating Leases (and associated documents for each Operating Lease) were entered into by us and
BNP Paribas Leasing Corporation (“BNPPLC”).



Each Livermore Lease facility has an approximately seven-year term (inclusive of an
initial construction period during which BNPPLC’s and our obligations will be governed by the
Construction Agreement entered into with regard to such Livermore Lease facility) ending on the
first business day in January, 2015. Each New Fremont Lease has an approximately seven-year term
ending on the first business day in January, 2015.

Under each Operating Lease, we may, at our discretion and with 30 days’ notice, elect to
purchase the property that is the subject of the Operating Lease for an amount approximating the
sum required to prepay the amount of BNPPLC’s investment in the property and any accrued but unpaid
rent. Any such amount may also include an additional make-whole amount for early redemption of the
outstanding investment, which will vary depending on prevailing interest rates at the time of
prepayment.

We will be required, pursuant to the terms of the Operating Leases and associated
documents, to maintain collateral in an aggregate of approximately $165.0 million (upon completion
of the Livermore construction) in separate interest-bearing accounts and/or eligible short-term
investments as security for our obligations under the Operating Leases. As of June 29, 2008, we had
$129.2 million recorded as restricted cash and short-term investments in our consolidated balance
sheet as collateral required under the lease agreements related to the amounts currently
outstanding on the facility.

Upon expiration of the term of an Operating Lease, the property subject to that Operating
Lease may be remarketed. We have guaranteed to BNPPLC that each property will have a certain
minimum residual value, as set forth in the applicable Operating Lease. The aggregate guarantee
made by us under the Operating Leases is no more than approximately $141.8 million (although, under
certain default circumstances, the guarantee with regard to an Operating Lease may be 100% of
BNPPLC’s investment in the applicable property; in the aggregate, the amounts payable under such
guarantees will be no more than $165.0 million plus related indemnification or other obligations).

The lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that
does not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity (VIE) as defined by FASB
Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” and is therefore not
consolidated by us.

The remaining operating lease balances primarily relate to non-cancelable
facility-related operating leases.

Capital Leases

Capital leases reflect building lease obligations assumed from our acquisition of SEZ.
The amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations.

Purchase Obligations

Purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual
basis or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material
commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories. We continue to enter into new agreements and
maintain existing agreements to outsource certain activities, including elements of our
manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance, certain information technology
functions, and certain transactional general and administrative functions. The contractual cash
obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 29, 2008
under these arrangements and others. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of
transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition to these obligations, certain
of these agreements include early termination provisions and/or cancellation penalties which could
increase or decrease amounts actually paid.

Consignment inventories, which are owned by vendors but located in our storage locations
and warehouses, are not reported as our inventory until title is transferred to us or our purchase
obligation is determined. At June 29, 2008, vendor-owned inventories held at our locations and not
reported as our inventory were $26.5 million.

Long-Term Debt

On June 16, 2006, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Lam Research International SARL (“LRI”), as
borrower, entered into a $350 million Credit Agreement (the “LRI Credit Agreement”). In connection
with the LRI Credit Agreement, we entered into a Guarantee Agreement (the “Guarantee Agreement”)
guaranteeing the obligations of LRI under the LRI Credit Agreement. The outstanding balance on the
loan was repaid in full during the quarter ended March 30, 2008.

Concurrent with the repayment of the LRI Credit Agreement noted above, on March 3, 2008, we,
as borrower, entered into a Credit Agreement, dated as of March 3, 2008 (the “Credit Agreement”)
with ABN AMRO BANK N.V (the “Agent”), as administrative agent for the lenders party to the Credit
Agreement, and such lenders. Our wholly-owned domestic subsidiary entered into a guarantee for the
obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement. In connection with the Credit Agreement, the
Company and its wholly-owned domestic subsidiary entered into certain collateral documents
(collectively, the “Collateral Documents”) including certain
Security Agreements, a Pledge Agreement and other Collateral Documents to secure our obligations
under the Credit Agreement. The Collateral Documents encumber certain current and future accounts
receivables, inventory, equipment and related assets.



Under the Credit Agreement, we borrowed $250 million in principal amount for general
corporate purposes. The loan under the Credit Agreement is a non-revolving term loan with the
following repayment terms: (a) $12.5 million of the principal amount due on each of (i) September
30, 2008, (ii) March 31, 2009 and (iii) September 30, 2009 and (b) the payment of the remaining
principal amount on March 6, 2010. The outstanding principal amount bears interest at LIBOR plus
0.75% per annum or, alternatively, at the Agent’s “prime rate.” We may prepay the loan under the
Credit Agreement in whole or in part at any time without penalty. The Credit Agreement contains
customary representations, warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default, as well as
various negative covenants (including maximum leverage ratio, minimum liquidity and minimum
EBITDA).

As a condition to funding under the Credit Agreement, the outstanding balance ($250 million)
under the LRI Credit Agreement was repaid in full. LRI is our wholly-owned subsidiary. In addition,
the Guarantee Agreement was also terminated. Our obligations under the Guarantee Agreement were
fully collateralized by cash and cash equivalents.

Consolidated debt obligations increased slightly as a result of the SEZ acquisition by
$34.8 million of which $4.6 million represents the current portion of long-term debt and $30.2
million is classified as long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet. The debt obligations
consist of various bank loans and government grants supporting operating needs.

Our total long-term debt of $284.8 million as of June 29, 2008 includes the $250.0 million
discussed above and $34.8 million from SEZ. The current portion of long-term debt was $29.6
million as of June 29, 2008.

Guarantees

We account for our guarantees in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45 “Guarantor’s
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others” (“FIN 45”). FIN 45 requires a company that is a guarantor to make specific
disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. FIN 45 also requires
a company (the guarantor) to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the
obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee.

We have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under
some of our agreements. We have entered into certain insurance contracts which may limit our
exposure to such indemnifications. As of June 29, 2008, we have not recorded any liability on our
consolidated financial statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe,
based on information available, that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these
guarantees.

Generally, the Company indemnifies, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, its
customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by the Company’s products or
services. The Company seeks to limit its liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed
the sales price of the products or services subject to its indemnification obligations. The Company
does not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any material amounts
will be paid under these guarantees.

The Company offers standard warranties on its systems that run generally for a period of
12 months from system acceptance. The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty
spending activity by type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known
differences such as the impact of system reliability improvements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Investments

We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. As of June
29, 2008, these securities are classified as available-for-sale and consequently are recorded in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a
separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax.

Fixed Income Securities

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment
portfolio and variable rate long-term debt. At any time, a sharp rise in interest rates could have
a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio. Conversely,
declines in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our
investment portfolio. We target to maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the
safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, and
reinvestment risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values of fixed income
securities as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates.
Market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus
50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS. The hypothetical fair values as of June 29,2008 are
as follows:

We mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our
portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment
issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or
resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification.

Publicly Traded Equity Securities and Equity Mutual Funds

The values of our equity investments in publicly traded equity securities and equity mutual
funds are subject to equity price risk. The following table presents the hypothetical fair values
of our publicly traded equity security and equity mutual funds as a result of selected potential
decreases and increases in the price of each equity security in the portfolio. Potential
fluctuations in the price of each equity security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10%, 15%, 25%
were selected based on potential near-term changes in those security prices. The hypothetical fair

Foreign Currency Derivatives

We conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we
are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange
rates. The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars except for certain of
our revenues that are denominated in Japanese yen, certain revenues and expenses denominated in the
Euro, certain of our spares and service contracts which are denominated in various currencies, and
expenses related to our non-U.S. sales and support offices which are denominated in these
countries’ local currency. We currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize
the short-term impact of the exchange rate fluctuations on Japanese yen-denominated net assets and
forecasted Japanese yen-denominated revenue and also on U.S. dollar-denominated assets where the
Euro is the functional currency. We currently believe these are our primary exposures to currency
rate fluctuation. To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted Japanese yen-denominated
revenues, we enter into foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts that generally expire
within 12 months, and no later than 24 months. These foreign currency forward exchange rate
contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on our balance sheet at fair value
with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged
revenue is recognized. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and
losses generated by the remeasurement of Japanese yen-denominated net receivable balances against
the U.S. dollar and U.S. dollar-denominated net receivable balances against the Euro. The change
in fair value of these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of
other income and expense and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated
intercompany and trade receivables, recorded in other income and expense, assuming the hedge
contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances.

The notional amount and unrealized loss of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts
that are designated as balance sheet hedges as of June 29, 2008 is shown in the table below. This
table also shows the change in fair value of these balance sheet hedges assuming a hypothetical
foreign currency exchange rate movement of +/- 10 percent and +/- 15 percent. These changes in
fair values would be offset in other income and expense by corresponding change in fair values of
the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables assuming the hedge contract
fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances.

Long-Term Debt

Our long-term debt consists of $250 million in a non-revolving term loan with the following
repayment terms: (a) $12.5 million of the principal amount due on each of (i) September 30, 2008,
(ii) March 31, 2009 and (iii) September 30, 2009 and (b) the payment of the remaining principal
amount on March 6, 2010. The outstanding principal amount bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.75% per
annum or, alternatively, at the Agent’s “prime rate.” We may prepay the loan under the Credit
Agreement in whole or in part at any time without penalty. At any time a sharp increase in
interest rates could have a material adverse effect on interest expense and a material favorable
effect on interest expense with a sharp decline in interest rates.

A hypothetical change in interest rates on our variable rate long-term debt of 50 basis points
would result in a change in interest expense of approximately $1.3 million per fiscal year.

In addition, our long-term debt includes $3.8 million of variable rate debt based on local
LIBOR rates plus a spread of 0.50% and is subject to adverse as well as beneficial changes in
interest expense due to fluctuation in interest rates.

Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

The Consolidated Financial Statements required by this Item are set forth on the pages
indicated in Item 15(a). The unaudited quarterly results of our operations for our two most recent
fiscal years are incorporated herein by reference under Item 6, “Selected Financial Data”.

Item 9.

Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.



Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”), as of June 29, 2008, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with
the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as defined in Rule 13a-15(e). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer along with
our Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at
the reasonable assurance level.

We intend to review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures on an ongoing basis and to correct any material deficiencies that we may discover. Our
goal is to ensure that our senior management has timely access to material information that could
affect our business.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

SEZ Acquisition

. As a result of our acquisition of SEZ during the quarter ended March 30,
2008, our internal control over financial reporting now includes the controls of SEZ.

Except as disclosed above, there has been no change in our internal control over financial
reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control—Integrated
Framework” published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to
evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Based on
that evaluation, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of June 29, 2008 at providing reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the operations acquired from SEZ,
which was acquired on March 11, 2008. As allowed pursuant to guidance from the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the evaluation of internal control over financial reporting of SEZ may be
excluded. As of and for the year ended June 29, 2008 total assets and revenue of SEZ represented
27% (including goodwill and intangible assets) and 2% (from the March 11, 2008 acquisition date) of
consolidated total assets and revenue, respectively.

Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report, which is included in Part IV,
Item 15 of this 2008 Form 10-K.

Effectiveness of Controls

While we believe the present design of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting is effective at the reasonable assurance level, future events
affecting our business may cause us to modify our disclosure controls and procedures or internal
control over financial reporting. The effectiveness of controls cannot be absolute because the cost
to design and implement a control to identify errors or mitigate the risk of errors occurring
should not outweigh the potential loss caused by the errors that would likely be detected by the
control. Moreover, we believe that a control system cannot be guaranteed to be 100% effective all
of the time. Accordingly, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met.

Item 9B. Other Information

None.



PART III

We have omitted from the Report certain information required by Part III because we, as the
Registrant, will file a definitive proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JUNE 29, 2008

Note 1: Company and Industry Information

The Company designs, manufactures, markets, and services semiconductor processing equipment
used in the fabrication of integrated circuits. Semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex
series of process and preparation steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual
integrated circuits. The Company leverages its expertise in these areas to develop integrated
processing solutions which typically benefit its customers through reduced cost, lower defect
rates, enhanced yields, or faster processing time. The Company sells its products and services
primarily to companies involved in the production of semiconductors in the United States, Europe,
Taiwan, Korea, Japan, and Asia Pacific.

The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic
downturns and upturns. Today’s leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns may
not be any more reliable than in prior years. Demand for the Company’s equipment can vary
significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to,
economic conditions, supply, demand, and prices for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements,
and the Company’s ability to develop and market competitive products. For these and other reasons,
the Company’s results of operations for fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006 may not necessarily be
indicative of future operating results.

Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that could affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company based its estimates and
assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable,
and evaluates them on an on-going basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions.
Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition:

The Company recognizes all revenue when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the
selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and the
Company has completed its system installation obligations, received customer acceptance or is
otherwise released from its installation or customer acceptance obligations. In the event that
terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, the Company recognizes revenue
upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs
first. In circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance
or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, the Company recognizes revenue
where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed-to customer
specifications. In situations with multiple deliverables, revenue is recognized upon the delivery
of the separate elements to the customer and when the Company receives customer acceptance or is
otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. Revenue from multiple-element
arrangements is allocated among the separate elements based on their relative fair values, provided
the elements have value on a stand-alone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of fair
value, the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item
and delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in
our control. The maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is
not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. Revenue related to sales of spare parts and
system upgrade kits is generally recognized upon shipment. Revenue related to services is generally
recognized upon completion of the services requested by a customer order. Revenue for extended
maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount is recognized on a straight-line basis
over the term of the contract.

Inventory Valuation

: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard
costs which generally approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company
maintains a perpetual inventory system and continuously records the quantity on-hand and standard
cost for each product, including purchased components, subassemblies, and finished goods. The
Company maintains the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of
quantities on hand. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to
the customer. Generally, title transfer is documented in the terms of sale. When the terms of sale
do not specify, the Company assumes title transfers when it completes physical transfer of the
products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail. Transfer of title for
shipments to Japanese customers generally occurs at time of customer acceptance.

Standard costs are reassessed as needed, but annually at a minimum, and reflect achievable
acquisition costs, generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts, currently
obtainable assembly and test labor utilization levels, methods of manufacturing, and overhead for
internally manufactured products. Manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to
individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization
volumes. All intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal
entities are eliminated from the Company’s consolidated financial statements.



Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least
quarterly. The Company’s policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including
manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting
period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over
the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost. Inherent
in the estimates of market value are management’s forecasts related to its future manufacturing
schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market
conditions, possible alternative uses, and ultimate realization of excess inventory. If future
customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than the Company’s projections, additional
inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the
revision is made.

The Company records shipping and handling costs in cost of goods sold in its consolidated
statements of operations.

Warranty

: Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and
service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. The Company offers
standard warranties for its systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system
acceptance. When appropriate, the Company records a provision for estimated warranty expenses to
cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition. The amount recorded is based on an analysis
of historical activity which uses factors such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and
any known factors such as tool reliability trends. All actual parts and labor costs incurred in
subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves on a system-by-system basis.

Actual warranty expenses are incurred on a system-by-system basis, and may differ from the
Company’s original estimates. While the Company periodically monitors the performance and cost of
warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than its estimates, the Company may
recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are
identified. The Company does not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves
are related to specific systems.

In addition to the provision of standard warranties, the Company offers customer-paid extended
warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment
amount are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are
recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and
estimable.

Equity-based Compensation — Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Plans

: The
Company accounts for its employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) and stock plans under the provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R (“SFAS No. 123R”). SFAS No. 123R requires
the recognition of the fair value of equity-based compensation in net income. The fair value of our
restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair market value of Company stock at the date
of grant. The fair value of our stock options and ESPP awards was estimated using a Black-Scholes
option valuation model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions and
elections in adopting and implementing SFAS No. 123R, including expected stock price volatility and
the estimated life of each award. The fair value of equity- based awards is amortized over the
vesting period of the award and we have elected to use the straight-line method for awards granted
after the adoption of SFAS No. 123R and continue to use a graded vesting method for awards granted
prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R.

The Company makes quarterly assessments of the adequacy of its tax credit pool related to
equity-based compensation to determine if there are any deficiencies that require recognition in
its consolidated statements of operations. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the
Company will only recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in paid-in-capital if an
incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to the
Company have been utilized. In addition, the Company has elected to account for the indirect
benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit through the income statement
(continuing operations) rather than through paid-in-capital. The Company has also elected to net
deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits determined under Accounting
Principles Board No. 25 for income tax footnote disclosure purposes. The Company will track these
stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paid-in-capital
in accordance with Footnote 82 of SFAS No. 123R.

Income Taxes:

Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between
the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used
for income tax purposes. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax
assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of the Company’s net
deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. The Company believes it is more likely
than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively
impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the
event that the Company determines that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net
deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is
made. Likewise, if the Company later determines that it is more likely than not that the deferred
tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed.

The Company calculates its current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and
assumptions that can differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during
the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified.



The Company provides for income taxes on the basis of annual estimated effective income tax
rates. The Company’s estimated effective income tax rate reflects the underlying profitability of
the Company, the level of R&D spending, the regions where profits are recorded and the respective
tax rates imposed. The Company carefully monitors these factors and adjusts the effective income
tax rate, if necessary. If actual results differ from estimates, the Company could be required to
record an additional valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax
rate, which could have a material impact on its business, results of operations, and financial
condition.

The calculation of the Company’s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the
application of complex tax laws. The Company’s estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain
tax issue is highly judgmental. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with the
Company’s expectations could have a material impact on its results of operations and financial
condition.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation 48, “Accounting for Income Tax
Uncertainties” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return
positions in the financial statements as “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained by the taxing
authority. The recently issued literature also provides guidance on the derecognition, measurement
and classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and penalties. FIN
48 also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and
increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties. The
Company adopted FIN 48 in the first quarter of 2008. See Note 15: “Income Taxes” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements of this 2008 Form 10-K for further discussion.

The Company must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for
financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax
credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities,
which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and
financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax
positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to the
Company’s tax provision in a subsequent period.

The Company must assess the likelihood that it will be able to recover its deferred tax
assets. If recovery is not likely, the Company must increase its provision for taxes by recording a
valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that it estimates will not ultimately be
recoverable. The Company believes that it will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the
deferred tax assets recorded on its consolidated balance sheets. However, should there be a change
in the Company’s ability to recover its deferred tax assets, the Company’s tax provision would
increase in the period in which it determined that the recovery was not probable.

In addition, the calculation of the Company’s tax liabilities involves dealing with
uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. As a result of the implementation of
FIN 48, the Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step
process prescribed within the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for
recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely
than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or
litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit
as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. It
is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires the Company to
determine the probability of various possible outcomes. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax
positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to,
changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and
new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of
a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets”, (“SFAS No. 142”). SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and identifiable
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for
impairment at least annually. SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with estimable
useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual
values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”.

The Company reviews goodwill at least annually for impairment. Should certain events or
indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests, the Company performs the impairment
test of goodwill at that date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, the Company: (1)
allocates goodwill to its various reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2)
estimates the fair value of its reporting units; and (3) determines the carrying value (book value)
of those reporting units, as some of the assets and liabilities related to those reporting units
are not held by those reporting units but by corporate headquarters. Furthermore, if the estimated
fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company must estimate the fair
value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, in a manner similar to a
purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This can require independent valuations of
certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in-process research and
development and developed technology. Only after this process is completed can the amount of
goodwill impairment, if any, be determined.



The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires
significant judgment at many points during the analysis. In estimating the fair value of a
reporting unit for the purposes of the Company’s annual or periodic analyses, the Company makes estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of that reporting unit.
Although the Company’s cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with its
plans and estimates it is using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant exercise
of judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit over its
estimated remaining useful life. In addition, the Company makes certain judgments about allocating
shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of its reporting units. The Company also considers
the Company’s and its competitor’s market capitalization on the date it performs the analysis.
Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment
charge.

The value assigned to intangible assets is based on estimates and judgments regarding
expectations such as the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If actual
product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, the Company may be required to record
an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value.

Fiscal Year:

The Company follows a 52/53-week fiscal reporting calendar and its fiscal year
ends on the last Sunday of June each year. The Company’s most recent fiscal year ended on June 29,
2008 and included 53 weeks. The fiscal years ended June 24, 2007 and June 25, 2006 included 52
weeks. The Company’s next fiscal year, ending on June 28, 2009, will include 52 weeks.

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments:

All investments purchased with an original final
maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. All of the Company’s
short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale at the respective balance sheet dates.
The Company accounts for its investment portfolio at fair value. The investments classified as
available-for-sale are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices, and any material
temporary difference between the cost and fair value of an investment is presented as a separate
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss.) Unrealized losses are charged against
“Other income (expense)” when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than-temporary.
The Company considers several factors to determine whether a loss is other-than-temporary. These
factors include but are not limited to: (i) the extent to which the fair value is less than cost
basis, (ii) the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, (iii) the length of time
a security is in an unrealized loss position and (iv) the Company’s ability to hold the security
for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. The Company’s
ongoing consideration of these factors could result in additional impairment charges in the future,
which could adversely affect its results of operation. There was an impairment charge of
approximately $1 million recorded in fiscal year 2008. There were no impairment charges recorded
on the Company’s investment portfolio in fiscal years 2007 or 2006. The specific identification
method is used to determine the realized gains and losses on investments.

Property and Equipment:

Property and equipment is stated at cost. Equipment is depreciated by
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to eight
years. Buildings are depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, generally twenty five to thirty three years. Leasehold improvements are amortized by the
straight-line method over the shorter of the life of the related asset or the term of the
underlying lease. Amortization of capital leases is included with depreciation expense.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets(Excluding Goodwill)

: The Company routinely considers whether
indicators of impairment of long-lived assets are present. If such indicators are present, the
Company determines whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the
assets in question is less than their carrying value. If the sum is less, the Company recognizes an
impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair
values. Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. If
the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used, the Company recognizes an impairment
charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are
less than the asset’s carrying value. The fair value of the asset then becomes the asset’s new
carrying value, which the Company depreciates over the remaining estimated useful life of the
asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less
cost to sell.

Derivative Financial Instruments:

The Company carries derivative financial instruments
(derivatives) on the balance sheet at their fair values in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (SFAS
No. 133) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS No. 149”). The Company has a policy that
allows the use of derivative financial instruments, specifically foreign currency forward exchange
rate contracts, to hedge foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted revenue
transactions denominated in Japanese yen and other foreign currency denominated assets. The Company
does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

The Company’s policy is to attempt to minimize short-term business exposure to foreign
currency exchange rate risks using an effective and efficient method to eliminate or reduce such
exposures. In the normal course of business, the Company’s financial position is routinely
subjected to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. To protect
against the



reduction in value of forecasted Japanese yen-denominated revenues, the Company has instituted
a foreign currency cash flow hedging program. The Company enters into foreign currency forward
exchange rate contracts that generally expire within 12 months, and no later than 24 months. These
foreign currency forward exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are carried on
the Company’s balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts’ gains or
losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in
revenue in the same period the hedged revenue is recognized.

Each period, hedges are tested for effectiveness using regression testing. Changes in the fair
value of currency forwards due to changes in time value are excluded from the assessment of
effectiveness and are recognized in revenue in the current period. To qualify for hedge accounting,
the hedge relationship must meet criteria relating both to the derivative instrument and the hedged
item. These include identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the
risk being hedged and how the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to
changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows will be measured.

To receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at
the inception of the hedge and the hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future
cash flows on hedged transactions. When derivative instruments are designated and qualify as
effective cash flow hedges, the Company is able to defer changes in the fair value of the hedging
instrument within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged exposure is
realized. Consequently, with the exception of hedge ineffectiveness recognized, the Company’s
results of operations are not subject to fluctuation as a result of changes in the fair value of
the derivative instruments. If hedges are not highly effective or if the Company does not believe
that the underlying hedged forecasted transactions would occur, the Company may not be able to
account for its investments in derivative instruments as cash flow hedges. If this were to occur,
future changes in the fair values of the Company’s derivative instruments would be recognized in
earnings without the benefits of offsets or deferrals of changes in fair value arising from hedge
accounting treatment.

The Company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts to hedge the
gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of Japanese yen-denominated net receivable balances
against the U.S. dollar, U.S. dollar net receivable balances against the Euro, and Japanese net
receivable balances against the Euro. Under SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 149, these forward contracts
are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these
derivatives is recorded into earnings as a component of other income and expense and offsets the
change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade receivables,
recorded in other income and expense, assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and
trade receivable balances.

To hedge foreign currency risks, the Company uses foreign currency exchange forward contracts,
where possible and practical. These forward contracts are valued using standard valuation formulas
with assumptions about future foreign currency exchange rates derived from existing exchange rates
and interest rates observed in the market.

The Company considers its most current outlook in determining the level of foreign currency
denominated intercompany revenues to hedge as cash flow hedges. The Company combines these
forecasts with historical trends to establish the portion of its expected volume to be hedged. The
revenues are hedged and designated as cash flow hedges to protect the Company from exposures to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction
does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, the related hedge gains and losses
on the cash flow hedge are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to
interest and other income (expense) on the consolidated statement of operations at that time.

The Company does not believe that it is or was exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit
risk in its interest rate and foreign currency hedges, as counterparties are established and
well-capitalized financial institutions. The Company’s exposures are in liquid currencies (Japanese
yen and Euro), so there is minimal risk that appropriate derivatives to maintain the Company’s
hedging program would not be available in the future.

Guarantees:

The Company accounts for guarantees in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45,
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees
to Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and a rescission of FASB
Interpretation No. 34” (FIN No. 45). Accordingly, the Company evaluates its guarantees to determine
whether (a) the guarantee is specifically excluded from the scope of FIN No. 45, (b) the guarantee
is subject to FIN No. 45 disclosure requirements only, but not subject to the initial recognition
and measurement provisions, or (c) the guarantee is required to be recorded in the financial
statements at fair value. The Company has recorded a liability for certain guaranteed residual
values related to specific facility lease agreements. The Company has evaluated its remaining
guarantees and has concluded that they are either not within the scope of FIN No. 45 or do not
require recognition in the financial statements. These guarantees generally include certain
indemnifications to its lessors under operating lease agreements for environmental matters,
potential overdraft protection obligations to financial institutions related to one of the
Company’s subsidiaries, indemnifications to the Company’s customers for certain infringement of
third-party intellectual property rights by its products and services, and the Company’s warranty
obligations under sales of its products. Please see Note 14 for additional information on the
Company’s guarantees.



Foreign Currency Translation:

The Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate in a local
currency environment, where that local currency is the functional currency, primarily generate and
expend cash in their local currency. Billings and receipts for their labor and services are
primarily denominated in the local currency and the workforce is paid in local currency. Their
individual assets and liabilities are primarily denominated in the local foreign currency and do
not materially impact the Company’s cash flows. Accordingly, all balance sheet accounts of these
local functional currency subsidiaries are translated at the fiscal period-end exchange rate, and
income and expense accounts are translated using average rates in effect for the period, except for
costs related to those balance sheet items that are translated using historical exchange rates. The
resulting translation adjustments are recorded as cumulative translation adjustments, and are a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Translation adjustments are recorded in
other income (expense), net, where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency.

Reclassifications:

Certain amounts presented in the comparative financial statements for prior
years have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal year 2008 presentation.

Note 3: Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation Number 48, “Accounting for Income Tax
Uncertainties” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes, by prescribing a
minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the
financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognizing, measurement, classification,
interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company adopted FIN 48 as of
June 25, 2007. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, the Company decreased the recorded liability
for unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $26.2 million, and reclassed approximately $64.4
million from current to non-current income taxes payable. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48
resulted in an increase to the Company’s opening retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal
year 2008 of approximately $17.6 million.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair
Value Measurements,” (“SFAS No. 157”), which defines fair value, establishes guidelines for
measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does
not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found
in various prior accounting pronouncements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
No. 157-2 delaying the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis.
The Company will adopt the delayed portions of SFAS No. 157 during fiscal year 2010, while all
other portions of the standard will be adopted during fiscal year 2009, as required. SFAS No. 157
is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Earlier adoption is permitted,
provided the company has not yet issued financial statements, including interim periods, for that
fiscal year. The Company’s financial assets and liabilities impacted by SFAS No. 157 relate
primarily to derivatives, short-term investments and restricted investments balances. The Company
does not believe there will be any material impact on its financial position, results of operations
and liquidity as a result of adopting the provisions of SFAS No. 157.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, “The
Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 115” (“SFAS No. 159”). This statement permits entities to choose to measure many
financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be
measured at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to
facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar
types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first
fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007, provided the entity also elects to apply the
provisions of SFAS No. 157. The Company does not believe there will be any material impact on our
financial position, results of operations and liquidity as a result of adopting the provisions of
SFAS No. 159.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised
2007), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS No. 141R”). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements
for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets
acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill
acquired. SFAS No. 141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the
nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141R is effective as of the
beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2008. The Company expects to
adopt SFAS No. 141R in the beginning of fiscal year 2010 and is currently evaluating the potential
impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS No. 141R on its consolidated results of operations and
financial condition.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160,
“Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — An Amendment of ARB 51” (“SFAS
160”). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the treatment of noncontrolling
interests in a subsidiary. Noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary will be reported as a component
of equity in the consolidated financial statements and any retained noncontrolling equity
investment upon deconsolidation of a subsidiary is initially measured at fair value. SFAS 160 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 160 will result
in the reclassification of minority interests to stockholders’ equity. The Company is currently
assessing any further impacts of SFAS 160 on its results of operations and financial condition.



In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161,
“Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities — An Amendment of FASB Statement
133” (“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161 requires expanded and enhanced disclosure for derivative instruments,
including those used in hedging activities. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim
periods beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the
adoption of SFAS 161 on its consolidated financial statement disclosures.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
142-3, “Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets” (“FSP SFAS 142-3”). FSP SFAS 142-3
provides guidance with respect to estimating the useful lives of recognized intangible assets
acquired on or after the effective date and requires additional disclosure related to the renewal
or extension of the terms of recognized intangible assets. FSP SFAS 142-3 is effective for fiscal
years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company currently assessing the
impact of the adoption of FSP SFAS 142-3 on its results of operations and financial condition.

Note 4: Financial Instruments

The Company’s primary financial instruments include its cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments, restricted cash and investments, long-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts
payable, long-term debt and capital leases, and foreign currency related derivatives. The
estimated fair value of cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates their carrying
value due to the short period of time to their maturities. The estimated fair value of long-term
debt and capital lease obligations approximates its carrying value as the substantial majority of
these obligations have interest rates which adjust to market rates on a periodic basis. The fair
value of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and investments,
long-term investments, and foreign currency related derivatives are based on quotes from brokers
using market prices for similar instruments.

The Company accounts for its investment portfolio at fair value. Realized gains and (losses)
from investments sold were approximately $3.3 million and $(1.3) million in fiscal year 2008 and
approximately $0.5 million and $(1.3) million in fiscal year 2007, respectively. Realized gains and
(losses) for investments sold are specifically identified. Management assesses the fair value of
investments in debt securities that are not actively traded through consideration of interest rates
and their impact on the present value of the cash flows to be received from the investments. The
Company also considers whether changes in the credit ratings of the issuer could impact the
assessment of fair value.

The Company’s available-for-sale securities which are invested in taxable financial
instruments must have a minimum rating of A2 / A, as rated by two of the following three rating
agencies: Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s (S&P), or Fitch and available-for-sale securities which are
invested in tax-exempt financial instruments must have a minimum rating of A2 / A, as rated by any
one of the following three rating agencies: Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s (S&P), or Fitch.

Management has the ability and intent, if necessary, to liquidate any of its investments in
order to meet the Company’s liquidity needs in the next 12 months. Accordingly, those investments
with contractual maturities greater than one year from the date of purchase have been classified as
short-term on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Derivatives

The fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts is estimated based upon the
current market exchange rates at June 29, 2008 and June 24, 2007, respectively.

The Company also enters into foreign
currency forward exchange rate contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of Japanese
yen-denominated net receivable balances against the U.S. dollar, U.S. dollar net receivable balances against the Euro,
and Japanese yen-denominated net receivable balances against the Euro.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk
consist principally of cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and investments,
trade accounts receivable, and derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities.

Cash is placed on deposit in major financial institutions in various countries throughout the
world. Such deposits may be in excess of insured limits. Management believes that the financial
institutions that hold the Company’s cash are financially sound and, accordingly, minimal credit
risk exists with respect to these balances.

As noted above, the Company’s available-for-sale securities which are invested in taxable
financial instruments must have a minimum rating of A2 / A, as rated by two of the following three
rating agencies: Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s (S&P), or Fitch and available-for-sale securities which
are invested in tax-exempt financial instruments must have a minimum rating of A2 / A, as rated by
any one of the following three rating agencies: Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s (S&P), or Fitch and its
policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial
issuer.

The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of non performance by counterparties on
the foreign currency forward contracts that are used to mitigate the effect of exchange rate
changes. These counterparties are large international financial institutions and to date, no such
counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligations to the Company. The Company does not
anticipate nonperformance by these counterparties

As of June 29, 2008, one customer accounted for approximately 11% of accounts receivable. As
of June 24, 2007 two customers accounted for approximately 10% and 14% of accounts receivable.

Credit risk evaluations, including trade references, bank references and Dun & Bradstreet
ratings are performed on all new customers, and subsequent to credit application approval, the
Company monitors its customers’ financial statements and payment performance. In general, the
Company does not require collateral on sales.

Note 5: Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging

The Company carries derivative financial instruments (derivatives) on the balance sheet at
their fair values in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (SFAS No. 133) and Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities” (“SFAS No. 149”). The Company has a policy that allows the use of derivative
financial instruments, specifically



foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts, to hedge foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted revenue transactions denominated in
Japanese yen and other foreign currency denominated assets. The Company does not use derivatives
for trading or speculative purposes.

The Company’s policy is to attempt to minimize short-term business exposure to foreign
currency exchange rate risks using an effective and efficient method to eliminate or reduce such
exposures. In the normal course of business, the Company’s financial position is routinely
subjected to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. To protect
against the reduction in value of forecasted Japanese yen-denominated revenues, the Company has
instituted a foreign currency cash flow hedging program. The Company enters into foreign currency
forward exchange rate contracts that generally expire within 12 months, and no later than 24
months. These foreign currency forward exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and
are carried on the Company’s balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the
contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and
subsequently recognized in revenue in the same period the hedged revenue is recognized.

Each period, hedges are tested for effectiveness using regression testing. Changes in the fair
value of currency forwards due to changes in time value are excluded from the assessment of
effectiveness and are recognized in revenue in the current period. The change in forward time value
was not material for all periods. There were no gains or losses during the twelve months ended June
29, 2008 and June 24, 2007 associated with ineffectiveness or forecasted transactions that failed
to occur. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship must meet criteria relating both
to the derivative instrument and the hedged item. These include identification of the hedging
instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the hedging instrument’s
effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows
will be measured.

To receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at
the inception of the hedge and the hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future
cash flows on hedged transactions. When derivative instruments are designated and qualify as
effective cash flow hedges, the Company is able to defer changes in the fair value of the hedging
instrument within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged exposure is
realized. Consequently, with the exception of hedge ineffectiveness recognized, the Company’s
results of operations are not subject to fluctuation as a result of changes in the fair value of
the derivative instruments. If hedges are not highly effective or if the Company does not believe
that the underlying hedged forecasted transactions would occur, the Company may not be able to
account for its investments in derivative instruments as cash flow hedges. If this were to occur,
future changes in the fair values of the Company’s derivative instruments would be recognized in
earnings without the benefits of offsets or deferrals of changes in fair value arising from hedge
accounting treatment. At June 29, 2008, the Company expects to reclassify the entire amount
associated with the $5.9 million of gains as of June 29, 2008 accumulated in other comprehensive
income to earnings during the next 12 months due to the recognition in earnings of the hedged
forecasted transactions.

The Company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts to hedge the
gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of Japanese yen-denominated net receivable balances
against the U.S. dollar, U.S. dollar net receivable balances against the Euro, and Japanese
yen-denominated net receivable balances against the Euro. Under SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 149,
these forward contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in
fair value of these derivatives is recorded into earnings as a component of other income and
expense and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and
trade receivables, recorded in other income and expense, assuming the hedge contract fully covers
the intercompany and trade receivable balances.

Note 6: Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Shipments
to Japanese customers are classified as inventory and carried at cost until title transfers. The
acquisition of SEZ during the quarter ended March 30, 2008 resulted in $81 million in inventory on
the date of acquisition. Inventories consist of the following:

As a result of the determinations from the voluntary independent stock option review, the
Company considered the application of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(“IRC”) and similar provisions of state law to certain stock option grants where, under Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”, intrinsic value
existed at the time of grant. In the event such stock option grants are not considered as issued at
fair market value at the original grant date under the IRC and applicable regulations thereunder,
these options are subject to Section 409A. On March 30, 2008, the Board of Directors of the Company
authorized the Company to assume the tax liability of certain employees, including the Company’s
Chief Executive Officer and certain executive officers, with options subject to Section 409A. The
assumed 409A liability incurred as of March 30, 2008 totaled $50.2 million and is included in
accrued compensation in the table above. Of this amount, $43.8 million was recorded in operating
expenses consisting of $22.1 million attributable to research and development expenses and $21.7
million associated with selling, general and administrative expenses, and $6.4 million in cost of
goods sold in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The determinations from the
voluntary independent stock option review are more fully described in Note 3, “Restatement of
Consolidated Financial Statements” to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of the
Company’s 2007 Form 10-K.

Swiss franc associated with the acquisition of SEZ. The legal judgment of $15.8 million was
obtained in a lawsuit filed by the Company alleging breach of purchase order contracts by one of
its customers. The Supreme Court of California denied review of lower and appellate court judgments
in favor of the Company during the quarter ended September 24, 2006.

Note 10: Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed, using the
treasury stock method, as though all potential common shares that are dilutive were outstanding
during the period. The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators
of the basic and diluted computations for net income per share.

Note 12: Equity-Based Compensation Plans

The Company has adopted stock plans that provide for the grant to employees of equity-based
awards, including stock options and restricted stock units, of Lam Research Common Stock. In
addition, these plans permit the grant of nonstatutory equity-based awards to paid consultants and
outside directors. According to the plans, the equity-based award price is determined by the Board
of Directors or its designee, the plan administrator, but in no event will it be less than the fair
market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant. Equity-based awards granted under
the plans vest over a period determined by the Board of Directors or the plan administrator. The
Company also has an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) that allows employees to purchase its
Common Stock. A summary of stock plan transactions is as follows:

The Company awarded a total of 960,157 and 1,091,897 restricted stock units during fiscal
years 2008 and 2007, respectively. Certain of the unvested restricted stock units at June 29, 2008
contain Company-specific performance targets. As of June 29, 2008, 1,696,224 restricted stock units
remain subject to vesting requirements.

The 2007 Stock Incentive Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified equity-based awards to
eligible employees, consultants and advisors, and non-employee directors of the Company and its
subsidiaries. Additional shares are reserved for issuance pursuant to awards previously granted
under the Company’s 1997 Stock Incentive Plan and its 1999 Stock Option Plan. As of June 29, 2008
there were a total of 4,302,918 shares subject to options and restricted stock units issued and
outstanding under the Company’s Stock Plans. As of June 29, 2008, there were a total of 15,839,806
shares available for future issuance under the 1999 and 2007 Plans (the “Plans”) of which
13,139,227 are available from the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan.

The ESPP allows employees to designate a portion of their base compensation to be used to
purchase the Company’s Common Stock at a purchase price per share of the lower of 85% of the fair
market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the first or last day of the applicable purchase
period. Typically, each offering period lasts 12 months and comprises three interim purchase dates.
In fiscal year 2004, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the 1999 ESPP to (i) each
year automatically increase the number of shares available for issuance under the plan by a
specific amount on a one-for-one basis with shares of Common Stock that the Company will redeem in
public market and private purchases for such purpose and (ii) to authorize the Plan Administrator
(the “Compensation Committee of the Board”) to set a limit on the number of shares a plan
participant can purchase on any single plan exercise date. The automatic annual increase provides
that the number of shares in the plan reserve available for issuance shall be increased on the
first business day of each calendar year commencing with 2004, on a one-for-one basis with each
share of Common Stock that the Company redeems, in public-market or private purchases, and
designates for this purpose, by a number of shares equal to the lesser of (i) 2,000,000, (ii) one
and one-half percent (1.5%) of the number of shares of all classes of Common Stock of the Company
outstanding on the first business day of such calendar year, or (iii) a lesser number determined by
the Plan Administrator. During fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, the number of shares of Lam
Research Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 1999 ESPP increased by 1.9 million shares,
2.0 million shares, and 2.0 million shares, respectively, subject to repurchase of an equal number
of shares in public market or private purchases.

During fiscal year 2008, 235,901 shares of the Company’s Common Stock were sold to employees
under the 1999 ESPP. A total of 10,480,846 shares of the Company’s Common Stock have been issued
under the 1999 ESPP through June 24, 2007, at prices ranging from $4.11 to $46.25 per share. At
June 29, 2008, 6,384,303 shares were available for purchase under the 1999 ESPP.

The Company accounts for equity-based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123R), which the
Company adopted as of June 27, 2005 using the modified prospective method. The Company recognized
equity-based compensation expense of $42.5 million during fiscal year 2008, $35.6 million during
fiscal year 2007 and $24.0 million during fiscal year 2006. The income tax benefit recognized in
the consolidated statements of operations related to equity-based compensation expense was $7.0
million during fiscal year 2008, $5.8 million during fiscal year 2007, and $5.2 million during
fiscal year 2006. The estimated fair value of the Company’s stock-based awards, less expected
forfeitures, is amortized over the awards’ vesting period on a straight-line basis for awards
granted after the adoption of SFAS No. 123R and on a graded vesting basis for awards granted prior
to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R.

Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units

Stock Options

The Company did not grant any stock options during fiscal years 2007 and 2006. The fair value
of the Company’s stock options issued prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R was estimated using a
Black-Scholes option valuation model. This model requires the input of highly subjective
assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. Prior
to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company used historical volatility as a basis for calculating
expected volatility.

The year -end intrinsic value relating to stock options for fiscal years 2008 and 2007 is
presented below:

As
of June 29, 2008, there was less than $0.1 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
nonvested stock options granted and outstanding; that cost is expected to be recognized through
fiscal year 2009, with a weighted average remaining vesting period of
0.3 years. Cash received from
stock option exercises was $12.7 million, $42.5 million, and $179.4 million during fiscal years
2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

Restricted Stock Units

The fair value of the Company’s restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair
market value of the Company’s stock at the date of grant. As of
June 29, 2008, there was $49.4
million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock units
granted; that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining vesting period of
0.8 years.

ESPP

ESPP awards were valued using the Black-Scholes model. ESPP awards for offering periods
subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R were valued using the Black-Scholes model with expected
volatility calculated using implied volatility. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company
used historical volatility in deriving its expected volatility assumption. The Company determined,
for purposes of valuing ESPP awards, that implied volatility provides a more accurate reflection of
market conditions and is a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility.
During fiscal years 2008 and 2007 ESPP was valued assuming no expected dividends and the following
weighted-average assumptions:

As of June 29, 2008, there was $7.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to

Note 13: Profit Sharing and Benefit Plans

Profit sharing is awarded to certain employees based upon performance against specific
corporate financial and operating goals. Distributions to employees by the Company are based upon a
percentage of earned compensation, provided that a threshold level of the Company’s financial and
performance goals are met. In addition to profit sharing the Company has other bonus plans based on
achievement of profitability and other specific performance criteria. Charges to expense under
these plans were $93.1 million, $102.0 million, and $70.8 million during fiscal years 2008, 2007,
and 2006, respectively.

The Company maintains a 401(k)-retirement savings plan for its full-time employees in North
America. Commencing September 1, 2006, each participant in the plan may elect to contribute from 2%
to 75% of his or her annual salary to the plan, subject to statutory limitations. Prior to
September 1, 2006, the contribution range was from 2% to 20%. The Company makes matching employee
contributions in cash to the plan at the rate of 50% of the first 6% of salary contributed.
Employees participating in the 401(k)-retirement savings plan are 100% vested in the Company
matching contributions and investments are directed by participants. The Company made matching
contributions of approximately $5.0 million, $4.4 million, and $3.5 million in fiscal years 2008,
2007, and 2006, respectively.



Note 14: Commitments

The Company has certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of
which are recorded on its balance sheet and some of which are not. Obligations are recorded on the
Company’s balance sheet in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and
include its long-term debt which is outlined in the following table and discussed below. The
Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships and are presented as
operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below. The Company’s contractual cash
obligations and commitments relating to these agreements, and its guarantees are included in the
following table. The amounts in the table below exclude $109.5 million of liabilities under FIN 48
as the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement. See Note
15, “Income Taxes” of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Capital Leases

Capital leases reflect building lease obligations assumed from the Company’s acquisition of
SEZ. The amounts in the table below include the interest portion of payment obligations.

Long-Term Debt

Consolidated debt obligations increased as a result of the SEZ acquisition. Debt balances
related to the SEZ acquisition were $34.8 million. $4.6 million represents the current portion of
long-term debt and $30.2 million is classified as long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet.
The debt obligations consist of various bank loans and government grants supporting operating
needs.

On June 16, 2006, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, LRI, as borrower, entered into the
LRI Credit Agreement. In connection with the LRI Credit Agreement, the Company entered into the
Guarantee Agreement guaranteeing the obligations of LRI under the LRI Credit Agreement. The
outstanding balance on the loan was repaid in full and the Guarantee Agreement was also terminated
during the quarter ended March 30, 2008.

On March 3, 2008, the Company, as borrower, entered into the Credit Agreement with ABN AMRO
BANK N.V (the “Agent”), as administrative agent for the lenders party to the Credit Agreement, and
such lenders. Bullen Semiconductor Corporation entered into the Bullen Guarantee to guarantee the
obligations of the Company under the Credit Agreement. In connection with the Credit Agreement, the
Company and Bullen entered into the Collateral Documents including the Security Agreement, the
Bullen Security Agreement, the Pledge Agreement and other Collateral Documents to secure its
obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Collateral Documents encumber current and future
accounts receivables, inventory, equipment and related assets of the Company and Bullen, as well as
100% of the Company’s ownership interest in Bullen and 65% of the Company’s ownership interest in
Lam Research International BV, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In addition, any future
domestic subsidiaries of the Company will also enter into a similar guarantee and collateral
documents to encumber the foregoing type of assets.

Under the Credit Agreement, the Company borrowed $250 million in principal amount for general
corporate purposes. The loan under the Credit Agreement is a non-revolving term loan with the
following repayment terms: (a) $12.5 million of the principal amount due on each of (i) September
30, 2008, (ii) March 31, 2009 and (iii) September 30, 2009 and (b) the payment of the remaining
principal amount on March 6, 2010. The outstanding principal amount bears interest at LIBOR plus
0.75% per annum or, alternatively, at the Agent’s “prime rate.” The Company may prepay the loan
under the Credit Agreement in whole or in part at any time without penalty. The Credit Agreement
contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default, as
well as various negative covenants (including maximum leverage ratio, minimum liquidity and minimum
EBITDA).

As a condition to funding under the Credit Agreement, the outstanding balance ($250 million)
under the LRI Credit Agreement was repaid in full and the Guarantee Agreement was also terminated.
The Company’s obligations under the Guarantee Agreement were fully collateralized by cash and cash
equivalents.

The Company’s total long-term debt of $284.8 million as of June 29, 2008 includes the $250.0
million discussed above and $34.8 million from SEZ. The current portion of long-term debt was
$29.6 million as of June 29, 2008.

Operating Leases

The Company leases most of its administrative, R&D and manufacturing facilities, regional
sales/service offices and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases, which expire at
various dates through 2016. Certain of the Company’s facility leases for buildings located at its
Fremont, California headquarters and certain other facility leases provide the Company with an
option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of the
Company’s facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of
inflation.

The Company’s rental expense for the space occupied during fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006
aggregated approximately $11 million, $11 million, and $9 million, respectively. Included in the
Operating Leases Over 5 years section of the table below is $141.8 million in guaranteed residual
values for lease agreements relating to certain properties at the Company’s Fremont, California
campus and properties in Livermore, California.

On December 18, 2007, the Company entered into a series of two operating leases (the
“Livermore Leases”) regarding certain improved properties in Livermore, California. On December 21,
2007, the Company entered into a series of four amended and restated operating leases (the “New
Fremont Leases,” and collectively with the Livermore Leases, the “Operating Leases”) with regard to
certain improved properties at its headquarters in Fremont, California. Each of the Operating
Leases is an off-balance sheet arrangement. The Operating Leases (and associated documents for each
Operating Lease) were entered into by the Company and BNP Paribas Leasing Corporation (“BNPPLC”).

Each Livermore Lease facility has an approximately seven-year term (inclusive of an initial
construction period during which BNPPLC’s and the Company’s obligations will be governed by the
Construction Agreement entered into with regard to such Livermore Lease facility) ending on the
first business day in January, 2015. Each New Fremont Lease has an approximately seven-year term
ending on the first business day in January, 2015.

Under each Operating Lease, the Company may, at its discretion and with 30 days’ notice, elect
to purchase the property that is the subject of the Operating Lease for an amount approximating the
sum required to prepay the amount of BNPPLC’s investment in the property and any accrued but unpaid
rent. Any such amount may also include an additional make-whole amount for early redemption of the
outstanding investment, which will vary depending on prevailing interest rates at the time of
prepayment.

The Company will be required, pursuant to the terms of the Operating Leases and associated
documents, to maintain collateral in an aggregate of approximately $165.0 million (upon completion
of the Livermore construction) in separate interest-bearing accounts and/or eligible short-term
investments as security for its obligations under the Operating Leases. As of June 29, 2008, the
Company had $129.2 million recorded as restricted cash and short-term investments in its
consolidated balance sheet as collateral required under the lease agreements related to the amounts
currently outstanding on the facility.

Upon expiration of the term of an Operating Lease, the property subject to that Operating
Lease may be remarketed. The Company has guaranteed to BNPPLC that each property will have a
certain minimum residual value, as set forth in the applicable Operating Lease. The aggregate
guarantee made by the Company under the Operating Leases is no more than approximately $141.8
million (although, under certain default circumstances, the guarantee with regard to an Operating
Lease may be 100% of BNPPLC’s investment in the applicable property; in the aggregate, the amounts payable under such guarantees
will be no more than $165.0 million plus related indemnification or other obligations).



The lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that does
not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity (VIE) as defined by FASB Interpretation
No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” and is therefore not consolidated by the
Company.

The remaining operating lease balances primarily relate to non-cancelable facility-related
operating leases.

Purchase Obligations

Purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis
or over multi-year periods related to the Company’s outsourcing activities or other material
commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories. The Company continues to enter into new
agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain activities, including elements of
its manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance, certain information technology
functions, and certain transactional general and administrative functions. The contractual cash
obligations and commitments table presented above contains the Company’s minimum obligations at
June 29, 2008 under these arrangements and others. Actual expenditures will vary based on the
volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition to these
obligations, certain of these agreements include early termination provisions and/or cancellation
penalties which could increase or decrease amounts actually paid.

Consignment inventories, which are owned by vendors but located in the Company’s storage
locations and warehouses, are not reported as the Company’s inventory until title is transferred to
the Company or its purchase obligation is determined. At June 29, 2008, vendor-owned inventories
held at the Company’s locations and not reported as its inventory were $26.5 million.

Guarantees

The Company accounts for its guarantees in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees
of Indebtedness of Others” (“FIN 45”). FIN 45 requires a company that is a guarantor to make
specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. FIN 45 also
requires a company (the guarantor) to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for
the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee.

The Company has issued certain indemnifications to its lessors under some of its agreements.
The Company has entered into certain insurance contracts which may limit its exposure to such
indemnifications. As of June 29, 2008, the Company has not recorded any liability on its financial
statements in connection with these indemnifications, as it does not believe, based on information
available, that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees.

Please see the discussion above under “Operating Leases” regarding the guarantee on the
Company’s operating lease under the Livermore and Fremont facilities.

Generally, the Company indemnifies, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, its
customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by the Company’s products or
services. The Company seeks to limit its liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed
the sales price of the products or services subject to its indemnification obligations. The Company
does not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any material amounts
will be paid under these guarantees.

The Company offers standard warranties on its systems that run generally for a period of 12
months from system acceptance. The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending
activity by type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences
such as the impact of system reliability improvements.

Realization of the Company’s net deferred tax assets is based upon the weight of available
evidence, including such factors as the recent earnings history and expected future taxable income.
The Company believes it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized with an exception
of $3.4 million related to certain deferred tax assets acquired in the SEZ acquisition; however,
ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not
known or anticipated at this time. Subsequently recognized tax benefits associated with valuation
allowances recorded in SEZ acquisition will be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill.

Deferred tax assets relating to tax benefits of employee stock option grants have been reduced
to reflect the exercises in fiscal year 2008 and 2007. Some exercises resulted in tax deductions in
excess of previously recorded benefits based on the option value at the time of grant
(“windfalls”). Although these additional tax benefits are reflected in net operating loss
carryforwards, pursuant to SFAS 123(R), the additional tax benefit associated with the windfall is
not recognized until the tax benefits reduce cash taxes payable, at which time the Company will
credit equity.

At June 29, 2008, the Company had federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately
$82.6 million, of which approximately $22.7 million will expire in varying amounts between fiscal
years 2016 and 2028. The remaining balance of $59.9 million of tax carryforwards may be carried
forward indefinitely. The tax benefits relating to approximately $58.3 million of the tax credit
carryforwards will be credited to equity when recognized, in accordance with SFAS No. 123R.

At June 29, 2008, the Company had foreign net operating losses of approximately $92.6 million
of which $39.9 million will expire in fiscal year 2012. The remaining balance of $52.7 million of
tax carryforwards may be carried forward indefinitely.

As a result of an Advanced Pricing Agreement with certain foreign tax authorities, the Company
reduced its recorded future unrecognized tax benefits by $12.3 million in the fourth quarter of
fiscal year 2008.

Effective from fiscal year 2003 through June 2013, the Company has negotiated a tax holiday on
certain foreign earnings, which is conditional upon the Company meeting certain employment and
investment thresholds. The impact of the tax holiday decreased income taxes by approximately $18.9
million for fiscal year 2008, $48.4 million in fiscal year 2007, and $72.0 million in fiscal year
2006. The benefit of the tax holiday on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.15 in
fiscal year 2008, $0.34 in fiscal year 2007, and $0.50 in fiscal year 2006.

Unremitted earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries included in consolidated retained
earnings aggregated to approximately $1.07 billion at June 29, 2008. These earnings, which reflect
full provisions for foreign income taxes, are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. If
these earnings were remitted to the United States, they would be subject to U.S. taxes of
approximately $296 million at current statutory rates. The Company’s federal income tax provision
includes U.S. income taxes on certain foreign-based income.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation Number 48, “Accounting for Income Tax
Uncertainties” (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes, by prescribing a minimum
recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial
statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognizing, measurement, classification, interest
and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company adopted FIN 48 as of June 25, 2007. As
a result of the adoption of FIN 48, the Company decreased the recorded liability for unrecognized
tax benefits by approximately $26.2 million, and reclassed approximately $64.4 million from current
to non-current income taxes payable. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 resulted in an
increase to the Company’s opening retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 of
approximately $17.6 million.

The Company has historically classified unrecognized tax benefits in current taxes payable. As
a result of adoption of FIN 48, we reclassified unrecognized tax benefits to long-term income taxes
payable. Long-term income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions, reduced by the associated
federal deduction for state taxes and non-U.S. tax credits, and may also include other long-term
tax liabilities that are not uncertain but have not yet been paid. The Company’s policy to include
interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes on the
consolidated condensed statements of operations did not change as a result of implementing the
provisions of FIN 48.

The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:

During fiscal year 2008, the Company completed its unilateral advanced pricing agreement
(“APA”) with certain foreign tax authorities. As a result of the APA, the Company reduced its
balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $11.7 million, of which $8.1 million
relates to years prior to fiscal year 2008.

If the remaining balance of $143.8 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits at June 29, 2008
were realized in a future period, it would result in a tax benefit of $101.8 million and a
reduction of the effective tax rate. Approximately $11.3 million of gross unrecognized tax
benefits are related to the SEZ pre-acquisition period and would result in an adjustment to
goodwill of $0.5 million.

The Company recognizes potential accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as tax
expense. As of the adoption date of FIN 48, the Company had accrued approximately $5.8 million for
the payment of interest and penalties (net of tax benefit) relating to unrecognized tax benefits.
As of June 29, 2008, the Company had accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits of $9.3
million (net of tax benefit). During fiscal year 2008, interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits increased by $3.5 million, of which $1.2 million was recognized in the
provision for income taxes. The remaining balance of approximately $2.3 million related to the SEZ
acquisition and was recorded in goodwill.

The Company does not anticipate that the total unrecognized tax benefits will significantly
change due to the settlement of audits and the expiration of statute of limitations in the next 12
months.

The Company files U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign income tax returns. As of the
year-ended June 29, 2008, fiscal years 2000-2007 remain subject to examination in the U.S., and
fiscal years 2002-2007 remain subject to examination in various foreign jurisdictions.

Note 16: Acquisitions

SEZ

During fiscal year 2008, the Company acquired approximately 99% of the outstanding shares of
SEZ, a major supplier of single-wafer wet clean technology and products to the global semiconductor
manufacturing industry. The acquisition was an all-cash transaction. The Company expects to take
additional steps as necessary to acquire the SEZ shares that remain outstanding. The acquisition of
these shares was conducted pursuant to the terms of a Transaction Agreement entered into on
December 10, 2007 by and between the Company and SEZ. SEZ’s Spin-Process single-wafer technology
forms part of a broad equipment solution portfolio for wafer cleaning and decontamination, a key
process adjacent to etch.

The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, “Business Combinations” and all amounts were recorded at
their estimated fair value. The consolidated financial statements include the operating results of
SEZ from the acquisition date of March 11, 2008.

Company’s estimates and assumptions are subject to change.

The Company recorded a charge of $2.1 million during fiscal year 2008 for in process research
and development related to the acquisition of SEZ. This amount is included in operating expenses in
the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.

Unaudited pro forma financial information is presented below as if the acquisition of SEZ
occurred at the beginning of the fiscal periods presented below. The pro forma information

Bullen Ultrasonics

During the quarter ended December 24, 2006, the Company acquired the U.S. silicon growing and
silicon fabrication assets of Bullen Ultrasonics, Inc. The Company was the largest customer of the
Bullen Ultrasonics silicon business. The silicon business has become a division of the Company
post-acquisition.

The acquisition included assets related to Bullen Ultrasonics’ silicon growing and silicon
fabrication business, including assets of Bullen Ultrasonics and Bullen Semiconductor (Suzhou) Co.,
Ltd., a wholly foreign-owned enterprise established in Suzhou, Jiangsu, People’s Republic of China
(“PRC”). The closing of the U.S. asset acquisition occurred on November 13, 2006. The acquisition
of the Suzhou assets occurred during the quarter ending September 28, 2008. The assets acquired
consist of fixtures, intellectual property, equipment, inventory, material and supplies, contracts
relating to the conduct of the business, certain licenses and permits issued by government
authorities for use in connection with the operations of Eaton, Ohio and Suzhou manufacturing
facilities, real property and leaseholds connected with such facilities, data and records related
to the operation of the silicon growing and silicon fabrication business and certain proprietary
rights.

Pursuant to the First Amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement dated October 5, 2006, the
parties to the Asset Purchase Agreement agreed that the closing of the sale of the Suzhou assets
would take place within 5 business days following receipt by the parties of all necessary
approvals, consents and authorizations of governmental and provincial authorities in the PRC and
satisfaction of other customary conditions and covenants. The Company paid the $2.5 million
purchase price for the Suzhou assets upon the receipt of the approvals and satisfaction of
conditions noted above which occurred during the quarter ending September 28, 2008.

The acquisition supports the competitive position and capability primarily of the Company’s
dielectric etch products by providing access to and control of critical intellectual property and
manufacturing technology related to the production of silicon parts in the Company’s processing
chambers. The Company funded the purchase price of the acquisition with existing cash resources.

The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards Number 141, “Business Combinations” and all amounts were recorded at
their estimated fair value. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the operating
results from the date of acquisition. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented
because the effects of the acquisition were not material to the Company’s results.

Note 19: Restructuring and Asset Impairments

During the June 2008 quarter the Company incurred expenses for restructuring and asset
impairment charges related to the integration of SEZ and overall streamlining of the Company’s
combined clean product group (“June 2008 Plan”). These charges included severance and related
benefits costs, excess facilities-related costs and certain asset impairments associated with the
Company’s initial product line integration road maps.

Prior to the end of the June 2008 quarter, the Company initiated the announced restructuring
activities and management with the proper level of authority approved specific actions under the
June 2008 Plan. Severance packages to affected employees were communicated in enough detail such
that the employees could determine their type and amount of benefit. The termination of the
affected employees occurred as soon as practical after the restructuring plans were announced. The
amount of remaining future lease
payments for facilities the Company ceased to use and included in the restructuring charges is
based on management’s estimates using known prevailing real estate market conditions at that time
based, in part, on the opinions of independent real estate experts. Leasehold improvements relating
to the vacated buildings were written off, as these items will have no future economic benefit to
the Company and have been abandoned.



The Company distinguishes regular operating cost management activities from restructuring
activities. Accounting for restructuring activities requires an evaluation of formally committed
and approved plans. Restructuring activities have comparatively greater strategic significance and
materiality and may involve exit activities, whereas regular cost containment activities are more
tactical in nature and are rarely characterized by formal and integrated action plans or exiting a
particular product, facility, or service.

The Company recorded net restructuring charges and asset impairments during fiscal year 2008
of approximately $19.0 million, consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated
employees of $5.5 million, charges for the present value of remaining lease payments on vacated
facilities of $0.9 million, and the write-off of related fixed assets of $1.9 million. The Company
also recorded asset impairments related to initial product line integration road maps of $10.7
million. Of the total $19.0 million in charges, $12.6 million was recorded in cost of goods sold
and $6.4 million was recorded in operating expenses in the Company’s fiscal year 2008 consolidated
statement of operations.

Note 20: Legal Proceedings

From time to time, the Company has received notices from third parties alleging infringement
of such parties’ patent or other intellectual property rights by the Company’s products. In such
cases it is the Company’s policy to defend the claims, or if considered appropriate, negotiate
licenses on commercially reasonable terms. However, no assurance can be given that the Company will
be able in the future to negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all,
or that any litigation resulting from such claims would not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s consolidated financial position or operating results.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lam Research Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lam Research Corporation as of June
29, 2008 and June 24, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 29, 2008. Our audits
also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Lam Research Corporation at June 29, 2008 and June
24, 2007, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended June 29, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, under the heading Income
Taxes, Lam Research Corporation changed its method of accounting for income tax uncertainties in
fiscal year 2008.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), Lam Research Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of
June 29, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 27,
2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lam Research Corporation

We have audited Lam Research Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 29,
2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Lam Research
Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting,
management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting did not include the internal controls of SEZ, which is included in the June 29, 2008
consolidated financial statements of Lam Research Corporation and constituted approximately 27% of
consolidated total assets as of June 29, 2008 and 2% of revenues for the year then ended. Our
audit of internal control over financial reporting of Lam Research Corporation also did not include
an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of SEZ.

In our opinion, Lam Research Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of June 29, 2008, based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Lam Research Corporation as of June 29,
2008 and June 24, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 29, 2008 of Lam Research
Corporation and our report dated August 27, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
