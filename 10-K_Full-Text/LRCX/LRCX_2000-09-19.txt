ITEM 1. BUSINESS

We design,
manufacture, market and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the
fabrication of integrated circuits. We are recognized as a leading supplier of
front-end wafer processing equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry.
Our products are used to selectively remove portions of various films to create
an integrated circuit. Etch processes, which are repeated numerous times during
the fabrication cycle, are required to manufacture every type of semiconductor
device produced today. Chemical Mechanical Planarization ("CMP") is used to
planarize the surface of the processed wafer to prepare it for further
processing. CMP is currently the planarization technology of choice for
manufacturing sub-0.35 micron integrated circuits with multiple metal layers.
Post- CMP clean processes are used to remove residues left on the wafer after
CMP processing.

We sell a broad range of plasma ("dry") etch products to
address specific applications. Our Transformer Coupled Plasma ("TCP

Ò

") etchers utilize a high-density plasma process
to etch device features down to 0.18 micron and below. We also market both the
DSS-200

â

and Synergy

Ô

product lines of post-CMP cleaners, which are used
to remove residual slurries and other contaminants from wafer surfaces, both
after CMP polishing and before and after essential semiconductor process steps.
Our Teres

Ô

CMP polishing system leverages our
post-CMP cleaning expertise to provide fully integrated polishing and cleaning
solutions.

Products

Semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex
series of process steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many
individual integrated circuits. The five basic steps of semiconductor wafer
fabrication include photolithography, deposition, etch, CMP, and post-CMP clean.
Quality assurance tests are often conducted between each step. Our products are
currently used in three steps in the front-end of the wafer processing
manufacturing cycle: etch, CMP, and post-CMP clean. Several of our current etch
products are available as stand-alone systems or as clusters used on the
Alliance

â

multi-chamber cluster platform. We
also supply advanced control system software with all systems for production
management.

Etch Products

The etch process defines line-widths and other
microscopic features on integrated circuits. Plasma etching was developed to
meet the demand for device geometries smaller than three microns. Plasma
consists of ions and neutral species that react with exposed portions of the
wafer to produce the finely delineated features and patterns of the integrated
circuit. Today, manufacturers of advanced integrated circuits require etch
systems that create features of 0.25 micron and below (approximately 1/300 the
thickness of a human hair). In the near future, systems capable of producing
devices with feature sizes smaller than 0.13 micron will be needed. The trend
toward features less than 0.13 micron has also driven a transition from aluminum
to copper conductive lines for faster processing speeds. In addition to
continually shrinking feature sizes, advanced manufacturing facilities are now
producing integrated circuits on 200 mm (8 inch diameter) silicon wafers, but a
transition is in progress that will increase standard wafer diameters to 300 mm
(12 inches). To accommodate these decreasing line-widths and anticipated
increasing wafer diameters, manufacturers will increasingly require more precise
control over the etching process. Our family of etch systems incorporates plasma
technologies designed to meet both current and future needs.

Rainbow

Ô

.

The first
Rainbow etch single chamber system was introduced in 1987. The Rainbow series of
products addresses processes that utilize wafer sizes up to 200 mm and feature
line-width sizes as small as 0.18 micron in some cases. The Rainbow product
line, also available on the Alliance platform, includes the Rainbow 4400, 4500,
4600 and 4700 system series for etching of different films. These systems are
designed to accommodate certain hardware and process enhancements.

4520XLe

Ô

and

Exelan™

. The 4520XLe is a dual frequency oxide etch system that
offers an extended process window and capabilities for sub-0.18 micron
geometries. The Exelan is our latest oxide etch system offering which was
announced in July 1999, and is well suited for next-generation etch regimes
associated with copper damascene processes. It provides all the process
flexibility and advanced etch capabilities of our proven dual frequency systems
at a low cost of ownership.

TCP

Ò

.

Our TCP

product line of high-density, low-pressure etch systems, which was
introduced in late 1992, incorporates our patented Transformer Coupled Plasma
source technology, which has been proven to etch features as small as 0.08
micron geometries. We currently offer the TCP 9600SEII and TCP 9600PTX, for
metal etch applications, the TCP 9400SEII, TCP 9400PTX and the TCP 9400DFM, for
polysilicon, polycide and shallow trench isolation ("STI") etch applications,
and the TCP 9100PTX, for oxide etch applications. These systems are currently
used in the production of a broad range of advanced logic and memory devices,
while research and development ("R&D") has demonstrated their continued
application in advanced next-generation features and production, such as STI.
The TCP series operates at low pressures for improved pattern control and high
plasma density for higher etch rates. Our TCP systems are designed to offer
customers a reliable, low cost of ownership solution for their advanced
processing needs. The TCP systems are available as a standalone, single wafer
configuration or in conjunction with the Alliance multi-chamber cluster
platform.

CMP Product

Teres

ä

. We offer the Teres CMP integrated polishing
and cleaning system with Linear Planarization Technology™ ("LPT™"),
which uses a high-speed belt instead of the rotating table used in conventional
polishers. LPT offers a wider process window and more flexible polishing options
than conventional systems. We designed the Teres system to planarize patterned
films with higher removal rates and better uniformity and planarity than
conventional systems currently offer. The Teres is supplied with an integrated
Synergy post-CMP cleaning system (see discussion below) to provide dry in/dry
out production.

Post-CMP Wafer Cleaning Products

DSS-200®.

The
DSS-200 series II cleaning system has a number of features that distinguish it
from competitive cleaning methods. Double-sided scrubbing technology with
chemical cleaning simultaneously scrubs both sides of the wafer with proprietary
brushes top and bottom, while limiting contact that can contaminate the backside
of the wafer. For selected applications, brush cleaning systems provide
significant advantages over traditional batch wet bench cleaning and ultrasonic
cleaning systems, including improved cleaning efficiency, reduced chemical
usage, a smaller footprint and greater process flexibility. In addition, single
wafer processing minimizes the risks inherent in processing wafers in batches.

Synergy

ä

. Synergy products combine double-sided
scrubbing technology and Chemical Mechanical Cleaning ("CMC"™) technology
to perform mechanical cleaning and chemical cleaning simultaneously in a single-
step process. The applications for the Synergy family include oxide, STI,
tungsten and copper cleaning. In response to the worldwide demand for a dry
in/dry out CMP solution, we provide the Synergy Integra™, which
incorporates advanced cleaning technology with a platform that integrates the
polisher and cleaner. Integrated systems are the result of partnerships between
Lam and key polishing vendors.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

The market for semiconductor capital equipment is
characterized by rapid technological change. We believe that continued and
timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products is
necessary for us to maintain our competitive position. Accordingly, we devote a
significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to R&D programs
and seek to maintain close relationships with our customers to be responsive to
their product needs.

Our R&D expenses during fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998 were
approximately $176.9 million, $142.5 million and $206.5 million, respectively,
and represented 14.4%, 22.0% and 19.6% of total revenue, respectively. Current
significant projects are targeted at continued development of advanced
applications and enhancements to our existing products, including developing the
technology necessary to support smaller feature sizes, copper-based devices and
300 mm wafers. In addition, we maintain an in-house group of highly skilled
application engineers to develop and respond to customer process needs
worldwide, when a high level of technical expertise is required.

We expect to continue to make substantial investments in
R&D to meet our customers' product needs and maintain our competitive
position.

MARKETING, SALES AND SERVICE

Our marketing and sales efforts are focused on
building long-term relationships with our customers. These efforts are supported
by a team of product marketing managers, sales personnel, equipment engineers
and process engineers that work closely with individual customers to find
solutions to their process needs. After-sales support is an essential element of
our marketing and sales program. We maintain an ongoing support relationship
with our customers and have an extensive network of field service personnel in
place throughout the United States, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific. We believe
that our comprehensive support programs and close working relationships improve
our competitiveness.

We have more than 40 sales and support centers located
throughout the United States, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific, through which
direct sales personnel sell and service our products. We provide our customers a
comprehensive warranty package on all released products.

Export sales accounted for approximately 37%, 33% and 39% of
our net sales in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Export sales consist
of sales from our U.S. operating subsidiary to non-affiliated customers in non-
U.S. countries. During fiscal 1999 and 1998, we downsized our worldwide
operations and in fiscal 1998, we discontinued our manufacturing operations in
Korea. A significant portion of our sales and operations will be subject to
certain risks, including tariffs and other barriers, difficulties in staffing
and managing foreign subsidiary and branch operations, potentially adverse tax
consequences and the possibility of difficulty in accounts receivable
collection. There can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of
operations and cash flows. Reference is made to Note C of our Consolidated
Financial Statements, included in Item 8 herein, for further information
concerning export sales, which information is incorporated herein by this
reference.

CUSTOMERS

Our customers include certain of the world's leading
semiconductor manufacturers. Revenue from STMicroelectronics accounted for 15%
of total revenue in fiscal 2000. Revenue from Intel Corporation accounted for
12% of our total revenue in fiscal 1998. In fiscal 1999, no individual customer
accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue.

Our business depends upon the capital expenditures of
semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current and anticipated
market demand for integrated circuits and products utilizing integrated
circuits. During calendar year 1998, the semiconductor industry experienced a
slowdown resulting from depressed DRAM pricing and manufacturing over-capacity.
This caused semiconductor manufacturers to reduce their capital equipment
investments, and in certain cases customers either rescheduled or canceled
capital equipment purchases. Also, during calendar year 1998, the Asian
customers were faced with difficulties in their financial markets, which had an
adverse impact on the ability of those customers to purchase capital equipment.
Beginning in late fiscal 1999, there were indications of a recovery in the
semiconductor industry, this recovery is expected to extend through calendar
year 2000. On a global basis, semiconductor makers began adding new capacity to
address an increase in demand for semiconductors. In addition to new capacity,
the semiconductor industry accelerated a migration to new materials such as
copper and the new interconnect processes required to implement them.

BACKLOG

We schedule production of our systems based upon
order backlog and our customer commitments. Included in our backlog are orders
for which written authorizations have been accepted and shipment dates assigned.
Our policy on backlog is to make adjustments to reflect our customer push-outs
and deferrals of delivery dates, as well as cancellations, so that only those
orders for which equipment is scheduled to be shipped within 12 months are
reflected in our published backlog amounts. As of June 25, 2000 and June
30, 1999, our order backlog was approximately $551 million and $233 million,
respectively. All orders for our products are subject to cancellation by our
customers, in some cases with limited penalty. Because some orders are received
for systems to be shipped in the same quarter and because of possible customer
changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders, our backlog at any
particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding
period.

MANUFACTURING

Our manufacturing operations consist of assembling
and testing components and subassemblies that are then integrated into finished
systems. Once we have completed final testing of all electronic and
electromechanical subassemblies that make up one of our products, the completed
system is process tested with

defined

processes. The final assembly and testing of our
products are conducted in cleanroom environments where personnel are properly
attired to reduce particulate contamination. Prior to shipping a completed
system, customer representatives may perform acceptance tests at our facility.
After passing these acceptance tests, the system is vacuum-bagged in a cleanroom
environment and prepared for shipment.

During fiscal 1999, we entered into a five-year contract
manufacturing agreement with Yokogawa Electric Corporation ("Yokogawa"). Under
the terms of the agreement, Yokogawa assembles Transport Modules ("TMs") from
kits supplied by our Fremont manufacturing operations. Yokogawa integrates these
TMs with completed process modules provided by us, perfoms final test services
for the completed machines, and ships them to our customers in Japan.

EMPLOYEES

As of September 5,
2000, we had 3,708 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by
a trade union, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. Our management
considers employee relations to be good.

Each of our employees signed an
agreement to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, and
all key employees have stock or stock option arrangements with us that provide
for the vesting of their interests over several years.

COMPETITION

The semiconductor manufacturing equipment
industry is highly competitive. We face substantial competition throughout the
world. Our management believes that to remain viable we will require significant
financial resources to offer a broad range of products, to maintain customer
service and support centers worldwide and to invest in product and process
R&D. Certain of our existing and potential competitors have substantially
greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing,
marketing and customer service and support organizations. We expect our
competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current
products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with enhanced
price and performance characteristics. If our competitors enter into strategic
relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering etch, CMP or
post-CMP clean products similar to those we sell, our ability to sell our
products to those manufacturers could be adversely affected. No assurance can be
given that we will continue to compete successfully in the United States or
worldwide.

We face significant competitive factors in the equipment
market, including quality, repeatability, process capability and flexibility,
and overall cost of ownership, which may be affected by factors such as
reliability, software automation, throughput, customer support and system price.
Although we believe that we compete favorably with respect to many of these
factors, our ability to compete successfully in the marketplace will depend upon
our ability to introduce product enhancements and new products on a timely
basis. There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully
in the future. Our primary competitors in the etch equipment market are Applied
Materials, Inc. and Tokyo Electron Limited ("TEL"). Our Teres CMP polishing
system faces significant competition from several competitors. Among the
companies currently offering polishing systems are Applied Materials, Inc.,
Ebara Corp. and SpeedFam-IPEC, Inc. 	In CMP slurry removal and cleaning
applications, our competitors include DaiNippon Screen Manufacturing Co. Ltd.
and VERTEQ Inc.

PATENTS AND LICENSES

We have a policy of seeking patents on
inventions relating to new products and processes developed as part of our
ongoing research, engineering and manufacturing activities. We hold United
States patents and corresponding foreign patents covering various aspects of our
products and process. We believe that the duration of our patents generally
exceeds the life cycles of the technologies and processes disclosed and claimed
therein. Our patents, which cover material aspects of our current core products,
have current durations ranging from approximately eight to fifteen years. We
believe that although the patents we own and may obtain in the future will be of
value, they will not alone determine our success, which depends principally upon
our engineering, marketing, service and manufacturing skills. However, in the
absence of patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to
imitate our products, manufacturing techniques and processes. In addition, other
companies and inventors may receive patents that contain claims applicable or
similar to our products and processes. The sale of products covered by patents
of others could require licenses that may not be available on acceptable terms,
or at all.

From time to time, we have received notices from third
parties alleging infringement of such parties' patent or other intellectual
property rights by our products. In such cases, it is our policy to defend the
claims or negotiate licenses on commercially reasonable terms, where considered
appropriate. However, no assurance can be given that we will be able in the
future to negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at
all, or that any litigation resulting from such claims would not have a material
adverse effect on our business and financial results. For further discussion of
legal matters see Item 3 "Legal Proceedings" on page 10 of this Form 10-K.

OTHER CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS

See the discussion of our risks in the section of
this report entitled Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations".

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Our executive offices and principal manufacturing
and R&D facilities are located in Fremont, California, and are under leases
expiring from 2001 to 2014. As a result of the restructurings of our operations,
we have subleased some of our idle facilities.

In addition, we lease office space for our service and sales
personnel throughout the United States, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific. We have
subleased certain of those facilities as part of our restructurings and
consolidation.

Our fiscal 2000 rental payments for the facilities occupied
as of June 25, 2000, aggregated approximately $19.3 million and are subject to
periodic increases. We believe that our existing facilities are well maintained
and in good operating condition.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In October 1993, Varian Associates, Inc. ("Varian")
brought suit against us in the United States District Court, for the Northern
District of California, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based on
our alleged infringement of certain patents held by Varian. By order of the
Court, those proceedings were bifurcated into an initial phase to determine the
validity of the Varian patents and our infringement (if any), and a secondary
phase to determine damages to Varian (if any) and whether our infringement (if
shown) was willful. On April 13, 1999, the Court issued an interlocutory order
construing the meaning of the terms of the patent claims at issue in the action.
In September 1999, a hearing was held on a summary judgment motion which might
dispose of a number of Varian's claims, but the Court has not yet issued a final
ruling on that motion. Accordingly, to date, there has been no determination as
to the actual scope of those claims, or whether our products have infringed or
are infringing Varian's patents. A trial date previously

scheduled for March 2000 was vacated, pending the court's decision of
certain motions. There have been no findings in the action, which have caused us
reasonably to believe that any infringement, if found, or any damages, if
awarded, would have a material adverse effect on our operating results or our
financial position.

In September 1999, Tegal Corporation ("Tegal") brought suit
against us in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Virginia, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based on our alleged
infringement of certain patents held by Tegal. Specifically, Tegal identified
our 4520XLe and Exelan products as infringing the patents Tegal is asserting. On
our motion, this case was transferred to California and is now pending in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of California. To date,
however, there has been no determination as to the actual scope of those claims,
or whether our products have infringed or are infringing Tegal's patents. No
trial date is currently scheduled in the action. Furthermore, there have been no
findings in the action, which have caused us reasonably to believe that any
infringement, if found, or any damages, if awarded, could have a material
adverse effect on our operating results or our financial position.

From time to time, we
have received notices from third parties alleging infringement of such parties'
patent or other intellectual property rights by our products. In such cases, it
is our policy to defend the claims or negotiate licenses on commercially
reasonable terms, where considered appropriate. However, no assurance can be
given that we will be able in the future to negotiate necessary licenses on
commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any litigation resulting from
such claims would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial position or operating results.

Stock and Dividend Information:

Our Common Stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under
the symbol LRCX. The price range per share is the highest and lowest bid prices,
as reported by the National Association of Security Dealers, Inc., on any
trading day during the respective quarter.

As of June 25, 2000, we had 574 stockholders of record.

No cash dividends have been declared, or are anticipated to
be paid by us, as all available funds are intended to be employed in the
operation of the business. Additionally, certain of our bank agreements restrict
the payment of dividends.

On March 6, 2000, we held a special stockholder' meeting. At
the meeting, our stockholders approved an increase in the number of authorized
shares of Common Stock from 90 million to 400 million shares and approved a
three-for-one stock split of our outstanding shares of Common Stock to
stockholders of record as of March 7, 2000. Stockholders' approval of the
amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation satisfies the condition for the
previously announced three-for-one stock split approved by our Board of
Directors on January 21, 2000. All prior period shares and per share amounts
have been restated to reflect the three-for-one split.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

See the discussion of our "Cautionary Statements
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" in Part I of this report.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Fiscal 2000 vs. 1999

Total Revenue

Our total revenue for the fiscal year ended June 25,
2000 was $1.2 billion, 90% higher than prior fiscal year revenue of $648
million. We experienced increased revenue for all of our product lines. Our
increased revenue in Alliance multi-chamber cluster system, which utilizes from
one to four chambers each, was the most significant contributor to our higher
total revenue.

During calendar 1998, the global semiconductor industry
experienced a slowdown driven by depressed DRAM pricing, production over
capacity, as well as uncertainty in the worldwide financial markets. This
brought on a slowdown in equipment demand, which unfavorably impacted our sales
for the first nine months of fiscal 1999. In the last quarter of fiscal 1999,
the global semiconductor equipment industry began to recover, which lead to our
increased sales and profitability. We now are experiencing greater demand for
our systems as our customers continue to add capacity in their most advanced
lines, migrate to new lines, smaller geometries and new materials such as
copper.

Regional geographic breakdown of revenue is as follows:

Year ended
                                    -----------------
                                    June 25, June 30,
                                      2000     1999
                                    -------- --------
North America......................      29%      46%
Europe.............................      28%      21%
Asia Pacific.......................      31%      25%
Japan..............................      12%       8%

Gross Margin

Our gross margin percentage increased to 44.0%
(excluding restructuring charge/recoveries of $2.2 million) for fiscal 2000,
compared to 36.0% for fiscal 1999. During fiscal 2000, our gross margin
percentage was favorably impacted by higher sales volume, the efficiencies of
"lean" manufacturing techniques, and continued material cost reductions compared
to fiscal 1999.

Research and Development

R&D expenses for the fiscal year
ended June 25, 2000, were $176.9 million, 24.1% higher than the prior fiscal
year. However, as a percentage of revenue, R&D expenses were 14.4% of total
revenue for the current fiscal year, compared to 22.0% of total revenue for the
prior fiscal year. The decrease in R&D expenses as a percent of revenue is
mainly due to the significant increase in revenue in fiscal 2000. The increase
in R&D expenses in absolute dollars was a result of our continued
investments in advanced etch and CMP applications and enhancements to our
existing products, including developing the technology necessary to support
smaller feature size, copper based devices and 300 mm wafers. We believe that in
order to remain competitive, we must continue to invest substantially in
R&D.

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A")
expenses were 13.1% of total revenue in fiscal 2000, as compared to 22.5% of
total revenue in fiscal 1999, but increased in absolute dollars from $145.7
million in fiscal 1999 to $161.3 million in fiscal 2000. SG&A expenses
decreased as a percent of revenue mainly due to the significant increase in
revenue in fiscal 2000.

The increase in SG&A expenses was largely a result of
higher sales and marketing expenses related to higher sales volume and an
overall increase in headcount. In addition, incentive payments to employees and
management in fiscal 2000 were significantly larger than those paid in fiscal
1999.

Change in Functional Currency

In fiscal 2000 we determined that the functional
currency of our European and Asia Pacific foreign subsidiaries was no longer the
U.S. dollar but the individual subsidiary's local currency. The following are
the reasons for our change in functional currency: our European and Asia Pacific
foreign subsidiaries primarily generate and expend cash in their local currency;
their labor and services are primarily in local currency (workforce is paid in
local currency); their individual assets and liabilities are primarily
denominated in the local foreign currency and do not materially impact our cash
flows and there is an active local sales market for the foreign subsidiaries'
products and services. The European and Asia Pacific foreign subsidiaries are
currently less dependent on the U.S. corporate office with their daily
operations. In addition, the European community adopted a new Single European
Currency, the Euro, which required implementation of that currency as of January
1, 1999 and transition through January 1, 2002. Upon implementation of the
functional currency to the individual subsidiaries' local currency as of July 1,
1999, all balance sheet accounts are translated at the current exchange rate,
and income statement accounts are translated at an average rate for the period.
The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as currency translation
adjustments, which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss). Previously, some balance sheet accounts were translated at a historic
rate and translation adjustments were made directly to the statement of
operations. The impact of the change in functional currency was not material to
our Company's financial statements.

Changes in Accounting Policy

FAS 133.

In June 1998, the FASB released Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("FAS 133"). FAS 133 establishes accounting
and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts, and for derivatives used for hedging
activities. It requires that all derivatives be recognized either as an asset or
liability, and measures them at fair value. FAS 133 is effective for all fiscal
quarters for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000, and will be adopted by
us in fiscal year 2001. We believe that the application of FAS 133 will not have
a material impact on our consolidated financial position or overall trends in
results of operations.

SAB 101.

In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 101 "Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements." SAB 101 provides guidance on the
recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements of
all public registrants. Currently we generally recognize revenue on products
upon shipment to our customers. The adoption of SAB 101 may require that some or
all of that revenue not be recognized until the product is actually accepted by
the customers, an event, which generally does not happen until sometime after
shipment has occurred. Compliance with SAB 101 therefore might delay our
recognition of revenue, compared to our current practice, for one or more
quarters, causing an adverse impact on our reported results during the quarters
in which product has been shipped, but not yet accepted by the customer. The SEC
has delayed the required implementation date of SAB 101, which for us, will be
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. In addition, the SEC has indicated that
implementation guidance will be forthcoming in the form of "Frequently Asked
Questions", however, such guidance has not been issued to date. Although we
cannot fully assess the impact of SAB 101 until the additional guidance from the
SEC is issued, we are still in the process of assessing the impact of SAB 101 on
our consolidated results of operations based upon the most current information.

FIN 44

. In March 2000, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 44 ("FIN 44"), "Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving
Stock Compensation -- an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25". FIN 44 clarifies
the application of APB Opinion No. 25 and, among other issues, clarifies the
following: the definition of an employee for purposes of applying APB Opinion
No.25; the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a
noncompensatory plan; the accounting consequence of various modifications to the
terms of the previously fixed stock options or awards; and the accounting for an
exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination. FIN 44 is
effective July 1, 2000. We believe that the application of FIN 44 will not have
a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of
operations

Restructuring Charges

During our first fiscal 1997 quarter ended
September 30, 1996, we projected and announced that revenues would be lower than
previous quarters due to a projected 20% general market decline. Our revenues
during that quarter fell to $299.2 million, a decrease of 24% from the prior
quarter. We assessed that market conditions would remain depressed and,
therefore, that our revenues would continue to be adversely affected.
Accordingly, and as announced on August 26, 1996, we organizationally
restructured our business units into a more centralized structure and cut our
workforce by approximately 11%.

Our quarterly revenue would
eventually decline to $233.3 million in the March 1997 quarter, 40% lower than
the peak reached in the quarter ended June 1996. Subsequently, in the latter
part of calendar 1997, the industry rebounded quickly and entered into what
eventually became a short-lived upturn cycle. During the June 1997 quarter, our
revenues grew back to $282.6 million and reached $292.1 million by the December
1997 quarter. However, our outlook in late January 1998 was that the industry
was again entering into a steep downturn brought on by depressed DRAM pricing
and the Asia financial crisis. We therefore announced a further set of
restructuring activities in a news release on February 12, 1998. At that time,
our assessment related to industry conditions was that our revenues for the
March and June 1998 quarters would decline by approximately 20%. Our
restructuring plans aligned our cost structure to this level of revenues by
exiting part of our Chemical Vapor Deposition ("CVD") business and all of our
Flat Panel Display ("FPD") business, consolidating our manufacturing facilities
and substantially reducing our remaining infrastructure and workforce. Our
actual June 1998 revenues were in line with those expectations; however, by the
mid-June 1998 time-frame the industry conditions further deteriorated and the
outlook for future quarters significantly worsened. We projected revenues to
drop to a run rate of approximately $180 million per quarter and determined we
needed once more to reduce our cost structure in line with the projected
reductions in revenue. Accordingly, another separate restructuring plan was
developed and announced in June 1998 and we exited the remainder of our CVD
operations. As a result of the restructurings in fiscal 1998, we reduced our
global workforce by approximately 28%.

Our revenue outlook in June
1998 was based on our projection that the worldwide wafer fabrication industry
would deteriorate from a quarterly revenue amount of $4.2 billion to $3.2
billion, or a 25% decline. The semiconductor equipment market contracted beyond
what was anticipated, to quarterly revenues of $2.6 billion as reported by
Dataquest, an independent industry analysis firm. Our shortfall of revenues
during the September 1998 quarter declined in line with the industry as a whole,
and resulted in lower than anticipated revenues, falling to $142.2 million. At
that point in time, we projected that our quarterly revenues would remain closer
to the $140-$150 million level for at least the next several quarters. This
necessitated another restructuring plan and further cost reductions via employee
terminations, facilities consolidation and a contraction of operating
activities, all of which resulted in the additional write-off of plant-related
assets. This plan was announced and publicly communicated on November 12, 1998.
As a result of the fiscal 1999 restructuring, we further reduced our global
workforce by approximately 15%.

Beginning in late fiscal 1999, there were indications of a
recovery in the semiconductor industry. On a global basis, semiconductor makers
began adding new capacity to address an increase in the demand for
semiconductors. In addition to new capacity, the semiconductor industry
accelerated a migration to new materials such as copper and the new interconnect
processes required to implement them. In early calendar year 2000, we concluded
that the upturn would be sustainable and that it was likely to continue through
the end of the calendar year.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2000 we completed certain
elements of our restructuring activities in accordance with our previously
established and announced plans. As a result of the stronger than anticipated
recovery of the semiconductor capital equipment market, we were able to recover
approximately $18.9 million of the restructuring charges recorded in prior
periods. Of this amount, $1.4 million was recovered due to outplacement services
guaranteed by us for terminated employees and other exit costs not being
utilized. Another $5.6 million was recovered because we were able to reoccupy or
successfully sublease certain manufacturing and administrative facilities under
long term operating leases. We also recovered $3.1 million through the sale of
our previously abandoned and written off facility in Korea. Additionally, we
will utilize leasehold improvements of $5.5 million in certain manufacturing and
administration facilities under operating leases which have been reoccupied as a
result of the stronger than anticipated rebound in business. Approximately $0.8
million was recovered from the salvage of CVD inventories previously segregated
and written off due to requests from former customers to purchase certain piece
parts. The remaining $2.5 million was recovered due to certain customers not
utilizing system return credits they requested and which were issued as a result
of the decision to exit the CVD and FPD businesses.

As a result of the continued growth of the semiconductor
capital equipment market, we recovered an additional $17.0 million of
restructuring charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 at which time we
completed the remaining elements of our restructuring plan. Of this amount, $9.5
million was recovered due to lower severance and termination costs than we had
planned for certain employees and executives. Another $3.9 million was recovered
from successful subleasing or occupancy of certain manufacturing and
administrative facilities due to the aforementioned faster and more robust than
anticipated industry recovery. We also recovered approximately $1.4 million from
the sale of more CVD and FPD inventory. Another $1.9 million was recovered as a
result of customers not utilizing system return credits they had originally
requested. Additionally, we will utilize leasehold improvements of $0.3 million
in certain manufacturing and administration facilities under operating leases
which have been reoccupied as a result of the stronger than anticipated rebound
in business.

Severance and Benefits relates to the salary and fringe
benefit expense for involuntarily terminated employees representing
approximately 15% of the global workforce. Prior to the date of the financial
statements, management, with the proper level of authority, approved and
committed us to a plan of termination and determined the benefits the employees
being terminated would receive. Prior to the financial statement date, the
expected termination benefits were communicated to employees in enough detail
that they could determine their type and amount of benefit. The termination of
employees occurred shortly after the plan of restructuring was finalized.

Lease Payments on Vacated Facilities
relates to 24 months of rent and common area maintenance expense for the vacated
facilities. We also estimated given the then-current real estate market
conditions, that it would take approximately 24 months to sub-lease our vacated
facilities in Fremont, California.

We wrote-off all leasehold
improvements used in the excess facilities, computer equipment, furniture and
fixtures related to the involuntarily terminated employees, and other assets
deemed to have no future use as a result of the restructuring.

Credits on Returned Equipment relate to the charge
associated with the requirement by certain of our customers to return their
previously purchased CVD systems and spare parts. The majority of the Credit on
Return Equipment reserve balance of $1.7 million as of June 25, 2000 will be
utilized by the end of the current calendar year 2000.

Severance and Benefits relates
to the salary and fringe benefit expense of the involuntarily terminated
employees of the CVD and FPD operations which were exited, the shutdown of the
Wilmington, Massachusetts manufacturing facility, and the employees impacted by
the overall across the board reduction of the employee base. Prior to the date
of the financial statements, management, with the proper level of authority,
approved and committed us to a plan of termination and determined the benefits
the employees being terminated would receive. Prior to the financial statement
date, the expected termination benefits were communicated to employees in enough
detail that they could determine their type and amount of benefit. The 1998
restructuring plans resulted in our reducing our global workforce by
approximately 28%. The termination of employees occurred shortly after the plan
of restructuring was finalized.

The Severance and Benefits
reserve balance of $1.9 million as of June 25, 2000 will be utilized to make
scheduled cash payments through the remainder of those former employees'
separation contracts.

Lease Payments on Vacated Facilities, which were included
in the restructuring charge relates to remaining rent and common area
maintenance on the closed Wilmington, Massachusetts manufacturing facility. We
also estimated, given the then-current real estate market conditions, that it
would take approximately 24 months to sub-lease our excess facilities in
Fremont, California. Therefore, we included 24 months of rent and common area
maintenance expense related to excess facilities in our restructuring charge.
Subsequently, we

have subleased our excess facilities, and the remainder
represents fixed commitments that will be utilized.

We wrote-off all fixed assets relating to the operations
which were exited, leasehold improvements for the excess facilities, computer
equipment, furniture and fixtures related to the involuntarily terminated
employees and other assets deemed to have no future use as a result of the
restructuring.

The inventory write-off, which
was included in the restructuring charge, related to inventory from the
operations which were exited. The inventory write-off included raw materials on
hand and inventory scheduled to be purchased under non-cancelable commitments
from suppliers, spare parts, work-in-process and finished goods related to the
products from the exited operations.

Credits on Returned Equipment
relates to the charge associated with the requirement by certain of our
customers to return their previously purchased CVD systems and spare parts.
During fiscal 1999, we recorded an adjustment to the restructuring reserve of
$1.5 million for the sale of a previously written-off machine. The remainder of
the reserve was reversed during fiscal 2000.

Other Exit Costs relates to
the net book value of licensing and manufacturing agreements related to the
restructured operations which, as a direct result of the restructuring plan has
no future economic benefit to us.

Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the fiscal
1997 restructuring:

Severance and Benefits relates to the salary and fringe
benefit expense for the involuntarily terminated employees, which represented
approximately 11% of the global workforce. Prior to the date of the financial
statements, management, with the proper level of authority, approved and
committed the Company to a plan of termination and determined the benefits the
employees being terminated would receive. Prior to the financial statement date,
the expected termination benefits were communicated to employees in enough
detail that they could determine their type and amount of benefit. The actual
termination of employees occurred shortly after the plan of restructuring was
finalized. During fiscal 1998, the Company revised its estimate relating to
severance and benefits and transferred the excess balance of remaining lease
payments on vacated facilities of $1.1 million to severance and benefits.

The Severance and Benefits reserve balance of $0.4
million as of June 25, 2000 will be utilized to make scheduled periodic cash
payments through the remainder of those former employees' separation
contracts.

Lease Payments on Vacated
Facilities relate to rent and common area maintenance expense for the vacated
facilities.

We wrote-off all leasehold
improvements used in vacated facilities, computer equipment, furniture and
fixtures related to the involuntarily terminated employees, and other assets
deemed to have no future use as a result of the restructuring.

Purchased Technology for Research & Development

During the second quarter of fiscal 2000, we
purchased intellectual property rights related to the semiconductor equipment
industry from Oliver Design, Inc ("Oliver"). We recognized an expense for the
purchase of research development technology of approximately $7.5 million and
capitalized $1.5 million related to acquired patents, which will be amortized
ratably over its estimated useful life of five years. The technology is being
used in a single discrete next generation post-CMP wafer cleaning product
development project and has no future alternative use. We may make up to $2.0
million in additional license payments to Oliver based on product sales in the
event we are successful in the commercialization of this technology.

Other Income, net

Other income, net, of $7.0 million in
fiscal 2000 increased from $0.3 million in fiscal 1999, due largely to greater
foreign exchange currency gains on Japanese yen denominated receivables in the
current fiscal year. Another contributor to our higher other income was the
increase in interest income as a result of a larger investment portfolio and a
higher rate of return on our investments than during the previous fiscal year,
consistent with the higher interest rates prevailing in the U.S. market.

Tax Expenses

For fiscal year 2000, we recorded an income tax
expense of $32.1 million, which was 13.5% of income before taxes. This rate
reflects the benefit of net operating losses and research and development tax
credits carried over from prior periods. We expect to increase our effective
income tax rate to approximately 30% in fiscal 2001, based on our current
revenue and profit outlook for that period. For fiscal year 1999, we did not
record an income tax benefit on the loss before income taxes. No net tax benefit
was recorded in fiscal 1999 because it was offset by a valuation allowance. At
June 25, 2000, we had gross deferred tax assets arising from non-deductible
temporary differences and tax loss and tax credit carryforwards of $202.5
million. The gross deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance of
$94.7 million and deferred tax liabilities of $19.0 million. Realization of the
majority of the net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate
future taxable income. We believe that it is more likely than not that the
assets will be realized based on forecasted income. However, there can be no
assurance that we will meet our expectations of future income. We will evaluate
the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assess the need for
additional valuation allowance.

Transition to Single European Currency

During fiscal 1999, we established a team to
address issues raised by the introduction of the Single European Currency
("Euro") for initial implementation as of January 1, 1999, and through the
transition period to January 1, 2002. We met all related legal requirements by
January 1, 1999, and we expect to meet all legal requirements through the
transition period. We do not expect the cost of any related system modifications
to be material and do not currently expect that the introduction and use of the
Euro will materially affect our foreign exchange and hedging activities, or will
result in any material increase in transaction costs. We will continue to
evaluate the impact over time of the introduction of the Euro; however, based on
currently available information, our management does not believe that the
introduction of the Euro has or will have a material adverse impact on our
financial condition or results of our operations.

Year 2000 Issues

To date, we have not experienced any
material Year 2000 related issues, and we expect minimal future Year 2000 issues
based on the performance to date of internal systems that we use and the
products we supply to our customers.

Fiscal 1999 vs. 1998

Total Revenue

Total revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1999
was 38% lower compared to the prior fiscal year. During calendar 1998, the
semiconductor equipment market experienced a downturn brought on in large part
by depressed DRAM pricing, production over capacity and the difficulties in the
Asian financial markets. During the second half of fiscal 1999, the
semiconductor equipment industry began to show signs of slow and moderate
recovery. Our quarterly revenue also began to increase during the second half of
fiscal 1999; however, the fiscal 1999 revenue for each quarterly period was
still lower than the quarterly revenue achieved during each quarter of fiscal
1998. Sales for all of our products decreased when compared to the prior year.
Our single-chamber etch products experienced the greatest decrease. Our products
sales continued to shift from the single-chamber etch to the multi-chamber
cluster products. The decrease in the sale of single-chamber etch systems
represented approximately 62% of the total decrease in total revenue.

Gross Margin

Our gross margin percentage increased slightly to
36.0% for fiscal 1999, compared to 35.5% for fiscal 1998. During fiscal 1998, we
incurred a charge of $31.9 million to write-off inventory related to the exited
CVD and FPD operations. However, our fiscal 1999 gross margin percentages were
unfavorably impacted by our lower sales volume compared to fiscal 1998 and
continued competitive pricing pressures. During the second half of fiscal 1999,
the gross margin percentage began to increase as a result of our continued cost
reductions in manufacturing and economies of scale achieved by higher revenues.

Research and Development

R&D expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1999 were 22.0% of total revenue, compared to 19.6% of total revenue for the
prior fiscal year. The increase in percentage of total revenue was due to
significantly lower revenue rates, even though R&D expenses decreased 31.0%
in fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998. Our overall downsizing activities,
including our exiting of the FPD and CVD operations during calendar 1998,
largely contributed to the overall decline in R&D, expenses in absolute
dollars which were, however, partially offset by increased levels of spending
related to our CMP products.

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A")
expenses were 22.5% of our total revenue for fiscal 1999, as compared to 19.2%
of total revenue for the prior fiscal year, but decreased in absolute dollars
from $201.9 million in fiscal 1998 to $145.7 million in fiscal 1999. The
reduction in SG&A was largely a result of the fiscal 1999 and 1998
restructuring programs and our management's continuing efforts to improve
administrative efficiency.

Fiscal 1998 Restructuring Charges

See the discussion of our 1998 Restructuring Charges
in Fiscal 2000 vs. 1999 "Restructuring Charges" of this report.

Merger Costs

During the first quarter of fiscal 1998, We
recorded costs of $17.7 million relating to the merger with OnTrak. Such
expenses were related to investment advisory fees, legal and accounting fees,
financial printing costs and other direct merger-related expenditures.

Purchased Technology for R&D

During the third quarter of fiscal 1998, we
purchased a non-exclusive license for Trikon's M

Æ

RI

ä

source
technology. We recorded a charge of $12.1 million for the license and for the
purchase of an R&D system from Trikon. During fiscal 1999, $5.0 million in
additional fees for the purchase of a non-exclusive license for M

Æ

RI source technology became payable (separate from
royalties owed on shipments of M

Æ

RI souce-
based systems determined by rates prescribed in the license). This completed the
purchase payments for this technology. The technology was used in a single
discrete etch product development project and has no future alternative use.

Other Income (Loss), Net

Other income,
net, of $0.3 million in fiscal 1999 decreased from $1.8 million in fiscal 1998,
due largely to the increase in interest expense as a result of a full year's
interest expense associated with our $310.0 million Convertible Subordinated
Notes (the "Notes"). The Notes, which were issued in August 1997, bear interest
at five percent and are due to mature on September 1, 2002. During fiscal 1999,
we also had a lower rate of return on our investments than during the previous
fiscal year, consistent with the lower interest rates prevailing in the U.S.
market.

Tax Benefit

For fiscal year
1999, we did not record an income tax benefit on the loss before income. At June
30, 1999, we had a cumulative net deferred income tax asset of $107.4 million
that was available to reduce payments on future federal and state income tax
liabilities. At June 30, 1999, we had gross deferred tax assets arising from
non-deductible temporary differences, tax loss and tax credit carryforwards of $
202.0 million. The gross deferred tax assets were offset by a valuation
allowance of $84.7 million and deferred tax liabilities of $ 9.9 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of June 25, 2000, we had $432.1 million in
cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash compared
with $372.1 million at June 30, 1999. We had a total of $100.0 million available
under a syndicated bank line of credit, which is due to expire in April 2001.
Borrowings are subject to our compliance with financial and other covenants set
forth in the credit documents. During fiscal 1999, we amended the syndicated
bank line of credit with respect to certain applicable covenant requirements and
amended the line of credit borrowing rates to a range of 0.55% to 1.25% over
LIBOR. At June 25, 2000, we were in compliance with all our financial and other
covenants.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $119.9 million
in fiscal 2000. This primarily resulted from net income of $204.8 million, non-
cash charges for depreciation and deferred tax of $64.6 million, sales of
accounts receivables of $81.3 million offset by net uses of working capital of
$200.2 million and restructuring charges of $30.6 million. The increases in
accounts receivable and inventory resulted from the increase in sales volume and
were partially offset by the increase in accounts payable and accrued
liabilities. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by $25.4 million
and $47.9 million, respectively. The increase in accrued liabilities related to
incentive pay and vacation accruals, and customer deposits.

Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2000
was $91.7 million, which stemmed primarily from the net purchase of short-term
investments of $27.8 million and net capital expenditures of $50.4 million. Cash
totaling $6.5 million was used for the purchase of technology for research and
development purposes.

Net cash flows provided by financing
activities during fiscal 2000 were $8.4 million. We made principal payments on
long-term debt and capital lease obligations of $29.1 million offset by proceeds
from the issuance of short-term debt of $8.7 million. We repurchased $31.6
million of common stock and reissued $7.3 million of our treasury stock through
our employee option and stock purchase programs. Net proceeds from the issuance
of our common stock generated $53.1 million.

During fiscal 1999, we entered into certain option
transactions with independent third parties (the "third parties") option
transactions for the purchase and sale of our common stock. Our Board of
Directors authorized us to acquire from the third parties options to purchase up
to 10.5 million shares of our common stock. These call options are to be
acquired to offset the anticipated dilutive effect of a potential conversion
into common stock of the Notes previously issued by us, and due September 2,
2002. As part of the program, the Board of Directors also authorized us to enter
into put options with the same third parties covering up to 15.75 million shares
of our common stock. We anticipated that the premiums we would receive over the
course of the program from the sale of the put options to the third parties
would offset in full the premium cost of our purchase of the call options from
those same third parties. Consequently, we do not expect to exchange cash over
the course of the program with the third parties in conjunction with our
purchase of the call options.

Pursuant to this authorization described above, we have
as of June 25, 2000 acquired call options to purchase 3.72 million shares of our
Common Stock; the weighted average exercise price of these options is $11.29.
The call options provide that our maximum benefit at expiration is $17.97 per
option share (the difference between $29.26, which is the conversion price of
the Notes, and the weighted average exercise price of the call options). We have
also entered put options with the same third parties covering 5.58 million
shares of our common stock, giving those third parties the right to sell to us
shares of our Common Stock at a weighted average price of $9.48 per share.

The call and put options are European style options
exercisable upon expiration; all of the options expire no later than September
3, 2002, which is the business day following the date on which the Notes must
either be converted or retired. Upon option exercise, we have the ability, at
our option, to permit the options to be physically settled (i.e., shares would
be delivered to us against payment of the exercise price), settled in cash
(i.e., by a payment from one party to the other of the value of the option being
exercised) or "net settled" in shares (i.e., by delivery of a number of shares
of common stock having a value equal to the value of the option being
exercised). We can also terminate the options prior to expiration for a
settlement value determined from time to time by the appropriate Third Party.
While the options are only exercisable at expiration, the terms of the contracts
with the third parties provide for early termination and settlement of the
options upon the occurrence of certain events (in a form determined by us which
includes net settlement of shares), including without limitation our material
breach of the agreement, default on certain indebtedness or covenants relating
to our financial condition, reduction in our S&P credit rating below B or a
drop in the price of our Common Stock to less than $1.67 per share.

If the average stock price is below $9.48 during any period,
the required number of shares to net settle the Company's obligation under the
put option agreement would be considered dilutive securities in our dilutive
earnings per share ("EPS") calculation.

Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment
industry, we believe that maintenance of sufficient liquidity reserves is
important to ensure our ability to maintain levels of investment in R&D and
capital infrastructure through ensuing business cycles. Based upon our current
business outlook, our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted
cash and available lines of credit at June 25, 2000 are expected to be
sufficient to support our current anticipated levels of operations and capital
expenditures through December 2001.

RISK FACTORS

Our Quarterly Revenues and Operating Results are
Unpredictable

Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate
significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, not all of
which are in our control. These factors include:

economic conditions in the semiconductor industry
generally, and the equipment industry specifically;

customer capacity requirements;

the size and timing of orders from customers;

customer cancellations or delays in our
shipments;

our ability in a timely manner to develop, introduce and
market new, enhanced and competitive products;

our competitors' introduction of new products;

legal or technical challenges to our products and
technology;

changes in average selling prices and product mix;
and

exchange rate fluctuations.

We base our expense levels in part on our expectations of
future revenues. If revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet our
expectations, our operating results are adversely affected.

We derive our revenue primarily from the sale of a relatively
small number of high-priced systems. Our systems can range in price from
approximately $400,000 to $4 million per unit. Our operating results for a
quarter may suffer substantially if:

we sell fewer systems than we anticipate in any quarter;

we do not receive anticipated orders in time to enable
actual shipment during that quarter;

one or more customers delay or cancel anticipated
shipments; or

shipments are delayed by procurement shortages or
manufacturing difficulties.

Our ability to recognize revenues might be delayed due to
changes in accounting rules. SAB No. 101 "Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements" provides new guidance on the recognition, presentation and
disclosure of revenue in financial statements of all public registrants.
Currently, we generally recognize revenue on products upon shipment to our
customers. The adoption of SAB 101 may require that some or all of that revenue
not be recognized until the product is actually accepted by the customers, an
event, which generally does not happen until sometime after shipment has
occurred. Compliance with SAB 101 therefore might delay our recognition of
revenue, compared to our current practice, for one or more quarters, causing an
adverse impact on our operating results during the quarters in which product has
been shipped, but not yet accepted by the customer. The SEC has delayed the
required implementation date of SAB 101, which for us, will be the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2001. In addition, the SEC has indicated that implementation
guidance will be forthcoming in the form of "Frequently Asked Questions";
however, such guidance has not been issued to date. Although we cannot fully
assess the impact of SAB 101 until the additional guidance from the SEC is
issued, we are still in the process of assessing the impact of SAB 101 on our
consolidated results of operations based upon the most current information.

Further, because of our continuing consolidation of
manufacturing operations and capacity at our Fremont, California facility,
natural, physical, logistical or other events or disruptions affecting this
facility (including labor disruptions) could adversely impact our financial
performance.

We May Experience Difficulty Transitioning to our New
Enterprise Resource System

We implemented a new next-generation enterprise
resource planning and information system during fiscal 2000. It replaced most of
the transactional systems utilized in the past, including core manufacturing,
finance, service, sales, shipping, inventory and warranty operations and other
significant operational systems. Delays in our ability to transition to this new
planning and information system, or disruptions in our internal operations or
systems caused by the transition or the need to free up additional support and
resources in order to ensure our timely transition, could temporarily disrupt
certain of our operations. This could include a temporary delay in our ability
to manufacture and ship equipment and/or spare parts to our customers, which
could cause a near-term short fall in quarterly operating results, including
revenues and earnings

.

The Semiconductor Equipment Industry is Volatile, which
Affects Our Revenues and Financial Results

Our business depends on the capital equipment
expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current
and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products using
integrated circuits. The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and
historically experiences periodic downturns. During the past two years the
semiconductor industry has experienced severe swings of product demand and
volatility in product pricing. In early fiscal 1999 and fiscal 1998, the
semiconductor industry reduced or delayed significantly purchases of
semiconductor manufacturing equipment and construction of new fabrication
facilities because of an industry downturn. However, beginning in late fiscal
1999, we saw indications of a recovery, which is expected to extend through
calendar 2000. Fluctuating levels of investment by the semiconductor
manufacturers and pricing volatility will continue to affect materially our
aggregate bookings, revenues and operating results. Even during periods of
reduced revenues, we must continue to invest in research and development and to
maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities
to remain competitive, which may harm our financial results.

We Depend on New Products and Processes for Our
Success. For this Reason, We are Subject to Risks Associated with Rapid
Technological Change

Rapid technological changes in semiconductor
manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop
technological advances enabling such processes. We believe that our future
success depends in part upon our ability to develop, manufacture and
successfully introduce new products with improved capabilities and to continue
to enhance our existing products. Due to the risks inherent in transitioning to
new products, we must forecast accurately demand for new products while managing
the transition from older products. If new products have reliability or quality
problems our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing
costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional
service and warranty expenses. In the past, product introductions caused some
delays and reliability and quality problems. We may be unable to develop and
manufacture new products successfully, or new products that we introduce may
fail in the marketplace, which would materially and adversely affect our results
from operations.

We expect to continue to make significant investments in
research and development and to pursue joint development relationships with
customers or other members of the industry. We must manage product transitions
and joint development relationships successfully, as introduction of new
products could adversely affect our sales of existing products. Future
technologies, processes or product developments may render our current product
offerings obsolete, or we may be unable in a timely manner to develop and
introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products which satisfy
customer needs or achieve market acceptance. Furthermore, if we are unsuccessful
in the marketing and selling of advanced processes or equipment to customers
with whom we have strategic alliances, we may be unsuccessful in selling
existing products to those customers. In addition, in connection with the
development of new products, we will invest in significant levels of initial
production inventory. Our failure in a timely manner to complete
commercialization of these new products could result in inventory obsolescence,
which would adversely affect our financial results.

We Are Subject to Risks Associated with the
Introduction of New Products

Once new products are introduced, we expect to face
significant competition from multiple current and future competitors. We believe
that other companies are developing systems and other products that are
competitive to ours and are planning to introduce new products to this market,
which may affect our ability to sell new products. Furthermore, new products
represent significant investments of our resources and their success, or lack
thereof, could have a material affect on our financial results.

We Are Subject to Risks Relating to Product
Concentration and Lack of Product Revenue Diversification

We derive a substantial percentage of our revenues
from a limited number of products, and we expect these products to continue to
account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term. Continued
market acceptance of our primary products is, therefore, critical to our future
success. Our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows
could therefore be adversely affected by:

a decline in demand for our products;

a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our
products;

an improved version of products being offered by a
competitor in the market we participate in;

technological change that we are unable to match in our
products; and

a failure to release new enhanced versions of our
products on a timely basis.

We are Dependent Upon a Limited Number of Key
Suppliers

We obtain certain components and sub-assemblies
included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers.
Each of our key suppliers has a one year blanket purchase contract under which
we may issue purchase orders. We may renew these contracts periodically. Each of
these suppliers sold us products during at least the last four years, and we
expect that we will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we
will otherwise replace them with competent alternative source suppliers.
Nevertheless, a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could adversely
affect our operating results and result in damage to our customer relationships.

We May Encounter Difficulties Obtaining Sufficient
Personnel, Components and Other Resources to Meet Current Demands

The semiconductor equipment industry is
currently experiencing significant demand for its products. This demand has
increased our requirements for qualified management, technical and engineering
personnel needed for our business operations. Competition for adequate personnel
particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area is intense, and we have experienced
difficulty in identifying and hiring such personnel. The loss of the services of
key management or technical and engineering employees could have a material
adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, cash
flows, market perceptions and price of our common stock.

We might also experience shortages in components and other
resources of all types required to satisfy customer demand for our products. If
we are unable to satisfy customer demand, we might drive them to purchase
products elsewhere, which might have a material adverse affect on our operating
results and could result in damage to our customer relationships.

Once a Semiconductor Manufacturer Commits to Purchase a
Competitor's Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment the Manufacturer Typically
Continues to Purchase that Competitor's Equipment, Making it More Difficult for
Us to Sell our Equipment to that Customer

Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial
investment to install and integrate capital equipment into a semiconductor
production line. We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a
particular supplier's capital equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon
that equipment for that specific production line application. Accordingly, we
expect it to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer
initially selects a competitor's equipment. We believe that to remain
competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad
range of products, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide,
and to invest in product and process research and development.

We May Lack the Financial Resources or Technological
Capabilities of Certain of Our Competitors Needed to Capture Increased Market
Share

Certain of our competitors have substantially greater
financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing and
customer service and support resources than we do and therefore are increasingly
dominating the semiconductor equipment industry. In addition, there are smaller
emerging semiconductor equipment companies that may provide innovative
technology that may have performance advantages over systems we currently, or
expect to, offer.

We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design
and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new
products and processes with enhanced performance characteristics. If our
competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor
manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, it
could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers. In
addition, competitors with higher levels of financial resources than us may
continue to deeply discount products similar to those we sell. For these
reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide.

Our present or future competitors may be able to develop
products comparable or superior to those we offer or that adapt more quickly to
new technologies or evolving customer requirements. In particular, while we
currently are developing additional product enhancements that we believe will
address customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the
development or introduction of these additional product enhancements
successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or
be competitive. Accordingly, we may be unable to continue to compete effectively
in our markets, competition may intensify or future competition may have a
material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial condition
and cash flows.

Our Future Success Depends on International Sales

International sales accounted for approximately 71%
of our total revenue in fiscal 2000, 54% in fiscal 1999, and 55% in fiscal 1998.
We expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant
portion of our total revenue in future years. International sales are subject to
risks, including, but not limited to:

foreign exchange risks;

foreign trade disputes; and

economic, political, banking and currency problems in the
relevant region.

We currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to
minimize the short term impact of exchange rate fluctuations on yen-denominated
sales and assets, and will continue to enter into hedging transactions in the
future.

A Failure to Comply with Environmental Regulations May
Adversely Affect Our Operating Results

We are subject to a variety of governmental
regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise
hazardous chemicals. We believe that we are in general compliance with these
regulations and that we have obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise
addressing) all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business. These
permits generally relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes. Nevertheless, the
failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being
imposed on us, suspension of production, cessation of our operations or
reduction in our customers' acceptance of our products. These regulations could
require us to alter our current operations, to acquire significant equipment or
to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations.
Our failure to control the use, sale, transport or disposal of hazardous
substances could subject us to future liabilities.

Our Ability to Manage Potential Growth; Integration of
Potential Acquisitions and Potential Disposition of Product Lines and
Technologies Creates Risks for Us

Our management may face significant challenges in
improving financial and business controls, management processes, information
systems and procedures on a timely basis, and expanding, training and managing
our work force if we experience additional growth. There can be no assurance
that we will be able to perform such actions successfully. In the future, we may
make additional acquisitions of complementary companies, products or
technologies, or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or
technologies, which no longer fit our long-term strategy. Managing an acquired
business or disposing of product technologies entails numerous operational and
financial risks, including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and
new personnel or separating existing business or product groups, diversion of
management's attention to other business concerns, amortization of acquired
intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired
or disposed operations. Our success will depend, to a significant extent, on the
ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to
identify and respond to these challenges effectively. There can be no assurance
that we will be able to achieve and manage effectively any such growth,
integration of potential acquisitions or disposition of product lines or
technologies, or that our management, personnel or systems will be adequate to
support continued operations. Any such inabilities or inadequacies would have a
material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition
and cash flows.

An important element of our management strategy is to review
acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products, augment our
market coverage and distribution ability, or enhance our technological
capabilities. We may acquire additional businesses, products or technologies in
the future. Any acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially
dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent
liabilities and the amortization expense related to goodwill and other
intangible assets, any of which could materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations and/or the price of our Common
Stock.

The Market for Our Common Stock is Volatile, which May
Affect our Ability to Raise Capital or Make Acquisitions

The market price for our Common Stock is volatile and
has fluctuated significantly over the past years. The trading price of our
Common Stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in
response to factors, including the following:

general market or semiconductor industry
conditions;

variations in our quarterly operating results;

variations in our revenues or earnings from levels
securities analysts expect;

announcements of restructurings, technological
innovations, reductions in force, departure of key employees, consolidations of
operations or introduction of new products;

government regulations;

developments in or claims relating to patent or other
proprietary rights;

disruptions with key customers; or

political, economic or environmental events occurring
globally or in our key sales regions.

In addition, the stock market has in recent years experienced
increasing significant price and volume fluctuations. Recent volatility in the
price of our Common Stock was tied in part to the actual or anticipated movement
in interest rates and the price of and markets for semiconductor stock
generally. These broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the
price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In
the past, following volatile periods in the price of stock, many companies
become the object of securities class action litigation. If we are sued in a
securities class action, we could incur substantial costs and it could divert
management's attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact in the price
for our Common Stock.

Risk Associated with Our Call and Put Options

We have entered into third party option transactions
for the purchase and sale of our stock. The option positions will be of value to
us if our stock price exceeds the exercise price of the call options at the time
the options are exercised. Conversely, our stock price could also decline. If
our stock price on the exercise date of the options were below the put option
exercise price, we would have to settle the put obligation by paying cash or the
equivalent value of our Common Stock obligation.

If settlement were to occur prior to option expiration
because of the occurrence of an event giving the third parties the right to
terminate the transactions, we will be required both to pay to the third parties
the value of their position (which would depend on a number of factors,
including the time remaining to expiration and the volatility of Lam Common
Stock) which could be greater or lesser than the difference between the options'
exercise prices and the then market price of Lam Common Stock, as well as any
costs or expenses incurred by the third parties as a result of unwinding the
transactions.

The Potential Anti-Takeover Effects of Our Bylaws
Provisions and the Rights Plan We Have in Place May Affect Our Stock Price and
Inhibit a Change of Control Desired by Some of Our Stockholders

On January 23, 1997, we adopted a Rights Plan (the
"Rights Plan") in which rights were distributed as a dividend at the rate of one
right for each share of our Common Stock, held by stockholders of record as of
the close of business on January 31, 1997, and thereafter. In connection with
the adoption of the Rights Plan, our Board of Directors also adopted a number of
amendments to our Bylaws, including amendments requiring advance notice of
stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals.

The Rights Plan may have certain anti-takeover effects. The
Rights Plan will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts
to acquire Lam in certain circumstances. Accordingly, the existence of the
Rights Plan and the issuance of the related rights may deter certain acquirers
from making takeover proposals or tender offers. The Rights Plan, however, is
not intended to prevent a takeover. Rather it is designed to enhance the ability
of our Board of Directors to negotiate with a potential acquirer on behalf of
all of our stockholders.

In addition, our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes
issuance of 5,000,000 shares of undesignated Preferred Stock. Our Board of
Directors, without further stockholder approval, may issue this Preferred Stock
on such terms as the Board of Directors may determine, which also could have the
effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Lam. The issuance of
Preferred Stock could also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of
our Common Stock, including causing the loss of voting control. Our Bylaws and
indemnity agreements with certain officers, directors and key employees provide
that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur
in legal proceedings resulting from their service to Lam. Moreover, Section 203
of the Delaware General Corporation Law restricts certain business combinations
with "interested stockholders", as defined by that statute.

Intellectual Property and Other Claims Against Us Can
Be Costly and Could Result in the Loss of Significant Rights which are Necessary
to our Continued Business and Profitability

Other parties may assert infringement, unfair
competition or other claims against us. Additionally, from time to time, other
parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or
other intellectual property rights. In such cases, it is our policy either to
defend the claims or to negotiate licenses on commercially reasonable terms.
However, we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses on
commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and any litigation resulting from
these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and
financial results.

In October 1993, Varian Associates, Inc. sued us in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of California, seeking
monetary damages and injunctive relief based on our alleged infringement of
certain patents Varian held. We asserted defenses that the subject patents are
invalid and unenforceable, and that our products do not infringe these patents.
Litigation is inherently uncertain and we may fail to prevail in this
litigation. However, we believe that the Varian lawsuit will not materially
adversely affect our operating results or financial position. See Part I Item 3
of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the Varian lawsuit.

Additionally, in September 1999, Tegal Corporation sued us in
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, seeking
monetary damages and injunctive relief based on our alleged infringement of
certain patents Tegal holds. Specifically, Tegal identified our 4520XLe

Ô

and Exelan

Ô

products as infringing the patents Tegal is asserting. Litigation is inherently
uncertain and we may fail to prevail in this litigation. However, we believe
that the Tegal lawsuit will not materially adversely affect our operating
results or financial position. See Part I Item 3 of this Form 10-K for a
discussion of the Tegal lawsuit.

We May Fail to Protect Our Proprietary Technology
Rights, which Would Affect Our Business

Our success depends in part on our proprietary
technology. While we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through
patents, copyrights and trade secret protection, we believe that our success
also depends on increasing our technological expertise, continuing our
development of new systems, increasing market penetration and growth of our
installed base, and providing comprehensive support and service to our
customers. However, we may be unable to protect our technology in all instances,
or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology
independently. We currently hold a number of United States and foreign patents
and pending patent applications. However, other parties may challenge or attempt
to invalidate or circumvent any patents the United States or foreign governments
issue to us or these governments may fail to issue pending applications. In
addition, the rights granted or anticipated under any of these patents or
pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or in fact provide no
competitive advantages.

YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE

with Year 2000 compliance in the section of this report entitled Item 7
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations".

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our exposure to
market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our investment
portfolio and long-term debt obligations. We maintain a strict investment
policy, which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by
limiting default risk, market risk, and reinvestment risk. The table below
presents notional amounts and related weighted-average interest rates by year of
maturity for our investment portfolio and long-term debt obligations at June 25,
2000, and June 30, 1999:

We mitigate default risk by
targeting investments in high credit quality securities and by constantly
positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in
a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes
only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve
portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification.

We have no cash flow exposure
related to our fixed rate $309.8 million Convertible Subordinated Notes,
Japanese yen-denominated bank loans or on our current capital lease obligations.
However, we do have cash flow exposure on the interest expense related to our
existing $100.0 million line of credit because the lending rates we receive
under that line of credit vary with LIBOR. At June 25, 2000, we had no
borrowings against this line of credit.

We conduct business on a
global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we are
potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign
currency exchange rates. For this reason, we enter into foreign currency forward
contracts to minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the value of
our yen-denominated assets and liabilities. We defer realized gains and losses
on these contracts and offset them against realized and unrealized gains and
losses from the settlement of the related yen-denominated receivables. At June
25, 2000, the notional amount of outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts
was $175.9 million. The unrealized gain on the contracts at June 25, 2000, was
$1.8 million. An adverse change in the exchange rate of the yen of approximately
15% would result in an unrealized loss of $28.9 million.

During fiscal 1999, we entered
into third party option transactions for the purchase and sale of our Common
Stock, in order to offset the dilutive effect of a potential conversion into
Common Stock of the $309.8 million Convertible Subordinated Notes we previously
issued and which are due September 2, 2002. We have as of June 25, 2000 acquired
call options to purchase 3.72 million shares of our Common Stock. The weighted
average exercise price of these options is $11.29. The call options provide that
our maximum benefit at expiration is $17.97 per option share (the difference
between $29.26, which is the conversion price of the Notes, and the weighted
average exercise price of the call options). We have also entered into put
options with the same third parties covering 5.58 million shares of our Common
Stock, giving those third parties the right to sell to us shares of our Common
Stock at a weighted average price of $9.48 per share.

Below is a table showing, at assumed exercise prices for the
put and call options and market prices for our Common Stock, our gain or (loss)
under the put and call options upon exercise or upon maturity of the options
transaction.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JUNE 25, 2000

NOTE A: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Effective fiscal year 2000, the Company changed
its reporting period to a fifty-two/fifty-three week fiscal year. The Company's
fiscal year end will fall on the last Sunday of June each year. The Company's
current fiscal year ended on June 25, 2000. Adoption of the change in fiscal
year did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial
statements.

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned
subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation.

Cash Equivalents:

All
highly-liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or
less are considered to be cash equivalents.

Revenue Recognition:

Sales of the Company's products
are generally recorded upon shipment. Estimated costs to be incurred by the
Company related to product installation and warranty fulfillment is accrued at
the date of shipment. Service revenue is recognized when earned under the
contract. In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued SAB
101 "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements". SAB 101 provides guidance on
the recognition, presentation, and disclosure of revenue in financial statements
of all public registrants. In addition, the SEC has indicated that
implementation guidance will be forthcoming in the form of "Frequently Asked
Questions", however, such guidance has not been issued to date.

Changes in the Company's revenue recognition policy resulting
from the interpretation of SAB 101 would be reported as a change in accounting
principle. The impact of this change, if any, on previously recognized revenue
would result in a cumulative adjustment to earnings in the quarter the Company
adopts SAB 101. The SEC has delayed the required implementation date, which for
the Company, will be the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Although we cannot fully
assess the impact of SAB 101 until the additional guidance from the SEC is
issued, we are still in the process of assessing the impact of SAB 101 on our
consolidated reported results of operations based upon the most current
information.

Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or
market. The Company evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of
inventory on a quarterly basis. The Company's policy is to evaluate all
inventory, including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished
goods and spare parts. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of the
Company's estimated usage for the next 12 to 24 months' requirements is written
down to its estimated net realizable value. Inherent in the estimates of net
realizable value are management's estimates related to the Company's future
manufacturing schedules, customer demand, obsolescence, possible alternative
uses and ultimate realization of potential excess inventory.

Equipment and Leasehold
Improvements:

Equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost.
Equipment is depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets, generally three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are
amortized by the straight-line method over the shorter of the life of the
related asset or the term of the underlying lease. Amortization of equipment
under capital leases is included with depreciation.

Foreign Currency:

Effective July 1, 1999 the Company
has determined that the functional currency of its European and Asia Pacific
subsidiaries is no longer the U.S. dollar but the individual subsidiary's local
currency. The following are the reasons for the Company's change in functional
currency: the Company's European and Asia Pacific subsidiaries primarily
generate and expend cash in their local currency; their labor and services are
primarily in local currency (workforce is paid in local currency); their
individual assets and liabilities are primarily denominated in the local foreign
currency and do not materially impact the Company's cash flows and there is an
active local sales market for the foreign subsidiaries' products and services.
The European and Asia Pacific subsidiaries are currently less dependent on the
Company's U.S. corporate office with their daily operations. Beginning July 1,
1999, all balance sheet accounts of these local functional currency subsidiaries
are translated at the current exchange rate, and income statement accounts are
translated at an average rate for the period. The resulting translation
adjustments are recorded as currency translation adjustments, which are a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Previously, some
balance sheet accounts were translated at historical exchange rates and
translation adjustments were made directly to the statement of operations. The
impact of the change in functional currency was not material to the Company's
financial statements.

Foreign Exchange Forward
Contracts:

The Company may enter into foreign currency forward exchange
contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments and
balance sheet positions. The Company does not enter into derivative financial
instruments for trading purposes. Foreign currency forward exchange contracts
designated as effective hedges of firm commitments are treated as hedges for
accounting purposes. Gains and losses related to qualified accounting hedges of
firm commitments are deferred and are recognized in income when the hedged
transaction occurs.

Use of Estimates:

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Derivative Instruments and
Hedging:

In June 1998, the FASB released Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities" ("FAS 133"). FAS 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards
for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in
other contracts, and for derivatives used for hedging activities. It requires
that all derivatives be recognized either as an asset or liability, and be
measured at fair value. FAS 133 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 2000, and will be adopted by the Company in fiscal year 2001. The
Company believes that the adoption of FAS 133 will not have a material impact on
the Company's consolidated financial position or overall trends in results of
operations.

Employee Stock Plans

: The Company accounts for its
stock option plans and its employee stock purchase plans in accordance with the
provisions of the Accounting Principles Board's Opinion No. 25 "Accounting For
Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25"). In October 1995, the FASB released
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, "Accounting For Stock-Based
Compensation" ("FAS 123"), which provides an alternative to APB 25. As allowed
under FAS 123, the Company continues to account for its employee stock plans in
accordance with the provisions of APB 25. In March 2000, the FASB issued FIN 44,
"Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation -- an
Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25". FIN 44 clarifies the application of APB
Opinion No. 25 and, among other issues, clarifies the following: the definition
of an employee for purposes of applying APB Opinion No.25; the criteria for
determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan; the accounting
consequence of various modifications to the terms of the previously fixed stock
options or awards; and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation
awards in a business combination. FIN 44 is effective July 1, 2000. The Company
believes that the adoption of FIN 44 will not have a material impact on the
Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.

NOTE B: COMPANY AND INDUSTRY INFORMATION

Lam is a supplier of
technically complex thin film processing equipment used at the front-end of
semiconductor manufacturing. The Company's product offerings include single
wafer plasma etch systems with a wide range of applications, CMP and post-CMP
wafer cleaning systems. The Company sells its products primarily to companies
involved in the production of semiconductors in the United States, Europe, Japan
and Asia Pacific. Credit evaluations are performed on all customers, and the
Company does not usually require collateral on sales.

The semiconductor industry has
historically been cyclical and has experienced periodic downturns, which have
had a material adverse effect on the semiconductor industry's demand for
semiconductor processing equipment, including equipment manufactured and
marketed by the Company. Certain of the components and subassemblies included in
the Company's products are obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of
suppliers. The Company believes that alternative sources could be obtained and
qualified to supply these products. Nevertheless, a prolonged inability to
obtain certain components could have a severe near-term effect on the Company's
operating results and could result in damage to customer relationships.

During fiscal 1999, the
Company amended its bank agreement to sell specific Japanese yen-denominated
receivables, subject to recourse provisions. At June 25, 2000 and June 30, 1999,
$17,295,000 and $13,006,000 of these receivables, respectively, had been sold to
the bank, of which $6,994,000 and $7,463,000 at June 25, 2000 and June 30, 1999,
respectively, remained uncollected by the bank and subject to recourse
provisions.

During fiscal 2000 the company
entered into an agreement to sell specific U.S. dollar denominated receivables,
subject to recourse provisions. At June 25, 2000, $47,640,000 of these
receivables had been sold to a large financial institution, of which $4,743,000
is subject to recourse provisions.

During fiscal 2000 and 1998, a single customer accounted for
15% and 12% respectively, of total sales. During fiscal 1999, no individual
customer accounted for greater than 10% of total sales.

The Company operates in one
business segment: the manufacturing and servicing of front-end wafer processing
semiconductor manufacturing equipment. All products and services are marketed
within the geographic regions in which the Company operates. The Company's
current product offerings qualify for aggregation under FAS 131 "Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information" as its products are
manufactured and distributed in the same manner, have similar long-term gross
margins and are sold to the same customer base.

The Company operates in four geographic
regions: the United States, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific. The summary of local
operations by geographic region for fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998 is as
follows:

The fair values of the Company's investments in debt
securities and restricted cash are based on quoted market prices at June 25,
2000 and June 30, 1999, respectively. The fair value of the Company's auction
rate preferreds is based upon par value. The fair value of the Company's foreign
currency forward contracts is estimated based upon the yen exchange rate at June
25, 2000 and June 30, 1999, respectively. The fair value of the Company's
convertible subordinated notes and the Company's other long-term debt is
estimated based on the current rates offered to the Company for similar debt
instruments of the same remaining maturities.

NOTE D: DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company enters into foreign currency forward
contracts to minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the value of
yen-denominated assets and liabilities. A substantial portion of the forward
contracts entered into has a maturity of 180 days or less. The unrealized gains
and losses on these contracts are deferred and offset against unrealized gains
and losses from the related yen-denominated assets and liabilities. Realized
losses on yen-forward contracts are offset by gains on underlying yen-denominated
receivables.

At June 25, 2000 and June 30, 1999, the notional amount
of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were $175,982,000 and
$71,672,000, respectively. Of the total outstanding contracts at June 25, 2000
and June 30, 1999, $104,116,000 and $33,885,000, respectively, were to hedge
yen-denominated inter-company receivables, and $71,866,000 and $36,129,000,
respectively, were to hedge firm commitments from customers in Japan. The
estimated fair value of these forward contracts at June 25, 2000 and June 30,
1999 was $1,822,000 and $1,658,000, respectively.

During August 1997, Lam completed an offering of $310.0
million of Convertible Subordinated Notes, which mature on September 2, 2002.
Interest on the five percent Notes is payable on September 1 and March 1 of each
year, commencing March 1, 1998. The Notes are convertible into shares of Lam
Common Stock at any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date,
unless previously redeemed, at a conversion price of $29.26 per share, subject
to anti-dilution adjustments. The Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at
the option of the Company and upon at least 20 days notice, at redemption prices
starting at 102.0% and at diminishing prices thereafter, plus accrued interest,
except that the Notes may not be redeemed prior to September 6, 2000. On or
after September 6, 2000, the Notes may be redeemed if the closing price of Lam
Common Stock is at least 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading
days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending within five trading
days prior to the notice of redemption. The Notes are unsecured and subordinated
in right of payment in full to all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of
the Company. Expenses associated with the offering of approximately $9.0 million
were deferred in other assets and are being ratably amortized over the term of
the Notes.

During the quarter ended September 30, 1998, the Company
entered into a Yen-denominated credit facility for an approximately 1.7 billion
yen-denominated loan ($16.0 million at June 25, 2000). This credit facility
replaces a term loan, which was held with other financial institutions.
Principal payments on the new facility are due annually on September 30, through
September 30, 2001. The new facility reflects terms, which were more favorable
than the previous yen-denominated loan.

The Board of Directors of the Company has authorized the
Company to acquire from independent third parties (the "third parties") options
to purchase up to 10.5 million shares of Lam common stock. These call options
are to be acquired to offset the anticipated dilutive effect of a potential
conversion into common stock of the Notes previously issued by the Company, and
due September 2, 2002. As part of the program, the Board of Directors also
authorized the Company to enter into put options with the same third parties
covering up to 15.75 million shares of Lam Common Stock. The Board of Directors
anticipated that the premiums the Company would receive over the course of the
program from the sale of the put options to the third parties would offset in
full the premium cost to the Company of its purchase of the call options from
those same third parties. Consequently, the Company does not expect to exchange
cash over the course of the program with the third parties in conjunction with
the Company's purchase of the call options.

Pursuant to this authorization, described above, the Company
has as of June 30, 1999 acquired call options to purchase 3.72 million shares of
Lam Common Stock; the weighted average exercise price of these options is
$11.29. The call options provide that the maximum benefit to the Company of the
call options at expiration is $17.97 per option share (the difference between
$29.26, which is the conversion price of the debentures, and the weighted
average exercise price of the call options). The Company has also entered put
options with the same third parties covering 5.58 million shares of its common
stock, giving those third parties the right to sell to the Company shares of Lam
Common Stock at a weighted average price of $9.48 per share.

The call and put options are European style options
exercisable upon expiration; all of the options expire no later than September
3, 2002, which is the business day following the date on which the Notes must
either be converted or retired. Upon option exercise, the Company has the
ability, at its option, to permit the options to be physically settled (i.e.,
shares would be delivered to the Company against payment of the exercise price),
settled in cash (i.e., by a payment from one party to the other of the value of
the option being exercised) or "net settled" in shares (i.e., by delivery of a
number of shares of common stock having a value equal to the value of the option
being exercised). The Company can also terminate the options prior to expiration
for a settlement value determined from time to time by the appropriate Third
Party. While the options are only exercisable at expiration, the terms of the
contracts with the third parties provide for early termination and settlement of
the options upon the occurrence of certain events (in a form determined by the
Company which includes net settlement of shares), including without limitation
the Company's material breach of the agreement, default on certain indebtedness
or covenants relating to the Company's financial condition, reduction in the
Company's S&P credit rating below B or a drop in the price of the Company's
Common Stock to less than $1.67 per share.

If the average stock price is below $9.48 during any period,
the required number of shares to net settle the Company's obligation under the
put option agreement would be considered dilutive securities in the Company's
dilutive EPS calculation.

As of June 25, 2000, the Company has deposited $9.0 million
as security for its obligations under the put options. The Company is required
to increase this amount if the Company enters additional option transactions
with the third parties. The Company will also have to increase the amount of
this security deposit by the amount from time to time that the put options are
actually in the money.

At June 25, 2000, the Company had a total of $100.0 million
available under a syndicated bank line of credit. The line of credit was
renegotiated in April 1998 and subsequently amended in December 1998, and is due
to expire in April 2001. Borrowings under the syndicated bank line of credit
bear interest at 0.55% to 1.25% over LIBOR, and are subject to Lam's compliance
with financial and other covenants. The credit agreement includes terms
requiring satisfaction of certain financial ratios, interest coverage, maximum
debt to equity leverage, senior indebtedness, tangible net worth, minimum
profitability, and also restricts the Company from paying dividends. At June 25,
2000, future maturities of long-term debt and minimum payments for capital lease
obligations are as follows:

NOTE I: STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

On March 6, 2000, the Company held a special
stockholders' meeting. At the meeting, the Company's stockholders approved an
increase in the number of authorized shares of the Company's Common Stock from
90 million to 400 million shares and approved a three-for-one stock split of its
outstanding shares of Common Stock. Stockholders' approval of the amendment to
the Company's Certificate of Incorporation satisfies the condition for the
previously announced three-for-one stock split for stockholders of record as of
March 7, 2000 approved by Lam's Board of Directors on January 21, 2000. All
prior period shares and per share amounts have been restated to give retroactive
effect to the three-for-one split.

During the first quarter of
fiscal 1999, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized
the repurchase, at management's discretion, of up to 1,104,000 shares of Lam
Common Stock from the public market or in private purchases. The shares
repurchased under this authorization would be used to reduce dilution caused by
the issuance of shares reserved under the Company's stock option and employee
stock purchase plans. During the third quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company
announced a share repurchase program of up to 6,000,000 shares of Lam Common
Stock. The shares repurchased under this authorization would be used to reduce
dilution caused by the issuance of shares reserved under the Company's stock
option and employee stock purchase plans. During fiscal 1999, the Company
repurchased 2,574,000 shares of Lam Common Stock for $18.9 million. During
fiscal 2000, the Company repurchased 1,049,000 shares of Lam Common Stock for
$31.6 million. At June 25, 2000 3,481,000 shares remain available for
repurchase.

Basic net income (loss) per share is calculated using the weighted average
number of shares outstanding during the period. For fiscal year 2000, diluted
net income per share includes the assumed exercise of employee stock options and
the assumed conversion of the convertible subordinated notes to common shares.
Options and convertible securities were outstanding during fiscal 1999 and 1998,
but were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per common share
because the effect in years with a net loss would have been antidilutive. The
shares potentially issuable under the put option agreement have been excluded
from the computation of dilutive net income (loss) per share because the effect
would have been antidilutive.

NOTE K: COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)

The components of comprehensive income
(loss), net of tax, are as follows for fiscal years ended June 25, 2000, June

NOTE L: STOCK OPTION PLANS AND STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

The Company has
adopted incentive stock option plans that provide for the granting to qualified
employees of incentive stock options to purchase shares of Lam Common Stock. In
addition, the plans permit the granting of nonstatutory stock options to paid
consultants and employees, and provide for the automatic grant of nonstatutory
stock options to outside directors. The option price is determined by the Board
of Directors, but in no event will it be less than the fair market value of Lam
Common Stock on the date of grant (no less than 85% of the fair market value at
the date of grant in the case of nonstatutory options). Options granted under
the plans vest over a period determined by the Board of Directors. Under the
automatic grant program, each outside director receives an option immediately
exercisable for 6,000 shares of Lam Common Stock during December of each year
during which the outside director serves, with the exercise price equal to the
fair market value on the date of grant.

A summary of incentive stock option plan transactions follows:

During fiscal 1998, the
stockholders of the Company approved the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, which
provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock, deferred stock and
performance share awards to participating officers, directors, employees,
consultants and advisors of the Company and its subsidiaries. Initially,
9,000,000 shares were reserved for issuance. The number of shares to be issued
will automatically be increased each calendar quarter subject to certain
provisions and restrictions, but will in no event exceed 15,000,000 shares.
During fiscal 1999, the Board of Directors of the Company amended the 1997 Stock
Incentive Plan to provide for annual non-employee director options to be granted
in December, as opposed to January, of each calendar year, and to allow for re-
pricing of stock options held by eligible employees who, at the time of any such
re-pricing, are not a member of the Board of Directors, a member of the
Company's senior management or a principal stockholder of the Company.

During fiscal 1999, the Board
of Directors of the Company approved the 1999 Stock Option Plan, which provides
for the grant of non-qualified stock option awards to eligible employees,
consultants and advisors of the Company and its subsidiaries. However, employees
who are also members of the Board of Directors or of the Company's senior
management, or who are a principal stockholder of the Company, are not eligible
to receive stock option awards under this plan. Initially, 9,000,000 shares were
reserved for issuance. In fiscal 2000, stockholders approved an additional
6,000,000 shares for issuance under the 1999 Stock Option Plan.

During fiscal 1996, the
Company adopted a Performance-Based Restricted Stock Plan designed to reward
executives based upon the achievement of certain predetermined goals. The grant
is based on the fair market value of the Lam's Common Stock at the end of the
quarter, provided the predetermined goals are met. The Company authorized
450,000 shares to be reserved for issuance under the Performance-Based Stock
Plan. At June 25, 2000, 400,872 shares remain available for issuance under this
plan. However, no shares have been issued under this plan since June 1996.

During fiscal 1999, the
Company adopted the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "1999 ESPP"). The
1999 ESPP allows employees to designate a portion of their base compensation to
be used to purchase Lam Common Stock at a purchase price per share of the lower
of 85% of the fair market value of Lam Common Stock on the first or last day of
the applicable offering period. Typically, each offering period lasts twelve
months and comprises three interim purchase dates. The 1999 ESPP, approved by
the Company's stockholders at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders on November 5,
1998, replaced the existing 1984 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "1984 ESPP").
The Company has 9,000,000 shares of Lam Common Stock reserved for issuance under
the 1999 ESPP: 3,000,000 shares may be issued at any time and additional shares
(up to 6,000,000 total additional shares) may be issued for each share of Lam
Common Stock which the Company redeems in public-market at private purchases and
designated for this purpose.

During fiscal 2000, 2,145,623
shares of Lam Common Stock were sold to employees under the 1999 ESPP. A total
of 10,289,923 shares of the Lam's Common Stock were issued under the 1999, and
1984 Plans through June 25, 2000, at prices ranging from $0.09 to $31.84 per
share. At June 25, 2000, 660,715 shares remain available for purchase under all
employee stock purchase plans.

As permitted by FAS 123, the
Company has elected to follow APB 25, and related Interpretations, in accounting
for stock-based awards to employees. Under APB 25, the Company generally records
nominal compensation expense with respect to such awards, which are generally
granted at market value on the date of grant.

Pro forma information
regarding net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share is required by FAS
123 for awards granted after June 30, 1995, as if the Company had accounted for
its stock-based awards to employees under the fair value method of FAS 123. The
fair value of the Company's stock-based awards to employees was estimated using
a Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes option valuation model
was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have
no vesting restrictions and which are fully transferable. In addition, the
Black-Scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions,
including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's stock-based
awards to employees have characteristics significantly different from those of
traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can
materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion the existing
models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of
the Company's stock-based awards to employees. The fair value of the Company's
stock-based awards to employees was estimated assuming no expected dividends and
the following weighted-average assumptions:

OPTIONS                  ESPP
                                 ----------------------- -----------------------
                                  2000    1999    1998    2000    1999    1998

Risk-free interest rate.........    6.2%    4.9%    5.7%    6.2%    4.9%    5.7%

The weighted average fair
value of options granted during 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $17.09, $9.25 and $20.59
per share, respectively. The weighted average fair value of shares granted under
the ESPP plans during fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $3.46, $5.39 and $12.85 per
share, respectively.

For pro forma purposes, the
estimated fair value of the Company's stock-based awards to employees is
amortized over the option's vesting period (for options) and the respective
four, six or twelve-month purchase periods (for stock purchases under the
respective employee stock purchase plans). The Company's pro forma information
follows:

FAS 123 is applicable only to awards granted subsequent to
June 30, 1995. As a result, its pro forma effect was not fully reflected in
fiscal years prior to 1999.

NOTE M: PROFIT SHARING PLAN AND BENEFIT PLAN

During fiscal 1998,
the Company revised the profit sharing plan for its employees in North America.
Distributions to employees by the Company are made bi-annually based upon a
percentage of base salary, provided that a threshold level of the Company's
financial and performance goals are met. Upon achievement of the threshold, the
profit sharing is awarded based upon performance against certain corporate
financial and operating goals. During fiscal 2000, the Company incurred
$24,405,000 in profit sharing plan expense. During fiscal 1999, the Company
incurred an expense of $2,121,000 based upon the Company achieving certain
business process improvements. During 1998, the Company did not incur any profit
sharing plan expense.

The Company maintains a
401(k)-retirement savings plan for its full-time employees in North America.
Each participant in the plan may elect to contribute 2% to 15% of his or her
annual salary to the plan, subject to statutory limitations. The Company matches
employee contributions to the plan at the rate of 50% of the first 6% of salary
contributed.

NOTE N: COMMITMENTS

The Company leases
its administrative, R&D and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service
offices and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases, which
expire at various dates through 2014. All of the Company's facility leases for
buildings located at its Fremont, California headquarters and certain operating
leases provide the Company an option to extend the leases for additional
periods. Certain of the Company's other facility leases provide for periodic
rent increases based on the general rate of inflation.

Future minimum lease payments
under operating leases, consist of the following:

                                                    ==========

During the third quarter of fiscal 2000, the Company entered into a five year
Operating Lease Agreement, relating to certain buildings at its Fremont,
California campus, in order to obtain more favorable terms and to reduce the
amount of the previous minimum lease payments. As part of the Agreement, the
Company is required to provide a guaranteed residual value of $25,205,000 at the
end of the lease term.

During fiscal 1998, the Company entered into an Operating
Lease Agreement relating to certain buildings at its Fremont campus that
provided more favorable terms and reduced the amount of the Company's
obligation. As part of the collateral restrictions of the Agreement, the Company
is required to maintain a certain amount of cash, $51.4 million at June 25, 2000
and June 30, 1999, respectively, in restricted specified interest-bearing
accounts. These restricted cash accounts must be maintained through March 2003
(unless the Agreement is otherwise terminated or the amount of maintained cash
is reduced), as the underlying obligation is paid down. Additional collateral
restrictions of the Agreement require the Company to provide a guaranteed
residual value of $44,402,000 at the end of the lease term.

Total rent expense for all
leases amounted to approximately $26,505,000, $33,144,000 and $44,737,000, for
fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

The Company has subleased some
of its buildings and currently is entitled to receive income of approximately
$4,716,000, $4,326,000, $3,221,000 $1,702,000, $1,550,000 and $812,000 for the
fiscal years 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and thereafter, respectively.

For the fiscal years ended
June 25, 2000, June 30, 1999 and June 30, 1998, the Company received income
totaling $4,671,000, $3,226,000 and $1,752,000, respectively, on its subleased
facilities.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax
effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax
purposes. Significant components of the Company's net deferred tax assets as of
June 25, 2000 and June 30, 1999 are as follows:

Approximately $71,900,000 and $1,500,000 of
the valuation allowance for deferred taxes, for fiscal 2000 and 1999,
respectively, is attributable to stock option deductions, the benefit of which
will be credited to equity when realized.

At June 25, 2000, the Company has federal tax loss
carryforwards of approximately $199,000,000, which will expire between 2019 and
2020. The Company also has federal and state tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $54,800,000, of which approximately $30,700,000 will expire in
varying amounts between 2001 and 2020. The remaining balance of $24,100,000 of
tax carryforwards may be carried forward indefinitely. A valuation allowance has
been provided for a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the
carryforwards. Realization of the majority of the net deferred tax assets is
dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income. We believe that it
is more likely than not that the assets will be realized based on forecasted
income. However, there can be no assurance that we will meet our expectations of
future income. We will evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets
quarterly and assess the need for additional valuation allowance.

Income before income taxes from foreign
operations for fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $25,780,000, $13,829,000 and
$11,462,000, respectively. In addition, the Company received royalty and other
income from foreign sources of $369,457, $410,000 and $2,059,000, in fiscal
years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, which is subject to foreign tax
withholding.

NOTE P: RESTRUCTURINGS

During the Company's first fiscal 1997 quarter ended
September 30, 1996, the Company projected and announced that revenues would be
lower than previous quarters due to a projected 20% general market decline. The
Company's revenues during that quarter fell to $299.2 million, a decrease of 24%
from the prior quarter. The Company assessed that market conditions would remain
depressed and, therefore, that its revenues would continue to be adversely
affected. Accordingly, and as announced on August 26, 1996, the Company
organizationally restructured its business units into a more centralized
structure and cut its workforce by approximately 11%.

The Company's quarterly
revenue would eventually decline to $233.3 million in the March 1997 quarter,
40% lower than the peak reached in the quarter ended June 1996. Subsequently, in
the latter part of calendar 1997, the industry rebounded quickly and entered
into what eventually became a short-lived upturn cycle. During the June 1997
quarter, the Company's revenues grew back to $282.6 million and reached $292.1
million by the December 1997 quarter. However, the Company's outlook in late
January 1998 was that the industry was again entering into a steep downturn
brought on by depressed DRAM pricing and the Asia financial crisis. The Company
therefore announced a further set of restructuring activities in a news release
on February 12, 1998. At that time, the Compny's assessment related to industry
conditions was that its revenues for the March and June 1998 quarters would
decline by approximately 20%. The Company's restructuring plans aligned its cost
structure to this level of revenues by exiting part of its CVD business and all
of its FPD business, consolidating its manufacturing facilities and
substantially reducing its remaining infrastructure and workforce. The Company's
actual June 1998 revenues were in line with those expectations; however, by the
mid-June 1998 time-frame the industry conditions further deteriorated and the
outlook for future quarters significantly worsened. The Company projected
revenues to drop to a run rate of approximately $180 million per quarter and
determined it needed once more to reduce its cost structure in line with the
projected reductions in revenue. Accordingly, another separate restructuring
plan was developed and announced in June 1998 and the Company exited the
remainder of its CVD operations. As a result of the restructurings in fiscal
1998, the Company reduced its global workforce by approximately 28%.

The Company's revenue outlook
in June 1998 was based on its projection that the worldwide wafer fabrication
industry would deteriorate from a quarterly revenue amount of $4.2 billion to
$3.2 billion, or a 25% decline. The semiconductor equipment market contracted
beyond what was anticipated, to quarterly revenues of $2.6 billion as reported
by Dataquest, an independent industry analysis firm. The Company's shortfall of
revenues during the September 1998 quarter declined in line with the industry as
a whole, and resulted in lower than anticipated revenues, falling to $142.2
million. At that point in time, the Company projected that its quarterly
revenues would remain closer to the $140-$150 million level for at least the
next several quarters. This necessitated another restructuring plan and further
cost reductions via employee terminations, facilities consolidation and a
contraction of operating activities, all of which resulted in the additional
write-off of plant-related assets. This plan was announced and publicly
communicated on November 12, 1998. As a result of the fiscal 1999 restructuring,
the Company further reduced its global workforce by approximately 15%.

Beginning in late fiscal 1999, there were indications of a
recovery in the semiconductor industry. On a global basis, semiconductor makers
began adding new capacity to address an increase in the demand for
semiconductors. In addition to new capacity, the semiconductor industry
accelerated a migration to new materials such as copper and the new interconnect
processes required to implement them. In early calendar year 2000, the Company
determined that the upturn would be sustainable and that is was likely to
continue through the end of the calendar year.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2000, the Company
completed certain elements of its restructuring activities in accordance with
its previously established and announced plans. As a result of the stronger than
anticipated recovery of the semiconductor capital equipment market, the Company
was able to recover approximately $18.9 million of the restructuring charges
recorded in prior periods. Of this amount $1.4 million was recovered due to
outplacement services guaranteed by the Company for terminated employees and
other exit costs not being utilized. Another $5.6 million was recovered because
the Company was able to reoccupy or successfully sublease certain manufacturing
and administrative facilities under long term operating leases. The Company also
recovered $3.1 million through the sale of its previously abandoned and written
off facility in Korea. Additionally, the Company will utilize leasehold
improvements of $5.5 million in certain manufacturing and administration
facilities under operating leases which have been reoccupied as a result of the
stronger than anticipated rebound in business. Approximately $0.8 million was
recovered from the salvage of CVD inventories previously segregated and written
off due to requests from former customers to purchase certain piece parts. The
remaining $2.5 million was recovered due to certain customers not utilizing
system return credits they requested and which were issued as a result of the
decision to exit the CVD and FPD businesses.

As a result of the continued growth of the semiconductor
capital equipment market, the Company recovered an additional $17.0 million of
restructuring charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 at which time we
completed the remaining elements if our restructuring plan. Of this amount, $9.5
million was recovered due to lower severance and termination costs than the
Company had planned for certain employees and executives. Another $3.9 million
was recovered from successful subleasing or occupancy of certain manufacturing
and administrative facilities due to the aforementioned faster and more robust
than anticipated industry recovery. The Company also recovered approximately
$1.4 million from the sale of more CVD and FPD inventory. Another $1.9 million
was recovered as a result of customers not utilizing system return credits they
had originally requested. Additionally, we will utilize leasehold improvements
of $0.3 million in certain manufacturing and administration facilities under
operating leases which have been reoccupied as a result of the stronger than
anticipated rebound in business.

Severance and Benefits relates to the salary and fringe
benefit expense for involuntarily terminated employees representing
approximately 15% of the global workforce. Prior to the date of the financial
statements, management, with the proper level of authority, approved and
committed the Company to a plan of termination and determined the benefits the
employees being terminated would receive. Prior to the financial statement date,
the expected termination benefits were communicated to employees in enough
detail that they could determine their type and amount of benefit. The
termination of employees occurred shortly after the plan of restructuring was
finalized.

Lease Payments on Vacated Facilities
relates to 24 months of rent and common area maintenance expense for the vacated
facilities. The Company also estimated given the then-current real estate market
conditions, that it would take approximately 24 months to sub-lease its vacated
facilities in Fremont, California.

The Company wrote-off all
leasehold improvements used in the excess facilities, computer equipment,
furniture and fixtures related to the involuntarily terminated employees, and
other assets deemed to have no future use as a result of the restructuring.

Credits on Returned Equipment relate to the charge
associated with the requirement by certain of the Company's customers to return
their previously purchased CVD systems and spare parts. 	The majority of the
Credit on Return Equipment reserve balance of $1.7 million as of June 25, 2000
will be utilized by the end of the current calendar year 2000.

Severance and Benefits relates
to the salary and fringe benefit expense of the involuntarily terminated
employees of the CVD and FPD operations which were exited, the shutdown of the
Wilmington, Massachusetts manufacturing facility, and the employees impacted by
the overall across the board reduction of the employee base. Prior to the date
of the financial statements, management, with the proper level of authority,
approved and committed the Company to a plan of termination and determined the
benefits the employees being terminated would receive. Prior to the financial
statement date, the expected termination benefits were communicated to employees
in enough detail that they could determine their type and amount of benefit. The
restructuring plans resulted in the Company reducing its global workforce by
approximately 28%. The termination of employees occurred shortly after the plan
of restructuring was finalized.

The Severance and Benefits
reserve balance of $1.9 million as of June 25, 2000 will be utilized to make
scheduled fixed cash payments through the remainder of those former employees'
separation contracts.

Lease Payments on Vacated Facilities, which were included
in the restructuring charge, related to remaining rent and common area
maintenance on the closed Wilmington, Massachusetts manufacturing facility. The
Company also estimated, given the then-current real estate market conditions,
that it would take approximately 24 months to sub-lease its excess facilities in
Fremont, California. Therefore, the Company included 24 months of rent and
common area maintenance expense related to excess facilities in its
restructuring charge. Subsequently, the Company has subleased its excess
facilities, and the remainder represents fixed commitments that will be
utilized.

The Company wrote-off all fixed assets relating to the
operations which were exited, leasehold improvements for the excess facilities,
computer equipment, furniture and fixtures related to the involuntarily
terminated employees and other assets deemed to have no future use as a result
of the restructuring.

The inventory write-off, which
was included in the restructuring charge, related to inventory from the
operations which were exited. The inventory write-off included raw materials on
hand and inventory scheduled to be purchased under non-cancelable commitments
from suppliers, spare parts, work-in-process and finished goods related to the
products from the exited operations.

Credits on Returned Equipment
relates to the charge associated with the requirement by certain of the
Company's customers to return their previously purchased CVD systems and spare
parts. During fiscal 1999, the Company recorded an adjustment to the
restructuring reserve of $1.5 million for the sale of a previously written-off
machine. The remainder of the reserve was reversed during fiscal 2000.

Other Exit Costs relates to
the net book value of licensing and manufacturing agreements related to the
restructured operations which, as a direct result of the restructuring plan, has
no future economic benefit to us.

1997 restructuring:

approximately 11% of the global workforce. Prior to the date of the financial
statements, management, with the proper level of authority, approved and
committed the Company to a plan of termination and determined the benefits the

the expected termination benefits were communicated to employees in enough
detail that they could determine their type and amount of benefit. The actual
termination of employees occurred shortly after the plan of restructuring was
finalized. During fiscal 1998, the Company revised its estimate relating to
severance and benefits and transferred the excess balance of remaining lease
payments on vacated facilities of $1.1 million to severance and benefits.

The Severance and Benefits reserve balance of $0.4
million as of June 25, 2000 will be utilized through the remainder of those
former employees' separation contracts.

Lease Payments on Vacated
Facilities relate to rent and common area maintenance expense for the vacated
facilities.

The Company wrote-off all
leasehold improvements used in the vacated facilities, computer equipment,
furniture and fixtures related to the involuntarily terminated employees, and
other assets deemed to have no future use as a result of the
restructuring.

NOTE Q: PURCHASED TECHNOLOGY FOR R&D

During the second quarter of fiscal 2000, the
Company purchased intellectual property rights related to the semiconductor
equipment industry from Oliver Design, Inc ("Oliver"). The Company recognized an
expense for the purchase of research development technology of approximately
$7.5 million and capitalized $1.5 million related to acquired patents, which
will be amortized ratably over their estimated useful life of five years.
Accumulated amortization for fiscal 2000 was $150,000. The technology is being
used in a single discrete next generation post-CMP wafer cleaning product
development project and has no future alternative use. The Company may make up
to $2.0 million in additional license payments to Oliver based on product sales
in the event Lam is successful in the commercialization of this technology.

During fiscal 1998, the
Company purchased a non-exclusive, worldwide license from Trikon Technologies,
Inc. ("Trikon") for its MØRI source technology. During fiscal 1998, the
Company recorded a charge for the purchase of technology of $12.1 million for
the initial payment on the license and for the purchase of a Trikon system to be
utilized for R&D. The technology is being used in a single discrete etch
product development project and has no future alternative use. An additional
$5.0 million for the license became payable and was paid in fiscal 1999.

NOTE R: LITIGATION

In October, 1993 Varian
Associates, Inc. ("Varian") brought suit against the Company in the United
States District Court, for the Northern District of California, seeking monetary
damages and injunctive relief based on the Company's alleged infringement of
certain patents held by Varian. By order of the Court, those proceedings were
bifurcated into an initial phase to determine the validity of the Varian patents
and Lam's infringement (if any), and a secondary phase to determine damages to
Varian (if any) and whether Lam's infringement (if shown) was willful. On April
13, 1999, the Court issued an interlocutory order construing the meaning of the
terms of the patent claims at issue in the action. In September 1999, a hearing
was held on a summary judgment motion which might dispose of a number of
Varian's claims, but the Court has not yet issued a final ruling on that motion.
Accordingly, to date, there has been no determination as to the actual scope of
those claims, or whether Lam's products have infringed or are infringing
Varian's patents. A trial date previously scheduled for March 2000 was vacated,
pending the court's decision of certain motions. There have been no findings in
the action which have caused the Company reasonably to believe that any
infringement, if found, or any damages, if awarded, would have a material
adverse effect on the Company's operating results or the Company's financial
position.

In September 1999, Tegal
brought suit against Lam in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Virginia, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based on
Lam's alleged infringement of certain patents held by Tegal. Specifically, Tegal
identified the Company's 4520XLe and Exelan products as infringing the patents
Tegal is asserting. On the Company's motion, this case was transferred to
California and is now pending in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of California. To date, there has been no determination as to
the actual scope of those claims, or whether the Company's products have
infringed or are infringing Tegal's patents. No trial date is currently
scheduled in the action. Furthermore, there have been no findings in the action,
which have caused the Company reasonably to believe that any infringement if
found, or any damages, if awarded, could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's operating results or our financial position.

From time to time, the
Company has received notices from third parties alleging infringement of such
parties' patent or other intellectual property rights by its products. In such
cases, it is the Company's policy to defend the claims or negotiate licenses on
commercially reasonable terms, where considered appropriate. However, no
assurance can be given that the Company will be able in the future to negotiate
necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any
litigation resulting from such claims would not have a material adverse effect
on the Company's consolidated financial position or operating results.
