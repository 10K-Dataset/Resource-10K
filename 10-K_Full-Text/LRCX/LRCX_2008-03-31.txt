2007 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K



Explanatory Note

In this Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended June 24, 2007 (the “2007
Form 10-K”), Lam Research Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Lam Research” or “the Company”), is
restating its consolidated balance sheet as of June 25, 2006 and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years ended June 25, 2006
and June 26, 2005, as a result of a voluntary independent stock option review described below. The
Company also recorded adjustments affecting previously-reported financial statements for fiscal
years 1997 through 2004, the effects of which are summarized in cumulative adjustments to
additional paid-in capital, deferred stock-based compensation, and retained earnings as of June 27,
2004. In addition, the Company is restating the unaudited quarterly condensed financial statements
for interim periods of fiscal year 2006, and unaudited condensed balance sheets as of March 25,
2007, December 24, 2006 and September 24, 2006. There was no effect of the restatement on the
consolidated statements of operations for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2007.

On July 18, 2007, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had initiated a voluntary
independent review regarding the timing of the Company’s past stock option grants and other related
issues. The voluntary internal review arose after the Company’s independent registered public
accounting firm performed auditing procedures relating to the Company’s historical stock option
grant programs and procedures as part of the firm’s fiscal year-end 2007 audit. The Board of
Directors appointed a special committee consisting of two independent board members (the
“Independent Committee”) to conduct a comprehensive review of the Company’s historical stock option
practices. The Independent Committee promptly engaged independent outside legal counsel and
forensic accountants to assist with the review. On December 21, 2007, the Company announced that
the Independent Committee had reached a preliminary conclusion that the actual measurement dates
for financial accounting purposes of certain stock option grants issued in the past differed from
the recorded grant dates of such awards. Upon the recommendation of management and the Independent
Committee, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors concluded that the financial statements
for fiscal years 1997 through 2005, and the interim periods contained therein should no longer be
relied upon. The Independent Committee’s review was completed in February 2008.

The review covered stock option grants awarded in fiscal years 1997 through 2005 (the “Review
Period”). The scope of the review included evaluating 100% of “Company-wide” grants, director
grants, Section 16 officer grants, and new hire grants, as well as a sampling of grants deemed
“other grants”, representing approximately 94% of all stock option grants during the Review Period.
This Review Period comprised approximately 16,000 separate stock option grants on approximately 500
separately recorded grant dates. These grants involved approximately 58 million underlying shares
of Common Stock and included grants to domestic and international employees. Share amounts have
been adjusted as applicable to reflect the March 2000 3-for-1 stock split. The Independent
Committee’s review also included procedures to identify
potential modifications of stock option grants and
grants awarded to consultants, and testing of cash exercises. The Company had not awarded any
Company-wide stock option grants since October 2002 and stopped issuing stock option grants during
fiscal year 2005 and only issued restricted stock units
(“RSUs”) thereafter.
The Independent Committee did not include fiscal years 2006 and 2007 in the scope of its review
based on several factors including but not limited to the fact that
the Company only issued RSUs
after fiscal year 2005 and the Company’s equity granting processes and controls had been documented
and tested as part of its assessment of the operating effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Additionally, no
information arose during the stock option review that would indicate a need to expand the scope of
the review to include other periods.

Consistent with applicable accounting literature and guidance from the SEC staff, the Company
organized the grants during the review period into categories based on the grant type and the
process by which the grant was finalized. The Company analyzed the evidence from the Independent
Committee’s review related to each category including, but not limited to, physical documents,
electronic documents, and underlying electronic data about documents. Based on the relevant facts
and circumstances, the Company applied the applicable accounting standards to determine, for
grants within each category, the proper measurement date. If the measurement date was not the
originally recorded grant date, accounting adjustments were made as required, resulting in
stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects. The significant majority of the
measurement date changes result from stock options granted prior to fiscal year 2003. As a result
of the findings of the review, the Company has recognized incremental stock-based compensation and
associated payroll tax expense of $96.4 million on a pre-tax basis ($65.8 million after taxes)
in the aggregate during fiscal years 1997 through 2006 which includes incremental stock-based compensation expense of
$1.2 million recognized in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised),
“Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123R”) during fiscal year 2006.

The Independent Committee also concluded that there was no intentional misconduct on the part
of Company management or the Company’s independent directors. During its review of the Company’s
historical stock option practices, the Independent Committee did not find evidence of any other
financial reporting or accounting issues unrelated to stock-based compensation.

The Company determined revised measurement dates for approximately 33 million options granted
during fiscal year 1997 to March 2005. The additional aggregate stock-based compensation expense noted above
is net of forfeitures related to employee terminations. To determine revised measurement dates,
management evaluated all of the available evidence. For those grants where the revised measurement
date could not be determined with certainty, management applied judgment to determine what it
believes to be the most appropriate measurement date in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
(“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB No. 25”) and other
applicable accounting rules, and considered the amount of additional compensation expense that
could result had different dates been selected. For a broader discussion of the judgments
underlying the revised measurement dates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of



Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this 2007
Form 10-K. The adjustments relating to these option grants did not affect
the Company’s previously reported revenue, cash, cash
equivalents or short-term investments and relate exclusively to the
Company’s historical stock option granting practices. This restatement is more fully described in
Note 3, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” to Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8 and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
in Item 7. This 2007 Form 10-K also reflects the restatement of “Selected Financial
Data” in Item 6 as of and for the years ended June 25, 2006, June 26, 2005, June 27, 2004, and June
29, 2003.

Financial information included in the reports on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filed or
furnished by Lam Research prior to January 24, 2008, and the related opinions of its independent
registered public accounting firm and all earnings press releases and similar communications issued
by the Company prior to January 24, 2008 are superseded in their entirety by this 2007 Form 10-K
and other reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on or after January 24, 2008.

Item 1.

Business

Lam Research Corporation (“Lam Research,” “we,” or the “Company”) was founded in 1980 and is
headquartered in Fremont, California. The mailing address for our principal executive offices is
4650 Cushing Parkway, Fremont, California 94538, and our telephone number is (510) 572-0200.
Additional information about Lam Research is available on our web site at
http://www.lamresearch.com. Our Forms 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and Forms 8-K are available online at the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) web site on the Internet. The address of that site is
http://www.sec.gov. We also make available free of charge the Forms 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and Forms 8-K
and any amendments to those reports on our corporate web site at http://www.lamresearch.com as soon
as reasonably practicable after we file them with or furnish them to the SEC.

We design, manufacture, market, and service semiconductor processing equipment used in
the fabrication of integrated circuits and are recognized as a major provider of such equipment to
the worldwide semiconductor industry. Semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of
process steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits. We
leverage our expertise in these areas to develop integrated processing solutions which typically
benefit our customers through reduced cost, lower defect rates, enhanced yields, or faster
processing time.

Etch Process

Etch processes, which are repeated numerous times during the wafer fabrication cycle, are
required to manufacture every type of semiconductor device produced today. Lam Research etch
products selectively remove portions of various films from the wafer in the creation of
semiconductors by utilizing various plasma-based technologies to create critical device features at
current and future technology nodes. Plasma consists of charged and neutral species that react with
exposed portions of the wafer surface to remove dielectric, metal, or polysilicon material and
produce the finely delineated features and patterns of an integrated circuit.

Advanced integrated circuit manufacturing requires etch systems capable of creating
structures for the 45 nanometer (nm) and below technology nodes. At this time, memory manufacturers
are transitioning from aluminum to copper conductive lines, while leading logic manufacturers are
progressing with the implementation of more fragile dielectric insulating materials (low-κ and
porous low-κ). Semiconductor manufacturers continue to require more precise control over the
etching process in order to accommodate decreasing linewidths and increasing wafer diameters. Lam
Research etch products and services are defined around the 2300

®

etch series.

systems enable sequential step tuning of gas flow and wafer temperature, which allows

in situ

processing of multi-layer stacks. Advanced Chamber Control and Conditioning (AC3™) technology
reduces processing drift and maintains the same chamber conditions for subsequent wafers.

Deep Silicon Etch Products

TCP

Syndion™ systems

. The TCP 9400DSiE employs Lam
Research’s TCP technology to facilitate deep silicon etch processes used in micro-electro
mechanical systems (MEMS), power device, and passive component fabrication. The TCP-based
technology provides the process flexibility needed to address a broad range of requirements for the
manufacture of MEMS devices.

The 2300 Syndion,
which also employs TCP technology, addresses 3-D IC through-silicon via (TSV)
etch applications. TSVs provide the interconnects for die-to-die and wafer-to-wafer stacking,
eliminating wire bonding to increase device packing density (smaller form factor) and improve
performance (higher process speed and lower power requirements). Important for TSV applications,
the Syndion’s TCP-based technology enables sequential processing the same chamber while ensuring
etch rate uniformity and profile symmetry to prevent tilting. The technology also supports clean
mode operation and provides bias voltage control for process repeatability.

Patterning Process

During semiconductor device manufacturing, lithography processes establish the templates for
patterns to be created during subsequent etch processes.

Patterning Products


®

Motif ™ system.

The 2300 Motif is a post-lithography pattern enhancement
system that enables the creation of features as small as 10 nm by using plasma-based technology to
deposit a thin film on printed photoresist holes and spaces. The film is created by applying
multiple short etch-deposition cycles until the target feature size is achieved. This capability
addresses a customer technology need for a solution enabling the creation of features two to three
generations ahead of lithography. The system also simplifies optical proximity correction by
improving the lithography profile and provides a cost-effective approach to extending lithography
tool sets in select applications.

Clean Process

The manufacture of semiconductor devices involves a series of processes such as etch and
deposition, which leave particles and residues. The wafer must generally be cleaned following these
steps to remove residues that could degrade device performance. Common wafer cleaning steps include
post-etch/post-strip cleans and pre-diffusion/pre-deposition cleans (also referred to as “critical
cleans”), during which the wafer surface is prepared for subsequent diffusion/deposition steps.

For 65 nm technologies and below, defects transferred from the wafer edge bevel can
significantly limit device yield. During device patterning, complex interactions of film
deposition, lithography, etching, and chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) result in a wide range of
unstable film stacks on the wafer edge. In subsequent process steps these film layers can produce
defects that are transported to the device area of the wafer, and residues need to be removed from
the wafer edge to eliminate these defect sources.

Wet Clean Products

Confined Chemical Cleaning™ (C3™) single-wafer technology-based systems.

At the 65 nm
technology node and below, devices become more susceptible to damage from the chemical environment
and mechanical forces of the cleaning process. Lam Research’s single-wafer wet cleaning system,
based on the Company’s proprietary C3 technology, provides high-selectivity wafer cleaning with
minimal mechanically induced damage and allows flexibility in selecting cleaning chemicals that
minimize damage to device structures. Advanced drying technology integrated into the cleaning unit
facilitates low-defect processing of hydrophobic materials, such as advanced low-κ dielectrics.
Short contact times, enabled by an innovative chemical delivery mechanism to enhance the transport
of chemicals to and from the wafer surface, minimize potential erosion or etching of delicate
features on the wafer, while allowing for highly selective and efficient residue removal.

Bevel Clean Product

s


®

Coronus

TM

bevel clean system.

The 2300 Coronus plasma-based bevel
clean system is a plasma-based technology that allows control of the wafer edge at multiple steps
during the device fabrication process by selectively removing films from the wafer edge using
edge-confined plasma technology. Removal of these films at select points in the integration flow
reduces defects and increases device yields. Precise control of the processing zone coupled with
Lam Research’s Dynamic Alignment, which provides accurate wafer placement, ensures a repeatable
processing area, wafer to wafer.

Research and Development

The market for semiconductor capital equipment is characterized by rapid technological
change and product innovation. Our ability to obtain and maintain our competitive advantage depends
in part on our continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing
products. Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to
R&D programs and seek to maintain close and responsive relationships with our customers and
suppliers.

Our R&D expenses during fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005 were $285.3 million,
$229.4 million, and $195.3 million, respectively. The majority of spending is targeted at etch and
plasma-based technology applications with an increasing proportion focused on adjacent markets,
pre- and post-etch step opportunities, consistent with our multi-product growth strategy. We
believe current challenges for customers in the pre- and post-etch applications present
opportunities for us. We plan to leverage our extensive production experience in etch and strip
into new products and new capabilities for our customers at the 65, 45, and 32 nm nodes, including
post ion implantation strip, clean, and patterning.

We expect to continue to make substantial investments in R&D to meet our customers’
product needs, support our growth strategy, and enhance our competitive position.

Marketing, Sales, and Service

Our marketing, sales, and service efforts are focused on building long-term relationships
with our customers and targeting product and service solutions designed to meet our customers’
needs. These efforts are supported by a team of product marketing and sales professionals as well
as equipment and process engineers who work closely with individual customers to develop solutions
for their wafer processing needs. We maintain ongoing service relationships with our customers and
have an extensive network of field service engineers in place throughout the United States, Europe,
Taiwan, Korea, Japan, and Asia Pacific. We believe that comprehensive support programs and close
working relationships with customers are essential to maintaining high customer satisfaction and
our competitiveness in the marketplace.

We offer standard warranties for our systems that generally run for a period of 12 months
from system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer. The
warranty provides that systems shall be free from defects in material and workmanship and conform
to our published specifications. The warranty is limited to repair of the defect or replacement
with new or like-new equivalent goods and is valid when the buyer provides prompt notification
within the warranty period of the claimed defect or non-conformity and also makes the items
available for inspection and repair. We also offer extended warranty packages to our customers to
purchase as desired.

Export Sales

A significant portion of our sales and operations occur outside the United States and,
therefore, may be subject to certain risks, including but not limited to tariffs and other
barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing non-U.S. operations, adverse tax consequences,
exchange rate fluctuations, changes in currency controls, compliance with U.S. and international
laws and regulations, including U.S. export restrictions, and economic and political conditions.
There can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial position, and results of operations and cash flows. Revenue by region was as

Customers

Our customers include many of the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers. Customers
continue to establish joint ventures, alliances and licensing arrangements, which have the
potential to positively or negatively impact our competitive position and market opportunity. In
fiscal year 2007, revenues from Hynix Semiconductor and Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd., each
accounted for approximately 14% of total revenues. In fiscal year 2006, revenues from Samsung
Electronics Company, Ltd., accounted for approximately 15% of total revenues and revenues from
Toshiba Corporation accounted for approximately 12% of total revenues. In fiscal year 2005,
revenues from Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd., accounted for approximately 13% of total revenues.

A material reduction in orders from our customers in the semiconductor industry could
adversely affect our results of operations and projected financial condition. Our business depends
upon the expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers. Semiconductor manufacturers’ businesses, in
turn, depend on many factors, including their economic capability, the current and anticipated
market demand for integrated circuits and the availability of equipment capacity to support that
demand.

Backlog

Our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems, spares, and services where
written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services
is anticipated within the next 12 months. Our policy is to revise our backlog for order
cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect, among other things, spares volume estimates and
customer delivery date changes. In general, we schedule production of our systems based upon
purchase orders in backlog and our customers’ delivery requirements. Included in our systems
backlog are orders for which written requests have been accepted, prices and product specifications
have been agreed upon, and shipment of systems is expected within one year. The spares and services
backlog includes customer orders for products that have not yet shipped and for services that have
not yet been provided. Where specific spare parts and customer service purchase contracts do not
contain discrete delivery dates, we use volume estimates at the contract price and over the
contract period, not exceeding 12 months, in calculating backlog amounts.

As of June 24, 2007 and June 25, 2006, our backlog was approximately $643 million and
$521 million, respectively. Generally, orders for our products and services are subject to
cancellation by our customers with limited penalties. Because some orders are received for
shipments in the same quarter and due to possible customer changes in delivery dates and
cancellations of orders, our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of
business volumes nor actual revenue levels for succeeding periods.

Manufacturing

Our manufacturing operations consist mainly of assembling and testing components,
sub-assemblies, and modules that are then integrated into finished systems prior to shipment to or
at the location of our customers. Most of the assembly and testing of our products is conducted in
cleanroom environments.

We have agreements with third parties to outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing,
production warehousing, and logistics functions. We believe that these outsourcing contracts
provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a more timely and cost effective
manner, enabling us to respond to the cyclical nature of our business. We believe that we have
selected reputable providers and have secured their performance on terms documented in written
contracts. However, it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we
expect, and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business and have a negative effect on
our operating results and financial condition. Overall, we believe we have effective mechanisms to
manage risks associated with our outsourcing relationships. Refer to Note 16 of our Consolidated
Financial Statements, included in Item 8 herein, for further information concerning our outsourcing
commitments.

Certain components and sub-assemblies included in our products are only obtained from a
single supplier. We believe that, in many cases, alternative sources could be obtained and
qualified to supply these products. Nevertheless, a prolonged inability to obtain these components
could have an adverse effect on our operating results and could unfavorably impact our customer
relationships.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the management of
hazardous materials. We are currently not aware of any pending notices of violation, fines,
lawsuits, or investigations arising from environmental matters that would have any material effect
on our business. We believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we
have obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise addressing) all necessary environmental permits to
conduct our business. Nevertheless, the failure to comply with present or future regulations could
result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, and cessation of our operations or
reduction in our customers’ acceptance of our products. These regulations could require us to alter
our current operations, to acquire significant equipment, or to incur substantial other expenses to
comply with environmental regulations. Our failure to control the use, sale, transport or disposal
of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities.



Employees

As of March 10, 2008, we had approximately 3,000 regular full-time employees.

Each of our employees is required to sign an agreement to maintain the confidentiality of
our proprietary information. All employees are required to sign an acknowledgement that they have
read and agree to abide by a statement of standards of business conduct. In the semiconductor and
semiconductor equipment industries, competition for highly skilled employees is intense. Our future
success depends, to a significant extent, upon our continued ability to attract and retain
qualified employees particularly in the R&D and customer support functions.

Competition

The semiconductor capital equipment industry is characterized by rapid change and is
highly competitive throughout the world. To compete effectively, we invest significant financial
resources to continue to strengthen and enhance our product and services portfolio and to maintain
customer service and support locations globally. Semiconductor manufacturers evaluate capital
equipment suppliers in many areas, including, but not limited to, process performance,
productivity, customer support, defect control, and overall cost of ownership, which can be
affected by many factors such as equipment design, reliability, software advancements, etc. Our
ability to succeed in the marketplace will depend upon our ability to maintain existing products
and introduce product enhancements and new products on a timely basis. In addition, semiconductor
manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate new capital equipment
into semiconductor production lines. As a result, once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a
particular supplier’s equipment and qualified it for production, the manufacturer generally
maintains that selection for that specific production application and technology node provided that
there is demonstrated performance to specification by the installed base. Accordingly, we may
experience difficulty in selling to a given customer if that customer has qualified a competitor’s
equipment. We must also continue to meet the expectations of our installed base of customers
through the delivery of high-quality and cost-efficient spare parts in the presence of third-party
spares provider competition. We face significant competition with all of our products and
services. Certain of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial
resources and larger engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support
organizations than we do. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and
performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes
with enhanced price/performance characteristics. If our competitors make acquisitions or enter into
strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers, or other entities, covering
products similar to those we sell, our ability to sell our products to those customers could be
adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the
future. Our primary competitors in the etch market are Tokyo Electron, Ltd. and Applied Materials,
Inc.

Patents and Licenses

Our policy is to seek patents on inventions relating to new or enhanced products and
processes developed as part of our ongoing research, engineering, manufacturing, and support
activities. We currently hold a number of United States and foreign patents covering various
aspects of our products and processes. We believe that the duration of our patents generally
exceeds the useful life of the technologies and processes disclosed and claimed therein. Our
patents, which cover material aspects of our past and present core products, have current durations
ranging from approximately 1 to 20 years. We believe that, although the patents we own and may
obtain in the future will be of value, they will not alone determine our success, which depends
principally upon our engineering, marketing, support, and delivery skills. However, in the absence
of patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to imitate our products,
manufacturing techniques, and processes. In addition, other companies and inventors may receive
patents that contain claims applicable or similar to our products and processes. The sale of
products covered by patents of others could require licenses that may not be available on terms
acceptable to us, or at all. For further discussion of legal matters, see Item 3, “Legal
Proceedings,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended June 24, 2007 (the
“2007 Form 10-K).

Recent Acquisitions

During the quarter ended December 24, 2006, we acquired the U.S. silicon growing and silicon
fabrication assets of Bullen Ultrasonics, Inc. We were the largest customer of the Bullen
Ultrasonics silicon business. The silicon business has become a division of Lam Research
post-acquisition.

The acquisition includes assets related to Bullen Ultrasonics’ silicon growing and
silicon fabrication business, including assets of Bullen Ultrasonics and Bullen Semiconductor
(Suzhou) Co., Ltd., a wholly foreign-owned enterprise established in Suzhou, Jiangsu, People’s
Republic of China (PRC). The closing of the U.S. asset acquisition occurred on November 13, 2006.
The acquisition of the Suzhou assets has not yet occurred as of the date of this filing. The assets
acquired consist of fixtures, intellectual property, equipment, inventory, material and supplies,
contracts relating to the conduct of the business, certain licenses and permits issued by
government authorities for use in connection with the operations of Eaton, Ohio and Suzhou
manufacturing facilities, real property and leaseholds connected with such facilities, data and
records related to the operation of the silicon growing and silicon fabrication business and
certain proprietary rights.

Pursuant to the First Amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement dated October 5, 2006,
the parties to the Asset Purchase Agreement agreed that the closing of the sale of the Suzhou
assets would take place within 5 business days following receipt by the parties of all necessary
approvals, consents and authorizations of governmental and provincial authorities in the PRC and
satisfaction of other customary conditions and covenants. We will pay the $2.5 million purchase
price for the Suzhou assets upon the receipt of the approvals and satisfaction of conditions noted
above.



The acquisition supports the competitive position and capability primarily of our
dielectric Etch products by providing access to and control of critical intellectual property and
manufacturing technology related to the production of silicon parts in our processing chambers. We
funded the purchase price of the acquisition with existing cash resources.

See the description of our acquisition of SEZ Holding AG under the heading “Subsequent
Events” in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations,” of this 2007 Form 10-K.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

In addition to the other information in this 2007 Form 10-K, the following risk factors
should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business because such factors may
significantly impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. As a result of these
risk factors, as well as other risks discussed in our other SEC filings, our actual results could
differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. No priority or
significance is intended, nor should be attached, to the order in which the risk factors appear.

The Results of Our Independent Committee Review of Our Historical Stock Option Practices and
Resulting Restatements May Continue to Have Adverse Effects on Our Financial Results.

The
review by a special committee of our Board of Directors consisting of
two independent Board members (the “Independent Committee”)
of our historical stock option practices and the resulting restatement of our historical financial
statements have required us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting,
legal, and other expenses during fiscal year 2008. The resulting restatements have had a material
adverse effect on our results of operations. We have restated our historical results of operations
to record additional non-cash, stock-based compensation expense of
$95.2 million in the aggregate for the periods
from fiscal 1997 to fiscal 2006 (excluding the impact of related payroll and income taxes). We
expect to amortize less than $0.1 million of compensation
expense under Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised),
“Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123R”) in periods
subsequent to fiscal year 2006 to properly account for previously issued stock options with deemed
incorrect measurement dates. Furthermore, to address potential adverse tax consequences certain of
our employees have incurred or may incur as a result of the issuance
and/or exercise of misdated stock options, we will take remedial
actions to make such employees, including our Chief Executive Officer
and other affected executive officers, whole
for any or all such additional tax liabilities currently estimated to
be in the range of approximately $50 million to $55 million. Such actions may cause us to incur additional cash or
noncash compensation expense. See the “Explanatory Note” immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and
Note 3, “Restatements of Consolidated Financial Statements,” to Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements of this 2007 Form 10-K for further discussion.

We May Be Subject to the Risks of Lawsuits in Connection With Our Historical Stock Option
Practices, the Resulting Restatements, and the Remedial Measures We Have Taken.

We, and our current and former directors and officers, may become the subject of government
inquiries, shareholder derivative and class action lawsuits and other legal proceedings relating to
our historical stock option practices and resulting restatements in the future. We have received a
letter from a stockholder demanding that our Board of Directors take certain actions, including
potentially legal action, in connection with our historical stock option practices, and threatening
to sue if our Board of Directors does not comply with the stockholder’s demands. Our Board of
Directors is currently reviewing the letter. We may also be subject to other kinds of lawsuits.
Should any of these events occur, they could require us to expend significant management time and
incur significant accounting, legal and other expenses. This could divert attention and resources
from the operation of our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations. In addition, the ultimate outcome of these potential actions could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the
trading price for our securities. Litigation may be time-consuming, expensive and disruptive to
normal business operations, and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict. The defense of
these potential lawsuits could result in significant expenditures.

Subject to certain limitations, we are obliged to indemnify our current and former directors,
officers and employees in connection with any government inquiry or litigation related to our
historical stock option practices that may arise. We currently hold insurance policies for the
benefit of our directors and officers, although there can be no assurance that the insurance would
cover all of the expenses that would be associated with any proceedings.

Judgment and Estimates Utilized by Us in Determining Stock Option Grant Dates and Related
Adjustments may be Subject to Change due to Subsequent SEC Guidance or Other Disclosure
Requirements.

In determining the restatement adjustments in connection with the stock option review,
management used all reasonably available relevant information to form conclusions it believes are
appropriate as to the most likely option granting actions that occurred, the dates when such
actions occurred, and the determination of grant dates for financial accounting purposes based on
when the requirements of the accounting standards were met. We considered various alternatives
throughout the course of the review and restatement, and we believe the approaches used were the
most appropriate, and that the choices of measurement dates used in our review of stock option
grant accounting and restatement of our financial statements were reasonable and appropriate in our
circumstances. However, the SEC may issue additional guidance on disclosure requirements related to
the financial impact of past stock option grant measurement date errors that may require us to
amend this filing or other filings with the SEC to provide additional disclosures pursuant to such
additional guidance. Any such circumstance could also lead to future delays in filing our
subsequent SEC reports and delisting of our Common Stock from the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
Furthermore, if we are subject to adverse findings in any of these matters, we could be required to
pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us which could harm our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.



We Have not Been in Compliance With SEC Reporting Requirements and NASDAQ Listing Requirements. If
We are Unable to Attain Compliance With, or Thereafter Remain in Compliance With SEC Reporting
Requirements and NASDAQ Listing Requirements, There may be a Material
Adverse Effect on Our
Business and Our Stockholders.

As a consequence of the Independent Committee review of our historical stock option practices
and resulting restatements of our financial statements, we have not been able to file our periodic
reports with the SEC on a timely basis and continue to face the possibility of delisting of our
stock from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. We have now filed this 2007 Form 10-K and we believe
that this filing, together with the expected filing of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as of and
for the quarter ended September 23, 2007 (the “First Quarter 2008 Form 10-Q”) and the Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q as of and for the quarter ended December 23, 2007 (the “Second Quarter 2008
Form 10-Q”) with the SEC will remediate the Company’s non-compliance with Marketplace Rule 4310(c)
(14), subject to the affirmative completion by the NASDAQ Stock Market Inc. (“NASDAQ”) of its
compliance protocols and its notification to the Company accordingly. However, if NASDAQ disagrees
with the Company’s position or if the SEC disagrees with the manner in which the financial impact
of past stock option grants have been accounted for and reported, or not reported, there could be
further delays in filing subsequent SEC reports or other actions that might result in delisting of
the Company’s Common Stock from the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

See the “Explanatory Note” immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 3, “Restatements of
Consolidated Financial Statements,” to Consolidated Financial Statements of this 2007 10-K for
further discussion. Until we have returned to full compliance with SEC reporting requirements and
NASDAQ listing requirements, the possibility of a NASDAQ delisting exists. If this happens, the
price of our stock and the ability of our stockholders to trade in our stock would be adversely
affected. In addition, we would be subject to a number of restrictions regarding the registration
of our stock under federal securities laws, and we would not be able to allow our employees to
exercise their outstanding options, which could adversely affect our business and results of
operations.

As
a result of the delayed filings of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended
September 23, 2007 and December 23, 2007, as well as of this 2007 Form 10-K, we will be ineligible to
register our securities on Form S-3 for sale by us or resale by others until one year from the date
the last delinquent filing is made. We may use Form S-1 to raise capital or complete acquisitions,
but doing so could increase transaction costs and adversely impact our ability to raise capital or
complete acquisitions of other companies in a timely manner.

It may be Difficult or More Costly to Obtain Director and Officer Liability Insurance Coverage as a
Result of Our Stock Option Restatement.

The issues arising from our restatement may make it more difficult to obtain director and
officer liability insurance coverage in the future. If we are able to obtain this coverage, it
could be significantly more costly than in the past, which could have an adverse effect on our
financial results and cash flow. If we are unable to secure appropriate director and officer
liability insurance coverage on reasonable terms, our directors and officers could face increased
risks of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties. In that event, we
believe we could have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified directors and officers, which
could adversely affect our business.

Our Quarterly Revenues and Operating Results Are Unpredictable

Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due
to a number of factors, not all of which are in our control. We manage our expense levels based in
part on our expectations of future revenues. If revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet
our expectations, our operating results may be adversely affected. Because our operating expenses
are based in part on anticipated future revenues, and a certain amount of those expenses are
relatively fixed, a change in the timing of recognition of revenue and/or the level of gross profit
from a single transaction can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter. Factors
that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include, but are not limited to:



Further, because a significant amount of our R&D and administrative operations and
capacity is located at our Fremont, California campus, natural, physical, logistical or other
events or disruptions affecting these facilities (including labor disruptions, earthquakes, and
power failures) could adversely impact our financial performance.

We Derive Our Revenues Primarily from a Relatively Small Number of High-Priced Systems

System sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue. Our systems can
typically range in price up to approximately $6 million per unit, and our revenues in any given
quarter are dependent upon the acceptance of a rather limited number of such systems. As a result,
the inability to declare revenue on even a few systems can cause a significant adverse impact on
our revenues for that quarter.

Variations in the Amount of Time it Takes for Our Customers to Accept Our Systems May Cause
Fluctuation in Our Operating Results

We generally recognize revenue for new system sales on the date of customer acceptance or
the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse. As a result, the fiscal period in
which we are able to recognize new systems revenues is typically subject to the length of time that
our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation,
which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate.

The Semiconductor Equipment Industry is Volatile and Reduced Product Demand Has a Negative Impact
on Shipments

Our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor
manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated
circuits and products using integrated circuits. The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature
and historically experiences periodic downturns. Business conditions historically have changed
rapidly and unpredictably.

Fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers could continue to
materially affect our aggregate shipments, revenues and operating results. Where appropriate, we
will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our
expenditures with anticipated revenue streams, which sometimes result in restructuring charges.
Even during periods of reduced revenues, we must continue to invest in research and development and
maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain
competitive, which may temporarily harm our financial results.

We Depend on New Products and Processes for Our Success. Consequently, We are Subject to Risks
Associated with Rapid Technological Change

Rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to
increased pressure to develop technological advances enabling such processes. We believe that our
future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved
capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products. If new products have reliability or
quality problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs,
delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses.
We may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully or new products that we
introduce may fail in the marketplace. Our failure to complete commercialization of these new
products in a timely manner could result in unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence, which
would adversely affect our financial results.

In order to develop new products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant
investments in R&D and to pursue joint development relationships with customers, suppliers or other
members of the industry. We must manage product transitions and joint development relationships
successfully, as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing
products. Moreover, future
technologies, processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete,
leaving us with non-competitive products, or obsolete inventory, or both.



We are Subject to Risks Relating to Product Concentration and Lack of Product Revenue
Diversification

We derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products, and
we expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near
term. Continued market acceptance of these products is, therefore, critical to our future success.
Our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could therefore be adversely
affected by:

In addition, the fact that we offer a more limited product line creates the risk that our
customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer
additional products as well. This may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with
certain customers. Such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated
with technology changes. Since we are primarily a provider of etch equipment, our business is
affected by our customers’ use of etching steps in their processes. Should technologies change so
that the manufacture of semiconductor chips requires fewer etching steps, this might have a larger
impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors.

We Have a Limited Number of Key Customers

Sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our
overall revenue, new orders and profitability. As a result, the actions of even one customer may
subject us to revenue swings that are difficult to predict. Similarly, significant portions of our
credit risk may, at any given time, be concentrated among a limited number of customers, so that
the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly
impact our financial results.

Strategic Alliances May Have Negative Effects on Our Business

Increasingly, semiconductor companies are entering into strategic alliances with one
another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies. Often, one
of the outcomes of such an alliance is the definition of a particular tool set for a certain
function or a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment. While
this could work to our advantage if Lam Research’s equipment becomes the basis for the function or
process, it could work to our disadvantage if a competitor’s tools or equipment become the standard
equipment for such function or process. In the latter case, even if Lam Research’s equipment was
previously used by a customer, that equipment may be displaced in current and future applications
by the tools standardized by the alliance.

Similarly, our customers may team with, or follow the lead of, educational or research
institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps. If
those institutions utilize a competitor’s equipment when they establish those processes, it is
likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing
lines. These actions could adversely impact our market share and subsequent business.

We are Dependent Upon a Limited Number of Key Suppliers

We obtain certain components and sub-assemblies included in our products from a single
supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We have established long-term contracts with many of
these suppliers. These long-term contracts can take a variety of forms. We may renew these
contracts periodically. In some cases, these suppliers sold us products during at least the last
four years, and we expect that we will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we
will otherwise replace them with competent alternative suppliers. However, several of our suppliers
are relatively new providers to us so that our experience with them and their performance is
limited. Where practical, our intent is to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that
the failure of any single supplier will adversely affect our business. Nevertheless, a prolonged
inability to obtain certain components could impair our ability to ship products, lower our
revenues and thus adversely affect our operating results and result in damage to our customer
relationships.



Our Outsource Providers May Fail to Perform as We Expect

Outsource providers have played and will play key roles in our manufacturing operations
and in many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology,
facilities management, and certain elements of our finance organization. Although we aim at
selecting reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written
contracts, it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect
and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business.

In addition, the expansive role of outsource providers has required and will continue to
require us to implement changes to our existing operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with
and manage the performance of these outsource providers. Any delay or failure in the implementation
of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely affect our customer relationships
and/or have a negative effect on our operating results.

Once a Semiconductor Manufacturer Commits to Purchase a Competitor’s Semiconductor Manufacturing
Equipment, the Manufacturer Typically Continues to Purchase that Competitor’s Equipment, Making it
More Difficult for Us to Sell Our Equipment to that Customer

Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate
wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line. We believe that once a
semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment, the manufacturer
generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application. Accordingly, we
expect it to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer initially selects a
competitor’s equipment.

We are Subject to Risks Associated with Our Competitors’ Strategic Relationships and Their
Introduction of New Products and We May Lack the Financial Resources or Technological Capabilities
of Certain of Our Competitors Needed to Capture Increased Market Share

We expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future competitors.
We believe that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours
and are planning to introduce new products, which may affect our ability to sell our existing
products. We face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading
semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this
could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers.

We believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to
offer a broad range of products, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to
invest in product and process R&D. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial
resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and
support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the
semiconductor equipment industry. These competitors may deeply discount or give away products
similar to those that we sell, challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar
accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products. For these reasons, we may fail
to continue to compete successfully worldwide.

In addition, our competitors may provide innovative technology that may have performance
advantages over systems we currently, or expect to, offer. They may be able to develop products
comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving
customer requirements. In particular, while we currently are developing additional product
enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely
manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements
successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive.
Accordingly, we may be unable to continue to compete in our markets, competition may intensify, or
future competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial
condition, and/or cash flows.

Our Future Success Depends on International Sales and the Management of Global Operations

Non-U.S. sales accounted for approximately 84% in fiscal year 2007, 86% in fiscal year
2006 and 84% in fiscal year 2005 of our total revenue. We expect that international sales will
continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in future years.

We are subject to various challenges related to the management of global operations, and
international sales are subject to risks including, but not limited to:



Certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the U.S.
Government. Our failure or inability to obtain such licenses would substantially limit our markets
and severely restrict our revenues. Many of the challenges noted above are applicable in China,
which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of
potential significant growth for our business. As the business volume between China and the rest of
the world grows, there is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships between China, Taiwan,
Japan, and the United States. Political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions
which would adversely affect our business with China and/or Taiwan and perhaps the entire Asia
region. A significant trade disruption in these areas could have a material, adverse impact on our
future revenue and profits.

We are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency
exchange rates. The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars except for
certain of our revenues in Japan that are denominated in Japanese yen, certain of our spares and
service contracts which are denominated in other currencies, and expenses related to our non-U.S.
sales and support offices which are denominated in these countries’ local currency.

We currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term
impact of the exchange rate fluctuations on Japanese yen-denominated assets and forecasted Japanese
yen-denominated revenue where we currently believe our primary exposure to currency rate
fluctuation lies and will continue to enter into hedging transactions, for the purposes outlined,
in the foreseeable future. However, these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect
because differences between the actual timing of customer acceptances and our forecasts of those
acceptances may leave us either over- or under-hedged on any given transaction. Moreover, by
hedging our yen-denominated assets with currency forward contracts, we may miss favorable currency
trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges. Additionally, we currently do
not enter into such forward contracts for currencies other than the yen, and we therefore are
subject to both favorable and unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact
business (including intercompany transactions) in other currencies.

Our Financial Results May be Adversely Impacted by Higher than Expected Tax Rates or Exposure to
Additional Income Tax Liabilities

As a global company, our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic
composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region. We are subject to
income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and significant judgment
is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities. Our effective tax rate could be adversely
affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates,
in the valuation of deferred tax assets, in tax laws or by material audit assessments, which could
affect our profitability. In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are
predominantly in the United States, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income
in the United States. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits
in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our
profitability.

A Failure to Comply with Environmental Regulations May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results

We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or
disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals. We believe that we are in general
compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise
addressing) all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business. These permits generally
relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes. Nevertheless, the failure to comply with present or
future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, cessation
of our operations or reduction in our customers’ acceptance of our products. These regulations
could require us to alter our current operations, to acquire significant equipment or to incur
substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Our failure to control the
use, sale, transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities.

If We are Unable to Adjust the Scale of Our Business in Response to Rapid Changes in Demand in the
Semiconductor Equipment Industry, Our Operating Results and Our Ability to Compete Successfully May
be Impaired

The business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry has historically been
characterized by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our management to adjust
spending and resources allocated to operating activities. During periods of rapid growth or decline
in demand for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate
financial and business controls, management processes, information systems and procedures and in
training, managing, and appropriately sizing our supply chain, our work force, and other components
of our business on a timely basis. Our success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability
of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to
these challenges effectively. If we do not adequately meet these challenges, our gross margins and
earnings may be impaired during periods of demand decline, and we may lack the infrastructure and
resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during
periods of demand growth.

If We Choose to Acquire or Dispose of Product Lines and Technologies, We May Encounter Unforeseen
Costs and Difficulties That Could Impair Our Financial Performance

An important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that
would complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, or
enhance our technological capabilities. As a result, we may make acquisitions of complementary
companies, products or technologies, such as our March 2008
acquisition of SEZ Holding AG, or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or
technologies that no longer fit our long-term strategies. Managing an acquired business, disposing
of product technologies or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks,
including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing
business or product groups,



diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns, amortization of acquired
intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed
operations among others. We anticipate that our recent acquisition of
SEZ will give rise to risks like these, as we integrate its
operations with ours. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage
successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of product lines or
technologies, or reduction in personnel or that our management, personnel, or systems will be
adequate to support continued operations. Any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a
material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.

In addition, any acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive
issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization
of related intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and/or the price of
our Common Stock.

The Market for Our Common Stock is Volatile, Which May Affect Our Ability to Raise Capital or Make
Acquisitions

The market price for our Common Stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over
the past years. The trading price of our Common Stock could continue to be highly volatile and
fluctuate widely in response to factors, including but not limited to the following:

In addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations.
Historically, we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our Common Stock due in part
to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for
semiconductors. These broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the
price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following
volatile periods in the price of stock, many companies became the object of securities class action
litigation. If we are sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs, and it
could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on the price for
our Common Stock.



We Rely Upon Certain Critical Information Systems for the Operation of Our Business

We maintain and rely upon certain critical Information Systems for the effective
operation of our business. These Information Systems include telecommunications, the internet, our
corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, network communications,
and e-mail. These Information Systems may be owned by us or by our outsource providers or even
third parties such as vendors and contractors and may be maintained by us or by such providers and
third parties. These Information Systems are subject to attacks, failures, and access denials from
a number of potential sources including viruses, destructive or inadequate code, power failures,
and physical damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines, and networking equipment. To
the extent that these Information Systems are under our control, we have implemented security
procedures, such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes, to address the
outlined risks. However, security procedures for Information Systems cannot be guaranteed to be
failsafe and our inability to use or access these Information Systems at critical points in time
could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business.

Intellectual Property and Other Claims Against Us Can be Costly and Could Result in the Loss of
Significant Rights Which are Necessary to Our Continued Business and Profitability

Third parties may assert infringement, unfair competition or other claims against us.
From time to time, other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent
or other intellectual property rights. In addition, our Bylaws and indemnity obligations provide
that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal
proceedings resulting from their service to Lam Research. In such cases, it is our policy either to
defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms.
However, we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other
settlements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and any litigation resulting from these
claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results.
Moreover, although we seek to obtain insurance to protect us from claims and cover losses to our
property, there is no guarantee that such insurance will fully indemnify us for any losses that we
may incur.

We May Fail to Protect Our Proprietary Technology Rights, Which Could Affect Our Business

Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology. While we attempt to protect
our proprietary technology through patents, copyrights and trade secret protection, we believe that
our success also depends on increasing our technological expertise, continuing our development of
new systems, increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base, and providing
comprehensive support and service to our customers. However, we may be unable to protect our
technology in all instances, or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology
independently. We currently hold a number of United States and foreign patents and pending patent
applications. However, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any
patents the United States or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue
patents for pending applications. In addition, the rights granted or anticipated under any of these
patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or, in fact provide no
competitive advantages.

We are Subject to the Internal Control Evaluation and Attestation Requirements of Section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include in
our annual report our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting and our audited financial statements as of the end of each fiscal year. Furthermore, our
independent registered public accounting firm (the “Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm” or the “Firm”)
is required to report on whether it believes we maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year. We have successfully
completed our assessment and obtained our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm’s
attestation as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 24,
2007. In future years, if we fail to timely complete this assessment, or if our Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm cannot timely attest to our assessment, we could be subject to
regulatory sanctions and a loss of public confidence in our internal control. In addition, any
failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their
implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to timely meet our regulatory
reporting obligations.

Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Must Confirm Its Independence in Order for Us to
Meet Our Regulatory Reporting Obligations on a Timely Basis

Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm communicates with us at least annually
regarding any relationships between the Firm and Lam Research that, in the Firm’s professional
judgment, might have a bearing on the Firm’s independence with respect to us. If, for whatever
reason, our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm finds that it cannot confirm that it is
independent of Lam Research based on existing securities laws and registered public accounting firm
independence standards, we could experience delays or other failures to meet our regulatory
reporting obligations.

Item 2.

Properties

Our executive offices and principal operating and R&D facilities are located in Fremont,
California, and are held under operating leases expiring from fiscal years 2008 to 2014. These
leases generally include options to renew or purchase the facilities. Please see additional
information under the heading “Subsequent Events” in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of this 2007 Form 10-K regarding renewal of
these leases and entry into additional leases. In addition, we lease properties for our service,
technical support and sales personnel throughout the United States, Europe, Taiwan, Korea, Japan,
and Asia Pacific and own a manufacturing facility located in Eaton, Ohio. Our fiscal year 2007
rental payments for the space occupied during that period aggregated approximately $11 million. Our
facilities lease obligations are subject to periodic increases, and we believe that our existing
facilities are well-maintained and in good operating condition.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

From time to time, we have received notices from third parties alleging infringement of
such parties’ patent or other intellectual property rights by our products. In such cases it is our
policy to defend the claims, or if considered appropriate, negotiate licenses on commercially
reasonable terms. However, no assurance can be given that we will be able to negotiate necessary
licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any litigation resulting from such
claims would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity,
operating results, or our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

Item 5.

Market for the Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases
of Equity Securities

The information required by this Item with respect to the market price of the Company’s
Common Stock, number of holders thereof, and payment of dividends is incorporated by reference from
Item 6, “Selected Financial Data”, below.

In October 2004, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase
of up to $250 million of our Common Stock from the public market or in private purchases. The terms
of the repurchase program permitted us to repurchase shares through September 30, 2007. In August
2005, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of an additional $500
million of our Common Stock from the public market or private purchase. The terms of the repurchase
program permitted us to repurchase shares through September 30, 2008. In February 2007, we
announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to an additional
$750 million of our Common Stock from the public market or private purchase. The terms of the
repurchase program permitted us to repurchase shares at a pace determined by management. We
completed the repurchase of all amounts available under our share repurchase authorizations during
the quarter ended June 24, 2007. Share repurchases under the authorizations were as follows:

Restructuring charges, net exclude restructuring charges (recoveries)
included in cost of goods sold and reflected in gross margin of $(1.7) million
and $(1.0) million for fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively. Restructuring
amounts included in cost of goods sold and reflected in gross margin primarily
relate to the write-off of selected, older product line inventories in
connection with our restructuring plans and partial recovery of the charges
from the subsequent sale of a portion of such inventories. These restructuring
charges/(recoveries) are included as a component of cost of goods sold in
accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force 96-9, “Classification of Inventory
Markdowns and Other Costs Associated with a Restructuring” (EITF 96-9). There
were no restructuring charges or recoveries included in cost of goods sold in
fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005. Fiscal year 2005 restructuring charges
consist only of additional liabilities related to prior restructuring plans.

(2)

Operating income during the fiscal years ended June 24, 2007 and June 25,
2006 includes $35.6 million and $24.0 million, respectively, of equity-based
compensation expense as a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment” at the beginning of fiscal
year 2006.

(3)

Diluted net income per share for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2004
includes the assumed conversion of the convertible subordinated 4% notes.
Accordingly, interest expense, net of taxes, of $3.2 million has been added
back to net income for computing diluted earnings per share.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains
forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition,
significance, value and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated
in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to
those discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this 2007

Form 10-K

and other documents we file
from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See “Cautionary Statement Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this 2007

Form 10-K

).

The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced
periodic downturns and upturns. Today’s leading indicators of changes in customer investment
patterns may not be any more reliable than in prior years. Demand for our equipment can vary
significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to,
economic conditions (generally and in the semiconductor industry), supply, demand, and prices for
semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and our ability to develop and market competitive
products. For these and other reasons, our results of operations for fiscal years 2007, 2006, and
2005 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(MD&A) provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with
our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in this 2007 Form 10-K. MD&A consists of the following sections:

Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements

In this 2007 Form 10-K, the Company is restating its consolidated balance sheet as of June 25,
2006 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
for the years ended June 25, 2006 and June 26, 2005 as a result of determinations from a voluntary
independent stock option review conducted by the Independent Committee. The Company also recorded
adjustments affecting previously-reported financial statements for fiscal years 1997 through 2004,
the effects of which are summarized in cumulative adjustments to additional paid-in capital,
deferred stock-based compensation, and retained earnings as of June 27, 2004. This restatement is
also described in the Explanatory Note to this 2007 10-K, immediately preceding Part I Item I and
in Note 3, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements”, to Consolidated Financial
Statements. This 2007 Form 10-K also reflects the restatement of “Selected Financial
Data” in Item 6 for the years ended June 25, 2006, June 26, 2005, June 27, 2004 and June 29, 2003.
In addition, the Company is restating the unaudited quarterly condensed financial statements for
interim periods of fiscal year 2006, and unaudited condensed balance sheets as of March 25, 2007,
December 24, 2006 and September 24, 2006. There was no effect of the restatement on the
consolidated statements of operations for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2007.

Financial information included in the reports on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filed or
furnished by Lam Research prior to January 24, 2008, and the related opinions of its Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm and all earnings press releases and similar communications issued
by the Company prior to January 24, 2008 are superseded in their entirety by this 2007 Form 10-K
and other reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on or after January 24, 2008.

Independent Committee Review

On July 18, 2007, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had initiated a voluntary
independent review regarding the timing of and accounting for the Company’s past stock option
grants and other related issues. The voluntary internal review arose after the Company’s
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm performed auditing procedures relating to the
Company’s historical stock option grant programs and procedures as part of the firm’s fiscal
year-end 2007 audit. The Board of Directors appointed a special committee consisting of two
independent board members (the “Independent Committee”) to conduct a comprehensive review of the
Company’s historical stock option practices. The Independent Committee promptly engaged independent
outside legal counsel and forensic accountants to assist with the review. On December 21, 2007,
the Company announced that the Independent Committee had reached a preliminary conclusion that the
actual measurement dates for financial accounting purposes of certain stock option grants issued in
the past differed from the recorded grant dates of such awards. Upon the recommendation of
management and the Independent Committee, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors concluded
that the financial statements for fiscal years 1997 through 2005, and the interim periods contained
therein should no longer be relied
upon. The Independent Committee’s review was completed in February 2008.



Scope of the Independent Committee Review

The review covered stock option grants awarded in fiscal years 1997 through 2005 (the “Review
Period”). The scope of the review included evaluating 100% of “Company-wide” grants, director
grants, Section 16 officer grants, and new hire grants, as well
as a sampling of grants deemed
“other grants”, representing approximately 94% of all stock option grants during the Review Period.
This Review Period comprised approximately 16,000 separate stock option grants on approximately 500
separately recorded grant dates. These grants involved approximately 58 million underlying shares
of Common Stock and included grants to domestic and international
employees. Share amount have been adjusted as applicable to reflect
the March 2000 3-for-1 stock split. The Independent
Committee’s review also included procedures to identify
potential modifications of stock option grants, and grants awarded to consultants, and testing of cash exercises. The Company had not awarded any
Company-wide stock option grants since October 2002 and stopped issuing stock option grants during
fiscal year 2005 and only issued restricted stock units
(“RSUs”) thereafter.
The Independent Committee did not include fiscal years 2006 and 2007 in the scope of its review
based on several factors including but not limited to the fact that
the Company only issued RSUs
after fiscal year 2005 and the Company’s equity granting processes and controls had been documented
and tested as part of its assessment of the operating effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Additionally, no
information arose during the stock option review that would indicate a need to expand the scope of
the review to include other periods.

The Independent Committee’s review included the collection and processing of over 3.5 million
electronic documents, which included hard drives and network share drives of numerous individuals,
the Company’s network servers, and backup tapes. The Independent Committee’s advisors also
collected and reviewed hard copy documents from numerous sources and conducted 61 interviews of 47
individuals, predominantly current or former directors, officers and employees of the Company.

Stock Option Review Results

Consistent with applicable accounting literature and guidance from the SEC staff, the Company
organized the grants during the review period into categories based on the grant type and the
process by which the grant was finalized. The Company analyzed the evidence from the Independent
Committee’s review related to each category including, but not limited to, physical documents,
electronic documents, and underlying electronic data about documents. Based on the relevant facts
and circumstances, the Company applied the applicable accounting standards to determine, for
grants within each category, the proper measurement date. If the measurement date was not the
originally recorded grant date, accounting adjustments were made as required, in some cases
resulting in stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects. The significant majority of
the measurement date changes result from stock options granted prior to fiscal year 2003. As a
result of the findings of the review, the Company has recognized incremental stock-based
compensation and associated payroll tax expense of $96.4 million on a pre-tax basis ($65.8 million
after taxes) in the aggregate during fiscal years 1997 through 2006
which includes incremental stock-based
compensation expense of $1.2 million recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 123R during fiscal year
2006.

The
Independent Committee also concluded that there was no intentional misconduct on the part
of Company management or the Company’s independent directors. During its review of the Company’s
historical stock option practices, the Independent Committee did not find evidence of any other
financial reporting or accounting issues unrelated to stock-based compensation.

Company-wide Grants

Company-wide grants were awarded on ten dates during the Review Period, and are associated
with approximately half of the shares underlying option grants encompassed in the review. These
ten dates include grants issued on six dates for broad-based and primarily discretionary grants
(“focal grants”), two grant dates that were formula-based grants (“supplemental grants”) and two
grant dates designed to address certain previously granted stock options for which the exercise
price was higher than the then-current fair value of the Company’s Common Stock (“cancel and
replace grants”). As a result of its review, the Company determined that the actual measurement
dates for certain stock option grants differed from the recorded grant dates. The Company
determined that the actual measurement date, meaning when the required actions necessary to grant
the option were completed, including the determination of the number of shares underlying the
options to be granted to each employee and the exercise price, was the correct measurement date to
determine what, if any stock-based compensation was appropriate. Any intrinsic value of the
options on the measurement date, measured as the difference between the stated exercise price and
the market price, has been recorded as compensation expense during the periods when employees were
providing services in exchange for the options.

With respect to the focal grants, the Company concluded that a process to determine the total
number of shares underlying the options, grant date and exercise price generally commenced prior to
the recorded grant date, but that in certain cases the specific allocation of those shares among
the various option recipients was not finalized until after the original recorded grant date. To
address these circumstances, the Company has revised the measurement date for accounting purposes
for these option grants to a date after the original grant date, when the
allocation of the shares was first known to be finalized. The Company has recognized
stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of $61.2 million on a pre-tax basis as a
result of these revised measurement dates.



With respect to the supplemental grants, the Company determined that the
general formula for determining the number of shares underlying the option grant to which each
recipient would be entitled was not sufficiently finalized for accounting purposes at the
original recorded grant date. To address these circumstances, the Company has revised the
measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to the date when this formula was first
known to be finalized. The Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense, net of
forfeitures, of $5.6 million on a pre-tax basis as a result of these revised measurement dates.

The cancel and replace grants involved recipients electing to exchange certain stock options,
for which the exercise price was higher than the then-current fair value of the Company’s Common
Stock, in return for a new grant of options. The Company determined that in both instances, the
election deadline was after the recorded grant date. The measurement date should have been the
later of the recorded grant date or the date of election because the elections were revocable up to
the last day of the offer period. To address these circumstances, the Company has revised the
measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to the last possible date of election.
The Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of $0.2 million on
a pre-tax basis as a result of these revised measurement dates.

Grants to Directors and Section 16 Officers

Director grants were awarded on ten dates during the stock option review period. Grants to
directors were typically governed by the requirements of the underlying stock option plan
documents, as grant dates and amounts were typically fixed by the respective stock option plan.
There were instances when the grant dates were not consistent with
dates fixed by the respective stock option plan. In all instances the
grant date was within 1 to 3 days of the dates provided by the plan.
To address these circumstances, the Company has revised the measurement date for
accounting purposes for these grants to the date as required by the stock option plan. The Company
has recognized stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of $2.8 million on a pre-tax
basis as a result of the revised measurement dates.

Section 16 officer grants were awarded on 23 grant dates during the stock option review
period. The Company determined that the actual measurement date, meaning when the required actions
necessary to grant the option were completed, including the determination of the number of shares underlying the options
to be granted to each employee and the exercise price, was the correct measurement date to
determine the market price of the option shares. Any intrinsic value of the options on the
measurement date, measured as the difference between the stated exercise price and the market
price, has been recorded as compensation expense during the periods when employees were providing
services in exchange for the options. In instances where the original recorded grant date was not
consistent with the correct measurement date, the Company has revised the measurement date for
accounting purposes for these grants to a date after the original grant date, when the number of
shares underlying the options to be granted to each employee and the exercise price were first
known to be finalized. The Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense, net of
forfeitures, of $1.0 million on a pre-tax basis as a result of the revised measurement dates.
Additionally, it was determined that for one grant the recorded grant price was based on an average
of closing prices of the Company’s stock immediately prior to the grant date. The option plan
under which this option was granted allowed for similar pricing. To address this circumstance the
Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense of $2.1 million on a pre-tax basis for this
grant, which was equal to the difference between the closing price of the stock on the date of
grant and the originally recorded grant exercise price.

Grants to Consultant

The Company concluded that six granting actions to a non-employee consultant were incorrectly
accounted for as employee as opposed to non-employee stock awards. To address this circumstance,
the Company has recognized a stock-based compensation expense of $3.2 million on a pre-tax basis
under “fair value” accounting in accordance with the requirements of EITF Issue No. 96-18,
“Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other than Employees for Acquiring or in
Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services”.

Grants to New Hires

New hire grants were generally approved prior to the employee’s hire date and granted as of
the last day of the month of hire prior to calendar year 1999 and on the first day of the
individual’s employment with the Company beginning in calendar year 1999. In instances where
approval was not evidenced on or before the original recorded grant date, the Company has revised
the measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to a date after the original grant
date, when the required approval was first evidenced, but not before the employee’s hire date. The
Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of $1.7 million on a
pre-tax basis as a result of these revised measurement dates.



Other Grants

For the remaining population reviewed of stock options granted during the stock option review
period, the Company has concluded that certain actual measurement dates differed from the recorded
grant dates primarily due to a lack of contemporaneous documentation evidencing approval as of the
original recorded grant date. In these circumstances, the Company has revised the measurement date
for accounting purposes for these grants to a date after the original grant date, when the shares
underlying the options to be granted to each employee and the exercise price were first known to be finalized. The primary issue with these grants was that there was insufficient evidence to conclude
that the specific allocation of those shares among the various grant recipients was finalized at the
original recorded grant date. To address these circumstances, the Company has revised the
measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to a date after the original grant date,
when the allocation of the shares underlying the options and exercise price was first known to be
finalized. The Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of
$8.2 million on a pre-tax basis as a result of these revised measurement dates.

Deemed Modifications to Stock Option Grants Connected with Terminations or Leaves of
Absences

Compensation expense was also recognized as a result of deemed modifications to certain
employee stock option grant awards in connection with certain employees’ terminations or leaves of
absence. Typically such modifications related to extensions of the time employees could exercise
options following their termination of employment or that enabled the employee to vest in
additional shares in relation to a leave of absence or subsequent to their termination, thus
triggering a new measurement date under the accounting literature applicable at that time. The
Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of $9.2 million on a
pre-tax basis as a result of these new measurement dates.

Use of Judgment

The Company evaluated all available evidence for each individual grant within the scope of the
independent review and the revised measurement dates represent the earliest date when the terms of
the options granted to individual recipients were known with finality. The proposed measurement
date for certain grants could not be determined with certainty based on available evidence. In
light of the judgment used in establishing the measurement dates, alternate approaches to those
used by the Company could have resulted in different stock-based compensation expense than that
recorded by the Company in the restatements. While the Company has considered these alternative
approaches, it believes its approach is the most appropriate under the circumstances.

The Company prepared a sensitivity analysis to determine the hypothetical minimum and maximum
compensation expense charge that it might have recorded for these grants if it had used different
judgments to determine the revised measurement dates. The Company applied its sensitivity
methodology on a grant date by grant date basis to examine the largest hypothetical variations in
stock-based compensation expense within a reasonable range of possible measurement dates for each
grant event.

After developing the range for each grant event included in the Company’s sensitivity
analysis, the Company selected the highest and lowest closing sale price of its Common Stock within
the date range to determine the range of potential compensation expense adjustments for the grants.
The Company then compared these aggregated amounts to the stock-based compensation expense that it
recorded for the stock option grants analyzed. If the Company had used the highest closing sale
price of its Common Stock within the date range for these grant events, its stock-based
compensation expense adjustment relating to these grants would have increased, net of forfeitures,
by approximately $30 million on a pre-tax basis. Conversely, had the Company used the lowest
closing sale price of its Common Stock within the date range for the grants analyzed, its
stock-based compensation expense adjustment relating to these grants would have decreased, net of
forfeitures, by approximately $26 million on a pre-tax basis. Substantially all of the
hypothetical increases or decreases of stock-based compensation expense resulting from the
Company’s sensitivity analysis relates to periods prior to fiscal 2005.

Findings and Recommendations of the Independent Committee

As a result of its review, the Independent Committee identified certain deficiencies relating
to the Company’s historical practices and accounting with respect to stock options, including the
following areas:

As a result of the deficiencies identified, the Independent Committee developed
recommendations targeted at strengthening the Company’s processes with respect to equity
compensation and relating accounting. These recommendations were presented to the Board of
Directors on February 1, 2008 and include the areas of: approval authority for equity compensation
awards; oversight and administration of the awards process; coordination among relevant
departments; training with respect to equity compensation; and record-keeping. The Company is
currently reviewing all of the Independent Committee’s recommendations as well as a potential
timetable for implementation, but the Company believes that the substance of many of the
recommendations of the Independent Committee have already been incorporated into the Company’s
current equity compensation processes. This belief is consistent with the determination by
the Independent Committee and the Company that the granting of RSUs after fiscal year 2005 was not
within the scope of the Independent Committee review in part due to the documentation and testing
required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.



The Independent Committee concluded that there was no intentional misconduct on the part of
Company management or the Company’s independent directors.

Effect of Restatement on Consolidated Financial Statements

The Company previously applied Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees”, and its related interpretations and provided the required pro forma
disclosures under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation”, through its fiscal year ended June 26, 2005. Under APB Opinion No. 25, a
non-cash, stock-based compensation expense was required to be recognized for any option for which
the exercise price was below the market price on the actual measurement date. Because certain of
the Company’s options were assessed as having an exercise price below the market price on the
actual measurement date based on the Company’s revised measurement dates as a result of the stock
option review as more fully described above, there is a non-cash deferred compensation charge for
each of these options under APB Opinion No. 25 equal to the number of shares underlying the
options, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price and the market price on the actual
measurement date. That deferred compensation expense is amortized over the vesting period of the
option. The Company also recorded compensation expense under “fair value” accounting when
applicable, for example, for the grants to the nonemployee consultant noted above.

Commencing in its fiscal year ended June 25, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R),
“Share-Based Payment”. As a result, beginning in fiscal year 2006, the additional stock-based
compensation expense required to be recorded for each option with a revised measurement date, as
more fully described above, is equal to the fair value of the option on revised measurement date,
amortized over the remaining service period of the option. The Company did not record these
stock-based compensation expenses under APB Opinion No. 25 nor SFAS No. 123(R) related to its
options based on the revised measurement dates in the Company’s previously issued financial
statements, and that is why the Company is restating them in this filing. The Company restated its
historical results of operations to record additional pre-tax, non-cash, stock-based compensation
expense of (a) $94.0 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997 through June 26, 2005 under
APB Opinion No. 25 and other applicable accounting rules, and (b) $1.2 million for the year ended
June 25, 2006 under SFAS No. 123(R). As of June 25, 2006, there was less than $0.1 million of
remaining compensation expense to be recorded under SFAS No. 123(R) for stock options with revised
measurement dates. In addition the Company recorded pre-tax payroll related tax expenses of $1.2
million through June 25, 2006.

Diluted shares in fiscal years 2005 and 2006 also increased as a result of the adjustments for
stock options with revised measurement dates. The Company uses the treasury stock method to
calculate the weighted-average shares used in the diluted EPS calculation. As part of the
restatement, the Company revised its treasury stock calculations in accordance with SFAS No. 128,
“Earnings Per Share”. These calculations assume that (i) all dilutive options with revised
measurement dates are exercised, (ii) the Company repurchases shares with the proceeds of these
hypothetical exercises along with the tax benefit resulting from the hypothetical exercises, and
(iii) any average unamortized deferred stock-based compensation is also used to repurchase shares.

As described for each element above, the Company evaluated the impact of the restatements on
its global tax provision. As a result, we recorded a cumulative tax benefit of $30.6 million
through June 25, 2006. The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in multiple tax
jurisdictions around the world. In certain jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, the United
States, the Company is able to claim a tax deduction relative to stock options. In those
jurisdictions, where a tax deduction is claimed, the Company has recorded deferred tax assets,
totaling $6.2 million at June 25, 2006, to reflect future tax deductions to the extent the Company
believes such assets to be recoverable. Based on this review, the Company now believes that it
should not have taken a United States tax deduction in prior years for stock option related amounts
pertaining to certain executives under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 162(m). Section 162(m)
limits the deductibility of compensation above certain thresholds. As a result, the Company’s tax
carryforward attributes have decreased by approximately $14.6 million as of June 25, 2006.

For those stock option grants determined to have incorrect measurement dates for accounting
purposes and that had been originally issued as incentive stock options, or ISOs, the Company
recorded a liability for payroll tax contingencies in the event such grants would not be respected
as ISOs under the principles of the IRC and the regulations therein. The Company recorded expense
and accrued liabilities for certain foreign payroll tax contingencies. The total payroll tax
accrual was approximately $1.2 million for annual periods from our fiscal year 1997 through fiscal
year 2006. This cumulative expense resulted from payroll tax expense recorded in prior periods has
been partially offset by benefits relating to the expiration of the related statute of limitations.

As a result of the restatement, the cumulative effect of the related after-tax expenses for
the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997 through June 25, 2006 was $65.8 million, as compared to $96.4
million in pre-tax charges as previously discussed. These additional stock-based compensation and
other expenses had no effect on the Company’s reported revenue, cash, cash equivalents or
short-term investments for each of the restated periods. The Company has also restated the pro forma
amortization of deferred stock-based employee compensation included in reported net income, net of
tax, and total stock-based employee compensation expenses determined under fair value based method,
net of tax,
under SFAS No. 123 in Note 14, “Equity-Based Compensation Plans” to Consolidated Financial
Statements to reflect the effect of the stock-based compensation expense resulting from the
correction of these past stock option grants.



As a result of the determinations from a voluntary independent stock option review, the Company
considered the application of Section 409A of the IRC to certain stock option grants where, under
APB No. 25, intrinsic value existed at the time of grant. In the event such stock option grants are
not considered as issued at fair market value at the original grant date under the IRC and
applicable regulations thereunder, these options are subject to Section 409A. On March 30, 2008,
the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the Company to assume the liability of any and all
employees, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and certain executive officers, with
options subject to Section 409A. The liability is currently
estimated to be in the range of approximately $50 million to
$55 million. The determinations from the voluntary independent stock option review are more fully
described in Note 3, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” to Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations” in Item 7 of the Company’s 2007 Form 10-K.

As a result of these adjustments, the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and
related disclosures as of June 25, 2006 and for each of the two years in the period ended June 25,
2006 have been restated. The Company also recorded adjustments affecting previously-reported
financial statements for fiscal years 1996 through 2004, the effects of which are summarized in
cumulative adjustments to additional paid-in capital, deferred stock-based compensation, and
retained earnings as of June 27, 2004.

Late SEC Filings and NASDAQ Delisting Proceedings

On August 27, 2007, the Company received a NASDAQ Staff Determination letter stating that, as
a result of the delayed filing of its 2007 Form 10-K, the Company was not in compliance with the
filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) and was
therefore subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. On November 7, 2007, the
Company received an additional letter from NASDAQ of similar substance related to its First Quarter
2008 Form 10-Q. On January 14, 2008, the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel granted the Company’s
request for continued listing, provided that it filed a written summary of the Independent
Committee’s findings with NASDAQ, as well as the 2007 Form 10-K and First Quarter 2008 Form 10-Q on
or before February 13, 2007. On February 5, 2008, the Company received an additional letter from
NASDAQ stating that, as a result of the delayed filing of its Second Quarter 2008 Form 10-Q, the
Company was not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in
Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) and was therefore subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Global Select
Market. On February 8, 2008, the Company received a notice from the NASDAQ Listing and Hearings
Review Council that advised the Company that any delisting determination by the NASDAQ Listing
Qualifications Panel had been stayed pending further review by the Review Council. The Company was
given until March 28, 2008 to submit additional information to assist the Review Council in its
assessment of the Company’s listing status. On February 12, 2008, the Company filed a written
summary of the Independent Committee’s findings with NASDAQ. The Company believes that the filing
of this 2007 Form 10-K, together with the expected filing of the First Quarter 2008 Form 10-Q and
the Second Quarter 2008 Form 10-Q, with the SEC will remediate the Company’s non-compliance with
Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14), subject to NASDAQ’s affirmative completion of its compliance
protocols and its notification to the Company accordingly. However, if NASDAQ disagrees with the
Company’s position or if the SEC disagrees with the manner in which the financial effect of past
stock option grants have been accounted for and reported, or not reported, there could be further
delays in filing subsequent SEC reports or other actions that might result in delisting of the
Company’s Common Stock from the NASDAQ Global Select Market.



Costs of Restatement and Legal Activities

During the first two quarters of fiscal year 2008, the Company incurred expenses totaling
approximately $9.5 million for legal, accounting, tax and other professional services in connection
with the Independent Committee’s review, the Company’s own internal review and recertification
procedures, the preparation of the June 24, 2007 consolidated financial statements and the restated
consolidated financial statements. There were no such expenses incurred as a result of the stock
option review during fiscal year 2007.

Shareholder Litigation Relating to Historical Stock Option Practices

We, and our current and former directors and officers, may become the subject of government
inquiries, shareholder derivative and class action lawsuits and other legal proceedings relating to
our historical stock option practices and resulting restatements in the future. We have received a
letter from a stockholder demanding that our Board of Directors take certain actions, including
potentially legal action, in connection with our historical stock option practices, and threatening
to sue if our Board of Directors does not comply with the stockholder’s demands. Our Board of
Directors is currently reviewing the letter. We may also be subject to other kinds of lawsuits.
Should any of these events occur, they could require us to expend significant management time and
incur significant accounting, legal and other expenses. This could divert attention and resources
from the operation of our business and adversely affects our financial condition and results of
operations. In addition, the ultimate outcome of these potential actions could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the
trading price for our securities. Litigation may be time-consuming, expensive and disruptive to
normal business operations, and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict. The defense of
these potential lawsuits could result in significant expenditures.



Executive Summary

We design, manufacture, market, and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the
fabrication of integrated circuits and are recognized as a major provider of such equipment to the
worldwide semiconductor industry. Semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process
steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits. We leverage
our expertise in these areas to develop integrated processing solutions that typically benefit our
customers through reduced cost, lower defect rates, enhanced yields, or faster processing time.

The following summarizes certain key quarterly and annual financial information for the
periods indicated below (in thousands, except per share data and percentages) and demonstrates the
strength of our performance throughout fiscal year 2007:

Our demonstrated performance and our business model, which utilizes the capabilities of
outsource providers, enables us to focus on new and existing product development, sales and
marketing, and customer support. We are executing to the near-term production requirements of our
customers, targeted to expand our leadership position in etch, leverage our etch expertise into
adjacent markets and meet our objective of delivering best-in-class financial performance over the
long term.

Fiscal year 2007 shipments were approximately $2.6 billion. Fiscal year 2007 revenues
increased 56% compared to fiscal year 2006 revenues reflecting the increase in customer demand
which we believe included market share gains in both the dielectric and conductor product segments
of the etch market, with positive revenue momentum in all regions.

Gross margin as a percent of revenues remained greater than 50% for the third consecutive year
and increased sequentially to 50.8% compared to fiscal year 2006 gross margin of 50.4%.

Our fiscal 2007 performance is demonstrated by the significant increase in operating margin to
30.3% compared with 24.6% in fiscal year 2006, a sequential increase of 92% compared to the 56%
growth in revenue. Total operating expenses increased 25% during fiscal year 2007 compared to
fiscal year 2006, driven by discretionary investments related to our multi-product and adjacent
market expansion plans. These investments included increased compensation costs as we expanded our
headcount to support our growth plans during fiscal year 2007 by more than 20% to approximately
2,900 employees. Incentive-based compensation levels grew consistent with our strong performance
in profitability and share price. We also invested in discretionary spending on supplies and
materials to support our new product development and customer evaluation activities.

Equity-based compensation expense recognized during fiscal year 2007 in cost of goods sold and
operating expenses was $6.4 million and $29.1 million, respectively compared to $5.4 million and
$18.6 million, respectively, in the prior year. The fiscal year 2007 increase reflects the
addition of our 2007 restricted stock unit focal grant which was awarded at a higher stock price
than the prior year focal grant.

Worthy of note is the growth in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal year 2007
which more than doubled from fiscal year 2006 performance to $823.6 million representing
approximately 32% of revenues, an increase of 124.2% sequentially.

year 2007 as Memory at approximately 73%, Foundry at 15%, and IDM Logic/Other at 12%.

Unshipped orders in backlog as of June 24, 2007 were approximately $642.6 million. The basis
for recording new orders is defined in our backlog policy. Our unshipped orders backlog includes
orders for systems, spares, and services where written customer requests have been
accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next
12 months. Our policy is to revise our backlog for
order cancellations and to make adjustments to
reflect, among other things, spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes. Please

The increase in revenues during fiscal years 2007 and 2006 reflected an improved market
environment which was evidenced by expanded levels of capital investments by semiconductor
manufacturers and our market share expansion. We believe we gained market share in both the
dielectric and conductor product segments of the etch market over this period, with strong revenue
performance in Taiwan, China, North America, and Korea during fiscal year 2007 and in Japan and
Korea during fiscal year 2006. The increase in revenues was correlated to the amount of shipments
and our installation and acceptance timelines. The overall Asia region continued to account for a
significant portion of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for
semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in that region. Our deferred revenue balance
increased to $295.5 million as of June 24, 2007 compared to $229.7 million as of June 25, 2006, as
shipments outpaced revenues during fiscal year 2007. The anticipated future revenue value of
orders shipped from backlog to Japanese customers that are not recorded as deferred revenue was
approximately $51 million as of June 24, 2007; these shipments are classified as inventory at cost
until title transfers.

Gross margin as a percent of revenue during fiscal year 2007 remained greater than 50% for the
third consecutive year and increased sequentially to 50.8% for fiscal year 2007. The increase in
gross margin as a percent of revenue for fiscal year 2007 compared with fiscal year 2006 was
primarily driven by improved utilization of factory and field resources on higher business volumes
partially offset by product and customer mix and implementation of a targeted consumable spare
parts price-reduction strategy focused on preserving and building market share and strengthening
customer trust in our efforts to support their cost-reduction roadmaps.

The decrease in gross margin as a percent of revenue during fiscal year 2006 compared with
fiscal year 2005 was affected by the inclusion of equity-based compensation as a result of the
adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based
Payment” (SFAS No. 123R) of $5 million, or 0.3%. The impact of unfavorable product mix was
generally offset by improved installation and warranty performance, and improved factory
utilization which was facilitated by higher volumes.

We continue to invest significantly in research and development focused on leading-edge plasma
etch and our portfolio of new products. The growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year
2007 compared to fiscal year 2006 included expected increases of approximately $22 million in
engineering material supplies and outside services targeting etch, new and product growth
objectives, $18 million in salary and benefits costs for planned increases in headcount and
employee base compensation supporting that same strategy, $6 million in incentive-based
compensation driven by higher profit levels and $6 million in equity-based compensation.
Approximately 33% of fiscal year 2007 systems revenues were derived from products introduced over
the previous two years.

The growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005
was primarily due to approximately $19 million in increased supplies and outside services, $8
million in increased equity-based compensation expense, and $4 million in increased salary and
benefit costs due to planned increases of employee base compensation and increased headcount.

The increase in SG&A expenses during fiscal year 2007 compared with the prior year was driven
by increases of $20 million in incentive-based compensation triggered by higher profits and stock
price, approximately $15 million in salary and benefit costs for planned increases in headcount and
employee base compensation, and $5 million in equity-based compensation.

The increase in SG&A expenses during fiscal year 2006 compared with the prior year was driven
by increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately $4 million due to planned increases of
employee base compensation and increased headcount. Increases in incentive-based cash compensation
of approximately $7 million were principally due to our long-term executive compensation program
implemented during fiscal year 2006 and equity-based compensation was approximately $8 million.
Fiscal year 2005 SG&A expenses were lower primarily due to the March 2005 receipt of an $8 million
tax refund from the California State Board of Equalization for previously paid sales and use tax.

The increase in interest income during fiscal year 2007 compared with the prior year is
primarily due to increases in our average balances of cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments, and restricted cash and investments throughout fiscal year 2007 and to a lesser
extent, increases in interest rate yields. Although the average total cash and cash equivalents
and short-term investments balances increased throughout the year, the balances at the end of
fiscal year 2007 decreased by approximately $490 million compared to the prior year, primarily due
to share repurchase activity of approximately $1.1 billion throughout fiscal year 2007, of which
approximately $768 million occurred during the June 2007 quarter.

The increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2007 was due to the $350 million of
long-term debt entered into by our wholly-owned subsidiary on June 16, 2006 to facilitate the
repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). The balance
of our long-term debt was $250 million as of June 24, 2007.

In June 2007 we recognized a gain of $3.0 million related to the sale of a private equity
investment.

The favorable legal judgment of $15.8 million during fiscal year 2007 was obtained in a
lawsuit filed by the Company alleging breach of purchase order contracts by one of its customers.
The Supreme Court of California denied review of lower and appellate court judgments in favor of
Lam Research during the quarter ended September 24, 2006.

The sequential increase in interest income during fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year
2005 was due to the combined effect of increased cash and cash equivalents, short-term securities,
and restricted cash and investments balances as well as increases in interest rate yields. The
Company’s total balances of cash, cash equivalents, short-term securities, and restricted cash and
investments, increased approximately $626 million from fiscal year 2005. This increase included the
Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary’s drawdown against a $350 million Credit Agreement to support the
Company’s foreign earnings repatriation of $500 million under the AJCA. The remaining increase of
$276 million was primarily driven by $367 million from cash flows from operating activities.

Income Tax Expense

Our annual income tax expense was $161.9 million, $104.6 million and $99.0 million, in fiscal
years 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2007, 2006, and
2005 was 19.1%, 23.8% and 25.0%, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal
year 2007 was due to the change in the geographical mix of income in jurisdictions with a lower tax
rate as well as certain discrete events resulting in a net tax benefit of $21.5 million, or 2.5%
benefit on the effective tax rate. These discrete events included favorable adjustments for
previously estimated tax liabilities upon the filing of the Company’s U.S. and certain foreign
income tax returns, the reversal of tax reserves with respect to certain transfer pricing items now
settled and an increased benefit related to the extension of the federal research credit as it
pertains to the Company’s fiscal year 2006. These favorable adjustments were partially offset by
an increase in tax expense related to the application of foreign tax rulings.

The fiscal year 2006 effective tax rate was 23.8%, compared to the fiscal year 2005 effective
tax rate of 25.0%, and reflects the increase in income in jurisdictions with a lower tax rate, the
realization of state R&D tax credits not previously benefited, favorable tax rulings on prior year
tax returns filed and the reversal of tax reserves with respect to the agreement of a bilateral
advanced pricing arrangement. These favorable adjustments for the year were partially offset by a
discrete event for the repatriation during fiscal year 2006 of a $500 million extraordinary
dividend under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, combined with the impact of the accounting
for equity-based awards in accordance with SFAS No. 123R and the deductibility of those awards in
some jurisdictions, and the expiration of the research tax credit on December 31, 2005.

Deferred Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income
tax purposes. Our gross deferred tax assets, primarily comprised of reserves and accruals that are
not currently deductible and tax credit carryforwards, were $123.3 million and $133.3 million at
the end of fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. These gross deferred tax assets were offset
by deferred tax liabilities of $34.2 million and $27.1 million at the end of fiscal years 2007 and
2006, respectively.

Deferred tax assets decreased in fiscal year 2007 primarily due to the utilization of tax
credits, adjustments for previously estimated tax liabilities upon the filing of income tax returns
in various jurisdictions, the impact of certain elections related to foreign tax rulings, the
conclusion of negotiations on certain transfer pricing items, and the incremental tax benefit
related to stock-based compensation deductions.

We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more
likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future
taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however,
ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not
known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to
realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in
the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than
not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. We
evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the
need for additional valuation allowances, if any.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We based our estimates
and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable
and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions.
Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.

The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are
described in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of these significant accounting
policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is defined
as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and
requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need
to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.

We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant
judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition:

We recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling
price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have
completed our system installation obligations, received customer acceptance or are otherwise
released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations. In the event that terms of the
sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of
the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. In circumstances
where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do
not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue where it can be reliably
demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed-to customer specifications. In
situations with multiple deliverables, revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate
elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our
customer acceptance obligations. Revenue from multiple-element arrangements is allocated among the
separate elements based on their relative fair values, provided the elements have value on a
stand-alone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the arrangement does not
include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the
undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. The maximum revenue
recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery
of additional items. Revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits is generally
recognized upon shipment. Revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of
the services requested by a customer order. Revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with
a fixed payment amount is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.

Inventory Valuation

: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard
costs which approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. We maintain a perpetual
inventory system and continuously record the quantity on-hand and standard cost for each product,
including purchased components, subassemblies, and finished goods. We maintain the integrity of
perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand. Finished goods
are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. Generally, title
transfer is documented in the terms of sale. When the terms of sale do not specify, we assume title
transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other
customer practices prevail. Transfer of title for shipments to Japanese customers generally occurs
at time of customer acceptance.

Standard costs are reassessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs,
generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts, currently obtainable assembly
and test labor utilization levels, methods of manufacturing, and overhead for internally
manufactured products. Manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product
standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes. All
intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are
eliminated from our consolidated financial statements.

Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least
quarterly. Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw
materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. Generally,
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over the
next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost. Inherent in
the estimates of market value are management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing
schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market
conditions, possible alternative uses, and ultimate realization of excess inventory. If future
customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory
write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is
made.

Warranty

: Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and
service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. We offer standard
warranties for our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance, not
to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer. When appropriate, we record a
provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue
recognition. The amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity which uses factors
such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such as tool reliability
trends. All actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those
established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping.

Actual warranty expenses are incurred on a system-by-system basis, and may differ from our
original estimates. While we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities,
if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments
to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. We do not maintain
general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems.



In addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer customer-paid extended warranty
services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are
recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded
either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable.

Equity-based Compensation — Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Plans

: We account
for our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) and stock plans under the provisions of SFAS No. 123R.
SFAS No. 123R requires the recognition of the fair value of equity-based compensation in net
income. The fair value of our restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair market
value of Company stock at the date of grant. The fair value of our stock options and ESPP awards
was estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. This model requires the input of highly
subjective assumptions and elections in adopting and implementing SFAS No. 123R, including expected
stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. The fair value of equity-based awards
is amortized over the vesting period of the award and we have elected to use the straight-line
method for awards granted after the adoption of SFAS No. 123R and continue to use a graded vesting
method for awards granted prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R.

We make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool to determine if there are
any deficiencies that require recognition in our consolidated statements of operations. As a result
of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we will only recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in
paid-in-capital if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently
available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect
benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income
deduction through the income statement (continuing operations) rather than through paid-in-capital.
We have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to
net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits
determined under APB No. 25 for income tax footnote disclosure purposes. We will track these stock
award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paid-in-capital in
accordance with Footnote 82 of SFAS No. 123R.

In connection with our restatement of the consolidated financial statements, we have applied
judgment in choosing whether to revise measurement dates and if revised which measurement date to
select for prior option grants. Information regarding the restatement is set forth above in
“Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements” and in Note 3, “Restatement of Consolidated
Financial Statements” in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.

Income Taxes:

Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between
the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used
for income tax purposes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the
amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is
dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be
realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other
variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not
be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to
earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more
likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided
valuation allowance would be reversed.

We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that
could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent
year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified.

We provide for income taxes on an interim basis on the basis of annual estimated effective
income tax rates. Our estimated effective income tax rate reflects the underlying profitability of
the Company, the level of R&D spending, the regions where profits are recorded and the respective
tax rates imposed. We carefully monitor these factors and adjust the effective income tax rate, if
necessary. If actual results differ from estimates, we could be required to record an additional
valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust our effective income tax rate, which could
have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application
of complex tax laws. Our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly
judgmental. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with the Company’s
expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operation and financial
condition. The Company accounts for the income tax contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5,
“Accounting for Contingencies”.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

We account for goodwill and other intangible assets in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets”, (SFAS No. 142). SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and identifiable intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least
annually. SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be
amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and
reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets”. We review goodwill for impairment at least annually. In addition, we review
goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable.



Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation Number 48, “Accounting for Income Tax
Uncertainties” (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes, by prescribing a minimum
recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial
statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognizing, measurement, classification, interest
and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We will adopt FIN 48 as of June 25, 2007. As a
result of the adoption of FIN 48, we expect to decrease the recorded liability for unrecognized tax benefits
by approximately $26.2 million as well as reclass approximately $64.4 million from current to
non-current income taxes payable. We expect the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 to be a
$17.6 million increase to our opening retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008.

In September 2006, the Staff of the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering
the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements” (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year
misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of determining whether the
current year’s financial statements are materially misstated. We applied the provisions of SAB 108
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007.

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements”, (SFAS No. 157), which defines
fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair
value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but rather
eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements. SFAS No.
157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Earlier adoption is permitted,
provided the company has not yet issued financial statements, including interim periods, for that
fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting the provisions of SFAS No.
157 on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (SFAS No. 159).
This statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other
items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value and establishes
presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that
choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159
is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after November 15,
2007, provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 157. We expect to adopt
SFAS No. 159 beginning June 30, 2008 and are currently evaluating the impact that this
pronouncement may have on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (SFAS
No. 141R). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and
measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any
noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No. 141R also establishes
disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the
business combination. SFAS No. 141R is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year
that begins after December 15, 2008. We expect to adopt SFAS No. 141R beginning in fiscal year
2010 and are currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS No. 141R on
our consolidated financial statements.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of June 24, 2007, we had approximately $1.0 billion in gross cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments compared with $1.5 billion at June 25,
2006. During fiscal year 2007, we generated $823.6 million in cash from operating activities,
which supported the use of $1.1 billion in stock repurchases, $177.1 million to fund the
acquisition of the silicon growing and silicon fabrication assets of Bullen Ultrasonics, Inc.
(Bullen), and $100.0 million repayment of our long-term debt.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities of $823.6 million during fiscal year 2007 consisted
of (in millions):

$

823.6

Significant changes in assets and liabilities included increases in deferred profit of $51.1
million due to increased volume of shipments, $44.8 million in accrued expenses primarily due to
increased incentive-based compensation on higher profit levels, and an increase in accounts payable
of $9.1 million. These amounts were partially offset by an increase in inventories of $56.3
million on increased business volume, an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $19.2
million on a pre-tax basis due to certain supply arrangement and taxes receivable.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2007 was $82.8 million and included
the acquisition of Bullen assets of $177.1 million and capital expenditures of $60.0 million
partially offset by the reclassification of $110.0 million from restricted cash and investments due
to the repayment of $100.0 million of our long-term debt and $45.2 million in net sales of
short-term investments.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2007 was $1.1 billion in total
reflecting $1.1 billion of stock repurchases thereby completing all available share repurchase
authorizations. We also made payments on our long-term debt and capital leases of $100.2 million.
Partially offsetting these uses of cash were $60.6 million from the issuance of our Common Stock
related to employee equity-based plans, and $45.0 million of excess tax benefit on equity-based
compensation plans which represents the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the compensation
cost recognized.

Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining
sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and
capital infrastructure. Based upon our current business outlook, our levels of cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments at June 24, 2007 are expected to be sufficient to support
our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, and capital
expenditures through at least the next 12 months.

In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our
ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products. Should additional
funding be required, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or
private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, in the event of such requirements, we
will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives.
However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be
no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

We have certain obligations, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some which
are not, to make future payments under various contracts. Obligations are recorded on our balance
sheet in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The obligations recorded on
our consolidated balance sheet include our long-term debt which is outlined in the following table
and discussed below. Our off-balance sheet arrangements include certain contractual relationships
and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below. Our combined
contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to these agreements, and our guarantees are

Operating Leases

We lease most of our administrative, R&D and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service
offices and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates
through 2021. Certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our Fremont, California
headquarters and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for
additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for
periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation.

Included in the operating leases less than 1 year section of the table above is $75.0 million
in guaranteed residual values for lease agreements relating to certain properties at our Fremont,
California campus. As part of the lease agreements, we have the option to purchase the remaining
buildings at any time for a total purchase price for all remaining properties related to these
leases of approximately $85.0 million. We are required to guarantee the lessor a residual value on
the properties of up to $75.0 million at the end of the lease terms in fiscal year 2008 (in the
event that the leases are not renewed, we do not exercise the purchase options, the lessor sells
the properties and the sale price is less than the lessor’s costs). We maintain cash collateral of
$85.0 million as part of the lease agreements as of June 24, 2007 in separate, specified
certificates of deposit and interest-bearing accounts that are recorded as restricted cash and
investments in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The lessor under the lease agreements is a
substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a variable
interest entity (VIE) as defined by FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities” and is therefore not consolidated by us. We obtained compliance waivers from the lessor
with respect to our obligation to deliver financial statements to the lessor under the terms
provided in the lease agreements. Please see additional information in “Subsequent Events” below
regarding renewal of the leases noted above and entry into additional leases.

The remaining operating lease balances primarily relate to non-cancelable facility-related
operating leases.

Purchase Obligations

Purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis
or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments,
including vendor-consigned inventories. We continue to enter into new agreements and maintain
existing agreements to outsource certain activities, including elements of our manufacturing,
warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance, certain information technology functions, and
certain transactional general and administrative functions. The contractual cash obligations and
commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 24, 2007 under these
arrangements and others. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and
length of contractual service provided. In addition to these obligations, certain of these
agreements include early termination provisions and/or cancellation penalties which could increase
or decrease amounts actually paid.

Consignment inventories, which are owned by vendors but located in our storage locations and
warehouses and properly segregated and controlled, are not reported as our inventory until title is
transferred to us or our purchase obligation is determined. At June 24, 2007, vendor-owned
inventories held at our locations and not reported as our inventory were $27.4 million.



Long-Term Debt and Interest Expense

On June 16, 2006, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Lam Research International SARL (LRI), as
borrower, entered into a $350 million Credit Agreement (the LRI Credit Agreement). Under the LRI
Credit Agreement, on June 19, 2006, LRI borrowed $350 million in principal amount. The loan under
the LRI Credit Agreement shall be fully repaid not later than five years following the closing date
and will bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread (applicable margin) ranging from 0.10% to 0.50%,
depending upon a consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the LRI Credit Agreement. LRI may
prepay the loan under the LRI Credit Agreement in whole or in part at any time without penalty,
subject to reimbursement of lenders’ breakage and redeployment costs in certain cases. The amounts in the table above include the
remaining principal payment of $250 million due on June 19, 2011 and interest payments estimated
based on the current LIBOR rate in effect as of June 24, 2007 of 5.320% and applicable margin of
ten basis points. $100.0 million of the original $350.0 million debt was repaid during fiscal year
2007. The fair value of long-term debt approximates its carrying value due to the variable interest
rate applicable to the debt. Please see
additional information under “Subsequent Events” below regarding termination of the LRI Credit
Agreement and our entry into a new credit agreement.

We used the proceeds from the credit facility entered into by LRI to facilitate a portion of
the repatriation of $500 million of foreign earnings in fiscal year 2006 under the provisions of
the American Jobs Creation Act.

Guarantees

We account for our guarantees in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Interpretation No. 45 “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (FIN No. 45). FIN No. 45 requires a company that is
a guarantor to make specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has
issued. FIN No. 45 also requires a company (the Guarantor) to recognize, at the inception of a
guarantee, a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee.

We lease several facilities at our headquarters location in Fremont, California. As part of
certain of the lease agreements, we have the option to purchase the remaining buildings at any time
for a total purchase price for all remaining properties related to these leases of approximately
$85.0 million. We are required to guarantee the lessor a residual value on the properties of up to
$75.0 million at the end of the lease terms in fiscal year 2008 (in the event that the leases are
not renewed, we do not exercise the purchase options, the lessor sells the properties and the sale
price is less than the lessor’s costs). We maintain cash collateral of $85.0 million as part of the
lease agreements as of June 24, 2007 in separate, specified certificates of deposit and
interest-bearing accounts that are recorded as restricted cash and investments in our Consolidated
Balance Sheet. The lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company
that does not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity as defined by FASB
Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” and is therefore not
consolidated by us. We obtained compliance waivers from the lessor with respect to our obligation
to deliver financial statements to the lessor under the terms provided in the lease agreements.
Please see additional information under “Subsequent Events” below for renewal of the leases noted
above and entry into additional leases.

We have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors under some of our agreements. We have
entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to such indemnifications. As
of June 24, 2007, we have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection with
these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable
that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees.

On June 16, 2006, our wholly-owned subsidiary, LRI, as borrower, entered into the $350 million
LRI Credit Agreement. In connection with the LRI Credit Agreement, we entered into a Guarantee
Agreement (the “Guarantee Agreement”) guaranteeing the obligations of LRI under the LRI Credit
Agreement. Our obligations under the Guarantee Agreement are collateralized by readily marketable
securities in an amount equal to 110% of the outstanding balance of our obligations under the
Guarantee Agreement, representing $275.0 million at June 24, 2007 as we had paid down $100.0
million of the existing debt during fiscal year 2007. This collateral is reflected in the balance
of restricted cash and investments in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We obtained compliance
waivers from the lender with respect to our obligation to deliver financial statements to the
lender under the terms provided in the Guarantee Agreement. Please see additional information
under “Subsequent Events” below regarding termination of the LRI Credit Agreement and the Guarantee
Agreement, our entry into a new credit agreement, and the entry of our wholly-owned subsidiary
Bullen Semiconductor Corporation into a new guarantee agreement with respect to the new credit
agreement.

Generally, we indemnify, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, our customers for
infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products or services. We seek to
limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products
or services subject to its indemnification obligations. We do not believe, based on information
available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these guarantees.

We offer standard warranties on our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from
system acceptance not to exceed 14 months from the date of shipment of the system to the customer.
The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system,
customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as the impact of system
reliability improvements.



Subsequent Events

SEZ Transaction

: On March 11, 2008, we completed the tender offer for the outstanding shares
of SEZ Holding AG (“SEZ”), the leading supplier of single-wafer clean technology and products to
the global semiconductor manufacturing industry. Upon the completion of the tender, we acquired
approximately 94% of the outstanding shares of SEZ. We expect to take additional steps as
necessary to acquire the SEZ shares that remain outstanding.

The tender offer was conducted pursuant to the terms of a Transaction Agreement entered into
on December 10, 2007 by and between the Company and SEZ (the “Transaction Agreement”). Under the
terms of the Transaction Agreement, we acquired all shares of SEZ that were tendered in the offer
at a price of CHF 38 per share in cash, for a total price of CHF 606 million, which approximated
US$584 million.

In December 2007, we purchased a call option with a notional amount of approximately CHF 641
million to hedge the currency exposure in connection with the anticipated purchase of the shares of
SEZ as noted above. The call option premium cost was $10.3 million. The mark-to-market value of
the fair value of the call option as of December 23, 2007 was $3.1 million resulting in a $7.2 million unrealized
loss recorded in other income (expense), net in our condensed consolidated statements of operations
for the quarter ended December 23, 2007. In February 2008 we extended the expiration date of the call option at an additional premium
cost of $2.4 million. We exercised the call option during March 2008 which resulted in a gain of
$40.7 million which we will record in other income (expense), net in our condensed consolidated
statements of operations for the quarter ending March 30, 2008.

Operating Leases

: On December 18, 2007, we entered into a series of two operating leases (the
“Livermore Leases”) regarding certain improved properties in Livermore, California. On December 21,
2007, we entered into a series of four amended and restated operating leases (the “New Fremont Leases,” and collectively
with the Livermore Leases, the “Operating Leases”) with regard to certain improved properties
at our headquarters in Fremont, California. Each of the Operating Leases is an off-balance sheet
arrangement.

The Operating Leases (and associated documents for each Operating Lease) were entered into by
us and BNP Paribas Leasing Corporation (“BNPPLC”).

Each Livermore Lease facility has an approximately seven-year term (inclusive of an initial
construction period during which BNPPLC’s and our obligations will be governed by the Construction
Agreement entered into with regard to such Livermore Lease facility) ending on the first business
day in January, 2015. Total scheduled rent payments under the Livermore Leases are estimated to be
approximately $25.7 million in the aggregate (based on one-month LIBOR rates at the time of
entering into the leases), following completion of improvements to each property.

Each New Fremont Lease has an approximately seven-year term ending on the first business day
in January, 2015. Total scheduled rent payments under the New Fremont Leases are approximately
$32.4 million in the aggregate (based upon three-month LIBOR rates at the time of entering into the
leases).

Under each Operating Lease, we may, at our discretion and with 30 days’ notice, elect to
purchase the property that is the subject of the Operating Lease for an amount approximating the
sum required to prepay the amount of BNPPLC’s investment in the property and any accrued but unpaid
rent. Any such amount may also include an additional make-whole amount for early redemption of the
outstanding investment, which will vary depending on prevailing interest rates at the time of
prepayment.

We are required, pursuant to the terms of the Operating Leases and associated documents, to
maintain collateral in an aggregate of approximately $165.0 million (upon completion of the
Livermore construction) in separate interest-bearing accounts with BNPPLC (or a third party,
currently State Street Bank and Trust, with regard to the Livermore Leases) as security for our
obligations under the Operating Leases.

Upon expiration of the term of an Operating Lease, the property subject to that Operating
Lease may be remarketed. We have guaranteed to BNPPLC that each property will have a certain
minimum residual value, as set forth in the applicable Operating Lease. The aggregate guarantee
made by us under the Operating Leases is no more than approximately $141.8 million (although, under
certain default circumstances, the guarantee with regard to an Operating Lease may be 100% of
BNPPLC’s investment in the applicable property; in the aggregate, the amounts payable under such
guarantees will be no more than $165.0 million plus related indemnification or other obligations).

Under each Operating Lease and its associated documents, we are subject to a financial
covenant requiring us to maintain unrestricted cash, unencumbered cash investments, and
unencumbered marketable securities of at least $300.0 million (not including the collateral
maintained as security for our obligations under the Operating Leases).

The Operating Leases are subject to customary default provisions, including, without
limitation, those relating to payment defaults under the Operating Leases and associated documents,
payment defaults under other indebtedness of us, performance defaults under the Operating Leases
(including cross-defaults between each of the Operating Leases), and events of bankruptcy. In the
event that such defaults occur and are continuing, BNPPLC may accelerate repayment of a portion or
all of its investment under the applicable Operating Leases; alternatively, BNPPLC may require us
to pay all amounts due under one or more Operating Leases through the end of the term of the
applicable Operating Leases.



Credit Agreements

: On March 3, 2008, we, as borrower, entered into a Credit Agreement, dated
as of March 3, 2008 (the “Credit Agreement”) with ABN AMRO BANK N.V (the “Agent”), as
administrative agent for the lenders party to the Credit Agreement, and such lenders. Bullen
Semiconductor Corporation, our wholly-owned domestic subsidiary(“Bullen”), entered into a guarantee
(the “Bullen Guarantee”) to guarantee our obligations under the Credit Agreement. In connection
with the Credit Agreement, we and Bullen entered into certain collateral documents (collectively,
the “Collateral Documents”) including a Security Agreement by us (the “Security Agreement”), a
Security Agreement by Bullen (the “Bullen Security Agreement”), a Pledge Agreement by us (the
“Pledge Agreement”) and other Collateral Documents to secure our obligations under the Credit
Agreement. The Collateral Documents encumber current and future accounts receivables, inventory,
equipment and related assets of us and Bullen, as well as 100% of our ownership interest in Bullen
and 65% of our ownership interest in Lam Research International BV, our wholly-owned subsidiary.
In addition, any future domestic subsidiaries of us will also enter into a similar guarantee and
collateral documents to encumber the foregoing type of assets.

Under the Credit Agreement, we borrowed $250 million in principal amount for general corporate
purposes. The loan under the Credit Agreement is a non-revolving term loan with the following
repayment terms: (a) $12.5 million of the principal amount due on each of (i) September 30, 2008,
(ii) March 31, 2009 and (iii) September 30, 2009 and (b) the payment of the remaining principal
amount on March 6, 2010. The outstanding principal amount bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.75% per
annum or, alternatively, at the Agent’s “prime rate.” We may prepay the loan under the Credit
Agreement in whole or in part at any time without penalty. The Credit Agreement contains customary
representations, warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default, as well as various
negative covenants (including maximum leverage ratio, minimum
liquidity and minimum EBITDA).

As a condition to funding under the Credit Agreement, the outstanding balance ($250 million)
under the LRI Credit Agreement was repaid in full. LRI is our wholly-owned subsidiary. In
addition, the Guarantee Agreement was also terminated. Our obligations under the Guarantee
Agreement were fully collateralized by cash and cash equivalents.

Section
409A:

As a result of the determinations from a voluntary independent stock option review, the Company
considered the application of Section 409A of the IRC to certain stock option grants where, under
APB No. 25, intrinsic value existed at the time of grant. In the event such stock option grants are
not considered as issued at fair market value at the original grant date under the IRC and
applicable regulations thereunder, these options are subject to Section 409A. On March 30, 2008,
the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the Company to assume the liability of any and all
employees, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and certain executive officers, with
options subject to Section 409A. The liability is currently
estimated to be in the range of approximately $50 million to
$55 million. The determinations from the voluntary independent stock option review are more fully
described in Note 3, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” to Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations” in Item 7 of the Company’s 2007 Form 10-K.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment
portfolio and variable rate long-term debt. We target to maintain a conservative investment policy,
which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market
risk, and reinvestment risk. The table below presents principal amounts and related
weighted-average tax equivalent interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio at
June 24, 2007 and June 25, 2006:

We mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our
portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment
issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or
resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification.

We conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we
are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange
rates. The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars except for certain of
our revenues in Japan that are denominated in Japanese yen, certain of our spares and service
contracts which are denominated in other currencies, and expenses related to our non-U.S. sales and
support offices which are denominated in these countries’ local currency. We currently enter into
foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of the exchange rate
fluctuations on Japanese yen-denominated assets and forecasted Japanese yen-denominated revenue
where we currently believe our primary exposure to currency rate fluctuation lies. To protect
against the reduction in value of forecasted Japanese yen-denominated revenues, we enter into
foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts that generally expire within 12 months, and no
later than 24 months. These foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts are designated as cash
flow hedges and are carried on our Balance Sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the
contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and
subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue is recognized. We also
enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the
remeasurement of Japanese yen-denominated net receivable balances. The change in fair value of
these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income and
expense and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and
trade receivables, recorded in other income and expense, assuming the hedge contract fully covers
the intercompany and trade receivable balances.

On June 24, 2007, the notional amount of outstanding Japanese yen forward contracts that are
designated as balance sheet hedges was $30.2 million. The unrealized gain on the contracts on June
24, 2007, was $0.1 million. As of June 24, 2007, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange
rate movement of 10 percent and 15 percent in the Japanese yen would result in a potential loss in
fair value of our balance sheet hedge forward contracts of $3.0 million and $4.5 million,
respectively. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income and expense by
corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and trade
receivables assuming the hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable
balances. On June 24, 2007, the notional amount of outstanding Japanese yen forward contracts that
are designated as cash flow hedges was $77.6 million. As of June 24, 2007, a hypothetical adverse
foreign currency exchange rate movement of 10 percent and 15 percent in the Japanese yen would
result in a potential loss in fair value of our cash flow hedge forward contracts of $7.8 million
and $11.6 million, respectively.

Our outstanding long-term debt of $250.0 million bears interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging
from 0.10% to 0.50%, depending upon a consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the LRI Credit
Agreement. The initial spread under the LRI Credit Agreement is 0.10%. The principal payment of
$250 million is due on June 19, 2011. The fair value of long-term debt approximates its carrying
value due to the variable interest rate applicable to the debt. Please see additional information
under “Subsequent Events” regarding termination of the LRI Credit Agreement and our entry into a
new credit agreement.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures

Stock Option Grant Practices and Restatement

As discussed in Note 3, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” to Consolidated
Financial Statements of this 2007 Form 10-K, we are restating our consolidated balance sheet as of
June 25, 2006 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash
flows for the years ended June 25, 2006 and June 26, 2005 as a result of a voluntary independent
stock option review conducted by a special committee appointed by the Board of Directors that
consisted of two independent board members (the “Independent Committee”). The Company also
recorded adjustments affecting previously-reported financial statements for fiscal years 1997
through 2004, the effects of which are summarized in cumulative adjustments to additional paid-in
capital, deferred stock-based compensation, and retained earnings as of June 27, 2004. This 2007
Form 10-K also reflects the restatement of “Selected Financial Data” in Item 6 as of
and for the years ended June 25, 2006, June 26, 2005, June 27, 2004 and June 29, 2003. In addition,
we are restating the unaudited quarterly condensed financial statements for interim periods of
fiscal year 2006, and unaudited condensed balance sheets as of March 25, 2007, December 24, 2006
and September 24, 2006. There was no effect of the restatement on the consolidated statements of
operations for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2007.

Findings and Recommendations of the Independent Committee

As a result of its review, the Independent Committee identified certain deficiencies relating
to the Company’s historical practices and accounting with respect to stock options. The
deficiencies identified include the following areas:

As a result of the deficiencies identified, the Independent Committee developed
recommendations targeted at strengthening the Company’s processes with respect to equity
compensation and relating accounting. These recommendations were presented to the Board of
Directors on February 1, 2008 and include the areas of: approval authority for equity compensation
awards; oversight and administration of the awards process; coordination among relevant
departments; training with respect to equity compensation; and record-keeping. The Company is
currently reviewing all of the Independent Committee’s recommendations as well as a potential
timetable for implementation, but the Company believes that the substance of many of the
recommendations of the Independent Committee have already been incorporated into the Company’s
current equity compensation processes. This belief is consistent with the determination by the
Independent Committee and the Company that the granting of RSUs after fiscal year 2005 was not
within the scope of the Independent Committee review in part due to the documentation and testing
required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

The
Independent Committee concluded that there was no intentional misconduct on the part of
Company management or the Company’s independent directors.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), as of June 24, 2007, we
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e). Based
upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer along with our Chief Financial Officer, concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level.

We intend to review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures on an ongoing basis and to correct any material deficiencies that we may discover. Our
goal is to ensure that our senior management has timely access to material information that could
affect our business.



Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control—Integrated
Framework” published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to
evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Based on
that evaluation, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of June 24, 2007 at providing reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report, which is included in Part IV,
Item 15 of this 2007 Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most
recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.

Effectiveness of Controls

While we believe the present design of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting is effective at the reasonable assurance level, future events
affecting our business may cause us to modify our disclosure controls and procedures or internal
control over financial reporting. The effectiveness of controls cannot be absolute because the cost
to design and implement a control to identify errors or mitigate the risk of errors occurring
should not outweigh the potential loss caused by the errors that would likely be detected by the
control. Moreover, we believe that a control system cannot be guaranteed to be 100% effective all
of the time. Accordingly, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met.

Item 9B. Other Information

practices in accordance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
listing standards issued by the SEC and NASDAQ.

Guidelines, adopted by the Board and reviewed from time to time by the Nominating/Governance
Committee, selected provisions of which are detailed below.

www.lamresearch.com

, via the Investor Relations page.

Board Nomination Policies and Procedures

•

Board Membership Criteria –

Lam Research’s Corporate Governance Guidelines provide
that nominees for director are evaluated on the basis of a range of criteria, including
(but not limited to) business and industry experience, wisdom, integrity, analytical
ability, ability to make independent judgments, understanding of the Company’s business
and competitive environment, willingness and ability to devote adequate time to Board
duties, and other appropriate considerations. No director shall be nominated or
re-nominated after having attained the age of seventy-five years, and no director may
serve on more than a total of four boards of public companies (including the Company’s
Board).

•

Nomination Procedure –

The Nominating/Governance Committee is responsible for
identifying, evaluating, and recommending candidates for election to the Board, with due
consideration for recommendations made by other Board members, the CEO, stockholders,
and other sources. In addition to the above criteria, the Nominating/ Governance
Committee also considers the appropriate balance of experience, skills, and
characteristics desirable among the members of the Board. The independent members of
the Board review the Nominating/Governance Committee recommendations and nominate
candidates for election by the Company’s stockholders.

Director Independence

•

Requirements –

Lam Research’s Corporate Governance Guidelines require that at least a
majority of the Board shall be independent in accordance with NASDAQ rules and other
applicable criteria for independence. In addition, no non-employee director may serve
as a consultant or service provider to the Company without the approval of a majority of
the independent directors.

•

Current Board Members –

The Board has determined that the following directors are
independent in accordance with NASDAQ criteria for director independence: David
Arscott, Robert Berdahl, Richard Elkus, Jr., Jack Harris, Grant Inman, Catherine Lego,
Seiichi Watanabe, and Patricia Wolpert.

•

Board Committees –

All members of each of the Company’s three standing committees

–

the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating/Governance Committees

–

are required to be
independent in accordance with NASDAQ and other applicable criteria. See

“Board
Meetings and Committees”

below for a description of the responsibilities of the Board’s
standing committees.



•

Lead Independent Director –

Pursuant to the Corporate Governance Guidelines, the
Board may designate an independent director as the Lead Independent Director. Upon
appointment, the Lead Independent Director is responsible for coordinating the
activities of the independent members of the Board and acting as the principal liaison
between the independent directors and the Executive Chairman and CEO when necessary and
appropriate. Director Robert Berdahl has served as the Lead Independent Director since
2004.

•

Executive Sessions of Independent Directors –

The Board and its standing committees
periodically hold meetings of only the independent directors or Committee members
without management present.

Board Access to Independent Advisors

•

The Board as a whole, and each of the Board committees separately, have authority to
retain and terminate such independent consultants, counselors, or advisors to the Board
or a respective committee as each may deem necessary or appropriate.

Board Training and Self-Assessment

•

The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that directors are expected to attend one
or more training sessions or conferences to enhance their ability to fulfill their
responsibilities. Each of the directors who served during fiscal year 2007 fulfilled
this expectation. In fiscal year 2005, a majority of the directors then serving
attended at least one conference certified by an institutional investor services
organization. From time to time, the Nominating/Governance Committee conducts a review
of the functioning of the Board and the Board committees.

Director and Executive Officer Stock Ownership

•

The Company maintains guidelines for stock ownership by members of the Board.
Pursuant to the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, each director is expected to
own at least 5,000 shares of Lam Research Common Stock by the later of five years after
commencing service on the Board or November 2010.

•

The Company maintains guidelines for stock ownership by designated members of the
executive management team. Under the guidelines, executives designated by the
Compensation Committee, including the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial
Officer, and certain other officers, are expected to own a number of shares of Lam
Research Common Stock equal in value to a multiple of each executive’s base annual
salary. The multiple varies according to the seniority of the office. Executives are
expected to achieve the requisite stock ownership levels by the later of five years
following appointment to office or December 2010.

Director Resignation or Notification Upon Change in Executive Officer Status

•

The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that a director who is also an executive
officer of the Company shall submit a resignation of his directorship to the Board if
the officer ceases to be an executive officer of the Company.

•

The Corporate Governance Guidelines require that a non-employee director notify the
Nominating/Governance Committee if such director experiences a change of executive
position held at another company. Upon any such notification, the Nominating/Governance
Committee will review the appropriateness of the director’s continued Board membership
under the circumstances, and the director will be expected to act in accordance with the
Nominating/Governance Committee’s recommendation.

Shareholder Communications with Board of Directors

•

Directors or with any director regarding the Company may write to the Board or the

In addition to the measures discussed above, the Company maintains various other policies and
practices to promote responsible corporate governance, such as:

Board Meetings and Committees

The Board of Directors of the Company held a total of eleven regularly scheduled or special
meetings during fiscal year 2007. All of the directors who served for the entire fiscal year
attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of Board meetings and meetings of Board committees on
which they were a member during fiscal year 2007, with the exception of Mr. Newberry, who attended
73% of such meetings.

The Board of Directors has an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, and a

Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). During fiscal year 2007, the
Audit Committee consisted of Board members Arscott, Inman, Lego, and Watanabe. All Audit Committee
members are non-employee directors who are independent in accordance
with the NASDAQ criteria for
audit committee member independence. The Audit Committee held nine meetings during fiscal year
2007. The Audit Committee appoints and provides for the compensation of the Company’s Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm; oversees and evaluates the work and performance of the
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm; reviews the scope of the audit; considers comments
made by the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm with respect to accounting procedures and

and anonymous submission by employees regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters;
reviews and approves all related-party transactions; and performs related duties as set forth in
applicable securities laws, NASDAQ corporate governance guidelines, and the Committee charter. The
Lam Research Board of Directors has determined that Ms. Lego is an audit committee financial expert

Ms. Lego is independent in accordance with the NASDAQ criteria for audit committee independence

During fiscal year 2007, the

Compensation Committee

consisted of Board members Berdahl, Elkus,
Harris, and Wolpert. All Compensation Committee members are independent, non-employee directors.
The Compensation Committee held seven meetings during fiscal year 2007. The Compensation Committee
recommends the salary level, incentives, and other forms of compensation for the Chief Executive
Officer and the Executive Chairman, subject to approval by the independent members of the Board.
It also approves salary levels, incentives, and other forms of compensation for the other executive
officers of the



Company.
The committee reviews and recommends to the Board all compensation arrangements
applicable to the members of the Board. The Compensation Committee reviews, recommends and
approves, subject to stockholder and/or Board approval as required, the creation, amendment, or
termination of certain equity-based compensation plans of the Company and such other compensation
plans as the Board may designate. In addition, this committee has authority with respect to grants
of stock options, restricted stock and stock units, deferred stock, and performance share awards to
officers and other employees of the Company

During fiscal year 2007, the

Nominating/Governance Committee

consisted of Board members
Berdahl, Elkus, and Inman. All Nominating/Governance Committee members are independent,
non-employee directors. The Nominating/Governance Committee held three meetings during fiscal year
2007. This committee recommends, for approval by the independent members of the Board, nominees
for election as directors of the Company. Pursuant to the committee’s charter and the Corporate
Governance Guidelines, the Nominating/Governance Committee is also responsible for recommending the
composition of Board committees for approval by the Board, reviewing and assessing the Corporate
Governance Guidelines from time to time and recommending changes for approval by the Board,
reviewing the functioning of the Board and its committees and reporting the evaluation to the
Board, and reviewing the suitability of each director for continuing service on the Board. No
material changes to the procedures by which stockholders may nominate or recommend nominees were
made during fiscal year 2007.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company’s executive officers, directors, and
persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of the Company’s equity securities to file an
initial report of ownership on Form 3 and changes in ownership on Forms 4 or 5 with the SEC.
Executive officers, directors, and greater-than-10% stockholders are also required by SEC rules to
furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Specific due dates for these
reports have been established, and the Company is required to disclose in this 2007 Form 10-K any
failure to file such reports on a timely basis. Based solely on its review of the copies of such
forms received by it, and written representations from certain reporting persons, the Company
believes that all of these requirements were satisfied during the 2007 fiscal year.



Item 11.

Executive Compensation

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Overview

Lam Research’s Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) oversees and administers compensation
policies, programs, and practices applicable to the Company’s executive officers. The Committee
also reviews policies and programs on at least a calendar year basis and recommends, where
appropriate, material changes for the independent members of the Board’s consideration and
approval. In addition, the Committee establishes and periodically reviews corporate goals and
objectives for the Chief Executive Officer; evaluates the CEO’s performances in light of those
goals and objectives; and, based on such evaluation, recommends, for approval by the independent
members of the Board, the CEO’s compensation packages, including any employment agreement.

This Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) discusses our compensation program for the period
including fiscal year 2007 and covers actions regarding executive compensation that were taken
through March 21, 2008 for our executive officers listed below (the “named executive officers”)
whose compensation is detailed in the tables below:

This CD&A discusses our executive compensation in the context of a calendar year because our
compensation program is designed and evaluated on a calendar year basis rather than a fiscal year
basis. However, as required by applicable SEC rules, the compensation tables that follow this CD&A
report the executive compensation payments and awards made during fiscal 2007.

Philosophy and Objectives

Lam Research’s compensation program is designed and evaluated on a calendar year basis rather than
a fiscal year basis because the Company’s business planning, performance goal setting, pay and
benefit cycles are all run on a calendar year. The principal objectives of our compensation program
are to:

•

Maintain competitive programs to attract, retain and motivate high-caliber executives,

•

Maximize the Company’s long-term success by appropriately rewarding executive officers
for their achievements,

•

Focus executive efforts on long-term strategic goals for the Company by closely aligning
executive financial interests with stockholder interests while minimizing undue dilution of
the Company’s shares, and

•

Structure compensation programs to take into account the accounting treatment and tax
deductibility of executive compensation expense.

In formulating and administering the individual elements of our executive compensation program we
focus on:

•

Developing compensation packages for our executive officers that are comparable to
similarly situated executives in high technology companies;

•

Emphasizing pay for performance that rewards achievement of both short- and long-term
business objectives;

•

Establishing appropriate quantitative and strategic performance objectives and metrics;
and

•

Matching recognition of compensation expense as much as possible to the fiscal period in
which performance occurs.

Within this framework, the Committee reviews the information, analysis and compensation proposals
provided by management and meets with our Executive Chairman, senior management, and specialists
from Human Resources, Finance and Legal. Management makes recommendations to the Committee on the
base salary, annual incentive award targets and long-term incentive compensation for the named
executive officers. The Committee considers management’s recommendations with respect to executive
compensation in light of competitive compensation data and relevant business objectives. At the
request of the committee the Executive Chairman discusses management’s compensation recommendations
with the Committee. The Committee also regularly holds executive sessions not attended by any
members of management. The Committee makes recommendations to the independent members of our Board
of Directors on the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer for the final determination and
approval by such members of our Board of Directors.

Executive Compensation Program Components and Process

Components

. Lam Research’s executive compensation program consists of the major components listed
in the table below. We consider each element to be appropriate to meet one or more of the
principal objectives of our compensation policy. We generally target compensation near the

th

percentile of our peer group, yet allow our executives the ability to achieve
higher levels of compensation (up to and above the 75

th

percentile of our peer group) if
warranted by superior company and individual performance. Furthermore, we also consider factors
such as job performance, job scope and responsibilities, skill set, prior experience, the
executive’s time in his or her position with Lam Research, internal consistency regarding pay
levels for similar positions or skill levels within the Company, external pressures to attract and
retain talent, and market conditions generally. In general, pay differentials between our
executive officers reflect these factors and we believe are consistent with pay differentials
between similar positions at our peer companies.

6. Other benefit programs

We also have included severance provisions in employment agreements we have entered into with
Messrs. Bagley, Newberry and Bright. These employment agreements are described in more detail
below as well as in the “Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control” section below.
We typically do not offer severance provisions in our agreements with executive officers but we
retain the flexibility to do so on an individual basis for recruitment and retention purposes and
in order to provide a period during which a former executive is
incentivized not to engage in
competitive activities.

Process: Generally.

At the beginning of each calendar year, the Committee reviews base salaries,
annual incentives and long-term incentives and revises the overall compensation package from time
to time when appropriate in light of Lam Research’s current business strategies and performance and
changes in regulatory, tax and accounting rules and interpretations, while also taking into account
the interests of our stockholders. For instance, in 2006, we substantially revised the long-term
incentive element of our compensation program when we introduced the
cash-based MYIP in consideration of, among other concerns, changes to accounting rules
regarding expense recognition for equity-based awards.

When appropriate, the Committee has also adjusted compensation components to account for the level
of previous earnings by an executive officer. For example, in February 2006, the Committee provided
a supplemental one-year plan under the MYIP for Messrs. Anstice, Maddock and Hariri in
consideration for the absence of equity incentive grants to them in the years prior to the adoption
of the MYIP and the relatively low level of equity incentive awards made to them in comparison to
executive officers in similar positions from our peer group. Messrs. Anstice, Maddock, and Hariri
have not received an equity award since 2002.

Process: Annual Incentive Awards

. Our annual incentive awards provide for cash payments based on
the corporate, organizational and individual performance results achieved each calendar year.
Corporate performance is determined primarily by operating income as a percent of revenue.
Organizational and individual performance metrics generally fall in one or more of the following
categories: business process improvement, customer relationships, market share gains,
organizational capability, new product development, decreased cycle times, and employee retention
efforts. Typically, the Committee meets in January and/or February to review the operating profit
performance target and target incentive amounts for the first half of the calendar year and in
August to review those targets for the second half of the calendar year. By
reviewing performance targets and accrued incentive amounts every six months, the Committee retains
the ability to make adjustments as necessary to reflect changing business conditions and corporate
objectives.

Process: MYIP.

The MYIP was designed and proposed to the Committee by management and is a program
under Lam Research’s stockholder-approved 2004 Executive Incentive Plan (the “EIP”). The cash-based
incentive structure of the MYIP is intended to provide competitive levels of compensation to our
senior executives while (i) allowing the Company to accrue compensation expense during the period
in which performance occurs, (ii) as a non-equity program, minimizing dilution of stockholder
value, and (iii) incentivizing senior management retention by generally requiring continuous
employment through the payment determination date which is typically approximately two years
following the start of the performance period. Performance factors are established by the
Committee annually and funding is accrued on a periodic basis. A new MYIP cycle typically
commences at the beginning of each calendar year and lasts for eight consecutive calendar quarters.
For instance, our first MYIP cycle commenced in the first quarter of calendar year 2006 and ran
through the end of calendar year 2007 (the “2006



MYIP”), a second MYIP commenced in the first quarter of calendar year 2007 and runs through the end
of calendar year 2008 (the “2007 MYIP”), and a third MYIP commenced in the first quarter of
calendar year 2008 and runs through the end of calendar year 2009 (the “2008 MYIP”). To date, the
MYIP program performance metrics have been comprised of a formula based on attainment of the
Company’s operating profit target for each year and stock price, because the Committee believes
these measurements represent the best indicators of the performance of the Company and our
executive team during the performance periods. For the 2006 MYIP, target award levels were
determined after consideration of a study conducted during 2005 and 2006 by Mercer Consulting, an
objective third party consulting firm. Mercer Consulting was engaged by management to provide
information on the amounts that executives of the peer group realized pursuant to long-term
equity-based incentive programs and to provide a recommendation on a competitive target award in
lieu of equity grants for participants of the 2006 MYIP. For the 2007 and 2008 MYIPs, the
Committee (and the independent members of the Board with respect to the CEO) set target awards
after consideration of the overall compensation package for the named executive officers, the
potential rewards from the MYIP and the competitive compensation environment. Typically, the
Committee (and the independent members of the Board with respect to the CEO) meets in January
and/or February to review and determine the operating profit performance metric for the
then-current calendar year for each cyle of the MYIP then in effect.

Process: Setting Targets.

The Committee establishes performance goals so that the specific
performance targets will be challenging but achievable based on expected levels of performance from
executive officers while providing that below expected performance would reduce the executive’s
award. Performance goals are set such that very strong performance is required to earn payments
above the target bonus amounts. The Company believes that our specific operating profit targets
for awards granted as annual incentive awards and under the MYIP are confidential information and
their disclosure would result in competitive harm to the Company. In 2006 and 2007 Lam Research
achieved significant market share growth, leading to a substantial expansion of revenues and
profitability growth. Together, these results led to the payment of above target bonuses as annual
incentive awards and contributed to a maximum payout under the applicable MYIP performance cycle.
For calendar years 2007 and 2008, the Committee revised the operating profit growth targets upward
to provide a greater degree of difficulty in meeting those targets in light of the business plan
and outlook each year.



Peer Group

The Committee also determines the levels of compensation and the mix and weighting of compensation
components after reviewing data from a peer group of comparably-sized companies in the high
technology industry and from nationally published survey data.

The peer group companies are selected based on their comparability to Lam Research’s revenue size
and business purpose, and with whom we believe we are likely to compete for talent. Based on these
criteria, the peer group may be modified from one year to the next. For 2007, the peer group
consisted of the following companies:

Analog Devices, Inc.

National Semiconductor Corporation

Applied Materials, Inc.

Novellus Systems Inc.

Cymer, Inc.

NVIDIA Corporation

Cypress Semiconductor Corporation

Plexus Corp.

Fairchild Semiconductor International, Inc.

SanDisk Corporation

KLA-Tencor Corporation

Teradyne, Inc.

LSI Corporation

Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc.

MEMC Electronic Materials, Inc.

Xilinx, Inc.

Molex Incorporated

In addition to peer group data, our human resources department engaged outside consultants from
Radford, the Presidio Group and F.W. Cook & Co. to analyze published survey market data on base
salary, bonus targets, equity awards and total compensation.

Base Salary

For 2007 and 2008, after taking into consideration peer group compensation and management’s
recommendations, the Committee (and the independent members of the Board with respect to the CEO)
set the base salaries of each of the named executive officers (see table below) as follows:

In connection with Mr. Bright’s Employment Agreement, his base salary was further increased to

Annual Incentive Awards

Generally

Annual incentive awards for our executive officers for a specific calendar year are based on an
individual performance factor, a corporate performance factor and a target bonus amount based upon
a percentage of annual eligible salary. The actual incentive award is calculated by multiplying the
individual factor by the corporate factor by the target bonus amount. The portion of the award
based upon individual performance is subject to a maximum multiplier determined at the beginning of
the calendar year. The corporate performance factor is applied using a fixed ratio based on the
Company’s actual operating profit achievement. The calculated incentive award
for executive officers (other than the CEO) may be increased by the Committee, and may be subject
to negative discretion by the Committee (or the independent members of the Board with respect to
the CEO) after the performance period.

The individual metrics for calendar years 2006 and 2007 were given equal weight with the corporate
performance factor which was based upon operating income as a percent of revenue. These objectives
and relative weightings were selected based upon management recommendations and Committee and Board
determination that they represented the most important metrics of company performance during the
applicable calendar years and as a complement to the focus on the operating profit metric under the
MYIP discussed below. For calendar years 2006 and 2007, the portion of the award based upon
individual performance was subject to a maximum multiplier of 1.5 on the performance factor.

Mr. Newberry

Annual incentive awards for Mr. Newberry for calendar years 2006, 2007, and 2008 were made under
Lam Research’s EIP so that his bonus amounts would qualify for deductibility under Section 162(m)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Section 162(m)”), discussed further below.

Calendar Year 2006. The Board approved Mr. Newberry’s target bonus amount for calendar year 2006
at 100% of his annual eligible salary. The metrics for Mr. Newberry’s individual performance were
market share (weighted at 30%), revenue and gross margin (weighted at 35%) and cash from operations
(weighted at 35%). These objectives, together, were given equal weight with the corporate
performance factor which was based upon operating income as a percent of revenue. For calendar
year 2006, no discretion was exercised by the Board in determining Mr. Newberry’s annual incentive
award. Mr. Newberry’s actual calendar year 2006 incentive award was calculated at 2.13 times his
target bonus amount, equal to a payout of $1,485,716. This amount is included in the Non-Equity
Incentive Plan Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table below.

Calendar Year 2007. In February 2007, the Committee selected, and the independent members of the
Board approved, the annual bonus plan factors for Mr. Newberry for calendar year 2007 and
established targets for the first half of calendar 2007. Each of the factors and their relative
weighting for Mr. Newberry’s 2007 annual bonus award were unchanged from the 2006 calendar year
plan except that under the corporate performance factor, actual operating profit growth targets
were revised upward to provide a greater degree of difficulty in meeting those targets in light of
the business plan and outlook for calendar year 2007. No changes were made to Mr. Newberry’s
performance targets for the second half of calendar year 2007. For calendar year 2007, no
discretion was exercised by the Board in determining
Mr. Newberry’s annual incentive award. In
February 2008, the Committee recommended and the independent
members of the Board approved that Mr. Newberry’s calendar
year 2007 annual incentive award be calculated at 1.80 times his target bonus amount, equal to a
payout of $1,427,690.

In
March 2008, based upon the Committee's recommendations, the
independent members of the Board approved Mr. Newberry’s target bonus amount
for calendar year 2008 at 125% of base salary, subject to a cap of 2.25 times the target bonus
amount.

Other Named Executive Officers

The individual performance factors for each executive also include organizational performance
objectives based upon applicable business unit performance goals. These objectives generally fall
in one or more of the following categories: business process improvement, customer relationships,
market share gains, organizational capability, new product development, decreased cycle times, and
employee retention efforts. Target bonus amounts ranged from 65% to 85% of annual salary for each
executive. The differences in target bonus amounts among the named executive officers are
determined based on job scope and responsibilities and the competitive compensation data.

Calendar Year 2006. In February 2007, the Committee approved incentive award payouts for calendar
year 2006 performance at amounts ranging from 1.90 to 2.05 times the executives’ target bonus award
reflecting each executive’s individual performance results. Actual dollar amounts are reported in
the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table below. The
Committee did not exercise discretion to increase or reduce any
awards during calendar year 2006.



Calendar Year 2007. In January 2008, the Committee approved incentive award payouts for calendar
year 2007 performance at amounts ranging from 1.61 to 1.80 times the executives’ target bonus award
reflecting each executive’s individual performance results against the organizational objectives
mentioned above. Additionally, new target bonus amounts for calendar year 2008 were set for the
named executive officers. These amounts range from 70% to 80% of
annual salary for each executive, subject to a cap of 2.25 times the
target bonus amount.

Earned annual incentive awards for calendar years 2005, 2006, and 2007 are provided in the table
below for the named executive officers.

Multi-Year
Cash-Based Incentive Program (“MYIP”)

The Committee selects certain executives to participate in each MYIP. During 2006 and 2007,
cash awards under the MYIP were the only long-term incentive awards provided for the named
executive officers with the exception of Mr. Gottscho, who received a grant of restricted share
units but was not a participant in the 2006 or 2007 MYIPs. In addition, Messrs. Anstice, Maddock,
and Hariri participated in a supplemental one-year plan under the MYIP based on the Company’s
operating profit performance which covered performance in calendar year 2006. Awards under the
supplemental plan were determined and paid in February 2007. The Committee established this
supplemental plan in consideration of the absence of equity incentive grants to the participants
since calendar year 2002.

In order to receive an award under the MYIP, participants generally must be continuously
employed at Lam Research through the date(s) on which the Committee determines the actual award
amounts under the applicable program (the “determination date”). The Committee has the discretion
to waive or otherwise adjust the retention criteria for individual participants. For example, Mr.
Bright is eligible to receive the target incentive amount established for his 2007 calendar year
performance under the 2007 MYIP, provided that Mr. Bright remains employed by Lam Research through
a vesting date of March 1, 2008.

The Company’s named executive officers excluding Mr. Gottscho were eligible for performance-based
awards under the following MYIPs:

MYIP
Performance Periods

Performance factors, comprised of a formula based on the attainment of the Company’s operating
profit target, are established by the Committee annually and measured and accrued on a quarterly
basis. In February 2006, the Committee (and the independent members of the Board with respect to
the CEO) established the operating profit performance metric upon which actual incentive awards would be
calculated for calendar 2006. In January 2007, the Committee (and the independent members of the
Board with respect to the CEO) established the operating profit performance metric upon which
actual incentive awards would be calculated for calendar 2007 under both the 2006 and 2007 MYIPs.
In January 2008, the Committee established the operating profit performance metric upon which actual incentive awards would be
calculated for calendar year 2008 under both the 2007 and 2008 MYIPs
for the Company’s named executive officers excluding Mr. Newberry. In
March 2008, based on recommendations of the Committee, the
independent members of the Board established this metric for
Mr. Newberry.

Additionally, the 2006, the 2007, and the 2008 MYIPs provide that the calculated award amounts are
automatically increased (but may not be decreased) pursuant to a ratio comparing the Company’s
stock price performance over the 50 trading day trailing average as of the end of each
fiscal quarter to the 200 trading day trailing average as of the
beginning of the program. Under each program, the actual award payable to each participant cannot exceed 2.5
times the target bonus amount set for each plan. During calendar year 2006 and 2007, the stock
price factor did positively affect the amounts calculated pursuant to the formula set forth in the
respective MYIP.

The Committee (and the independent members of the Board with respect to the CEO) has the
opportunity to review the provisional accruals on a periodic basis and may choose to exercise
negative discretion to reduce the amount of award accruals following such review. The Committee
(and the independent members of the Board with respect to the CEO) did not exercise its negative
discretion to reduce any award accruals during calendar years 2006 or 2007, with the exception of
Mr. Bright, whose 2006 MYIP award payment was reduced from the calculated amount.

The aggregate individual target award amounts and the aggregate amounts earned for the named
executive officers under each cycle of the MYIP (except for Mr. Gottscho who participates in the
2008 MYIP only) were:

Equity Incentive Compensation

The Company believes that long-term equity incentive awards can be a useful part of its executive
compensation program. However, as discussed above, the Company has chosen to grant primarily
long-term cash incentive awards to its executive officers for calendar years 2006 and 2007. The
Committee or Board may use its discretion to grant stock options or restricted stock units to
executive officers in the future to provide competitive long-term incentives and to reward
behaviors that result in long-term stockholder value growth. At this time, the Company does not
have a formal policy with respect to the timing of granting equity awards.

Compensation of Chief Executive Officer

The Company and Mr. Newberry entered into an employment agreement (the “Newberry Agreement”)
effective January 1, 2003, which continues in effect pursuant to an automatic one-year renewal
provision. The Newberry Agreement provides for a base salary at a rate to be set at least annually
by the Board. Under the Newberry Agreement, Mr. Newberry is entitled to participate in any
performance incentive plan offered by the Company, in the Company’s executive deferred compensation
plan(s), and in other benefit and compensation programs generally applicable to key executives of
the Company. The Newberry Agreement includes severance provisions which are described below in the
“Potential Payments Under Termination of Employment or Change-in-Control” section below.

Compensation of Executive Chairman

The Company and Mr. Bagley entered into a new employment agreement (the “Bagley Agreement”)
effective January 1, 2006. The term of the Bagley Agreement is from January 1, 2006, to March 31,
2009, unless extended or earlier terminated in accordance with its provisions. Pursuant to the
terms and conditions of the Bagley Agreement, Mr. Bagley will continue to serve as Executive
Chairman of the Company during the term of the agreement. Mr. Bagley will receive an annual salary
of $240,000 provided he remains employed by the Company. Subject to certain non-compete and other
terms and conditions, the Bagley Agreement provides for a lump sum payment of $2.5 million on April
15, 2009. During the term of the Bagley Agreement, Mr. Bagley will not participate in any
executive bonus plans maintained by the Company. Mr. Bagley however is eligible to participate in
the standard executive benefit plans maintained by the Company. During the term of the Bagley
Agreement, Mr. Bagley agrees not to perform services for any other for-profit enterprise that would
interfere with his services to, or otherwise compete with, the Company. The Bagley Agreement
includes severance provisions which are described below in the “Potential Payments Upon Termination
or Change-in-Control” section below.

Change in Control and Severance Arrangements

Lam Research generally does not provide for severance or change in control benefits to executive
officers except for individually negotiated arrangements such as those with Messrs. Newberry,
Bagley and Bright. These arrangements are more fully described in the “Potential Payments Upon
Termination of Employment or Change-in-Control” section below. We use such individually negotiated
arrangements for recruitment and retention purposes and in order to provide a period during which a
former executive will be incentivised not to engage in competitive activities.

However,
as discussed below, we do provide medical and dental insurance retirement benefits to
eligible former officers (and members of our Board). Furthermore, certain of the Company’s stock
option plans and its Employee Stock Purchase Plan provide that, upon a merger of the Company with
or into another corporation or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company, some or
all of the options granted under certain of the stock option plans shall be accelerated so as to be
fully exercisable, and all of the rights granted under the Employee Stock Purchase Plans shall be
fully exercisable following the merger for a period from the date of notice by the Board. Following
the expiration of such periods, the options and rights will terminate. The 2007 Stock Incentive
Plan adopted by Company stockholders at the 2006 Annual Meeting allows the Company broad discretion
to provide for vesting acceleration of awards on change-of-control transactions.

Elective Deferred Compensation Plan

Lam Research maintains a non-qualified deferred compensation plan, the Elective Deferred
Compensation Plan (the “EDCP”), which allows eligible employees, including executive officers, to
voluntarily defer receipt of all or a portion of his/her salary and all or a portion of a bonus
payment until the date or dates elected by the participant, thereby allowing the participating
employee to defer taxation on such amounts. The EDCP is offered to eligible employees, including
the named executive officers, in order to allow them to defer more compensation than they would
otherwise be permitted to defer under a tax-qualified retirement plan, such as The Lam Research
Corporation Employee Savings Plus Plan (the “401(k) Plan”). Further, Lam Research offers the EDCP
as a competitive practice to enable it to attract and retain top talent.



The EDCP is evaluated by the human resources group for competitiveness in the marketplace from time
to time, but the level of benefits provided is not typically taken into account in determining an
executive’s overall compensation package for a particular year due to its conservative nature.

Retirement Benefits Under the 401(k) Plan and Not-Generally-Available Benefit Programs

Each of Lam Research’s named executive officers is eligible for additional benefits generally
available to Company employees such as matching contributions to Lam Research’s 401(k) plan and
medical coverage benefits. Lam Research also provides additional benefits to its named executive
officers that are not generally available to other Company employees, including the payment of term
life insurance premiums, payment of medical co-insurance premiums and
matching contributions to the
EDCP in lieu of decreased contributions that would otherwise have been made had such EDCP
deferrals not been made. The amount of the Company EDCP contribution that is
not generally available to other Company employees is shown in the “All Other Compensation Table”
below.

Medical and Dental Insurance Retirement Benefit

The Company provides a program to pay for post-retirement medical and dental insurance coverage for
eligible former executive officers and members of Lam Research’s
Board of Directors. To be
eligible, a person must have served at the position of vice president or above or as a member of
the Board of Directors, be at least age 55 at retirement, and have at least five years of
continuous service with Lam Research. An executive officer or director must be enrolled in the
Company’s U.S. group medical and dental plans at the time of his or her retirement. When the
retired person reaches age 65, he or she is required to enroll in Medicare parts A and B which
would be the primary payer for the executive’s health coverage. The benefit also covers the
person’s spouse at the time of retirement for his or her lifetime as well as other eligible
dependents. The benefit ceases if the person becomes employed by a competitor of Lam Research
after leaving the Company’s service. We provide the benefit to our executives and members of our
board to further the long-term retention of their services and/or provide a disincentive to later
compete against the Company.

Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines

During fiscal year 2006, the Company adopted executive stock ownership guidelines, pursuant to
which senior executives are expected and encouraged to own and maintain certain minimum levels of
the Company’s Common Stock. The Committee believes that these guidelines are an appropriate
addition to the Company’s equity compensation policies and, in conjunction with Lam Research’s
equity and cash-based incentive plans, will further serve to align the long-term interests of the
senior executives with those of the Company’s stockholders. Each executive is required to
accumulate and maintain ownership of shares of the Company’s Common Stock, in the quantities
indicated by the guidelines below, by the later of December 31, 2010, or the fifth anniversary of
an executive’s hire date.

Accounting and Tax Considerations

Mr. Hariri received taxable income in fiscal year 2007 on the tax payments made on Mr. Hariri’s
behalf by the Company to compensate for the difference in income tax liabilities resulting from an
expatriate assignment.

In determining which elements of compensation are to be paid, and how they are weighted, Lam
Research also takes into account whether a particular form of compensation will be considered
“performance-based” compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under
Section 162(m), Lam Research generally receives a federal income tax deduction for compensation
paid to any of its named executive officers only if the compensation is less than $1 million during
any fiscal year or is “performance-based” under Section 162(m). In 2004, Lam Research adopted the
EIP with a structure intended to provide for the tax deductibility of awards granted under the EIP.
Accordingly, during fiscal 2007, the annual incentive awards granted to Mr. Newberry and to the
greatest extent possible, all MYIP grants to Mr. Newberry and the other named executive officers
were granted under Lam Research’s EIP. In November 2006, our stockholders approved an amendment to
the EIP that increased the



amount of cash awards that may be paid to any one participant in respect of achievement of
performance goals for any twelve-month period to $12 million. Prior to the amendment, the maximum
amount of awards that could be paid to a participant in a twelve-month period and qualify for
deductiblity under Section 162(m) was $2 million. Accordingly,
we expect that all MYIP grants made
after passage of the amendment will qualify for deductibility under Section 162(m). The prior $2
million limit for deductibility will likely apply to performance periods under grants prior to the
amendment. The Committee currently intends to continue to seek a tax deduction for all of Lam
Research’s executive compensation, to the extent it determines it is in the best interests of Lam
Research.

To assist in the avoidance of additional tax under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, Lam
Research structured the MYIP and the EDCP, and structures its equity awards, in a manner intended
to comply with the applicable Section 409A requirements. It is Lam Research’s general philosophy
not to provide any executive officer or director with a gross-up or other reimbursement for tax
amounts the individual might pay pursuant to Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.

year 2007 even if deferred at the election of the executive officer under the Company’s deferred
compensation plans and/or the Company’s 401(k) Plan. All amounts listed as “Executive

Under Lam Research’s EDCP, participants may defer up to 100% of base salary and/or bonus
compensation. The minimum deferral amount is $5,000 in any plan year.  Deferral elections may
be changed each year during the fall enrollment period. The
participants may elect to have their deferrals tracked to 16 variable
rate funds. Participants may establish up to 5 distribution accounts, each to begin payment in
a specific year or upon Retirement. Accounts must be elected at the time of enrollment. All
amounts listed as “Executive Contributions” in the table above represent contributions on
amounts earned during fiscal year 2007 and disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table earlier
in this document.

(2)

Amounts credited to the EDCP consist only of cash compensation that has been earned and
payment of which has been deferred by the participant. The amounts deferred under the EDCP are
credited with interest in the sum of (a) the yield-to-maturity of five-year U.S. Treasury
notes plus (b) 1.50% or with gains or losses that “mirror” the market performance of the funds
selected by employees, net of management fees and expenses. Lam Research generally may not take a
deduction with respect to amounts deferred under the EDCP until such amounts are paid out.
However, in certain circumstances where an amount is determinable by formula or otherwise
fixed at year end and paid within two and one-half months of year end, Lam Research may take a
deduction before the amounts are paid.

(3)

The above-market or preferential earnings portion of these amounts are reported in the
Summary Compensation Table under the column entitled “Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation Earnings.”

The Company first adopted a deferred compensation plan in 1994 (the “1994 Deferral Plan”). The 1994
Deferral Plan remains in effect but was closed to further contributions as of December 31, 2004.
The Company adopted a new deferred compensation plan (the “EDCP”) effective January 1, 2005.
Contributions by eligible executives on or after January 1, 2005, will be maintained in the EDCP.
Both Deferred Compensation Plans are voluntary, non-tax-qualified, deferred compensation plans that
encourage executives to save for retirement. Under the Deferred Compensation Plans, participants
were and are entitled to defer compensation until retirement, death, other termination of
employment, or until specified dates.



Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control

The Company provides a program to pay for post-retirement medical and dental insurance coverage for
eligible former executive officers (the “Executive Retirement Medical Benefit Plan”). Annually, Lam
Research has an independent actuarial valuation of this post-retirement benefit conducted in
accordance with the methodology prescribed by the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 106,
Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (SFAS No. 106). The most
recent valuation conducted in August 2007 valued Lam Research’s accumulated post-retirement benefit
obligation for the named executive officers, Mr. Bagley and directors under the plan at $603,000.
The amounts for the named executive officers and Mr. Bagley are shown in the table below:

In addition, certain of the Company’s stock option plans and its Employee Stock Purchase Plan
provide that, upon a merger of the Company with or into another corporation or the sale of
substantially all of the assets of the Company, each outstanding option or right to purchase Common
Stock shall be assumed, or an equivalent option or right substituted, by the successor corporation
or a parent or subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the event that the successor corporation
does not agree to assume the option or right or substitute an equivalent option or right, at the
discretion of the plan administrator, some or all of the options granted under certain of the stock
option plans shall be accelerated so as to be fully exercisable, and all of the rights granted
under the Employee Stock Purchase Plans shall be fully exercisable following the merger for a
period from the date of notice by the Board of Directors. Following the expiration of such periods,
the options and rights will terminate. The 2007 Stock Incentive Plan adopted by Lam Research
stockholders at the 2006 Annual Meeting allows the Company broad discretion to provide for vesting
acceleration of awards on change-of-control transactions.

The tables below quantify the amount that would be payable to each of Messrs. Newberry, Bright and
Bagley assuming the termination of his employment on June 24, 2007, and are estimates of the
amounts which would be paid out to each executive upon his termination. The actual amounts to be
paid out can only be determined at the time of the triggering events.

Newberry Agreement

The Newberry Agreement provides that in the event of involuntary termination without cause (as
defined in the agreement) or a change in control of the Company followed by either involuntary
termination or the acceptance of a position of materially lesser authority or responsibility
offered to Mr. Newberry by the Company, or if the Company is acquired by another entity so that
there will be no market for the Common Stock of the Company and the acquiring entity does not
provide options comparable to unvested stock options held by Mr. Newberry, all unvested stock
options granted to Mr. Newberry will automatically be accelerated in full so as to become fully
vested. Mr. Newberry is presently fully vested in his stock options but such provision applies to
any future grants. Mr. Newberry will have two years from the date of termination in which to
exercise such options.

If Mr. Newberry’s employment is involuntarily terminated without cause, he will be entitled to
receive a lump sum payment equal to fifteen (15) months of his then-annual base compensation, and
he will receive annually any benefits under the Executive Retirement Medical Benefit Plan for which
he qualifies following the date of termination. If Mr. Newberry resigns voluntarily, he will not
be entitled to receive any severance benefits under the Newberry Agreement, with the exception of
the benefits that he would qualify for under the Executive Retirement Medical Benefit Plan. In the
event of Mr. Newberry’s death, his estate will be entitled to receive an amount equal to Mr.
Newberry’s annual base salary payable in a lump sum. If Mr. Newberry becomes disabled, he will be
entitled to receive his base salary for a period of twelve (12) months from the date disability is
certified, as well as any bonus earned prior to the effective date of disability.



The Newberry Agreement provides that for a period of six months following Mr. Newberry’s
termination of employment with the Company, Mr. Newberry may not solicit any of the Company’s
employees to become employed by any other business enterprise.

Bright Agreement

The employment agreement which the Company entered into with Mr. Bright effective August 1, 2003
(the “Bright Agreement”) provides that in the event of a change in control of the Company, subject
to certain conditions set forth in the Bright Agreement, or involuntary termination of Mr. Bright
without cause (as defined in the agreement), all unvested stock options granted to Mr. Bright will
automatically be accelerated in full so as to become fully vested. Mr. Bright will have two years
from the date of termination in which to exercise such options. Mr. Bright presently does not have
any unvested or unexercised stock option grants but any new grants to Mr. Bright would be subject
to such provisions. If Mr. Bright’s employment is involuntarily terminated without cause, he will
be entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to fifteen (15) months of his then-annual base
compensation, and any annual benefits under the Executive Retirement Medical Benefit plan for which
he qualifies following the date of termination. In the event of Mr. Bright’s death, his estate will
be entitled to receive an amount equal to his annual base salary payable in a lump sum. If Mr.
Bright becomes disabled, he will be entitled to receive his base salary for a period of twelve (12)
months from the date disability is certified, as well as any bonus earned prior to the effective
date of disability.

benefit.



Bagley Agreement

Pursuant to the Bagley Agreement, Mr. Bagley is entitled to certain severance benefits upon
termination of his employment, depending on the reason for the early termination. If Mr. Bagley
voluntarily resigns his employment position, he will not be eligible for any severance payment or
benefits, but will remain eligible for the $2.5 million lump sum payment to be paid on April 15,
2009, provided the conditions precedent therefore are fulfilled. In the event of involuntary
termination of employment without cause (as defined in the agreement) or due to disability, Mr.
Bagley will be entitled to continued payment of his salary; to the lump sum payment when otherwise
due; to continued annual medical benefits under the Executive Retirement Medical Benefit plan; and
to exercise any vested stock options for two years after termination. If involuntary termination is
due to death, additional benefits include acceleration of payment of the lump sum amount within
ninety days after death and continued medical benefits for covered family members pursuant to plan
eligibility. If Mr. Bagley is terminated for cause, Mr. Bagley will not be entitled to receive any
severance benefits under the Bagley Agreement. There is no change-of-control benefits provision in
the Agreement.

The Bagley Agreement provides that (i) prior to March 31, 2009, Mr. Bagley may not provide services
to another entity that would constitute competition with the Company; and (ii) for a period of six
months following termination of the Agreement, Mr. Bagley may not solicit any of the Company’s
employees to become employed by any other business enterprise.

Includes shares issuable under the Company’s 1997 Stock Incentive Plan (the “1997
Plan”). The 1997 Plan was adopted by the Board in May 1997 and approved by the stockholders
of the Company in August 1997. In October 2002, the Board amended the 1997 Plan to provide
for the issuance of restricted stock unit awards, allow all 1997 Plan participants to
participate in exchanges of stock options previously permitted under the 1997 Plan, and
provide that vesting of restricted stock, deferred stock, performance share and restricted
stock unit awards would be determined by the Administrator of the Plan at the time of the
award grant.

Pursuant to the provisions of the 1997 Plan approved by the Company’s stockholders, the
number of shares reserved for issuance under the plan will automatically be increased each
calendar quarter if and to the extent necessary to provide that the ratio of (a) the number of
shares reserved for issuance under all of the Company’s stock-based incentive plans to (b) the total
number of shares of Lam Research Common Stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis will be equal to
18.5%; provided, that the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Lam 1997 Stock Plan
will in no event exceed fifteen million shares. During fiscal year 2007, there were no
additional amounts reserved for issuance.



(2)

Includes shares issuable under the Company’s 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended
(the “2007 Plan”). The 2007 Plan was adopted by the Board in August 2006, approved by the
stockholders of the Company in November 2006, and amended by the Board in November 2006. The
2007 Plan reserves for issuance up to 15,000,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock.

(3)

Includes 3,313,227 shares available for future issuance under the 1999 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (“1999 ESPP”). This number does not include shares that may be added to
the 1999 ESPP share reserve in the future in accordance with the terms of the 1999 ESPP, as
amended.

(4)

Includes shares issuable under the Company’s 1999 Stock Option Plan (the “1999
Option Plan”). The 1999 Option Plan reserves for issuance up to 27,500,000 shares of the
Company’s Common Stock.

The 1999 Option Plan was adopted by the Board as of November 5, 1998 (the “Effective Date”) and
amended and restated as of October 16, 2002 and November 7, 2002. All directors, officers and
employees of Lam and its designated subsidiaries, as well as consultants, advisors or
independent contractors who provide valuable services to the Company or such subsidiaries, are
eligible to participate in the 1999 Option Plan.

Nonstatutory stock options, deferred stock, restricted stock, performance shares, and restricted
stock unit awards (collectively, the “Awards”) may be granted under the plan. Stock options
granted under the 1999 Option Plan must have an exercise price that is not less than the fair
market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of the grant. The Administrator shall
determine the participants to whom Awards shall be granted and the terms of such Awards. The
1999 Option Plan terminates ten years from the Effective Date.

In the event of a corporate transaction such as a change of control, the 1999 Option Plan
provides that each outstanding Award shall be assumed, or an equivalent Award substituted, by
the successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the event
that the successor corporation does not agree to assume the Award or substitute an equivalent
Award, subject to limitations that may be placed on an Award on the date of grant, outstanding
Awards shall accelerate and become fully exercisable.

(5)

Does not include restricted stock units (RSUs) with an exercise price of $0.00.

(1)

Audit fees represent fees for professional services provided in connection
with the audits of annual financial statements, reviews of quarterly financial
statements, and audit services related to other statutory or regulatory filings or
engagements. In addition, audit fees include those fees related to Ernst & Young LLP’s
audit of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.



(2)

Audit-related fees consist of assurance and related services that are
reasonably related to the audit or review of the Company’s financial statements and are
not reported above under “Audit Fees.”

(3)

Tax fees represent fees for services primarily related to international tax
compliance.

(4)

All other fees relate principally to fees for subsidiary-related services.

The Audit Committee reviewed summaries of the services provided by Ernst & Young LLP and the
related fees during fiscal year 2007 and has determined that the provision of non-audit services
was compatible with maintaining the independence of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company’s Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm. The Audit Committee approved 100% of the services and related
fee amounts for services provided by Ernst & Young LLP during fiscal year 2007.

Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services

It is the responsibility of the Audit Committee to approve, in accordance with Sections 10A(h) and
(i) of the Exchange Act and the Rules and Regulations of the SEC, all professional services, to be
provided to the Company by its Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, provided that the
Audit Committee shall not approve any non-audit services proscribed by Section 10A(g) of the
Exchange Act in the absence of an applicable exemption.

It is the policy of the Company that the Audit Committee pre-approves all audit and permissible
non-audit services provided by the Company’s Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm,
consistent with the criteria set forth in the Audit Committee Charter and applicable laws and
regulations. The Committee has delegated to the Chair of the Committee the authority to
pre-approve such services, provided that the Chair shall report any decision on his part to
pre-approve such services to the full Audit Committee at its next regular meeting. These services
may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services, and other services. The
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm and Company management are required to periodically
report to the Audit Committee regarding the extent of services provided by the Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm pursuant to any such pre-approval.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JUNE 24, 2007

Note 1: Company and Industry Information

Lam Research Corporation (“Lam Research” or the “Company”) designs, manufactures,
markets, and services semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated
circuits and is recognized as a major provider of such equipment to the worldwide semiconductor
industry. Semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process steps that result in
the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits. The Company leverages its
expertise in these areas to develop integrated processing solutions which typically benefit its
customers through reduced cost, lower defect rates, enhanced yields, or faster processing time. The
Company sells its products and services primarily to companies involved in the production of
semiconductors in the United States, Europe, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, and Asia Pacific.

The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced
periodic downturns and upturns. Today’s leading indicators of changes in customer investment
patterns may not be any more reliable than in prior years. Demand for the Company’s equipment can
vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including, but not limited
to, economic conditions, supply, demand, and prices for semiconductors, customer capacity
requirements, and the Company’s ability to develop and market competitive products. For these and
other reasons, the Company’s results of operations for fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005 may not
necessarily be indicative of future operating results.

Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that could
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company based its
estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be
applicable, and evaluates them on an on-going basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current
conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition:

The Company recognizes all revenue when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the
selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and the
Company has completed its system installation obligations, received customer acceptance or is
otherwise released from its installation or customer acceptance obligations. In the event that
terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, the Company recognizes revenue
upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs
first. In circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance
or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, the Company recognizes revenue
where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed-to customer
specifications. In situations with multiple deliverables, revenue is recognized upon the delivery
of the separate elements to the customer and when the Company receives customer acceptance or is
otherwise released from its customer acceptance obligations. Revenue from multiple-element
arrangements is allocated among the separate elements based on their relative fair values, provided
the elements have value on a stand alone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of fair
value, the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item
and delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in
the Company’s control. The maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the
amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. Revenue related to sales of
spare parts and system upgrade kits is generally recognized upon shipment. Revenue related to
services is generally recognized upon completion of the services requested by a customer order.
Revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the term of the contract.

Inventory Valuation

: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using
standard costs, which approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company
maintains a perpetual inventory system and continuously records the quantity on-hand and standard
cost for each product, including purchased components, subassemblies and finished goods. The
Company maintains the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of
quantities on hand. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to
the customer. Generally, title transfer is documented in the terms of sale. When the terms of sale
do not specify, the Company assumes title transfers when it completes physical transfer of the
products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail. Transfer of title for
shipments to Japanese customers generally occurs at time of customer acceptance.

Standard costs are re-assessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition
costs, generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts, currently obtainable
assembly and test labor utilization levels, methods of manufacturing, and overhead for internally
manufactured products. Manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product
standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes. All
intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between the Company’s legal
entities are eliminated from its consolidated financial statements.

Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least
quarterly. The Company’s policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories, including
manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods and spare parts in each reporting
period.
Generally, obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements
over the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value, if less than cost.
Inherent in the estimates of market value are management’s forecasts related to the Company’s
future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general
semiconductor market conditions, possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess
inventory. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than the Company’s
projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required, and would be reflected in cost of
sales in the period the revision is made.



Warranty

: Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing
parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. The Company
offers standard warranties for its systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system
acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer. When appropriate,
the Company records a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system
upon revenue recognition. The amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity, which
uses factors such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such as
tool reliability trends. All actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are
charged to those established reserves through the application of detailed project record-keeping.

Actual warranty expenses are incurred on a system-by-system basis, and may differ from
the Company’s original estimates. While the Company periodically monitors the performance and cost
of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than its estimates, the Company may
recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are
identified. The Company does not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves
are related to specific systems.

In addition to the provision of standard warranties, the Company offers customer-paid
extended warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed
payment amount are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs
are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and
estimable.

Equity-based Compensation — Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Plans

: The
Company accounts for its employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) and stock plans under the provisions
of SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R requires the recognition of the fair value of equity-based
compensation in net income. The fair value of the Company’s restricted stock units was calculated
based upon the fair market value of Company stock at the date of grant. The fair value of the
Company’s stock options and ESPP awards was estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model.
This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions and elections in adopting and
implementing SFAS No. 123R, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of
each award. The fair value of equity-based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the
award, and the Company has elected to use the straight-line method for awards granted after the
adoption of SFAS No. 123R and continues to use a graded vesting method for awards granted prior to
the adoption of SFAS No. 123R.

The Company makes quarterly assessments of the adequacy of its tax credit pool to
determine if there are any deficiencies which require recognition in its consolidated statements of
operations. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company will only recognize a benefit
from stock-based compensation in paid-in-capital if an incremental tax benefit is realized after
all other tax attributes currently available to the Company have been utilized. In addition, the
Company has elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the
research tax credit and the extraterritorial income deduction through the income statement
(continuing operations) rather than through paid-in-capital. The Company has also elected to net
deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits determined under APB No. 25 for
income tax footnote disclosure purposes. The Company will track these stock award attributes
separately and will only recognize these attributes through paid-in-capital in accordance with
Footnote 82 of SFAS No. 123R.

In connection with the Company’s restatement of the consolidated financial statements, the
Company has applied judgment in choosing whether to revise measurement dates and if revised which
measurement date to select for prior option grants. Information regarding the restatement is set
forth below in Note 3, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” in these Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements and in “Restatement of Previously Issued
Financial Statements” in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations” of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended
June 24, 2007 (the “2007 Form 10-K”).

Income Taxes:

Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences
between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the
amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its
deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of the
Company’s net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. The Company believes it is
more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be
negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time.
In the event that the Company determines that it would not be able to realize all or part of its
net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such
determination is made. Likewise, if the Company later determines that it is more likely than not
that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance
would be reversed.

The Company calculates its current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and
assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during
the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified.

The Company provides for income taxes on an interim basis on the basis of annual estimated
effective income tax rates. The Company’s estimated effective income tax rate reflects the
underlying profitability of the Company, the level of R&D spending, the regions where profits are
recorded and the respective tax rates imposed. The Company carefully monitors these factors and
adjust the effective income tax rate, if necessary. If actual results differ from estimates, the
Company could be required to record an additional valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or
adjust its effective income tax rate, which could have a material impact on the Company’s business,
results of operations, and financial condition.



The calculation of the Company’s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the
application of complex tax laws. The Company’s estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain
tax issue is highly judgmental. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with the
Company’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operation and
financial condition. The Company accounts for the income tax contingencies in accordance with SFAS
No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies.”

Goodwill and Intangible Assets:

The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible
assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets,” (SFAS No. 142). SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and identifiable
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for
impairment at least annually. SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with estimable
useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual
values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually.
In addition, the Company reviews goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be
recoverable.

Fiscal Year:

The Company follows a 52/53-week fiscal reporting calendar and its fiscal
year ends on the last Sunday of June each year. The Company’s most recent fiscal year ended on
June 24, 2007 and included 52 weeks. The fiscal years ended June 25, 2006 and June 26, 2005 also
included 52 weeks. The Company’s next fiscal year, ending on June 29 2008 will include 53 weeks.

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.

Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments:

All investments purchased with an original
final maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. All of the Company’s
short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale at the respective balance sheet dates.
The Company accounts for its investment portfolio at fair value. The investments classified as
available-for-sale are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices, and any material
temporary difference between the cost and fair value of an investment is presented as a separate
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss.) Unrealized losses are charged against
“Other income (expense)” when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than-temporary.
 The Company considers  several factors to determine whether a loss is other-than-temporary. These
factors include but are not limited to: (i) the extent to which the fair value is less than cost
basis, (ii) the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, (iii) the length of time
a security is in an unrealized loss position and (iv) the Company’s ability to hold the security
for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. The Company’s
ongoing consideration of these factors could result in additional impairment charges in the future,
which could adversely affect its results of operation. There were no impairment charges recorded
on the Company’s investment portfolio in fiscal years 2007, 2006, or 2005. The specific
identification method is used to determine the realized gains and losses on investments.

Property and Equipment:

Property and equipment is stated at cost. Equipment is
depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally
three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized by the straight-line method over the
shorter of the life of the related asset or the term of the underlying lease.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

: The Company routinely considers whether indicators of
impairment of long-lived assets are present. If such indicators are present, the Company determines
whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is
less than their carrying value. If the sum is less, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based
on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is
determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. If the assets determined
to be impaired are to be held and used, the Company recognizes an impairment charge to the extent
the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset’s
carrying value. The fair value of the asset then becomes the asset’s new carrying value, which the
Company depreciates over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. Assets to be disposed of
are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Derivative Financial Instruments:

The Company carries derivative financial instruments
(derivatives) on the balance sheet at their fair values in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (SFAS
No. 133). The Company has a policy that allows the use of derivative financial instruments,
specifically foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts, to hedge foreign currency exchange
rate fluctuations on forecasted revenue transactions denominated in Japanese yen and other foreign
currency denominated assets. The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative
purposes.

The Company’s policy is to attempt to minimize short-term business exposure to foreign
currency exchange rate risks using an effective and efficient method to eliminate or reduce such
exposures. In the normal course of business, the Company’s financial position is routinely
subjected to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. To protect
against the reduction in value of forecasted Japanese yen-denominated revenues, the Company has
instituted a foreign currency cash flow hedging program. The Company enters into
foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts that generally expire within 12 months, and
no later than 24 months. These foreign currency forward exchange contracts are designated as cash
flow hedges and are carried on the Company’s balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion
of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and
subsequently recognized in revenue in the same period the hedged revenue is recognized.



Each period, hedges are tested for effectiveness using regression testing. Changes in the
fair value of currency forwards due to changes in time value are excluded from the assessment of
effectiveness and are recognized in revenue in the current period. To qualify for hedge
accounting, the hedge relationship must meet criteria relating both to the derivative instrument
and the hedged item. These include identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the
nature of the risk being hedged and how the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the
exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows will be measured.

To receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at
the inception of the hedge and the hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future
cash flows on hedged transactions. When derivative instruments are designated and qualify as
effective cash flow hedges, the Company is able to defer changes in the fair value of the hedging
instrument within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged exposure is
realized. Consequently, with the exception of hedge ineffectiveness recognized, the Company’s
results of operations are not subject to fluctuation as a result of changes in the fair value of
the derivative instruments. If hedges are not highly effective or if the Company does not believe
that the underlying hedged forecasted transactions would occur, the Company may not be able to
account for its investments in derivative instruments as cash flow hedges. If this were to occur,
future changes in the fair values of the Company’s derivative instruments would be recognized in
earnings without the benefits of offsets or deferrals of changes in fair value arising from hedge
accounting treatment.

The Company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts to hedge the
gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of Japanese yen-denominated receivable balances.
Under SFAS No. 133, these forward contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment.
Therefore, the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded into earnings as a component
of other income and expense and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency
denominated intercompany and trade receivables, recorded in other income and expense, assuming the
hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances.

To hedge foreign currency risks, the Company uses foreign currency exchange forward
contracts, where possible and practical. These forward contracts are valued using standard
valuation formulas with assumptions about future foreign currency exchange rates derived from
existing exchange rates and interest rates observed in the market.

The Company considers its most current outlook in determining the level of foreign
currency denominated intercompany revenues to hedge as cash flow hedges. The Company combines these
forecasts with historical trends to establish the portion of its expected volume to be hedged. The
revenues are hedged and designated as cash flow hedges to protect the Company from exposures to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction
does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, the related hedge gains and losses
on the cash flow hedge are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to
interest and other income (expense) on the consolidated statement of operations at that time.

The Company does not believe that it is or was exposed to more than a nominal amount of
credit risk in its interest rate and foreign currency hedges, as counterparties are established and
well-capitalized financial institutions. The Company’s exposures are in liquid currencies (Japanese
yen), so there is minimal risk that appropriate derivatives to maintain the Company’s hedging
program would not be available in the future.

Guarantees:

The Company accounts for guarantees in accordance with FASB Interpretation
No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees to Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and a rescission of
FASB Interpretation No. 34” (FIN No. 45). Accordingly, the Company evaluates its guarantees to
determine whether (a) the guarantee is specifically excluded from the scope of FIN No. 45, (b) the
guarantee is subject to FIN No. 45 disclosure requirements only, but not subject to the initial
recognition and measurement provisions, or (c) the guarantee is required to be recorded in the
financial statements at fair value. The Company has recorded a liability for certain guaranteed
residual values related to specific facility lease agreements. The Company has evaluated its
remaining guarantees and has concluded that they are either not within the scope of FIN No. 45 or
do not require recognition in the financial statements. These guarantees generally include certain
indemnifications to its lessors under operating lease agreements for environmental matters,
potential overdraft protection obligations to financial institutions related to one of the
Company’s subsidiaries, indemnifications to the Company’s customers for certain infringement of
third-party intellectual property rights by its products and services, and the Company’s warranty
obligations under sales of its products. Please see Note 17 for additional information on the
Company’s guarantees.

Foreign Currency Translation:

The Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate in a
local currency environment, where that local currency is the functional currency, primarily
generate and expend cash in their local currency. Billings and receipts for their labor and
services are primarily denominated in the local currency and the workforce is paid in local
currency. Their individual assets and liabilities are primarily denominated in the local foreign
currency and do not materially impact the Company’s cash flows. Accordingly, all balance sheet
accounts of these local functional currency subsidiaries are translated at the fiscal period-end
exchange rate, and income and expense accounts are translated using average rates in effect for the
period, except for costs related to those balance sheet items that are translated using historical
exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as cumulative translation
adjustments, and are a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Translation adjustments are recorded in other income (expense),
net, where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency.

Reclassifications:

Certain amounts presented in the comparative financial statements for
prior years have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal year 2007 presentation.



Note 3: Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements

In these consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 24, 2007. Lam
Research is restating its consolidated balance sheet as of June 25, 2006 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years ended
June 25, 2006 and June 26, 2005 as a result of determinations from a voluntary independent stock
option review described below. The Company also recorded adjustments affecting previously-reported
financial statements for fiscal years 1997 through 2004, the effects of which are summarized in
cumulative adjustments to additional paid-in capital, deferred stock-based compensation, and
retained earnings as of June 27, 2004.

Independent Committee Review

On July 18, 2007, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had initiated a voluntary
independent review regarding the timing and accounting of the Company’s past stock option grants
and other related issues. The voluntary internal review arose after the Company’s Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm performed auditing procedures relating to the Company’s
historical stock option grant programs and procedures as part of the firm’s fiscal year-end 2007
audit. The Board of Directors appointed a special committee consisting of two independent board
members (the “Independent Committee”) to conduct a comprehensive review of the Company’s historical
stock option practices. The Independent Committee promptly engaged independent outside legal
counsel and forensic accountants to assist with the review. On December 21, 2007, the Company
announced that the Independent Committee had reached a preliminary conclusion that the measurement
dates for financial accounting purposes of certain stock option grants issued in the past differed
from the recorded grant dates of such awards. Upon the recommendation of management and the
Independent Committee, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors concluded that the financial
statements for fiscal years 1997 through 2005, and the interim periods contained therein should no
longer be relied upon. The Independent Committee’s review was completed in February 2008.

Scope of the Independent Committee Review

The review covered stock option grants awarded in fiscal years 1997 through 2005 (the “Review
Period”). The scope of the review included evaluating 100% of “Company-wide” grants, director
grants, Section 16 officer grants, and new hire grants, as well as a sampling of grants deemed
“other grants”, representing approximately 94% of all stock option grants during the Review Period.
This Review Period comprised approximately 16,000 separate stock option grants on approximately 500
separately recorded grant dates. These grants involved approximately 58 million underlying shares
of Common Stock and included grants to domestic and international employees. Share amounts have
been adjusted as applicable to reflect the March 2000 3 for 1 stock split. The Independent
Committee’s review also included procedures to identify potential
modifications of stock option grants and
grants awarded to consultants, and testing of cash exercises. The Company had not awarded any
Company-wide stock option grants since October 2002 and stopped issuing stock option grants during
fiscal year 2005 and only issued restricted stock units
(“RSUs”) thereafter.
The Independent Committee did not include fiscal years 2006 and 2007 in the scope of its review
based on several factors including but not limited to the fact that
the Company only issued RSUs
after fiscal year 2005 and the Company’s equity granting processes and controls had been documented
and tested as part of its assessment of the operating effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Additionally, no
information arose during the stock option review that would indicate a need to expand the scope of
the review to include other periods.

The Independent Committee’s review included the collection and processing of over 3.5 million
electronic documents, which included hard drives and network share drives of numerous individuals,
the Company’s network servers, and backup tapes. The Independent Committee’s advisors also
collected and reviewed hard copy documents from numerous sources and conducted 61 interviews of 47
individuals, predominantly current or former directors, officers and employees of the Company.

Stock Option Review Results

Consistent
with applicable accounting literature and guidance from the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) staff, the Company
organized the grants during the review period into categories based on the grant type and the
process by which the grant was finalized. The Company analyzed the evidence from the Independent
Committee’s review related to each category including, but not limited to, physical documents,
electronic documents, and underlying electronic data about documents. Based on the relevant facts
and circumstances, the Company applied the applicable accounting standards to determine, for
grants within each category, the proper measurement date. If the measurement date was not the
originally recorded grant date, accounting adjustments were made as required, in some cases
resulting in stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects. The significant majority of
the measurement date changes result from stock options granted prior to fiscal year 2003. As a
result of the findings of the review, the Company has recognized incremental stock-based
compensation and associated payroll tax expense of $96.4 million on a pre-tax basis ($65.8 million
after taxes) in the aggregate during fiscal years 1997 through 2006,
which includes incremental stock-based
compensation expense of $1.2 million recognized under SFAS No. 123R during fiscal year 2006.

During its review of the Company’s historical stock option practices, the Independent
Committee did not find evidence of any other financial reporting or accounting issues unrelated to
stock-based compensation.



Company-wide Grants

Company-wide grants were awarded on ten dates during the Review Period, and are associated
with approximately half of the shares underlying option grants encompassed in the review. These
ten dates include grants issued on six dates for broad-based and primarily discretionary grants
(“focal grants”), two grant dates that were formula-based grants (“supplemental grants”) and two
grant dates designed to address certain previously granted stock options for which the exercise
price was higher than the then-current fair value of the Company’s Common Stock (“cancel and
replace grants”). As a result of its review, the Company determined that the actual measurement
dates for certain stock option grants differed from the recorded grant dates. The Company
determined that the actual measurement date, meaning when the required actions necessary to grant
the option were completed, including the determination of the number of shares underlying the
options to be granted to each employee and the exercise price, was the correct measurement date to
determine what, if any, stock-based compensation was appropriate. Any intrinsic value of the
options on the measurement date, measured as the difference between the stated exercise price and
the market price, has been recorded as compensation expense during the periods when employees were
providing services in exchange for the options.

With respect to the focal grants, the Company concluded that a process to determine the total
number of shares underlying the options, grant date and exercise price generally commenced prior to
the recorded grant date but that in certain cases the specific allocation of those shares among the
various option recipients was not finalized until after the original recorded grant date. To
address these circumstances, the Company has revised the measurement date for accounting purposes
for these option grants to a date after the original grant date, when the allocation of the shares
was first known to be finalized. The Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense, net
of forfeitures, of $61.2 million on a pre-tax basis as a result of these revised measurement dates.

With respect to the supplemental grants, the Company determined that the
general formula for determining the number of shares underlying the option grant to which each
recipient would be entitled was not sufficiently finalized for accounting purposes at the
original recorded grant date. To address these circumstances, the Company has revised the measurement date for
accounting purposes for these grants to the date when this formula was first known to be finalized.
The Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of $5.6 million
on a pre-tax basis as a result of these revised measurement dates.

The cancel and replace grants involved recipients electing to exchange certain stock options,
for which the exercise price was higher than the then current fair value of the Company’s Common
Stock, in return for a new grant of options. The Company determined that in both instances, the
election deadline was after the recorded grant date. The measurement date should have been the
later of the recorded grant date or the date of election because the
elections were revocable up to the last day of the offer period. To address these circumstances, the
Company has revised the measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to the last
possible date of election. The Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense, net of
forfeitures, of $0.2 million on a pre-tax basis as a result of these revised measurement dates.

Grants to Directors and Section 16 Officers

Director grants were awarded on ten dates during the stock option review period. Grants to
directors were typically governed by the requirements of the underlying stock option plan
documents, as grant dates and amounts were typically fixed by the respective stock option plan.
There were instances when the grant dates were not consistent with
dates fixed by the respective stock option plan. In all instances the
grant date was within 1 to 3 days of the dates provided by the plan.
To address these circumstances, the Company has revised the measurement date for
accounting purposes for these grants to the date as required by the stock option plan. The Company
has recognized stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of $2.8 million on a pre-tax
basis as a result of these revised measurement dates.

Section 16
officer grants were awarded on 23 grant dates during the stock option review
period. The Company determined that the actual measurement date, meaning when the required actions
necessary to grant the option were completed, including the
determination of the number of shares underlying the options
to be granted to each employee and the exercise price, was the correct measurement date to
determine the market price of the option shares. Any intrinsic value of the options on the
measurement date, measured as the difference between the stated exercise price and the market
price, has been recorded as compensation expense during the periods when employees were providing
services in exchange for the options. In instances where the original recorded grant date was not
consistent with the correct measurement date, the Company has revised the measurement date for
accounting purposes for these grants to a date after the original grant date, when the number of
shares underlying the options to be granted to each employee and the exercise price were first
known with to be finalized. The Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense, net of
forfeitures, of $1.0 million on a pre-tax basis as a result of the revised measurement dates.
Additionally, it was determined that for one grant the recorded grant price was based on an average
of closing prices of the Company’s stock immediately prior to the grant date. The option plan
under which this option was granted allowed for similar pricing. To address this circumstance the
Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense of $2.1 million on a pre-tax basis for this
grant, which was equal to the difference between the closing price of the stock on the date of
grant and the originally recorded grant exercise price.



Grants to Consultant

The Company concluded that six granting actions to a non-employee consultant were incorrectly
accounted for as employee as opposed to non-employee stock awards. To address this circumstance,
the Company has recognized a stock-based compensation expense of $3.2 million on a pre-tax basis
under “fair value” accounting in accordance with the requirements of EITF Issue No. 96-18,
“Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other than Employees for Acquiring or in
Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services”.

Grants to New Hires

New hire grants were generally approved prior to the employee’s hire date and granted as of
the last day of the month of hire prior to calendar year 1999 and on the first day of the
individual’s employment with the Company beginning in calendar year 1999. In instances where
approval was not evidenced on or before the original recorded grant date, the Company has revised
the measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to a date after the original grant
date, when the required approval was first evidenced, but not before the employee’s hire date. The
Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of $1.7 million on a
pre-tax basis as a result of these revised measurement dates.

Other Grants

For the remaining population reviewed of stock options granted during the stock option review
period, the Company has concluded that certain actual measurement dates differed from the recorded
grant dates primarily due to a lack of contemporaneous documentation evidencing approval as of the
original recorded grant date. In these circumstances, the Company has revised the measurement date
for accounting purposes for these grants to a date after the original grant date, when the shares
underlying the options to be granted to each employee and the exercise price were first known to be finalized. The primary issue with these grants was that there was insufficient evidence to conclude
that the specific allocation of those shares among the various grant recipients was finalized at the
original recorded grant date. To address these circumstances, the Company has revised the
measurement date for accounting purposes for these grants to a date after the original grant date,
when the allocation of the shares underlying the options and exercise price was first know to be
finalized. The Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of
$8.2 million on a pre-tax basis as a result of these revised measurement dates.

Deemed Modifications to Stock Option Grants Connected with Terminations or Leaves of
Absences

Compensation expense was also recognized as a result of deemed modifications to certain
employee stock option grant awards in connection with certain employees’ terminations or leaves of
absence. Typically such modifications related to extensions of the time employees could exercise
options following their termination of employment or that enabled the employee to vest in
additional shares in relation to a leave of absence or subsequent to their termination thus
triggering a new measurement date under the accounting literature applicable at that time. The
Company has recognized stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, of $9.2 million on a
pre-tax basis as a result of these new measurement dates.

Use of Judgment

The Company evaluated all available evidence for each individual grant within the scope of the
independent review and the revised measurement dates represent the earliest date when the terms of
the options granted to individual recipients were known with finality. The proposed measurement
date for certain grants could not be determined with certainty based on available evidence. In
light of the judgment used to establish the measurement dates, alternate approaches to those used
by the Company could have resulted in different stock-based compensation expense than that recorded
by the Company in the restatements. While the Company has considered these alternative approaches,
it believes its approach is the most appropriate under the circumstances.



Effect of Restatement on Consolidated Financial Statements

The Company previously applied Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees”, and its related interpretations and provided the required pro forma
disclosures under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation”, through its fiscal year ended June 26, 2005. Under APB Opinion No. 25,
non-cash, stock-based compensation expense was required to be recognized for any option for which
the exercise price was below the market price on the actual measurement date. Because certain of
the Company’s options were assessed as having an exercise price below the market price on the
actual measurement date based on the Company’s revised measurement dates as a result of the stock
option review as more fully described above, there is a non-cash deferred compensation charge for
each of these options under APB Opinion No. 25 equal to the number of shares underlying the
options, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price and the market price on the actual
measurement date. That deferred compensation expense is amortized over the vesting period of the
option. The Company also recorded compensation expense under “fair value” accounting when
applicable, for example, for the grant to the nonemployee consultant noted above.

Commencing in its fiscal year ended June 25, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R),
“Share-Based Payment”. As a result, beginning in fiscal year 2006, the additional stock-based
compensation expense required to be recorded for each option with a revised measurement date, as
more fully described above, is equal to the fair value of the option on the revised measurement
date, amortized over the remaining service period of the option. The Company did not record these
stock-based compensation expenses under APB Opinion No. 25 nor SFAS No. 123(R) related to its
options based on the revised measurement dates in the Company’s previously issued financial
statements, and that is why the Company is restating them in this filing. The Company restated its
historical results of operations to record additional pre-tax, non-cash, stock-based compensation
expense of (a) $94.0 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997 through June 26, 2005 under
APB Opinion No. 25 and other applicable accounting rules, and (b) $1.2 million for the year ended
June 25, 2006 under SFAS No. 123(R). As of June 25, 2006, there was less than $0.1 million of
remaining compensation expense to be recorded under SFAS No. 123(R) for stock options with revised
measurement dates. In addition the Company recorded pre-tax payroll related tax expenses of $1.2
million through June 25, 2006.

Diluted shares in fiscal years 2005 and 2006 also increased as a result of the adjustments for
stock options with revised measurement dates. The Company uses the treasury stock method to
calculate the weighted-average shares used in the diluted EPS calculation. As part of the
restatement, the Company revised its treasury stock calculations in accordance with SFAS No. 128,
“Earnings Per Share”. These calculations assume that (i) all dilutive options with revised
measurement dates are exercised, (ii) the Company repurchases shares with the proceeds of these
hypothetical exercises along with the tax benefit resulting from the hypothetical exercises, and
(iii) any average unamortized deferred stock-based compensation is also used to repurchase shares.

As described for each element above, the Company evaluated the impact of the restatements on
its global tax provision. The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in multiple tax
jurisdictions around the world. In certain jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, the United
States, the Company is able to claim a tax deduction relative to stock options. In those
jurisdictions, where a tax deduction is claimed, the Company has recorded deferred tax assets,
totaling $6.2 million at June 25, 2006, to reflect future tax deductions to the extent the Company
believes such assets to be recoverable. Based on this review, the Company now believes that it
should not have taken a United States tax deduction in prior years for stock option related amounts
pertaining to certain executives under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 162(m). Section 162(m)
limits the deductibility of compensation above certain thresholds. As a result, the Company’s tax
carryforward attributes have decreased by approximately $14.6 million as of June 25, 2006.

For those stock option grants determined to have incorrect measurement dates for accounting
purposes and that had been originally issued as incentive stock options, or ISOs, the Company
recorded a liability for payroll tax contingencies in the event such grants would not be respected
as ISOs under the principles of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) and the regulations therein. The
Company recorded expense and accrued liabilities for certain foreign payroll tax contingencies.
The total payroll tax accrued was approximately $1.2 million for annual periods from fiscal year
1997 through fiscal year 2006. This cumulative expense resulted from payroll tax expense recorded
in prior periods has been partially offset by benefits relating to the expiration of the related
statute of limitations.

As a result of the restatement, the cumulative effect of the related after-tax expenses for
the fiscal years ended June 30, 1997 through June 25, 2006 was $65.8 million, as compared to $96.4
million in pre-tax charges as previously discussed. These additional stock-based compensation and
other expenses had no effect on the Company’s reported revenue, cash, cash equivalents or
marketable securities for each of the restated periods. The Company has also restated the pro forma
amortization of deferred stock-based employee compensation included in reported net income, net of
tax, and total stock-based employee compensation expenses determined under fair value based method,
net of tax, under SFAS No. 123 in Note 14, “Equity-Based Compensation Plans” to Consolidated
Financial Statements to reflect the effect of the stock-based compensation expense resulting from
the correction of these past stock option grants.

As a result of the determinations from a voluntary independent stock option review, the Company
considered the application of Section 409A of the IRC to certain stock option grants where, under
APB No. 25, intrinsic value existed at the time of grant. In the event such stock option grants are
not considered as issued at fair market value at the original grant date under the IRC and
applicable regulations thereunder, these options are subject to Section 409A. On March 30, 2008,
the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the Company to assume the liability of any and all
employees, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and certain executive officers, with
options subject to Section 409A. The liability is currently
estimated to be in the range of approximately $50 million to
$55 million. The determinations from the voluntary independent stock option review are more fully
described in Note 3, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” to Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations” in Item 7 of the Company’s 2007 Form 10-K.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation Number 48, “Accounting for Income Tax
Uncertainties” (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes, by prescribing a minimum
recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial
statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognizing, measurement, classification, interest
and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company will adopt FIN 48 as of June 25, 2007.
As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, the Company expects to
decrease the recorded liability for
unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $26.2 million as well as reclass approximately $64.4
million from current to non-current income taxes payable. The Company expects the cumulative
effect of adopting FIN 48 to be a $17.6 million increase to the Company’s opening retained earnings
in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008.

In September 2006, the Staff of the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering
the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements” (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year
misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of determining whether the
current year’s financial statements are materially misstated. The Company applied the provisions
of SAB 108 beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007.

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” (SFAS No. 157), which defines
fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair
value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but rather
eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements. SFAS No.
157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Earlier adoption is permitted,
provided the company has not yet issued financial statements, including interim periods, for that
fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting the provisions of
SFAS No. 157 on its financial position, results of operations and liquidity.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (SFAS No. 159). This
statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items
at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value and establishes
presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that
choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159
is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after November 15,
2007, provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 157. The Company expects
to adopt SFAS No. 159 beginning June 30, 2008 and is currently evaluating the impact that this
pronouncement may have on its consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations”
(SFAS No. 141R). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes
and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed,
any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No. 141R also
establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of
the business combination. SFAS No. 141R is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year
that begins after December 15, 2008. The Company expects to adopt SFAS No. 141R in the beginning
of fiscal year 2010 and is currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of
SFAS No. 141R on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

The Company accounts for its investment portfolio at fair value. Realized gains and
(losses) from investments sold were approximately $0.5 million and $(1.3) million in fiscal year
2007 and approximately $0.1 million and $(0.5) million in fiscal year 2006, respectively. Realized
gains and (losses) for investments sold are specifically identified. Management assesses the fair
value of investments in debt securities that are not actively traded through consideration of
interest rates and their impact on the present value of the cash flows to be received from the
investments. The Company also considers whether changes in the credit ratings of the issuer could
impact the assessment of fair value. The fair value of the Company’s investments in auction rate
preferred securities is based upon par value, which approximates fair value due to the nature of
the instruments.

The Company’s available-for-sale securities are invested in financial instruments with a
minimum rating of A2 / A, as rated by two of the following three rating agencies: Moody’s, Standard
& Poor’s (S&P), or Fitch.



The amortized cost and fair value of cash equivalents and short-term investments and
restricted cash and investments with contractual maturities is as follows:

Management has the ability and intent, if necessary, to liquidate any of its investments in
order to meet the Company’s liquidity needs in the next 12 months. Accordingly, those investments
with contractual maturities greater than one year from the date of purchase have been classified as
short-term on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

On June 16, 2006, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Lam Research International SARL (LRI), as
borrower, entered into a $350 million Credit Agreement (the “LRI Credit Agreement”). Under the LRI
Credit Agreement, on June 19, 2006, LRI borrowed $350 million in principal amount. The loan under
the LRI Credit Agreement shall be fully repaid not later than five years following the closing date
and will bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread (applicable margin) ranging from 0.10% to 0.50%,
depending upon a consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the LRI Credit Agreement. LRI may
prepay the loan under the LRI Credit Agreement in whole or in part at any time without penalty,
subject to reimbursement of lenders’ breakage and redeployment costs in certain cases. The Company
obtained compliance waivers from the lender with respect to the Company’s obligation to deliver
financial statements to the lender under the terms provided in the Guarantee Agreement. Please see
Note 23 “Subsequent Events” below for information regarding termination of the LRI Credit Agreement
and the Company’s entry into a new credit agreement. As of June 24, 2007 the remaining principal
payment was $250 million and due on June 19, 2011 as $100.0 million of the original $350.0 million
debt was repaid during fiscal year 2007. The fair value of long-term debt approximates its carrying
value due to the variable interest rate applicable to the debt.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk consist principally of cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade accounts receivable and
derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities.

As of June 24, 2007, two customers accounted for approximately 10% and 14% of accounts
receivable. As of June 25, 2006 one customer accounted for approximately 15% of accounts
receivable.

As noted above, the Company’s available-for-sale securities are invested in financial
instruments with a minimum rating of A2 / A, as rated by two of the following three rating
agencies: Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s (S&P), or Fitch, respectively and its policy limits the amount
of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer.

Credit risk evaluations, including trade references, bank references and Dun & Bradstreet
ratings are performed on all new customers, and subsequent to credit application approval, the
Company monitors its customers’ financial statements and payment performance. In general, the
Company does not require collateral on sales.

The fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts is estimated based
upon the Japanese yen exchange rates at June 24, 2007 and June 25, 2006, respectively.

At June 24, 2007 and June 25, 2006, the notional amount of outstanding Japanese yen
forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges was $77.6 million and $193.8 million,
respectively. At June 24, 2007 and June 25, 2006, the notional amount of Japanese yen forward
contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges was $30.2 million and $23.5 million,
respectively.

Note 6: Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging

The Company carries derivative financial instruments (derivatives) on the balance sheet
at their fair values in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (SFAS No. 133). The Company has a
policy that allows the use of derivative financial instruments, specifically foreign currency
forward exchange rate contracts, to hedge foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted
revenue transactions denominated in Japanese yen and other foreign currency denominated assets. The
Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

The Company’s policy is to attempt to minimize short-term business exposure to foreign
currency exchange rate risks using an effective and efficient method to eliminate or reduce such
exposures. In the normal course of business, the Company’s financial position is routinely
subjected to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. To protect
against the reduction in value of forecasted Japanese yen-denominated revenues, the Company has
instituted a foreign currency cash flow hedging program. The Company enters into



foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts that generally expire within 12 months, and no
later than 24 months. These foreign currency forward exchange contracts are designated as cash flow
hedges and are carried on the Company’s balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of
the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and
subsequently recognized in revenue in the same period the hedged revenue is recognized.

Each period, hedges are tested for effectiveness using regression testing. Changes in
the fair value of currency forwards due to changes in time value are excluded from the assessment
of effectiveness and are recognized in revenue in the current period. The change in forward time
value was not material for all periods. There were no gains or losses during the twelve months
ended June 24, 2007 and June 25, 2006 associated with ineffectiveness or forecasted transactions
that failed to occur. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship must meet criteria
relating both to the derivative instrument and the hedged item. These include identification of the
hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the hedging
instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or
cash flows will be measured.

To receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented
at the inception of the hedge and the hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to
future cash flows on hedged transactions. When derivative instruments are designated and qualify as
effective cash flow hedges, the Company is able to defer changes in the fair value of the hedging
instrument within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged exposure is
realized. Consequently, with the exception of hedge ineffectiveness recognized, the Company’s
results of operations are not subject to fluctuation as a result of changes in the fair value of
the derivative instruments. If hedges are not highly effective or if the Company does not believe
that the underlying hedged forecasted transactions would occur, the Company may not be able to
account for its investments in derivative instruments as cash flow hedges. If this were to occur,
future changes in the fair values of the Company’s derivative instruments would be recognized in
earnings without the benefits of offsets or deferrals of changes in fair value arising from hedge
accounting treatment. At June 24, 2007, the Company expects to reclassify the entire amount of
$3.7 million of gains accumulated in other comprehensive income to earnings during the next 12
months due to the recognition in earnings of the hedged forecasted transactions.

The Company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts to hedge
the gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of Japanese yen-denominated receivable
balances. Under SFAS No. 133, these forward contracts are not designated for hedge accounting
treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded into earnings as a
component of other income and expense and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency
denominated intercompany and trade receivables, recorded in other income and expense, assuming the
hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances.

Note 12: Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed,
using the treasury stock method, as though all potential common shares that are dilutive were
outstanding during the period. The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and
denominators of the basic and diluted computations for net income per share.

Note 14: Equity-Based Compensation Plans

The Company has adopted stock plans that provide for the grant to employees of
equity-based awards, including stock options and restricted stock units, of Lam Research Common
Stock. In addition, these plans permit the grant of nonstatutory equity-based awards to paid
consultants and outside directors. According to the plans, the equity-based award price is
determined by the Board of Directors or its designee, the plan administrator, but in no event will
it be less than the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant.
Equity-based awards granted under the plans vest over a period determined by the Board of Directors
or the plan administrator. The Company also has an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) that allows
employees to purchase its Common Stock.

The Company awarded a total of 1,091,897 and 1,053,584 restricted stock units during
fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. Certain of these restricted stock units contain
Company-specific performance targets. As of June 24, 2007, 1,843,675 restricted stock units remain
subject to vesting requirements.

The 2007 Stock Incentive Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified equity-based
awards to eligible employees, consultants and advisors, and non-employee directors of the Company
and its subsidiaries. Additional shares are reserved for issuance pursuant to awards previously
granted under the Company’s 1997 Stock Incentive Plan and its 1999 Stock Option Plan. As of June
24, 2007 there were a total of 5,128,815 shares subject to options and restricted stock units
issued and outstanding under the Company’s Stock Plans. As of June 24, 2007, there were a total of
23,999,837 shares available for future issuance under the 1997, 1999, and 2007 Plans (the “Plans”)
of which 14,046,931 are available from the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan.

The ESPP allows employees to designate a portion of their base compensation to be used to
purchase the Company’s Common Stock at a purchase price per share of the lower of 85% of the fair
market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the first or last day of the applicable offering
period. Typically, each offering period lasts 12 months and comprises three interim purchase dates.
In fiscal year 2004, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the 1999 ESPP to (i) each
year automatically increase the number of shares available for issuance under the plan by a
specific amount on a one-for-one basis with shares of Common Stock that the Company will redeem in
public market and private purchases for such purpose and (ii) to authorize the Plan Administrator
(the “Compensation Committee of the Board”) to set a limit on the number of shares a plan
participant can purchase on any single plan exercise date. The automatic annual increase provides
that the number of shares in the plan reserve available for issuance shall be increased on the
first business day of each calendar year commencing with 2004, on a one-for-one basis with each
share of Common Stock that the Company redeems, in public-market or private purchases, and
designates for this purpose, by a number of shares equal to the lesser of (i) 2,000,000, (ii) one
and one-half percent (1.5%) of the number of shares of all classes of Common Stock of the Company
outstanding on the first business day of such calendar year, or (iii) a lesser number determined by
the Plan Administrator. During fiscal years 2007 and 2006, the number of shares of Lam Research
Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 1999 ESPP increased by 2.0 million shares in each
fiscal year, subject to repurchase of an equal number of shares in public market or private
purchases. There were no increases to the reserve during fiscal year 2005.

During fiscal year 2007, 564,332 shares of the Company’s Common Stock were sold to
employees under the 1999 ESPP. A total of 10,244,945 shares of the Company’s Common Stock have been
issued under the 1999 ESPP through June 24, 2007, at prices ranging from $4.11 to $42.04 per share.
At June 24, 2007, 4,748,883 shares were available for purchase under the 1999 ESPP.

The Company accounts for equity-based compensation in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123R), which
the Company adopted as of June 27, 2005 using the modified prospective method. The Company
recognized equity-based compensation expense of $35.6 million during fiscal year 2007 and $24.0
million during fiscal year 2006, respectively. The income tax benefit recognized in the
consolidated statements of operations related to equity-based compensation expense was $5.8 million
during fiscal year 2007 and $5.2 million during fiscal year 2006. The estimated fair
value of the Company’s stock-based awards, less expected forfeitures, is amortized over the awards’
vesting period on a straight-line basis for awards granted after the adoption of SFAS No. 123R and
on a graded vesting basis for awards granted prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R.

The modified prospective transition method of SFAS No. 123R requires the presentation of
pro forma information, for periods presented prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, regarding net
income (loss) and net income (loss) per share as if the Company had accounted for its stock plans
under the fair value method of SFAS No. 123R. For pro forma purposes, fair value of stock options
and ESPP awards was



estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model and amortized on a graded vesting basis.
The fair value of all of the Company’s equity-based awards was estimated assuming no expected
dividends and estimates of expected life, volatility and risk-free interest rate at the time of
grant. We recognized equity-based compensation expense under the provisions of SFAS No. 123R
during fiscal years 2007 and 2006 while fiscal year 2005 was under the provisions of APB No. 25.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and net income per share if the Company
had accounted for its stock plans under the fair value method of accounting under SFAS No. 123 in
all periods:

Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units

Stock Options

The Company did not grant any stock options during fiscal years 2007 and 2006. The fair
value of the Company’s stock options issued prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R was estimated
using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. This model requires the input of highly subjective
assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. Prior
to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company used historical volatility as a basis for calculating
expected volatility.

The year -end intrinsic value relating to stock options for fiscal years 2007 and 2006 is
presented below:

As of June 24, 2007, there was $0.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost
related to nonvested stock options granted and outstanding; that cost is expected to be recognized
through fiscal year 2009, with a weighted average remaining vesting period of  0.6 years. Cash
received from stock option exercises was $42.5 million and $179.4 million during fiscal years 2007
and 2006, respectively.



Restricted Stock Units

The fair value of the Company’s restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair
market value of the Company’s stock at the date of grant. As of June 24, 2007, there was $46.7
million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock units
granted; that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining vesting period of
0.8 years.

ESPP

ESPP awards were valued using the Black-Scholes model. ESPP awards for offering periods
subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R were valued using the Black-Scholes model with expected
volatility calculated using implied volatility. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company
used historical volatility in deriving its expected volatility assumption. The Company determined,
for purposes of valuing ESPP awards, that implied volatility provides a more accurate reflection of
market conditions and is a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility.
During fiscal years 2007 and 2006 ESPP was valued assuming no expected dividends and the following
weighted-average assumptions:

As of June 24, 2007, there was $1.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost

months.

Note 15: Profit Sharing and Benefit Plans

Profit sharing is awarded to certain employees based upon performance against specific
corporate financial and operating goals. Distributions to employees by the Company are based upon a
percentage of earned compensation, provided that a threshold level of the Company’s financial and
performance goals are met. In addition to profit sharing the Company has other bonus plans based on
achievement of profitability and other specific performance criteria. Charges to expense under
these plans were $102.0 million, $70.8 million, and $63.1 million during fiscal years 2007, 2006,
and 2005, respectively.

The Company maintains a 401(k)-retirement savings plan for its full-time employees in
North America. Commencing September 1, 2006, each participant in the plan may elect to contribute
from 2% to 75% of his or her annual salary to the plan, subject to statutory limitations. Prior to
September 1, 2006, the contribution range was from 2% to 20%. The Company makes matching employee
contributions in cash to the plan at the rate of 50% of the first 6% of salary contributed.
Employees participating in the 401(k)-retirement savings plan are 100% vested in the Company
matching contributions and investments are directed by participants. The Company made matching
contributions of approximately $4.4 million, $3.5 million, and $3.2 million in fiscal years 2007,
2006, and 2005, respectively.

The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Number
158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment
of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)” (SFAS No. 158) as of June 24, 2007. The
incremental effect of applying the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158 was to record an other
long-term liability of $0.8 million with a corresponding amount recorded as an adjustment to the
balance of accumulated other comprehensive income.



Note 16: Commitments

The Company has certain obligations, some of which are recorded on its balance sheet
and some which are not, to make future payments under various contracts. Obligations are recorded
on the Company’s balance sheet in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
The obligations recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet include its long-term debt
which is outlined in the following table and discussed below. The Company’s off-balance sheet
arrangements include certain contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and
purchase obligations in the tables below. The Company’s combined contractual cash obligations and
commitments relating to these agreements, and its guarantees are

Operating Leases

The Company leases most of its administrative, R&D and manufacturing facilities, regional
sales/service offices and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases, which expire at
various dates through 2021. Certain of the Company’s facility leases for buildings located at its
Fremont, California headquarters and certain other facility leases provide the Company with an
option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of the
Company’s facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of
inflation. Rent expense was $11.0 million, $8.9 million, and $6.5 million during fiscal years
2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

Included in the operating leases less than 1 year section of the table above is
$75.0 million in guaranteed residual values for lease agreements relating to certain properties at
the Company’s Fremont, California campus. As part of the lease agreements, the Company has the
option to purchase the remaining buildings at any time for a total purchase price for all remaining
properties related to these leases of approximately $85.0 million. The Company is required to
guarantee the lessor a residual value on the properties of up to $75.0 million at the end of the
lease terms in fiscal year 2008 (in the event that the leases are not renewed, the Company does not
exercise the purchase options, the lessor sells the properties and the sale price is less than the
lessor’s costs). The Company maintains cash collateral of $85.0 million as part of the lease
agreements as of June 24, 2007 in separate, specified certificates of deposit and interest-bearing
accounts which are recorded as restricted cash and investments in the Company’s Consolidated
Balance Sheet. The lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company
that does not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity (VIE) as defined by FASB
Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” and is therefore not
consolidated by the Company. The Company obtained compliance waivers from the lessor with respect
to the Company’s obligation to deliver financial statements to the lessor under the terms provided
in the lease agreements. Please see Note 23 “Subsequent Events” below for additional information
regarding renewal of the leases noted above and entry into additional leases.

The remaining operating lease balances primarily relate to non-cancelable
facility-related operating leases.



Purchase Obligations

Purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual
basis or over multi-year periods related to the Company’s outsourcing activities or other material
commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories. The Company continues to enter into new
agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain activities, including elements of
its manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance, certain information technology
functions, and certain transactional general and administrative functions. The contractual cash
obligations and commitments table presented above contains the Company’s minimum obligations at
June 24, 2007 under these arrangements and others. Actual expenditures will vary based on the
volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition to these
obligations, certain of these agreements include early termination provisions and/or cancellation
penalties which could increase or decrease amounts actually paid.

Consignment inventories, which are owned by vendors but located in the Company’s storage
locations and warehouses and properly segregated and controlled, are not reported as the Company’s
inventory until title is transferred to the Company or its purchase obligation is determined. At
June 24, 2007, vendor-owned inventories held at the Company’s locations and not reported as its
inventory were $27.4 million.

Long-Term Debt and Interest Expense

On June 16, 2006, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Lam Research International SARL
(LRI), as borrower, entered into a $350 million Credit Agreement (the LRI Credit Agreement). Under
the LRI Credit Agreement, on June 19, 2006, LRI borrowed $350 million in principal amount. The loan
under the LRI Credit Agreement shall be fully repaid not later than five years following the
closing date and will bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread (applicable margin) ranging from 0.10%
to 0.50%, depending upon a consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. LRI may
prepay the loan under the LRI Credit Agreement in whole or in part at any time without penalty,
subject to reimbursement of lenders’ breakage and redeployment costs in certain cases. The Company
obtained compliance waivers from the lender with respect to the Company’s obligation to deliver
financial statements to the lender under the terms provided in the Guarantee Agreement. The amounts in the table above include the
remaining principal payment of $250 million due on June 19, 2011. $100.0 million of the original $350.0 million debt was repaid during fiscal year
2007. The fair value of long-term debt approximates its carrying value due to the variable interest
rate applicable to the debt. Please see
Note 23 “Subsequent Events” below for information regarding termination of the LRI Credit Agreement
and the Company’s entry into a new credit agreement.

The Company used the proceeds from the credit facility entered into by LRI to facilitate
a portion of the repatriation of $500 million of foreign earnings in fiscal year 2006 under the
provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act.

Note 17: Guarantees

The Company accounts for its guarantees in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 45 “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (FIN No. 45). FIN No. 45
requires a company that is a guarantor to make specific disclosures about its obligations under
certain guarantees that it has issued. FIN No. 45 also requires a company (the Guarantor) to
recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in
issuing the guarantee.

The Company leases several facilities at its headquarters location in Fremont,
California. As part of certain of the lease agreements, the Company has the option to purchase the
remaining buildings at any time for a total purchase price for all remaining properties related to
these leases of approximately $85.0 million. The Company is required to guarantee the lessor a
residual value on the properties of up to $75.0 million at the end of the lease terms in the event
that the leases are not renewed, the Company does not exercise the purchase options, the lessor
sells the properties and the sale price is less than the lessor’s costs. As of June 24, 2007, the
Company had $85.0 million in separate, specified certificates of deposit and interest bearing
accounts, as collateral required under the lease agreements. These are recorded as restricted
cash and investments in its Consolidated Balance Sheet. These lease terms expire in fiscal year
2008. The lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that does
not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity (VIE) as defined by FASB Interpretation
No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” and is therefore not consolidated by the
Company. The Company obtained compliance waivers from the lessor with respect to the Company’s
obligation to deliver financial statements to the lessor under the terms provided in the lease
agreements. Please see Note 23 “Subsequent Events” for additional information regarding renewal of
the leases noted above and entry into additional leases.

The Company has issued certain indemnifications to its lessors under some of its
agreements. The Company has entered into certain insurance contracts which may limit its exposure
to such indemnifications. As of June 24, 2007, the Company has not recorded any liability on its
financial statements in connection with these indemnifications, as it does not believe, based on
information available, that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees.

On
June 16, 2006, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, LRI, as borrower, entered
into the LRI Credit Agreement. In
connection with the LRI Credit Agreement, the Company entered into a Guarantee Agreement (the
“Guarantee Agreement”) guaranteeing the obligations of LRI under the LRI Credit Agreement. The
Company’s obligations under the Guarantee Agreement are collateralized by readily marketable
securities in an amount equal to 110% of the outstanding balance of its obligations under the
Guarantee Agreement, representing $275.0 million at June 24, 2007 as the Company had paid down



$100.0 million of the existing debt during fiscal year 2007. This collateral is reflected in the
balance of restricted cash and investments in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The
Company obtained compliance waivers from the lender with respect to the Company’s obligation to
deliver financial statements to the lender under the terms provided in the Guarantee Agreement.
Please see Note 23 “Subsequent Events” below for information regarding termination of the LRI
Credit Agreement and the Guarantee Agreement, the Company’s entry into a new credit agreement, and
the entry of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary Bullen Semiconductor Corporation into a new
guarantee agreement with respect to the new credit agreement.

Generally, the Company indemnifies, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, its
customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by the Company’s products or
services. The Company seeks to limit its liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed
the sales price of the products or services subject to its indemnification obligations. The Company
does not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any material amounts
will be paid under these guarantees.

The Company offers standard warranties on its systems that run generally for a period of
12 months from system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from the date of shipment of the system
to the customer. The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by
type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as the
impact of system reliability improvements.

Realization of the Company’s net deferred tax assets is based upon the weight of available
evidence, including such factors as the recent earnings history and expected future taxable income.
The Company believes it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however,
ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not
known or anticipated at this time.

Deferred tax assets relating to tax benefits of employee stock option grants have been reduced
to reflect the exercises in fiscal year 2007 and 2006. Some exercises resulted in tax deductions in excess
of previously recorded benefits based on the option value at the time of grant (“windfalls”).
Although these additional tax benefits are reflected in net operating loss carryforwards, pursuant
to SFAS 123(R), the additional tax benefit associated with the windfall is not recognized until the
tax benefits reduce cash taxes payable, at which time



the Company
will credit equity. During fiscal year 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded a net credit to equity
of $62.4 million and $17.3 million, respectively.

At June 24, 2007, the Company had federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately
$149.1 million, of which approximately $98.7 million will expire in varying amounts between fiscal
years 2011 and 2028. The remaining balance of $50.4 million of tax carryforwards may be carried
forward indefinitely. The tax benefits relating to approximately
$131.7 million of the tax credit carryforwards will be credited
to equity when recognized, in accordance with SFAS No. 123R.

A reconciliation of income tax expense provided at the federal statutory rate (35% in fiscal
years 2007, 2006 and 2005) to actual income expense is as follows:

See Note 3 “Restatements of Consolidated Financial Statements” to Consolidated Financial
Statements

As a result of an Advanced Pricing Agreement with the IRS, the Company reversed its related
tax reserve and increased its net operating loss carryforward balance which resulted in a net tax
benefit of $39.5 million during the quarter ended September 24, 2006. The Company also recorded
tax expense of $29.5 million related to the application of foreign tax rulings in the same quarter.

Effective from fiscal year 2003 through June 2013, the Company has negotiated a tax holiday on
certain foreign earnings, which is conditional upon the Company meeting certain employment and
investment thresholds. The impact of the tax holiday decreased income taxes by approximately $48.4
million for fiscal year 2007 as compared to $72.0 million in fiscal year 2006. The benefit of the
tax holiday on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.34 in fiscal year 2007 as
compared to $0.50 in fiscal year 2006. There was no such benefit in fiscal year 2005.

Unremitted earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries included in consolidated retained
earnings aggregated to approximately $825.2 million at June 24, 2007. These earnings, which
reflect full provisions for foreign income taxes, are indefinitely invested in foreign operations.
If these earnings were remitted to the United States, they would be subject to U.S. taxes of
approximately $204.4 million at current statutory rates. The Company’s federal income tax provision
includes U.S. income taxes on certain foreign-based income.

Note 19 — Acquisitions

During the quarter ended December 24, 2006, the Company acquired the U.S. silicon growing
and silicon fabrication assets of Bullen Ultrasonics, Inc. The Company was the largest customer of
the Bullen Ultrasonics silicon business. The silicon business has become a division of the Company
post-acquisition while Bullen Ultrasonics retains assets unrelated to the silicon growing and
silicon fabrication business.

The acquisition includes assets related to Bullen Ultrasonics’ silicon growing and
silicon fabrication business, including assets of Bullen Ultrasonics and Bullen Semiconductor
(Suzhou) Co., Ltd., a wholly foreign-owned enterprise established in Suzhou, Jiangsu, People’s
Republic of China (PRC). The closing of the U.S. asset acquisition occurred on November 13, 2006.
The acquisition of the Suzhou assets has not yet occurred as of the date of this filing. The assets
acquired consist of fixtures, intellectual property, equipment, inventory, material and supplies,
contracts relating to the conduct of the business, certain licenses and permits issued by
government authorities for use in connection with the operations of Eaton, Ohio and Suzhou
manufacturing facilities, real property and leaseholds connected with such facilities, data and
records related to the operation of the silicon growing and silicon fabrication business and
certain proprietary rights.

Pursuant to the First Amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement dated October 5, 2006,
the parties to the Asset Purchase Agreement agreed that the closing of the sale of the Suzhou
assets would take place within 5 business days following receipt by the parties of all necessary
approvals, consents and authorizations of governmental and provincial authorities in the PRC and
satisfaction of other customary conditions and covenants. The Company will pay the $2.5 million
purchase price for the Suzhou assets upon the receipt of the approvals and satisfaction of
conditions noted above.

The acquisition supports the competitive position and capability primarily of the
Company’s dielectric Etch products by providing access to and control of critical intellectual
property and manufacturing technology related to the production of silicon parts in the Company’s
processing chambers. The Company funded the purchase price of the acquisition with existing cash
resources.



The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards Number 141, “Business Combinations” and all amounts were recorded
at their estimated fair value. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the operating results
from the date of acquisition. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the
effects of the acquisition were not material to the Company’s results.

The Company recognized $9.2 million and $0.3 million in intangible asset amortization expense
during fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” (SFAS No. 142).
SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. SFAS No. 142 also
requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective
estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in
accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” The
Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually. In addition, the Company reviews goodwill and other
intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable.

Note 21: Segment, Geographic Information and Major Customers

The Company operates in one business segment: manufacturing and servicing of front-end wafer
processing semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The Company’s material operating units qualify
for aggregation under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, “Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,” due to their identical customer base and
similarities in economic characteristics, nature of products and services, and processes for
procurement, manufacturing and distribution.

The Company operates in six geographic regions: the United States, Europe, Taiwan, Korea,
Japan, and Asia Pacific. For geographical reporting, revenues are attributed to the geographic
location in which the customers’ facilities are located while long-lived assets are attributed to
the geographic locations in which the assets are located.

Note 22: Legal Proceedings

From time to time, the Company has received notices from third parties alleging infringement
of such parties’ patent or other intellectual property rights by the Company’s products. In such
cases it is the Company’s policy to defend the claims, or if considered appropriate, negotiate
licenses on commercially reasonable terms. However, no assurance can be given that the Company will
be able in the future to negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all,
or that any litigation resulting from such claims would not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s consolidated financial position or operating results.



Note 23: Subsequent Events

SEZ Transaction

: On March 11, 2008, the Company completed the tender offer for the
outstanding shares of SEZ Holding AG (“SEZ”), the leading supplier of single-wafer clean technology
and products to the global semiconductor manufacturing industry. Upon the completion of the tender,
the Company acquired approximately 94% of the outstanding shares of SEZ. The Company expects to
take additional steps as necessary to acquire the SEZ shares that remain outstanding.

The tender offer was conducted pursuant to the terms of a Transaction Agreement entered into
on December 10, 2007 by and between the Company and SEZ (the “Transaction Agreement”). Under the
terms of the Transaction Agreement, the Company acquired all shares of SEZ that were tendered in
the offer at a price of CHF 38 per share in cash, for a total price of CHF 606 million, which
approximated US$584 million.

In December 2007, the Company purchased a call option with a notional amount of approximately
CHF 641 million to hedge the currency exposure in connection with the anticipated purchase of the
shares of SEZ as noted above. The call option premium cost was $10.3 million. The mark-to-market
value of the call option as of December 23, 2007 was $3.1 million resulting in a $7.2 million
unrealized loss recorded in other income (expense), net in the Company’s condensed consolidated
statements of operations for the quarter ended December 23,
2007. In February 2008 the Company extended the expiration date of the call option at an additional
premium cost of $2.4 million. The Company exercised the call option during March 2008 which
resulted in a gain of $40.7 million which it will record in other income (expense), net in its
condensed consolidated statements of operations for the quarter ending March 30, 2008.

Operating Leases

: On December 18, 2007, the Company entered into a series of two operating
leases (the “Livermore Leases”) regarding certain improved properties in Livermore, California. On
December 21, 2007, the Company entered into a series of four
amended and restated operating leases (the “New Fremont
Leases,” and collectively with the Livermore Leases, the “Operating Leases”) with
regard to certain improved properties at the Company’s headquarters in Fremont, California. Each of
the Operating Leases is an off-balance sheet arrangement.

The Operating Leases (and associated documents for each Operating Lease) were entered into by
the Company and BNP Paribas Leasing Corporation (“BNPPLC”).

Each Livermore Lease facility has an approximately seven-year term (inclusive of an initial
construction period during which BNPPLC’s and the Company’s obligations will be governed by the
Construction Agreement entered into with regard to such Livermore Lease facility) ending on the
first business day in January 2015. Total scheduled rent payments under the Livermore Leases are
estimated to be approximately $25.7 million in the aggregate (based on one-month LIBOR rates at the
time of entering into the leases), following completion of improvements to each property.

Each New Fremont Lease has an approximately seven-year term ending on the first business day
in January, 2015. Total scheduled rent payments under the New Fremont Leases are approximately
$32.4 million in the aggregate (based upon three-month LIBOR rates at the time of entering into
leases).

Under each Operating Lease, the Company may, at its discretion and with 30 days’ notice, elect
to purchase the property that is the subject of the Operating Lease for an amount approximating the
sum required to prepay the amount of BNPPLC’s investment in the property and any accrued but unpaid
rent. Any such amount may also include an additional make-whole amount for early redemption of the
outstanding investment, which will vary depending on prevailing interest rates at the time of
prepayment.

The Company is required, pursuant to the terms of the Operating Leases and associated
documents, to maintain collateral in an aggregate of approximately $165.0 million (upon completion
of the Livermore construction) in separate interest-bearing accounts with BNPPLC (or a third party,
currently State Street Bank and Trust, with regard to the Livermore Leases) as security for the
Company’s obligations under the Operating Leases.

Upon expiration of the term of an Operating Lease, the property subject to that Operating
Lease may be remarketed. The Company has guaranteed to BNPPLC that each property will have a
certain minimum residual value, as set forth in the applicable Operating Lease. The aggregate
guarantee made by the Company under the Operating Leases is no more than approximately $141.8
million (although, under certain default circumstances, the guarantee with regard to an Operating
Lease may be 100% of BNPPLC’s investment in the applicable property; in the aggregate, the amounts
payable under such guarantees will be no more than $165.0 million plus related indemnification or
other obligations).

Under each Operating Lease and its associated documents, the Company is subject to a financial
covenant requiring it to maintain unrestricted cash, unencumbered cash investments, and
unencumbered marketable securities of at least $300.0 million (not including the collateral
maintained as security for the Company’s obligations under the Operating Leases).



The Operating Leases are subject to customary default provisions, including, without
limitation, those relating to payment defaults under the Operating Leases and associated documents,
payment defaults under other indebtedness of the Company, performance defaults under the Operating
Leases (including cross-defaults between each of the Operating Leases), and events of bankruptcy.
In the event that such defaults occur and are continuing, BNPPLC may accelerate repayment of a
portion or all of its investment under the applicable Operating Leases; alternatively, BNPPLC may
require the Company to pay all amounts due under one or more Operating Leases through the end of
the term of the applicable Operating Leases.

Credit Agreement

: On March 3, 2008, the Company, as borrower, entered into a $250 million
Credit Agreement, dated as of March 3, 2008 (the “Credit Agreement”) with ABN AMRO BANK N.V (the
“Agent”), as administrative agent for the lenders party to the Credit Agreement, and such lenders.
Bullen Semiconductor Corporation, a wholly-owned domestic subsidiary of the Company (“Bullen”),
entered into a guarantee (the “Bullen Guarantee”) to guarantee the obligations of the Company under
the Credit Agreement. In connection with the Credit Agreement, the Company and Bullen entered into
certain collateral documents (collectively, the “Collateral Documents”) including a Security
Agreement by the Company (the “Security Agreement”), a Security Agreement by Bullen (the “Bullen
Security Agreement”), a Pledge Agreement by the Company (the “Pledge Agreement”) and other
Collateral Documents to secure the Company’s obligations under the Credit Agreement. The
Collateral Documents encumber current and future accounts receivables, inventory, equipment and
related assets of the Company and Bullen, as well as 100% of the Company’s ownership interest in
Bullen and 65% of the Company’s ownership interest in Lam Research International BV, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company. In addition, the Credit Agreement provides that any future domestic
subsidiaries of the Company will also enter into a similar guarantee and collateral documents to
encumber the foregoing type of assets.

Under the Credit Agreement, the Company borrowed $250 million in principal amount for general
corporate purposes. The loan under the Credit Agreement is a non-revolving term loan with the
following repayment terms: (a) $12.5 million of the principal amount due on each of (i) September
30, 2008, (ii) March 31, 2009 and (iii) September 30, 2009 and (b) the payment of the remaining
principal amount on March 6, 2010. The outstanding principal amount bears interest at LIBOR plus
0.75% per annum or, alternatively, at the Agent’s “prime rate.” The Company may prepay the loan
under the Credit Agreement in whole or in part at any time without penalty. The Credit Agreement
contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default, as
well as various negative covenants (including maximum leverage ratio, minimum liquidity and minimum
EBITDA).

As a condition to funding under the Credit Agreement, the outstanding balance ($250 million)
under the LRI Credit Agreement was repaid in full. LRI is our wholly-owned subsidiary. In
addition, the Guarantee Agreement was also terminated. Our obligations under the Guarantee
Agreement were fully collateralized by cash and cash equivalents.

Section
409A:

As a result of the determinations from a voluntary independent stock option review, the Company
considered the application of Section 409A of the IRC to certain stock option grants where, under
APB No. 25, intrinsic value existed at the time of grant. In the event such stock option grants are
not considered as issued at fair market value at the original grant date under the IRC and
applicable regulations thereunder, these options are subject to Section 409A. On March 30, 2008,
the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the Company to assume the liability of any and all
employees, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and certain executive officers, with
options subject to Section 409A. The liability is currently
estimated to be in the range of approximately $50 million to
$55 million. The determinations from the voluntary independent stock option review are more fully
described in Note 3, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” to Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations” in Item 7 of the Company’s 2007 Form 10-K.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lam Research Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lam Research Corporation as of June 24,
2007 and June 25, 2006 (restated), and the related consolidated
statements of operations,
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years ended
June 24, 2007, June 25, 2006 (restated) and June 26,
2005 (restated). Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item
15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Lam Research Corporation at June 24, 2007 and June
25, 2006 (restated), and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for
the years ended June 24, 2007, June 25, 2006 (restated) and
June 26, 2005 (restated), in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in
all material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 3, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” the Company has restated
previously issued financial statements as of June 25, 2006 and for each of the years in the two
year period ended June 25, 2006.

As discussed in Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, under the heading
Equity-Based Compensation-Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Plans, in fiscal 2006 Lam
Research Corporation changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), Lam Research Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of
June 24, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and
our report dated March 31,
2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lam Research Corporation

We have audited Lam Research Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of June
24, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Lam Research
Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Lam Research Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of June 24, 2007, based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Lam Research Corporation as of June 24,
2007 and June 25, 2006 (restated), and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the years ended
June 24, 2007, June 25, 2006 (restated) and June 26,
2005 (restated) of Lam Research Corporation and our report dated
March 31, 2008 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.
