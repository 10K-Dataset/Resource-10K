Item 1.

Business

Lam Research Corporation (Lam or the Company), a Delaware corporation, was
founded in 1980 and is headquartered in Fremont, California. The mailing
address for our principal executive offices is 4650 Cushing Parkway, Fremont,
California 94538, and our telephone number is (510) 572-0200. Additional
information about Lam is available on our web site at http://www.lamrc.com.
Our Forms 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and Forms 8-K are available online at the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) web site on the Internet. The address
of that site is http://www.sec.gov. We also make available free of charge the
Forms 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and Forms 8-K and amendments to those reports on our
corporate web site at http://www.lamrc.com, as soon as reasonably practicable
after we electronically file the reports with, or furnish them to, the SEC.

We design, manufacture, market, and service semiconductor processing
equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits and are recognized as
a major supplier of such equipment to the worldwide semiconductor
industry. Semiconductor wafers
are subjected to a complex series of process steps that result in the
simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits. Our etch and
chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) products selectively remove portions of
various films from the wafer to create semiconductors. We leverage our
expertise in these areas to also develop



intellectual property (IP) for integrated processing solutions.

Etch processes, which are repeated numerous times during the wafer
fabrication cycle, are required to manufacture every type of semiconductor
device produced today. Our current range of etch systems employ Lam’s TCP

®

high density and Dual Frequency Confined

TM

(DFC

TM

) medium density plasma
sources to etch device features at current generation geometries and smaller
than 100 nanometers (nm) in size.

CMP products are used to planarize the surface of the wafer to prepare it
for further processing. Our Teres

®

CMP products utilize a linear planarization
technology for manufacturing complex integrated circuits with features 0.13
microns (130 nm) and smaller with multiple metal layers. Our
200/300-mm CMP
systems provide integrated polishing and post-CMP cleaning solutions.

Etch Process

The etch process defines linewidths and other microscopic features on
integrated circuits. Plasma etching was developed to meet the demand for
device geometries smaller than 3 microns. Plasma consists of ions and neutral
species that react with exposed portions of the wafer surface to remove
dielectric, metal, or polysilicon material and produce the finely delineated
features and patterns of an integrated circuit.

Advanced integrated circuit manufacturing requires etch systems capable of
creating 0.13-micron features for current-generation products and below 100 nm
for future semiconductor products. The trend toward feature sizes in the
100-nm range accompanies a transition from aluminum to copper conductive lines
for faster device processing speeds. Subsequent feature size reductions below
100 nm will begin to integrate more fragile insulating dielectric materials
(low k and porous low k) in between conductive lines. In addition to
continually shrinking feature sizes, advanced manufacturing facilities are now
producing integrated circuits on 200-mm (8-inch) silicon wafers as well as on
wafer diameters of 300 mm (12 inch). To accommodate these decreasing
linewidths and increasing wafer diameters, semiconductor manufacturers will
continue to require more precise control over the etching process.

Several of our etch products are available as standalone (one chamber)
systems or as clusters (multi-chamber systems) using the Alliance

®

or 2300

TM

Etch Series platforms.

Dielectric Etch Products

4520 Series Systems.

The 4520 system processes wafer sizes up to 200 mm.

4520XL

E

TM

System

. The 4520XL

E

system introduced Lam’s proprietary DFC
plasma technology, which reduces plasma volume and sidewall polymer
accumulation for cleaner, low-cost operation. Additionally, it offers a wider
process window than the 4520 system with capability to etch geometries below
0.18 microns.

Exelan

®

,
Exelan

®

High Performance,
Exelan

®

HPT, and 2300 Exelan

®

Systems.

The Exelan family of products extends DFC technology to create smaller feature
sizes and mixes sequential etch process steps in the same chamber. These
integrated capabilities developed by Lam improve productivity and lower the
cost of ownership for our customers. Exelan was introduced in July 1999 to
define the structures required for manufacturing copper conductive lines in
semiconductors utilizing traditional insulating dielectric films. Exelan High
Performance, introduced in 2001, extends Exelan’s capabilities for etching
newer low k insulating dielectric films. Exelan HPT, introduced early in 2002,
targets sub-0.13 micron geometries.

The 2300 Exelan system addresses process requirements down to sub-65 nm
for 200-mm and 300-mm wafer sizes

.

Process chambers can be converted within
our customers’ fabrication



facilities from 200 mm to 300 mm, which has the advantage of providing greater
flexibility and lowering costs. This capability, combined with an overall
system footprint comparable to 200-mm systems, allows semiconductor
manufacturers to develop integrated circuits using 200-mm wafers instead of
expensive 300-mm wafers and later scale up to 300-mm wafer processing.

Conductor Etch Products

TCP

®

9400 and TCP

®

9600 Series and 2300 Versys

TM

Series Systems

. The
first TCP products were introduced in late 1992. They use Lam’s patented
Transformer Coupled Plasma source technology, a high-density, low-pressure
plasma source that can etch features well below 100 nm. For 200-mm wafer
sizes, we offer the TCP

®

9400PTX and TCP

®

9400DFM for silicon etch applications
and the TCP

®

9600PTX and TCP

®

9600DFM for metal etch applications. These
systems are used in the production of a broad range of advanced logic and
memory devices with feature sizes below 0.13 microns.

The 2300 Versys system for etching silicon and metal films employs a
scaled design of TCP technology to address leading-edge device structure
requirements. The 2300 Versys system has the capability to process 200- or
300-mm wafer sizes. The 2300 Versys Star

TM

silicon etch system enables
sequential step tuning of gas flow and wafer temperature, which provides the
critical dimension uniformity required for geometries down to sub-65 nm.

CMP and CMP Wafer Cleaning Processes

With increasingly smaller geometries, more layers are required to connect
the individual devices of an integrated circuit. Each additional layer
exaggerates the uneven topography of the previous ones. This effect creates a
depth-of-focus problem for subsequent photolithographic steps, which diminishes
the precision of the linewidth dimensions. The CMP process removes excess
material from the wafer surface by a combination of chemical and abrasive
actions to provide a flatter surface, improving photolithography results.
Additionally, CMP processes are required for the creation of copper conductive
lines. Removing the residue of the abrasive and chemical materials used in CMP
requires special cleaning techniques following processing.

CMP with Integrated Clean Products

Teres and 200/300-mm CMP systems.

We offer 200-mm Teres and 200/300-mm
CMP systems with integrated Synergy

TM

based cleaning systems. These tools
target advanced copper/low k and shallow trench isolation (STI) applications as
well as high-productivity interlayer dielectric (ILD) processes. The systems
incorporate our Linear Planarization Technology

TM

(LPT

TM

), which uses a
high-speed belt combined with patented air-bearing platen capability. These
features achieve uniformity control across the wafer surface by changing the
shape of the belt (pad) using air pressure. Independent zones can be adjusted
to change the pad pressure instead of bending the wafer backside so that
expensive 300-mm wafers and fragile multi-layer low k film stacks are not
unnecessarily stressed during processing.

Standalone Clean Products

Synergy.

Synergy products combine DSS

®

technology and Chemical Mechanical
Cleaning

TM

(CMC

TM

) technology to perform mechanical and chemical cleaning in a
single-step process. The Synergy Integra

TM

incorporates Synergy’s cleaning
technology with a platform that can be integrated with other suppliers’
polishing systems. Certain integrated systems in the industry are the result
of development relationships between Lam and other polishing vendors. In
addition to handling the clean step following CMP applications, the Synergy
standalone clean system is used to clean wafers both before and after a range
of semiconductor processing steps.

Research and Development

The market for semiconductor capital equipment is characterized by rapid
technological change and product innovation. Our ability to maintain
competitive advantage depends in part on our continued and timely development
of new products and enhancements to existing products. Accordingly, we devote
a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to R&D programs
and seek to maintain close relationships with our customers and be responsive
to their wafer processing needs.

Our R&D expenses during fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001 were $160.5 million,
$179.2 million, and $227.2 million, respectively, and represented 21.3%, 19.0%,
and 15.0% of total revenue, respectively. Expenditures are targeted at
continued development of advanced etch, CMP and post-CMP clean applications and
enhancements to our existing products, including developing the technology
necessary to support our customers’ transition to smaller feature sizes, (90 nm
and 65 nm), new materials, copper-based devices, and 300-mm wafers.

We expect to continue to make substantial investments in R&D to meet our
customers’ product needs and enhance our competitive position.

Marketing, Sales, and Service

Our marketing and sales efforts are focused on building long-term
relationships with our customers. These efforts are supported by a team of
product marketing and sales professionals as well as equipment and process
engineers that work closely with individual customers to develop solutions to
their processing needs. We maintain ongoing support relationships with our
customers and have an extensive network of field service personnel in place
throughout the United States, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific. We believe that
comprehensive support programs and close working relationships with customers
are essential to maintaining high customer satisfaction and our competitiveness
in the marketplace. We have 37 sales and support centers around the world, through which
technical personnel sell and/or service our products.

We provide standard warranties for our systems that run generally for a
period of 12 months from system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from
shipment of the system to the customer. The warranty provides that systems
shall be free from defects in material and workmanship and conform to our
published specifications. The warranty is limited to repair of the defect or
replacement with new or like-new equivalent goods and is valid when the buyer
provides prompt notification within the warranty period of the claimed defect
or non-conformity and also makes the items available for inspection and repair.
We make comprehensive warranty packages on all released products available to
our customers.

Export Sales

Export sales accounted for approximately 47%, 44%, and 50% of our net
sales in fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Export sales consist of
sales from any of our U.S. operating subsidiaries to non-affiliated customers
outside the U.S. As a result, a significant portion of our sales and
operations may be subject to certain risks, including tariffs and other
barriers, difficulties



in staffing and managing non-U.S. subsidiary and branch operations,
potentially adverse tax consequences, exchange rate fluctuations, and the
potential for difficulty in accounts receivable collection. There can be no
assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial position, and results of operations and cash flows.
Refer to Note 20 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8
herein, for further information concerning export sales.

Customers

Our customers include many of the world’s leading semiconductor
manufacturers. In fiscal year 2003, revenues from Samsung Electronics Company,
Ltd., accounted for approximately 15% of total revenues, and, in fiscal year
2001, revenues from STMicroelectronics accounted for approximately 15% of our
total revenue. No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of our total
revenue in fiscal 2002.

A material reduction in orders from several of our customers, due to
market or business conditions in the semiconductor industry could adversely
affect our results of operations and projected financial condition. Our
business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers,
which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for
integrated circuits and products utilizing integrated circuits. Beginning in
the second half of fiscal 2001, a slowing U.S. economy and worldwide decline in
demand for integrated circuits resulted in excess capacity in the semiconductor
industry and a severe contraction of the manufacturing equipment market. Our
customers reduced their level of capital expenditures, which caused a steep
decline in demand for our products in fiscal 2002, and demand has remained
relatively flat during fiscal 2003 due to our customers’ continuing cautious
posture about their levels of capital expenditures.

Backlog

Company backlog includes orders for systems, spares, and services where
written customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or
provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months. Our policy is
to make adjustments to our backlog to reflect, among other things, customer
delivery date changes as well as order cancellations. We schedule production
of our systems based upon purchase orders in backlog and our customers’
delivery requirements. Included in our systems backlog are orders for which
written requests have been accepted, prices have been agreed upon, and shipment
of systems is expected within one year. The spares and services backlog
includes customer orders for products that have not yet shipped and for
services that have not yet been provided. Where specific customer service and
spare parts purchase contracts do not contain specific delivery dates, we use
volume estimates at the contract price and over the contract period, not
exceeding 12 months, in calculating backlog amounts.

As of June 29, 2003 and June 30, 2002, our backlog was approximately $239
million and $287 million, respectively. Generally, orders for our products and
services are subject to cancellation by our customers with limited penalties.
Because some orders are received for shipments in the same quarter and due to
possible customer changes in delivery dates and cancellations of orders, our
backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual revenues
for succeeding periods.

Manufacturing

Our manufacturing operations consist mainly of assembling and testing
components and modules that are then integrated into finished systems. We are
seeing the effects of our outsourcing programs, as certain system assemblies
and modules are now received by us from third



party providers to be incorporated by us into system builds. Most of the
assembly and testing of our products is conducted in cleanroom environments.
Although infrequent, prior to shipping a completed system, customer
representatives may perform system acceptance tests at our facility.

Beginning in fiscal 2002 and continuing in fiscal 2003, we entered into
agreements with third parties to outsource certain elements of our
manufacturing, production warehousing, and logistics functions. We believe
that entering into these outsourcing contracts will provide us more flexibility
to scale our operations up and down in a more timely and cost effective manner,
enabling us to respond to the cyclical nature of our business. We believe that
we have selected reputable providers and are securing their performance on
terms documented in written contracts. However, it is possible that one or
more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect, and such failure
could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, the expanded role
of outsource providers has required us to implement changes to our existing
supply chain management operations and to adopt new procedures to manage
effectively the performance of those outsource providers. We believe that we
have implemented adequate oversight procedures. Even so, any delay or failure
in the implementation of our operational changes could adversely affect our
customer relationships and have a negative effect on our operating results and
financial condition. Refer to Note 17 of our Consolidated Financial
Statements, included in Item 8 herein, for further information concerning our
outsourcing commitments.

As is often the case in the high technology industry, due to limited
availability of suppliers of certain proprietary or patented technologies,
certain of the components and subassemblies included in our products are
obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We believe
that, in many cases, alternative sources could be obtained and qualified to
supply these products. Nevertheless, a prolonged inability to obtain certain
components could have an adverse short-term effect on our operating results and
could unfavorably impact our customer relationships.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the
management of hazardous materials. We are currently not aware of any pending
notices of violation, fines, lawsuits, or investigations arising from
environmental matters that would have any material effect on our business. We
believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we
have obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise addressing) all necessary
environmental permits to conduct our business. Nevertheless, the failure to
comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed
on us, suspension of production, cessation of our operations or reduction in
our customers’ acceptance of our products. These regulations could require us
to alter our current operations, to acquire significant equipment, or to incur
substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Our
failure to control the use, sale, transport or disposal of hazardous substances
could subject us to future liabilities.

Employees

As of
September 16, 2003, we had approximately 2,100 regular full-time
employees.

Each of our employees signs an agreement to maintain the confidentiality
of our proprietary information, and most of our employees have stock or stock
option arrangements with us that generally provide for the vesting of their options over
multiple years.

In the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, competition
for highly skilled employees is intense. Our future success depends to a
significant extent upon our continued ability to attract and retain qualified
employees, particularly in the R&D and customer support functions. We believe
that the ability to offer compensation in the form of stock options is an



important component of our key-employee retention programs.

Competition

The semiconductor capital equipment industry is characterized by rapid
change and is highly competitive throughout the world. In order to compete
effectively, we must invest significant financial resources to offer a broad
range of products, to maintain customer service and support centers globally,
and to develop enhanced product capabilities. Semiconductor manufacturers will
evaluate equipment suppliers in many areas, including, but not limited to,
process performance, productivity, customer support, defect control, and
overall cost of ownership, which can be affected by many factors such as
equipment design, reliability, software automation, etc. Our ability to
succeed in the marketplace will depend upon our ability to introduce product
enhancements and new products on a timely basis. In addition, semiconductor
manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate new
processing equipment into a semiconductor production line. As a result, once a
semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular supplier’s tool set and
qualified it for production, the manufacturer generally maintains that
selection for that specific production application. Accordingly, we may
experience difficulty in selling to a given customer if that customer has
qualified a competitor’s system.

We face significant competition with all of our products. Certain of our
existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial
resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and
customer service and support organizations. We expect our competitors to
continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and
processes and to introduce new products and processes with enhanced price
performance characteristics. If our competitors make acquisitions or enter into
strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering etch
or products similar to those we sell, our ability to sell our products to those
customers could be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will
continue to compete successfully in the future. Our primary competitors in the
etch market are Applied Materials, Inc. and Tokyo Electron Limited. Our CMP
integrated polishing system faces significant competition from Applied
Materials, Inc., Ebara Corp., and Novellus Systems, Inc.

Patents and Licenses

Our policy is to seek patents on inventions relating to new or enhanced
products and processes developed as part of our ongoing research, engineering,
manufacturing, and support activities. We hold United States patents and
corresponding non-U.S. patents covering various aspects of our products and
processes. We believe that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the
useful life of the technologies and processes disclosed and claimed therein.
Our patents, which cover material aspects of our past and present core
products, have current durations ranging from approximately 6 to 17 years. We
believe that, although the patents we own and may obtain in the future will be
of value, they will not alone determine our success, which depends principally
upon our engineering, marketing, support, and delivery skills. However, in the
absence of patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt
to imitate our products, manufacturing techniques, and processes. In addition,
other companies and inventors may receive patents that contain claims
applicable or similar to our products and processes. The sale of products
covered by patents of others could require licenses that may not be available
on acceptable terms, or at all.

From time to time, we have received notices from third parties alleging
infringement of such parties’ patent or other intellectual property rights by
our products. In such cases, it is our policy to defend the claims, or if
considered appropriate, negotiate licenses on commercially reasonable terms.
However, no assurance can be given that we will be able, in the future, to
negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or
that any litigation resulting from



such claims would not have a material adverse effect on our business and
financial results. For further discussion of legal matters, see Item 3, “Legal
Proceedings,” of this Form 10-K.

Other Cautionary Statements

See the discussion of risks in the section of this report entitled Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.”

Chief Financial Officer, Software Products Division, of NCR Corporation. He has
also held a variety of executive roles in finance and operations in several
industries ranging from commercial real estate to telecommunications.

Item 2.

Properties

Our executive offices and principal operating and R&D facilities are
located in Fremont, California, and are under operating leases expiring from
2003 to 2008. As a result of the restructuring of our operations, we have
subleased some of our idle facilities, (refer to Note 21 of our Consolidated
Financial Statements, included in Item 8 herein, for further information
concerning our property leases). In addition, we lease properties for our
service, technical support and sales personnel throughout the United States,
Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific. Our fiscal 2003 rental payments for the space
occupied during that period aggregated approximately $12.7 million, net of
sublease income of $1.6 million. Our facilities lease obligations are subject
to periodic increases, and we believe that our existing facilities are well
maintained and in good operating condition.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

In September 1999, Tegal Corporation (Tegal) brought suit against us
seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based on our alleged
infringement of certain patents held by Tegal. Specifically, Tegal identified
our 4520XL

E

and Exelan products as infringing the patents Tegal is asserting.
On our motion, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for
the Northern District of California (the Court). In August of 2002, Tegal
voluntarily dismissed its claims asserted against the
4520XL

E

. In January of
2003, the Court granted summary judgment on Tegal’s remaining claim asserted
against the Exelan. On June 17, 2003, the Court entered a final judgment in
this case, dismissing Tegal’s Exelan claim. The time for filing an appeal of
the decision has now passed, and neither party filed an appeal.

From time to time, we have received notices from third parties alleging
infringement of such parties’ patent or other intellectual property rights by
our products. In such cases it is our policy to defend the claims, or if
considered appropriate, negotiate licenses on commercially reasonable terms.
However, no assurance can be given that we will be able to negotiate necessary
licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any litigation
resulting from such claims would not have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position, liquidity, operating results, or our
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Results of Operations

Lam Research Corporation (Lam or the Company) is a major supplier of
semiconductor capital equipment. Our product offerings include single-wafer
plasma etch systems with a wide range of applications, CMP and CMP wafer
cleaning systems, and an array of services designed to optimize the utilization
of these systems by our customers.

The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically
experienced periodic downturns and upturns. Over the past 3 business cycles,
their severity has increased, and today’s leading indicators of changes in
customer investment patterns are no more reliable than in prior years. Demand
for our equipment can fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result
of various factors, including, but not limited to, economic conditions, supply,
demand, and price for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and our
ability to develop and market competitive products. For these and other
reasons, our results of operations for fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001 may not
necessarily be indicative of future operating results.

The sequential decrease in revenue for fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year
2002 compared to fiscal year 2001 reflects our customers’ response to excess
capacity in the semiconductor industry, which was significantly influenced by
the continued retrenchment of the global economy and levels of end-user demand
for products servicing telecommunications, computer, and consumer electronics
markets. Semiconductor manufacturers have selectively invested in leading-edge
technology equipment through fiscal 2003 and are in the early stages of ramping
these new capabilities at production volumes. Overall, demand has remained
relatively flat during fiscal 2003 as reflected in the pattern of our quarterly
revenues. Our current estimate for the September 2003 quarter is for revenues
to be approximately at the same levels as the June 2003 quarter revenues.

The downturn that began in the second half of fiscal 2001 resulted in
decreased revenues across nearly all product lines in fiscal 2002. The
reduction in revenue for fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was due to a worldwide decline in demand for integrated circuits which resulted in excess
capacity in the semiconductor industry and severe contraction in capital
investments.

We changed our revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2001, effective June 26, 2000, based on guidance provided in SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101), “Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements.” Refer to our discussion of “Critical Accounting Policies” for
additional information about our revenue recognition policy. Based on the
guidance provided by SAB 101, we generally recognize new systems revenue upon
customer acceptance. As a result, the fiscal period in which we are able to
recognize systems revenue is subject to the length of time that our customers
require to evaluate the performance of our equipment to agreed standards and
specifications, after system installation. Systems revenue recognition
generally occurs from two to seven months after the date of shipment. Spares
revenues generally are recognized on the date of shipment, and service revenues
are recognized generally upon performance of the activities requested by the
customer, including training, upgrades, and extended warranty support.

The increase in gross margin as a percent of total revenues of 12
percentage points in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was accomplished with
an approximate 20 percent reduction in revenues over the same periods. We have
focused on implementing strategies to outsource manufacturing activities in
order to lower our breakeven point to approximately $180 million in quarterly
revenues at the end of fiscal 2003. Further outsourcing of manufacturing
assembly activities was accomplished throughout fiscal 2003, continuing the
trend toward achieving a more variable cost structure, by establishing
transaction-based pricing agreements with vendors, and, additionally enabling
the elimination of infrastructure costs such as facilities. The same strategy
has provided opportunities to achieve lower material and assembly costs through
improved systems design and leverage from a more focused supplier base.

The manufacturing assembly outsourcing model has required fundamental
changes within the supply chain and within our business processes. One
objective of this strategy is to minimize certain costs related to holding
inventories and managing product lifecycles. Specifically related to this
point, in fiscal 2002, we incurred incremental excess and obsolete inventory charges of
$24.1 million in the second fiscal quarter of 2002, and
in addition we incurred $5.9 million of inventory restructuring expenses, contributing to
approximately a 450 basis points improvement in
the gross margin percentage compared to fiscal 2003. The charges in fiscal 2002 reflected the known
and anticipated impact of the downturn on our business at that point in time.
The reduction in excess and obsolete inventory costs in fiscal 2003 reflects
more stability in quarter on-quarter business levels during the year and other
inventory management efforts. Our current outlook for the September 2003
quarter is for essentially flat gross margin as a percentage of revenues
compared to the June 2003 quarter.

Approximately 500 basis points of the improvement in gross margin as a
percentage of revenues for fiscal 2003 compared to the corresponding period a
year ago is a result of $38.8 million of charges to cost of goods sold related
to a patent litigation settlement in fiscal 2002. In the second fiscal quarter
of 2002, we signed a final settlement agreement in connection with a patent
infringement claim by Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. (Varian).
We agreed to pay Varian $20.0 million in cash and issued Varian a warrant to
purchase 2,000,000 shares of our common stock with a fair value of $21.5
million. In connection with this settlement, we recorded a charge of $38.8
million, and the remaining amount of the settlement, $2.7 million, represented
the value of future licensed use of patents we received. The $2.7 million
relating to the license will continue to be amortized ratably over the
subsequent 10 quarters as a charge to cost of goods sold. Accumulated
amortization as of the end of fiscal 2003 was $1.6 million.

Additionally,
our restructuring plans, combined with ongoing cost
management activities have supported improved utilization rates in our
manufacturing operations, contributing to the
improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2003 over
fiscal 2002.

The decrease in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal
2001 stems from



patent litigation settlement charges and obsolete inventory charges within cost
of goods sold as well as unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs due to lower
production volumes. In the second fiscal quarter of 2002, we recorded a charge
for excess and obsolete inventory of $24.1 million. We recorded the charge
based on the results of our customary quarterly analysis of inventories and
their net realizable value based on current market conditions and forecasted
customer demand for related products. This analysis highlighted limited
anticipated consumption of our older generation equipment due to accelerated
technological and product design changes.

The reduction in absolute dollars in fiscal 2003, compared to fiscal 2002,
illustrates ongoing efforts to focus expenditures primarily on the development
of critical next-generation products. Spending in fiscal 2003 decreased
compared to fiscal 2002 and included a reduction in employee-related expenses
and supplies expenses of approximately $6 million, and lower infrastructure
costs, principally reflected in reduced depreciation and amortization of
another $6 million. Additionally, R&D expenses in fiscal 2002 of approximately
$5 million related to impairment charges and write-downs in the value of
selected laboratory equipment, which was determined to be no longer useful due
to technological changes. The increase in R&D expenses as a percentage of
revenues in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 is the result of the lower
sales volume in fiscal 2003.

The decrease in R&D expenses in absolute dollars in fiscal 2002 compared
to fiscal 2001 results from alignment of spending on general R&D programs with
the downturn in the business cycle.

Approximately,
60% of fiscal 2003 systems revenues are derived from
products introduced over the previous two years. We believe that in order to
remain competitive, we must continue to invest substantially in engineering and
technology development. Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our
personnel and financial resources to these programs, which will result in
sizeable levels of investment in next-generation products and enhancement of
existing products.

The reduction in Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses in
fiscal 2003, compared to the prior year, reflects the structural change in the
targeted administrative functions that have been outsourced. Reduced salaries
and benefits and supply costs have been significantly substituted with
variable, largely transaction-based pricing from selected providers.



Infrastructure rationalization, including reduced facilities, has contributed
the majority of the annual cost reduction from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003. In
addition, SG&A expenses in fiscal 2002 included a $4.2 million impairment
charge related to the write-down in value of certain demonstration equipment
used in sales and marketing activities, which was determined to be no longer
useful due to technological changes.

In the quarter ended December 29, 2002, we modified the contractual life
of and added additional vesting requirements to one of our Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer’s stock option
awards. As a result of the modification, we recorded deferred stock-based
compensation of $3.4 million, which is being amortized ratably over the vesting
period of the modified options, or 16 quarters. As of June 29, 2003,
approximately $2.8 million remained in deferred compensation within
stockholders’ equity. As modified, the option award provided for accelerated
vesting triggered when the Nasdaq National Market closing price of our common
stock reaches or exceeds $20.00 per share. At such time when vesting is
accelerated, all unvested shares will immediately vest and become exercisable,
and all remaining deferred compensation would then be recognized as
compensation expense within SG&A. In the quarter ended September 2003 we
modified the vesting requirements to this same option award by adding a second
condition to the accelerated vesting provision. Refer to the subsequent event
discussion included in this Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.

The decrease in absolute dollars of SG&A expenses in fiscal 2002 compared
to fiscal 2001 was largely due to manpower reductions, lower incentive payments
to employees, shutdown days, and other cost reduction programs in response to
the contraction in our levels of revenue. The increase in SG&A expenses as a
percentage of revenue for the same periods comparison was primarily the result
of lower sales volume in fiscal 2002.

Restructuring Charges

We have developed and implemented restructuring plans in response to
changes in business outlook with the intent to align our cost structure with
anticipated revenue levels. The frequency of our restructuring plans has been
driven by the unpredictable and substantial changes in the semiconductor
industry as a whole and the market for semiconductor processing equipment in
particular. These dynamic changes in the semiconductor industry and our
business have required multiple integrated responses, including those
activities within our restructuring plans, based on the best information and
industry-expert forecasts available at that point in time. Although management
makes every attempt to consolidate all known restructuring activities into one
plan, the extreme nature of our industry’s business cycles and the rapidly
changing forecasting environment places practical limitations on achieving this
objective. The implementation of restructuring activities and recognition of
their impact in our financial statements does not preclude similar but
unrelated actions from being necessary in future periods. We distinguish
regular operating cost management activities from restructuring activities.
Accounting for restructuring activities requires an evaluation of formally
committed and approved plans. Restructuring activities have comparatively
greater strategic significance and materiality and may involve exit activities,
whereas regular cost containment activities are more tactical in nature and are
rarely characterized by formal and integrated action plans or exiting a
particular product, facility, or service.



During fiscal 2003, we incurred $14.9 million of restructuring charges,
net, associated with our fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001 restructuring plans. As of June 29, 2003, the remaining restructuring reserve consisted of
approximately $11.0 million related to restructurings implemented during fiscal
2003 and approximately $8.3 million related to restructurings implemented
during fiscal 2002.

Fiscal 2003 Restructuring Activities

We have developed programs and incurred restructuring charges in response
to the depressed levels of capital investment by the semiconductor industry.
This situation has caused us to evaluate our revenue outlook and
forecasts, employment levels, facilities utilization and outsourcing
activities and the impact on manufacturing
and administrative facilities. Based on these evaluations, our senior
management committed to cost reduction and exit activities in the quarters
ended June 29, 2003 (the June 2003 Plan), March 30, 2003 (the March 2003 Plan),
and December 29, 2002 (the December 2002 Plan). Prior to the end of the June
29, 2003, March 30, 2003, and December 29, 2002 quarters, management with the
proper level of authority approved specific actions under the respective Plans
and communicated the severance packages to potentially impacted employees in
enough detail such that the employees could determine their type and amount of
benefits. None of the severance payments were contingent on employee’s future
service to the Company. The termination of the impacted employees occurred as
soon as practical after the restructuring plans were announced. The amount of
remaining future lease payments for facilities we ceased to use and included in
the restructuring charges are based on management’s estimates using known
prevailing real estate market conditions at that time. Leasehold improvements
relating to the vacated buildings were written off, as these items will have no
future economic benefit to us and have been abandoned.

We applied the accounting provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 146 “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities” (FAS 146) to the fiscal 2003 restructuring activities as we
early-adopted FAS 146 during the December 2002 quarter. Under the provisions of
FAS 146, the restructuring charges for the remaining contractual lease
payments, computed as the present value of remaining contractual payments less
estimated sublease income, on vacated facilities were recognized in the quarter
in which the Company ceased to use the facility. As a result of the fiscal
2003 restructuring activities, we expect quarterly savings in total
expenses of
approximately $1.0 million from the June 2003 Plan, $1.0 million from the March
2003 Plan, and $3.0 million from the December 2002 Plan. These estimated
savings from the Plans’ discrete actions are primarily related to lower
employee payroll, facilities, and depreciation expenses. Actual savings may
vary from anticipated savings, depending upon future events and circumstances,
such as differences in actual sublease income versus estimated amounts.
Through June 29, 2003, we believe actual savings are largely consistent with
estimated savings. However, other activities and factors may significantly



influence our future cost structure and may offset savings from the Plans.

June 2003 Plan

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we reduced our workforce in
North America, and Europe by approximately 30 people and vacated selected sales
and office facilities located in North America, Europe, and Asia determined to
be no longer critical to our operations. The employees included in the Plan
were from a broad range of organizations and at multiple levels throughout the
Company, with approximately 80% from North America and approximately 20% from
our European locations. We recorded a restructuring charge of approximately
$7.6 million, consisting of $0.8 million of severance and benefits for
involuntarily terminated employees, $5.7 million of charges for the present
value of remaining lease payments on vacated facilities, a $1.0 million loss on
the fair value of a vacated facility, and $0.2 million for the write-off of
related leasehold improvements. In June 2003, two lease agreements covering
four properties were amended, combined, restated, and transferred to a new
lessor under a single lease structure. One of the transferred leases covered
one of our vacated facilities at our Fremont, California campus. At the time
of the amendment, the leased facility’s fair value was less than its original
cost by approximately $1.0 million. Accordingly, this amount was recorded as a
loss on the fair value of the vacated facility and included in the $6.7 million
facility-related restructuring charge.

March 2003 Plan

During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we reduced our workforce in North
America and Europe by approximately 50 people and vacated selected sales and
office facilities located in North America determined to be no longer critical
to our operations. The employees included in the Plan were from a broad range
of organizations and at multiple levels throughout the Company, with the
majority of the reductions in North America. We recorded a restructuring
charge of approximately $4.7 million, consisting of $1.6 million of severance
and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, $2.9 million of charges
for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities, and $0.2 million for the
write-off of related leasehold improvements.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2003, we reduced our workforce in
North America, Europe, and Asia by approximately 120 employees and vacated
selected sales and office facilities located in North America, Europe, and Asia
determined to be no longer critical to our operations. The employees included
in the Plan were from a broad range of organizations and at multiple levels
throughout the Company with approximately 65% from North America and
approximately 35% from Asia and Europe locations. We recorded a restructuring
charge of approximately $5.7 million, consisting of $3.3 million of severance
and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, $1.9 million of charges
for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities, and $0.5 million for the
write-off of related leasehold improvements.

Fiscal 2002 Restructuring Activities

In response to the deterioration in semiconductor sales in the first half
of fiscal 2002, which resulted in a contraction in outlook for the wafer
fabrication equipment market and, therefore, in our revenues, our senior
management committed to cost reduction and exit activities in the quarters
ended December 30, 2001 (the December 2001 Plan), and September 23, 2001 (the
September 2001 Plan). Prior to the end of the December 30, 2001 and September
23, 2001



quarters, management, with the proper level of authority, approved specific
actions of the respective Plans and communicated the severance packages to
potentially impacted employees in enough detail such that the employees could
determine their type and amount of benefits. The termination of the impacted
employees occurred as soon as practical after the plans of restructuring were
announced. Lease payments on vacated facilities are based on management’s
estimates using prevailing real estate market conditions. We initially
estimated under the plans that, given prevailing real estate market conditions
at that time, it would take approximately 24 months to sublease our vacated
facilities. We revised the original estimates for lease payments on vacated
facilities if prevailing real estate market conditions were different than the
initial estimate. Leasehold improvements and certain fixed assets relating to
the vacated buildings were written off as these items have no future economic
benefit to us and have been abandoned.

December 2001 Plan

During the second fiscal quarter of 2002, we began implementing
restructuring activities that included reducing our workforce by approximately
470 employees in North America, Europe, and Asia, vacating selected office and
warehouse facilities at our Fremont, California campus determined to be no
longer critical to our operations, and the closure of certain offices in Asia.
The employees included in the Plan were from a broad range of organizations and
at multiple levels throughout the Company with approximately 80% from North
America and approximately 20% from Asia and Europe locations. We recorded a
restructuring charge of approximately $33.8 million, consisting of $14.2
million of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, $9.6
million of charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities, and $9.9
million for the write-off of related leasehold improvements and fixed assets.

During fiscal 2003, we recovered approximately $3.8 million of
restructuring charges originally accrued under the December 2001 Plan, $2.1
million for benefits and services that were not utilized by the terminated
employees, and $1.7 million related to a revision to the net amount of lease
payments remaining to be paid on the vacated facilities. In addition, during
fiscal 2003, we recorded approximately $3.0 million of additional restructuring
charges of which $2.5 million was due to revisions we made for the length of
time required to sublease two of our vacated buildings in Fremont, California
that were included in the December 2001 Plan and approximately $0.1 million due
to additional facility restoration costs incurred to fulfill our contractual
obligations under the terms of a lease agreement. Additionally, we revised our
estimates related to employee termination costs and recorded $0.4 million of
additional employee termination costs.

Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the December 2001 Plan:



The remainder of the Severance and Benefits reserve balance as of June 29,
2003, is anticipated to be utilized by the end of the 2003 calendar year. The
remainder of the reserve balance for Lease Payments on Vacated Facilities of
$7.5 million as of June 29, 2003, is anticipated to be utilized by the end of
fiscal 2008.

September 2001 Plan

During the first quarter of fiscal 2002, we began implementing
restructuring activities which included a reduction of approximately 550
employees in North America, Europe and Asia, vacating selected facilities at
our headquarters in Fremont, California determined to be no longer critical to
our operations and discontinuance of the manufacture of specific products
within our etch product lines. The employees were from a broad range of
organizations and at multiple levels throughout the Company, with approximately
85% from North America and 15% from Asia and Europe locations. We recorded a
restructuring charge of approximately $21.0 million consisting of $10.8 million
of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, $1.7 million
of charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities, $7.6 million for
discontinued inventory charges related to our decision to discontinue
manufacture of specific products within our etch product lines and $0.9 million
for the write-off of related leasehold improvements and fixed assets. In
fiscal 2003 and 2002, we recovered approximately $1.7 million from
unanticipated subsequent sales to our installed base of customers of certain
portions of the inventory. In addition, in fiscal 2003 and 2002, we physically
disposed of approximately $2.7 million of this inventory. We plan to
disposition the remaining quantities of this discontinued, obsolete inventory
by the end of the 2003 calendar year.

During fiscal 2002, we also recovered approximately $1.0 million of the
September 2001 Plan charge due to lower than estimated employee termination
costs of $0.7 million and lower than estimated expenses relating to a vacated
facility lease of $0.3 million. During fiscal 2003, approximately $0.9 million
was recovered due to $0.6 million of lower than previously estimated employee
severance and termination costs and $0.3 million was recovered due to actual
expenses being lower than estimated for vacated facility leases. In addition,
during fiscal 2003, we recorded additional charges for the September 2001 Plan
based on a revision of our estimate of the length of time required to sublease
one of our vacated buildings in Fremont, California. Based on prevailing
market conditions, we extended the accrual for lease payments to the end of the
lease in June 2004 and recorded an additional $0.6 million relating to these
remaining lease payments.

Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the September 2001 Plan:



The remainder of the Severance and Benefits reserve balance of $0.2
million, as of June 29, 2003, is anticipated to be utilized by the end of the
2003 calendar year. The remainder of the reserve balance for Lease Payments on
Vacated Facilities of $0.5 million as of June 29, 2003, is anticipated to be
utilized by the end of fiscal 2004.

Fiscal 2001 Restructuring Activities

During the quarter ended December 29, 2002, we completed the restructuring
activities associated with the June 2001 Plan. An additional $1.1 million of
restructuring charges was recovered due to lower than estimated employee
termination costs.

Purchased Technology for Research & Development

During the second quarter of fiscal 2001, we made an equity investment in
and purchased a portfolio of CMP intellectual property rights and research and
development technology from Strasbaugh. We recognized a one-time charge to
income of $8.0 million for the purchase of in-process research and development
technology and recorded a $6.0 million investment in preferred stock and
intangible assets. Our equity interest in Strasbaugh, representing
approximately 20% of Strasbaugh’s total capital stock, is accounted for under
the equity method, and the intellectual property rights are being amortized
ratably over five years.

Based on our analysis of Strasbaugh’s current and expected financial
performance, we determined in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 that the
carrying value of our equity investment had experienced an other-than-temporary
impairment and recorded a $2.0 million charge in other expense to write down
the investment to its estimated fair value.

Our equity in the income (loss) from Strasbaugh as of the end of fiscal
2003, 2002, and 2001 was ($0.8) million, ($0.8) million and $0.7 million,
respectively. The income (loss) has not been material, and, therefore, has
been included in other income, net, but not presented as a separate caption on the
accompanying statements of operations.

Other Income (Expense), net

Other income (expense), net, was ($10.3) million, ($8.2) million and $15.1
million in fiscal year 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The change in net
other expense in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to the
settlement of our equity derivative instruments indexed to Lam stock and lower
yields on investments due to declining interest rates partially offset by lower
interest expense due to the redemption of our 5% $300 million subordinated



debentures in September 2002. The increase in net other expense in fiscal 2002
compared to fiscal 2001 was driven by the non-taxable loss on our equity
derivatives indexed to Lam stock, and smaller foreign currency exchange gains
due to lower foreign currency balances.

On August 23, 2002, we settled our outstanding equity derivative contracts
by purchasing approximately 3.5 million shares of Lam common stock at an
average price of $11.19 per share for a total cash payment of $39.1 million.
By settling the equity derivative contracts, we were able to repurchase the
shares recording a life to date gain of $8.4 million ($2.41 per share) from
their then market value. Resulting from this transaction, we recognized an
increase in treasury stock of $47.6 million.

Based on the $13.60 market price of our common stock at the contract
settlement date (August 23, 2002), the fair value of the equity derivative
contracts declined by $16.4 million to $8.4 million, from their June 30, 2002
fair value of $24.8 million. This $16.4 million reduction in the equity
derivative contracts’ fair value was recorded as a non-taxable loss in other
expense in fiscal 2003.

Tax Expense (Benefit)

Our
annual income tax expense (benefit) was ($7.9) million, ($37.9)
million, and $60.5 million in fiscal years 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.
The gains and losses in fiscal years 2003, 2002, and 2001 resulting from the
change in fair value of our equity derivatives indexed to our stock were
non-taxable. In April 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) closed its
examination of our tax returns for fiscal years up to and including the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1998. Resolution was reached on a number of issues
including adjustments related to R&D tax credits resulting in our recording a
$24.9 million tax benefit in the fourth quarter. In addition, a tax expense of
approximately $17.0 million associated with implementing strategies to, in the
longer-term, limit our tax liability on the sale of our products worldwide, was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. These tax
strategies are structured to align the asset ownership and functions of our
various legal entities around the world, with our expectations of the level,
timing, and sources of future revenues and profits. In fiscal 2002, we
recorded an income tax benefit of $37.9 million related to net losses incurred.
In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2002, we increased our tax benefit
rate to 30%. The increase resulted from the tax benefit of the R&D credit
being proportionately greater in subsequent quarters due to lower projected
pretax income and investment in engineering and development programs qualifying
for R&D tax benefits. For fiscal year 2001, we recorded an income tax expense
of $60.5 million, which was 30% of income before taxes.

Deferred Tax Assets

We had gross deferred tax assets arising from non-deductible temporary
differences, net operating losses, and tax credit carryforwards of $287.5 million and $290.4 million
in fiscal 2003 and 2002. The gross deferred tax assets are offset by
valuation allowances of $36.7 million and $52.2 million and deferred tax
liabilities of $30.7 million and $26.7 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002.
Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable
income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be
realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market
conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. We
evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will
continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances, if any.

Outsourcing

We define aspects of our business as either core or critical capabilities
and those that are in support of these activities. We have identified as
critical for success in the marketplace our ability to develop leading edge
products, to market and sell what we develop, and to service and



support directly what we sell. Most other activities in the Company are in
support of product development, marketing and selling and customer service.
Consequently, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we began implementation of
an outsourcing strategy to obtain certain support services from third parties.
Accordingly, during fiscal 2002, we began to enter into agreements to outsource
elements of our manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities management and
information technology functions. During fiscal 2003, we continued to enter
into agreements to outsource certain elements of our transactional general and
administrative functions. We believe that entering into these outsourcing
programs will provide us with more flexibility to scale our operations in a
more timely manner to respond to the cyclical nature of our business.
Implementing this outsourcing strategy is intended to lead to proportionally
more of our employees supporting core activities and decrease our reliance on
temporary workforce during peak business cycles as well as reduce the
fluctuation in employment that occurs due to the cyclical nature of our
business.

Related Party Transactions

During fiscal year 2001, our President and Chief Operating Officer signed
a promissory note with Lam entitling him to borrow up to $1.0 million dollars
at 6.75% simple interest. At June 29, 2003, the entire principal amount, $1.0
million, and accrued interest was outstanding. The loan is secured by a
mortgage on his personal residence and is repayable, in full, together with
accrued interest, at any time, but no later than May 8, 2005.

Subsequent Events

During the quarter ending September 2003, we added a second condition to
the accelerated vesting provision contained in one of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer’s stock option awards
that was previously modified in the December 2002 quarter. When and if the
vesting of the award is accelerated, all unvested shares shall
immediately become fully vested and exercisable, and any remaining deferred compensation
would then be recognized as compensation expense within SG&A. The award now provides for
accelerated vesting when each of the following conditions is met: (1) the
Nasdaq national market closing price of Lam common stock reaches or exceeds
$20.00 per share, and (2) applying U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles, Lam’s fiscal quarter net income exceeds $2.5 million after
deducting any incremental amortization expense that results from acceleration
of these same options. The two conditions need not be met simultaneously nor
in a specific order.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires
management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. We based our estimates and assumptions on historical
experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable, and
evaluated them on an on-going basis to ensure they remained reasonable under
current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those
estimates.

The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our
financial statements are described in Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. Some of these significant accounting polices are
considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is
defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and
results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and subjective
judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that
are inherently uncertain.

We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the
more significant



judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial
statements.

Revenue Recognition:

We recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of
an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered,
the selling price is fixed or determinable, collectibility is reasonably
assured, and we have completed our system installation obligations, received
customer acceptance, or are otherwise released from our installation or
customer acceptance obligations. In the event that terms of the sale provide
for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the
expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever
occurs first. In circumstances where the practices of a customer do not
provide for a written acceptance and in addition, the terms of sale do not
include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue where it can be
reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the customer
specifications. Revenue related to sales of spare parts, system upgrade kits,
and remanufactured systems is generally recognized upon shipment. Revenue
related to services is generally recognized upon completion of performance of
the services requested by a customer order. Revenue for extended maintenance
service contracts with a fixed payment amount and a term more than one month is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the term of the contract.

We changed our revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2001, effective June 26, 2000, based on guidance provided in SAB 101.

Inventory Valuation:

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market
using standard costs, which approximate actual cost on a first-in, first-out
basis. We maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the
quantity on-hand and standard cost for each product, including purchased
components, subassemblies and finished goods. We maintain the integrity of
perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on
hand. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title
transfer to the customer. Generally, title transfer is documented in the terms
of sale. When the terms of sale do not specify when title transfers, we assume
title transfers when we complete physical delivery of the products unless other
customer practices prevail.

Standard costs are generally re-assessed at least annually and reflect
achievable acquisition costs, generally the most recent vendor contract prices
for purchased parts, currently obtainable assembly and test labor, and overhead
for internally manufactured products. Manufacturing labor and overhead costs
are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to
absorb spending at average utilization volumes. All intercompany profits
related to the sale and purchase of inventory between our legal entities are
eliminated from our consolidated financial statements.

Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of
inventory at least quarterly. Our policy is to assess the valuation of all
inventories, including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished
goods and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or
inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over the next
12 to 36 months is written-down to its estimated market value, if less than
cost. Inherent in the estimates of market value are management’s forecasts
related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological
and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, possible
alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory. If future
customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections,
additional inventory write-downs may be required, and would be reflected in
cost of sales in the period the revision is made.

Warranty:

Typically, marketing and selling semiconductor capital equipment
includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the
overall price of the system. We provide standard warranties for our systems
that run generally for a period of 12 months from



system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the
customer. We record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of
sales for each system upon revenue recognition. The amount recorded is based
on an analysis of historical activity, which uses factors such as type of
system, customer, geographic region, and any known differences such as tool
reliability improvements. All actual parts and labor costs incurred in
subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves through the
application of detailed project record keeping.

Actual warranty expenses are incurred on a system-by-system basis, and may
differ from our original estimates. While we periodically monitor the
performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are
different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the
period in which those differences arise or are identified. Accordingly, actual
costs that exceed the estimates are expensed as incurred, and at the same time,
additional probable and estimable liabilities may be recorded.

We do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves
are related to specific systems. Historically, including the most recent
12 months ended June 29, 2003, all warranty obligations have been
determined with reasonable estimates.

In addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer
customer-paid extended warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance
and warranty services with a fixed payment amount and a term of more than one month are recognized on a
straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded
either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable
and estimable.

Employee
Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Option Plans:

We account
for our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) and stock option plans
under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25
“Accounting For Stock Issued to Employees” (APB 25) and
Interpretation No. 44, “Accounting for Certain Transactions
Involving Stock Compensation — an Interpretation of APB Opinion
No. 25” (FIN 44) and make pro forma footnote disclosures as
required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148,
“Accounting For Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and
Disclosure” (FAS 148), which amends Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting For Stock-Based
Compensation” (FAS 123). Our ESPP is a non-compensatory plan, and our stock option plans are
accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of APB 25.

Pro forma net income (loss) and pro forma net income (loss) per share
disclosed in the footnotes to our annual consolidated financial statements are
estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes
option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of
traded options which have no vesting restrictions and which are fully
transferable. In addition, the Black-Scholes model requires the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the
estimated life of each option. Because our stock-based awards to employees
have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and
because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the
fair value estimate, in management’s opinion the existing models do not
necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of our stock-based
awards to employees.

Deferred
Income Taxes:

We record a valuation allowance to reduce our net
deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable
income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be
realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market
conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the
event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our
net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the
period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is
more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the
previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. Our current
valuation allowance of $36.7 million covers the tax benefit from the exercise
of employee stock options and foreign tax credits. When the stock option tax
benefits are realized, a portion of the valuation allowance will be reversed
and credited to capital in excess of par value. When the foreign tax credits
are realized, the remaining portion of the valuation allowance will be reversed
through the tax provision (benefit) in the statement of operations as a
reduction of income tax expense.



Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Costs associated with Exit or Disposal Activities:

In July 2002, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FAS 146. FAS 146 addresses
financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal
activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3, “Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit
an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)” (EITF 94-3).
The principal difference between FAS 146 and EITF 94-3 relates to FAS 146’s
requirements for the timing of recognizing a liability for a cost associated
with an exit or disposal activity. FAS 146 requires that a liability for a
cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the
liability is incurred. Under EITF 94-3 a liability for an exit cost was
recognized at the date of an entity’s commitment to an exit plan. FAS 146 is
effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31,
2002, with early adoption encouraged. We early-adopted FAS 146 in the quarter
ended December 29, 2002 and applied its accounting provisions to the
restructuring activities initiated during the quarters ended December 29, 2002,
March 30, 2003 and June 29, 2003 (see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Item 8 in this Form 10-K). No restructuring activities
were initiated during the quarter ended September 29, 2002.

Accounting
for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables:

In
November 2002, the FASB’s Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on
EITF Issue No. 00-21, “Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables” (EITF 00-21). EITF 00-21 provides guidance on how to account for
arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple deliverables
(products, services and/or rights to use assets). The provisions of EITF 00-21
will be applicable for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods
beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of EITF 00-21 is not currently
anticipated to have a material affect on our financial position or results of
operations.

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,
Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others:

In November 2002, the
FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others” (FIN 45). FIN 45 requires a company that is a guarantor to make
specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has
issued. FIN 45 also requires the guarantor to recognize, at the inception of a
guarantee, a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the
guarantee. FIN 45 also incorporates, without change, the guidance in FASB
Interpretation No. 34, “Disclosure of Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others” which is superseded by FIN 45. FIN 45’s disclosure requirements are
effective for financial statements for periods ending after December 15, 2002.
The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 are
applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued after December 31, 2002.
The provisions of FIN 45 did not have a material impact on our financial
position or results of operations upon adoption. (See Note 18 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 in this Form 10-K).

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure:

In
December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure” (FAS
148), which amends FAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”. FAS 148
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the “fair
value” method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In
addition, FAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements of FAS 123 and requires
prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements of the
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of
the method used on a company’s financial position and results of operations.
The transition guidance and annual



disclosure requirements of FAS 148 are effective for fiscal years ending after
December 15, 2002. We adopted the interim disclosure requirements of FAS 148
for financial statements in our fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2003. We intend
to continue to account for our stock option plans and stock purchase plan under
the provisions of APB 25 and FIN 44. Accordingly, the adoption of FAS 148 did
not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities:

In January 2003, the FASB
issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”
(FIN 46), an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,
“Consolidated Financial Statements”. FIN 46 establishes accounting guidance for
consolidation of a variable interest entity (VIE), sometimes formerly referred
to as a special purpose entity. In general, a VIE is a corporation,
partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes
that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights or (b) has
equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the
entity to support its activities. FIN 46 applies to any business enterprise,
both public and private, that has a controlling interest, contractual
relationship, or other business relationship with a VIE. FIN 46 provides
guidance for determining when an entity, the Primary Beneficiary, should
consolidate another entity, a VIE, that functions to support the activities of
the Primary Beneficiary. FIN 46 will require the consolidation of a VIE by a
company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the
VIE’s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the VIE’s residual
returns or both.

The effective date of the new rules under FIN 46 on our existing operating
leases was immediate on any new leases entered into after January 31, 2003,
which utilize VIEs or equivalent lease structures and otherwise effective the
first quarter of fiscal 2004. FIN 46 is not anticipated to have a material
impact on our financial position or results of operations because we have
transferred certain of our operating lease agreements to a new lessor that does
not qualify as a VIE (See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8 in this Form 10-K).

Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities:

In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities,” (FAS 149). FAS 149 amends Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities” (FAS 133) for decisions made as part of the Derivatives
Implementation Group (DIG) and changes financial reporting by requiring that
contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly.
Specifically, FAS 149 (1) clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an
initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative as discussed in
FAS 133, (2) clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component that
requires reporting as cash flows from financing activities in the statement of
cash flows, and (3) amends the definition of an “underlying"(to include a
variable such as the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event) to
correspond to the language in FIN 45. These changes will result in more
consistent reporting of contracts that are derivatives in their entirety or
that contain embedded derivatives that require separate accounting. FAS 149 is
effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, and for
hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. However, the provisions
of FAS 149 that codify the previous decisions made by the DIG are already
effective and should continue to be applied in accordance with their prior
respective effective dates. The adoption of FAS 149 is not anticipated to have
a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both
Liabilities and Equity:

In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments
with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and



Equity”, (FAS 150). FAS 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies
and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both
liabilities and equity. FAS 150 represents a significant change in practice in
the accounting for a number of financial instruments including mandatorily
redeemable equity instruments and certain equity derivatives that frequently
are used in connection with share repurchase programs. FAS 150 generally
requires liability classification for two broad classes of financial
instruments: (1) Instruments that represent, or indexed to, an obligation to
buy back the issuer’s shares, regardless of whether the instrument is settled
on a net-cash or gross physical basis, (2) Obligations that can be settled in
shares but meet one of the following conditions: (a) derive their value
predominately from some other underlying, or (b) have a fixed value, or have a
value to the counterparty that moves in the opposite direction as the issuer’s
shares. Many of the instruments within the scope of FAS 150 were previously
classified by the issuer as equity or temporary equity. FAS 150 is effective
for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and
otherwise is effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. The adoption of
FAS 150 is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial position
or results of operations.

Off -Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

We have certain obligations, some of which are recorded on our balance
sheet and some which are not, to make future payments under various contracts
such as debt agreements, lease agreements, consignment materials and
outsourcing agreements. In addition, our off-balance sheet arrangements
include contractual relationships for which we have an obligation under certain
guarantee contracts. Our contractual cash obligations and commitments relating
to these agreements, and our guarantees are included in the following table:

Debt and Other Long-Term Liabilities

Refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources” included in this Item 7
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” for information concerning our debt and other long-term
liabilities.

Operating Leases

We lease most of our administrative, R&D and operating facilities,
regional sales/services offices and certain equipment under non-cancelable
operating leases, which expire at various dates through 2021. Refer to Note 17
of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 in this Form 10-K,
for further information concerning our operating leases.

In March 2003, a lease agreement (the Agreement) relating to two
properties (land and buildings) at our Fremont, California campus was
transferred to a new lessor and amended and restated. The Agreement replaces
the former lease that was due to expire in March 2003. As



part of the Agreement, we have the option to purchase the buildings at any time
for approximately $54.4 million. In addition, we are required to guarantee the
lessor a residual value on the properties of up to $48.4 million at the end of
the lease term in fiscal 2008 (in the case that the lease is not renewed, we do
not exercise our purchase option, and the lessor sells the property and the
sale price is less than the lessor’s cost). We maintain cash collateral of
$54.4 million as of June 29, 2003 in separate specified interest-bearing
accounts. The lessor is a substantive independent leasing company that does
not have the characteristics of a VIE as defined by FIN 46, and, therefore, we
do not consolidate its operations.

In June 2003, two lease agreements relating to four properties (land and
buildings) at our Fremont, California campus were transferred to a new lessor
and amended and restated (the Lease Agreement). In connection with this
transaction, the leases were combined and transferred from the existing lessors
to a new lessor, under a single lease structure. As part of the Lease
Agreement, we have the option to purchase the buildings at any time for
approximately $58.0 million. In addition, the Lease Agreement requires that we
guarantee the lessor a residual value on the properties of up to $50.3 million
at the end of the lease term in fiscal 2008 (in the case that the lease is not
renewed, we do not exercise our purchase option, and the lessor sells the
property and the sale price is less than the lessor’s cost). Additionally, as
part of the Lease Agreement, we maintain cash collateral of approximately $58.0
million in separate specified interest bearing accounts. The lessor is a
substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics
of a VIE as defined by FIN 46, and, therefore, we do not consolidate its
operations.

Purchase Obligations

During
the second half of fiscal 2002, we began to enter into agreements with
third parties to outsource certain elements of our manufacturing, warehousing,
logistics, facilities maintenance, and information technology functions.
During fiscal 2003, we continued to enter into agreements to outsource certain
elements of our transactional, general and administrative functions. We
believe that these outsourced services will provide us with more flexibility to
scale our operations in a more timely manner to respond to the cyclical nature
of our business. In addition to minimum spending commitments, certain
of these agreements
provide for potential cancellation charges including the potential assumption of leases,
assets and employees. Refer to Note 17 of our Consolidated Financial
Statements, included in Item 8 in this Form for additional information.

We have certain guaranteed purchase agreements in place that contractually
obligate us to purchase a minimum amount of materials related to the
manufacturing of our products. At June 29, 2003, our outstanding purchase
obligation for these agreements was approximately $10.5 million.

Consignment inventories, which are owned by vendors but located in our
discrete storage locations and warehouses, are not reported as inventory until
title is transferred to us, or our purchase obligation is determined. At June
29, 2003, vendor owned inventories held at Lam and not reported as inventory
were approximately $6.4 million.

Guarantees

The transferred lease agreements relating to various properties at our
Fremont, California campus and discussed above under “Operating Leases” require
us to guarantee residual values of the leased properties to the lessors at the
end of the lease terms of up to $98.7 million. The terms of these guarantees,
five years, are equal to the remaining terms of the related lease agreements.
Under the accounting provisions of FIN 45, we recognized a liability of
approximately $1.0 million for the related residual value guarantees under
these leases. This liability, determined by computing the present value of
estimated probability weighted cash flows to be paid by us over



the term of the guarantees, was recorded as prepaid rent, with the offset
recorded as a liability, and the amount is being amortized to rent expense (for
the prepaid rent) and to income (for the liability) on a ratable basis over the
five-year period of the leases. Refer to Note 18 of our Consolidated Financial
Statements, included in Item 8 in this Form 10-K, for further information
concerning our guaranteed residual values.

We have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors under certain of
our operating lease agreements, such as, indemnification for certain
environmental matters. We have entered into certain insurance contracts to
minimize our exposure related to such indemnifications. As of June 29, 2003,
we have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection
with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information
available, that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these
guarantees.

We have agreements with two financial institutions where our U.S.
operating company guarantees payment of our Japanese subsidiary’s overdraft
protection obligation. The maximum potential amount of future payments that we
could be required to make under these agreements at June 29, 2003, is
approximately $5.2 million, the amount available under the overdraft protection
agreement. As of June 29, 2003, our Japanese subsidiary did not owe any
amounts under this agreement. We have not recorded any liability on our
financial statements in connection with these guarantees, as we do not believe,
based on information available, that it is probable that any amounts will be
paid under these guarantees.

We have an agreement with a financial institution to sell certain U.S.
Dollar-denominated receivables generated from the sale of our systems, subject
to recourse provisions. We insure these sold receivables for approximately 90%
of their value and guarantee payment of the remaining uninsured receivable
value in the event that the payment obligation is not satisfied. Based on
historical payment patterns, we have experienced negligible default on payment
obligations and therefore, believe the risk of loss from default is minimal.
The terms of these guarantees are from 90 days past the due date of the
receivable, until collected. At June 29, 2003, the maximum potential amount of
future payments we could be required to make under this agreement is
approximately $2.8 million. As of June 29, 2003, we have not recorded any
liability on our financial statements in connection with these guarantees, as
we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any
amounts will be paid under these guarantees.

Generally, we indemnify our customers, under pre-determined conditions and
limitations, for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by
our products or services. We seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to
an amount not to exceed the sales prices of the products or services. We do not
believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any material
amounts will be paid under these guarantees.

See Note 18 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 in
this Form 10K, for discussion relating to our product warranty reserves.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of June 29, 2003, we had $625.9 million in cash, cash equivalents,
short-term investments, and restricted cash compared with $945.2 million at
June 30, 2002.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $69.2 million in fiscal
2003, which consists of a net loss for the year of $7.7 million, adjusted for
non-cash charges of $70.3 million and sources of working capital of $6.6
million. Non-cash charges include items such as depreciation and amortization,
restructuring charges, deferred income taxes, and the adjustment for the loss
on equity derivative contracts in our stock.



Significant changes in current assets and liabilities include a $23.7
million improvement in accounts receivable resulting from continued improvement
in accounts receivable turnover. Additionally, our outsourcing strategy and
asset management efforts contributed to reduction of inventory levels of
approximately $63.5 million. Trade payables declined by $24.3 million due to
reduced spending resulting from our cost containment activities and lower
inventory purchases. Accrued liabilities declined by $34.9 million due in part
to tax payments and lower interest payable resulting from the redemption of our
5% Convertible Subordinated Notes. Deferred profits for shipments not yet
recognized as revenue fell $18.4 million, due to lower rates of shipments and
the reduced cycle time in customer acceptances.

Net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2003 was $296.4
million. We sold $355.5 million, net, of short-term investments that were
primarily used to repay our 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes (5% Notes) in
September 2002. Net capital expenditures were $12.3 million, and our restricted
cash increased $47.5 million primarily due to increased cash collateralization
requirements under certain of our operating lease agreements.

Net property and equipment was $48.8 million at June 29, 2003, compared to
$67.5 million at June 30, 2002. The decrease in property and equipment in
fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 is primarily due to minimized expenditures
for capital projects during fiscal 2003 and write-offs of leasehold
improvements and certain fixed assets related to buildings that we have vacated
due to restructuring activities.

Net cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2003 was $373.3 million
and consisted primarily of the repayment of our 5% Notes in the amount of
$309.8 million and repayment of our Japanese subsidiary’s long-term loan for
approximately $51.1 million. In connection with the settlement of our equity
derivative contract, we repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares of our
common stock for $39.1 million. We also reissued $12.5 million from treasury
stock through our employee stock purchase program. Net proceeds from the
issuance of our common stock from stock option exercises totaled $14.7 million.

During
fiscal 2003, we settled our outstanding equity derivative contracts
that were recorded in other short-term assets. Based on the market price of
our common stock at the contract settlement date (August 23, 2002), the fair
value of the equity derivative contracts decreased by $16.4 million to $8.4 million from their June 30, 2002 fair value of $24.8 million.

Currently outstanding debt obligations primarily consist of our 4% Notes.

Details of the 4% Notes are:

Offering Date

May 2001

Offering Amount

$300.0 million

Maturity Date

June 1, 2006

Offering Expenses

$8.5 million incurred at the time of offering, ratably
amortized to other expense over the term of the 4%
Notes. Remaining unamortized balance of $5.0 million
and $6.7 million at June 29, 2003 and June 30, 2002,
respectively.

Interest Rate terms

4% payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year,
commencing December 1, 2001

Conversion Rights

Convertible into Lam Common Stock at any time prior to
close of business on the maturity date, unless
previously redeemed, at a



conversion price of $44.93 per share subject to anti-dilution adjustments

Redemption Terms

Redeemable at Lam’s option, beginning June 5, 2004
with at least 20 days and no more than 60 days notice,
at redemption prices starting at 101.0% and at
diminishing prices thereafter, plus accrued interest

Security

4% Notes are unsecured and subordinated in right of
payment in full to all existing and future senior
indebtedness of Lam.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we entered into an interest rate
swap agreement (the swap) with a notional amount of $300 million in order to
hedge changes in the fair value of our 4% Notes, attributable to changes in the
benchmark interest rate. The transaction swapped 4% fixed interest payments
for variable interest payments based on the London Interbank Offered Rate
(LIBOR), resulting in interest expense savings of approximately $10.7 million
for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2003. Should 6-month LIBOR interest rates
rise above approximately 5% per annum in future periods, we would incur
incremental interest expense. Under the terms of the transaction, we must
provide collateral to match any unfavorable mark-to-market exposure (fair value) on the
swap. The amount of collateral required totals a minimum of $6.0 million plus
an amount equal to the unfavorable mark-to-market exposure (fair value) on the swap.
Therefore, the amount of cash collateral we will have to post in the future
will fluctuate from quarter to quarter commensurate with the mark-to-market
exposure (fair value) on the swap instrument. Generally, the required
collateral will rise as interest rates rise. At the end of fiscal
2003, we have
posted $6.0 million of collateral under this swap agreement which is included
in restricted cash on our balance sheet (classified as a long-term asset).

We have designated this swap as a fair value hedge under the provisions of
FAS 133. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Note 5 of our
Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K.

During
the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we signed a final settlement
agreement with Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. (Varian) in
connection with the patent infringement litigation filed by Varian in October
1993. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Varian granted us a
nonexclusive license to the patents involved in the litigation. We agreed to
pay Varian $20.0 million in cash ($5.0 million in December 2001 and the
remainder to be paid in equal quarterly installments of $1.25 million over a
three-year period). These payments began in the third quarter of fiscal 2002.
As of June 29, 2003, a total amount of $12.5 million had been paid to Varian,
which included the initial $5.0 million in December 2001 and six additional
quarterly installment payments of $1.25 million each, totaling $7.5 million as
of June 29, 2003. The total obligation remaining as of June 29, 2003 is $7.5
million, which will be paid through December 2004.

Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we
believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to ensure
our ability to sustain levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure
through ensuing business cycles. Based upon our current business outlook, our
levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at June 29, 2003,
combined with cash conservation activities, are expected to be sufficient to
support our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, and
capital expenditures, through at least the next 12 months.

In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future
revenues and our ability to appropriately size our business based on demand for
our products.



Risk Factors

Our Quarterly Revenues and Operating Results are Unpredictable

Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from
quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, not all of which are in our
control. We manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of
future revenues. If revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet our
expectations, our operating results may be adversely affected. Because our
operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues, and a
certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed, a change in the timing
of recognition of revenue and/or the level of gross profit from a single
transaction can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter.

Factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably
include, but are not limited to:



Further, because a significant amount of our R&D and administrative
operations and capacity is located at our Fremont, California, facility,
natural, physical, logistical or other events or disruptions affecting this
facility (including labor disruptions, earthquakes and power failures) could
adversely impact our financial performance.

We Derive Our Revenues Primarily from a Relatively Small Number of High-Priced
Systems

System sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue. Our
systems can range in price from approximately $400,000 to $4 million per unit,
and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon the acceptance of a
rather limited number of such systems. As a result, the inability to declare
revenue on even a few systems can cause a significant adverse impact on our
revenues for that quarter.

Variations in the Amount of Time it Takes for Our Customers to Accept Our
Systems May Cause Fluctuation in Our Operating Results

We generally recognize revenue for new system sales on the date of
customer acceptance or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions
lapse. As a result, the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize new
systems revenues is subject to the length of time that our customers require to
evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation,
which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate.

The Semiconductor Equipment Industry Is Volatile and Reduced Product Demand Has
a Negative Impact on Shipments

Our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of
semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current and
anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products using integrated
circuits. The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and historically
experiences periodic downturns. During calendar year 2001 and the first half
of calendar year 2002, semiconductor manufacturers canceled or delayed delivery
of orders as a result of overcapacity. The resulting demand contraction had a
negative impact on the level of system shipments during fiscal 2002 compared to
fiscal 2001. The semiconductor industry is experiencing a continued and
prolonged downturn, and as of the end of fiscal 2003, our customers continue to
remain cautious about their levels of capital expenditures.

Fluctuating levels of investment by the semiconductor manufacturers could
continue to materially affect our aggregate shipments, revenues and operating
results. We will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management
programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams,
which sometimes result in restructuring charges. Even during periods of
reduced revenues, we must continue to invest in research and development and
maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities
to remain competitive, which may temporarily harm our financial results.

We Depend on New Products and Processes for Our Success. Consequently, We are
Subject to Risks Associated with Rapid Technological Change

Rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes
subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances enabling
such processes. We believe that our future success depends in part upon our
ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to
continue to enhance our existing products. If new products have reliability or
quality problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher
manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and
additional service and warranty expenses. We may be unable to develop and have
new products manufactured successfully, or new products that we introduce may
fail in the marketplace. Our



failure to complete commercialization of these new products in a timely manner
could result in unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence, which would
adversely affect our financial results.

In order to develop new products and processes, we expect to continue to
make significant investments in R&D and to pursue joint development
relationships with customers or other members of the industry. We must manage
product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as
introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing
products. Future technologies, processes or product developments may render
our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive
products, or obsolete inventory, or both.

We Are Subject to Risks Relating to Product Concentration and Lack of Product
Revenue Diversification

We derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number
of products, and we expect these products to continue to account for a large
percentage of our revenues in the near term. Continued market acceptance of
our primary products is, therefore, critical to our future success. Our
business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could
therefore be adversely affected by:

We Have a Limited Number of Key Customers

Sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant
portion of our overall revenue. As a result, the actions of even one customer
may subject us to revenue swings that are difficult to predict or prepare for.
Similarly, significant portions of our credit risk may, at any given time, be
concentrated among a limited number of customers.

We Are Dependent Upon a Limited Number of Key Suppliers

We obtain certain components and sub-assemblies included in our products
from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We have
established long-term contracts with many of these suppliers. These
long-term contracts can take a variety of forms. We may renew these
contracts periodically. In some cases, these component suppliers sold us
products during at least the last four years, and we expect that we will
continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we will otherwise
replace them with competent alternative source suppliers. However, several of
our outsourced assembly suppliers are new providers to us so that our
experience with them and their performance is limited. Where practical, our
intent is to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the
failure of any single supplier will adversely affect our business.
Nevertheless, a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could impair
our ability to ship products, lower our revenues and thus adversely affect our
operating results and result in damage to our customer relationships.

Our Outsource Providers May Fail to Perform as We Expect



We are expanding the roles that outsource providers play in our business.
We anticipate that these outsource providers will play key roles in our
manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative
functions. Although we aim at selecting reputable providers and secure their
performance on terms documented in written contracts, it is possible that one
or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure
could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, the expanded role
of outsource providers has and will require us to implement changes to our
existing operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with and manage the
performance of these outsource providers. Any delay or failure in the
implementation of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely
affect our customer relationships and/or have a negative effect on our
operating results.

Once a Semiconductor Manufacturer Commits to Purchase a Competitor’s
Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment, the Manufacturer Typically Continues to
Purchase That Competitor’s Equipment, Making It More Difficult for Us to Sell
our Equipment to That Customer

Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify
and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line.
We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular
supplier’s processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that
equipment for that specific production line application. Accordingly, we
expect it to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer
initially selects a competitor’s equipment.

We Are Subject to Risks Associated with Our Competitors’ Introduction of New
Products and We May Lack the Financial Resources or Technological Capabilities
of Certain of Our Competitors Needed to Capture Increased Market Share

We expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future
competitors. We believe that other companies are developing systems and
products that are competitive to ours and are planning to introduce new
products, which may affect our ability to sell our existing products. We face
a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with
leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell
or may develop, as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to
those manufacturers.

We believe that to remain competitive we will require significant
financial resources to offer a broad range of products, to maintain customer
service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process
R&D. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources
and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service
and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to
increasingly dominate the semiconductor equipment industry. These competitors
may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell,
challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and
threatening our ability to sell those products. For these reasons, we may fail
to continue to compete successfully worldwide.

In addition, our competitors may provide innovative technology that may
have performance advantages over systems we currently, or expect to, offer.
They may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer
or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer
requirements. In particular, while we currently are developing additional
product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements,
we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of
these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product
enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive. Accordingly,
we may be unable to continue to compete in our markets, competition may
intensify, or future competition may have a material adverse effect on our
revenues, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.



Our Future Success Depends on International Sales

Non-U.S. sales accounted for approximately 72% of our total revenue in
fiscal 2003, 71% in fiscal 2002, and 70% in fiscal 2001. We expect that
international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our
total revenue in future years. International sales are subject to risks,
including, but not limited to:

•

foreign exchange risks;

•

changing import/export requirements;

•

foreign trade disputes; and

•

economic, political, banking and currency problems in the relevant region.

We currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the
short-term impact of exchange rate fluctuations on Japanese Yen-denominated
assets and will continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes
outlined in the foreseeable future.

A Failure to Comply with Environmental Regulations May Adversely Affect Our
Operating Results

We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the
discharge or disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals. We
believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we
have obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise addressing) all necessary
environmental permits to conduct our business. These permits generally relate
to the disposal of hazardous wastes. Nevertheless, the failure to comply with
present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us,
suspension of production, cessation of our operations or reduction in our
customers’ acceptance of our products. These regulations could require us to
alter our current operations, to acquire significant equipment or to incur
substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Our
failure to control the use, sale, transport or disposal of hazardous substances
could subject us to future liabilities.

If We Are Unable to Adjust the Scale of Our Business in Response to Rapid
Changes in Demand in the Semiconductor Equipment Industry, Our Operating
Results and Our Ability to Compete Successfully May Be Impaired

The business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry is
characterized by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our
management to adjust spending on operating activities. During periods of rapid
growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we face significant
challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management
processes, information systems and procedures on a timely basis and training,
managing, and appropriately sizing our work force. Our success will depend, to
a significant extent, on the ability of our executive officers and other
members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges
effectively. If we do not adequately meet these challenges, our gross margins
and earnings may be impaired during periods of demand decline, and we may lack
the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer
expectations and compete successfully during periods of demand growth.

If We Choose to Acquire or Dispose of Product Lines and Technologies, We May
Encounter Unforeseen Costs and Difficulties That Could Impair Our Financial
Performance

An important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition
prospects that would complement our existing products, augment our market
coverage and distribution ability, or enhance our technological capabilities.
As a result, we may make acquisitions of



complementary companies, products or technologies, or we may reduce or dispose
of certain product lines or technologies, which no longer fit our long-term
strategies. Managing an acquired business, disposing of product technologies
or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks,
including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or
separating existing business or product groups, diversion of management’s
attention away from other business concerns, amortization of acquired
intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired
or disposed operations among others. There can be no assurance that we will be
able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential
acquisitions, disposition of product lines or technologies, or reduction in
personnel or that our management, personnel, or systems will be adequate to
support continued operations. Any such inabilities or inadequacies could have
a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial
condition, and cash flows.

In addition, any acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially
dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent
liabilities, the amortization of related intangible assets, and goodwill
impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations and/or the price of
our Common Stock.

The Market for Our Common Stock is Extremely Volatile, Which May Affect Our
Ability to Raise Capital or Make Acquisitions

The market price for our Common Stock is extremely volatile and has
fluctuated significantly over the past years. The trading price of our Common
Stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to
factors, including but not limited to the following:

In addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume
fluctuations. Historically, we have witnessed significant volatility in the
price of our Common Stock due in part to the actual or anticipated movement in
interest rates and the price of and markets for semiconductors. These broad
market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the price of
our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past,
following volatile periods in the price of stock, many companies became the
object of securities class action litigation. If we are sued in a securities
class action, we could incur substantial costs, and it could divert a
management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on the



price for our Common Stock.

We Rely Upon Certain Critical
Information Systems for the Operation of our Business

We
maintain and rely upon certain critical Information Systems for the effective
operation of our business. These Information Systems include
telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, various
computer hardware and software applications, network communications,
and email. These Information Systems may be owned by us or by our
outsource providers or even third parties such as vendors and
contractors and may be maintained by us or by such providers and
third parties. These Information Systems are subject to attacks,
failures, and access denials from a number of potential sources
including viruses, destructive or inadequate code, power failures,
and physical damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines,
and networking equipment. We have security procedures, such as virus
protection software and emergency recovery processes, that are
believed to be adequate to cover the outlined risks; however, our
inability to use or access these Information Systems at critical
points in time could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient
operation of our business.

Risk Associated with Our Interest Rate Swap Agreement

We aim to limit the impact of interest rate exposure associated with our
interest rate sensitive investments and debt obligations. To minimize the
effect of the interest rate exposure associated with our 4% convertible
subordinated notes, we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a
notional amount of $300 million. We entered into the swap in order to hedge
changes in the fair value of our 4% Notes, attributable to changes in the
benchmark interest rate, by swapping 4% fixed interest payments for variable
interest payments based on the LIBOR based interest rate.

If 6-month LIBOR based interest rates remain at current levels or decrease
we expect the swap will result in interest savings. However, a rise in 6-month
LIBOR based interest rates above approximately 5% per annum in future periods
would result in incremental levels of interest expense.

The Potential Anti-Takeover Effects of Our Bylaws Provisions and the Rights
Plan We Have in Place May Affect Our Stock Price and Inhibit a Change of
Control Desired by Some of Our Stockholders

In 1997, we adopted a Rights Plan (the Rights Plan) in which rights were
distributed as a dividend at the rate of one right for each share of our Common
Stock, held by stockholders of record as of the close of business on January
31, 1997, and thereafter. In connection with the adoption of the Rights Plan,
our Board of Directors also adopted a number of amendments to our Bylaws,
including amendments requiring advance notice of stockholder nominations of
directors and stockholder proposals.

Our Rights Plan may have certain anti-takeover effects. Our Rights Plan
will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire
Lam in certain circumstances. Accordingly, the existence of the Rights Plan
and the issuance of the related rights may deter certain acquirers from making
takeover proposals or tender offers. The Rights Plan, however, is not intended
to prevent a takeover. Rather it is designed to enhance the ability of our
Board of Directors to negotiate with a potential acquirer on behalf of all of
our stockholders.

In addition, our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes issuance of
5,000,000 shares of undesignated Preferred Stock. Our Board of Directors,
without further stockholder approval, may issue this Preferred Stock on such
terms as the Board of Directors may determine, which also could have the effect
of delaying or preventing a change in control of Lam. The issuance of
Preferred Stock could also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of
our Common Stock, including causing the loss of voting control. Moreover,
Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law restricts certain business
combinations with “interested stockholders”, as defined by that statute.

Intellectual Property and Other Claims Against Us Can Be Costly and Could
Result in the Loss of Significant Rights Which Are Necessary to Our Continued
Business and Profitability

Third parties may assert infringement, unfair competition or other claims
against us. From time to time, other parties send us notices alleging that
our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights. In
addition, our Bylaws and indemnity agreements with certain officers, directors
and key employees provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against
losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to
Lam. In such cases, it is our policy either to defend the claims or to
negotiate licenses on commercially reasonable terms. However, we may be unable
in the future to negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms,
or at all, and any litigation resulting from these claims by other



parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results.

We May Fail to Protect Our Proprietary Technology Rights, Which Would Affect
Our Business

Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology. While we
attempt to protect our proprietary technology through patents, copyrights and
trade secret protection, we believe that our success also depends on increasing
our technological expertise, continuing our development of new systems,
increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base, and providing
comprehensive support and service to our customers. However, we may be unable
to protect our technology in all instances, or our competitors may develop
similar or more competitive technology independently. We currently hold a
number of United States and foreign patents and pending patent applications.
However, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any
patents the United States or foreign governments issue to us or these
governments may fail to issue pending applications. In addition, the rights
granted or anticipated under any of these patents or pending patent
applications may be narrower than we expect or, in fact provide no competitive
advantages.

Item 7A

. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates
primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt obligations. We
maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on the safety and
preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, and
reinvestment risk. The table below presents principal amounts and related
weighted-average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment
portfolio, long-term assets and long-term debt obligations at June 29, 2003 and
June 30, 2002:



We mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities
and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a
significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor.
The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or
resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of
diversification.

We have no foreign exchange cash flow exposure related to our fixed rate
$300.0 million convertible subordinated notes.

We conduct business on a global basis in several major international
currencies. As such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as
beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. For this reason, we
enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the impact of
exchange rate fluctuations on the value of our Japanese Yen-denominated assets.
The changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded in other income and expense. In addition, we periodically hedge
anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts. We
defer the gains and losses on these contracts and recognize them in income
during the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income.

On June 29, 2003, the notional amount of outstanding Japanese Yen forward
contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges was $2.2 million. The
unrealized loss on the contracts on June 29, 2003, was $0.1 million. A 15%
appreciation of the Japanese Yen would result in an unrealized loss of $0.4
million, while depreciation in the exchange rate of the Japanese Yen of
approximately 15% would result in an unrealized gain of $0.3 million.

On June 29, 2003, the notional amount of outstanding Japanese Yen forward
contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges was $16.4 million. The
unrealized gain on the contracts on June 29, 2003, was $0.3 million. A 15%
appreciation of the Japanese Yen would result in an unrealized loss of $2.9
million. Depreciation in the exchange rate of the Japanese Yen of



approximately 15% would result in an unrealized gain of $2.1 million.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we entered into an interest rate
swap agreement with a notional amount of $300.0 million in order to hedge
changes in the fair value of the Company’s 4% Notes, attributable to changes in
the benchmark interest rate, by swapping 4% fixed interest payments for
variable interest rates payments based on LIBOR. At June 29, 2003, the fair
value of the swap, $19.2 million, was recorded in other long-term assets. An
increase in rates by 1% would result in a decline in the fair value of the swap
of $7.7 million. A decrease in rates by 1% would result in an increase in the
fair value of the swap of $9.0 million.

Controls and Procedures

As of the close of our fiscal year ended June 29, 2003, we carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-14 and 13a-15. Based
upon that evaluation, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer along with our
Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
are reasonably effective in timely alerting them to material information
relating to the Company (including our consolidated subsidiaries) required to
be included in our periodic SEC filings.

We intend to review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures on an ongoing basis and to correct any
material deficiencies that we may discover. Our goal is to ensure that our
senior management has timely access to material information that could affect
our business. While we believe the present design of our disclosure controls
and procedures is reasonably effective to achieve our goal, future events
affecting our business may cause us to modify our disclosure controls and
procedures. The effectiveness of controls cannot be absolute because the cost
to design and implement a control to identify errors or mitigate the risk of
errors occurring should not outweigh the potential loss caused by the errors
that would likely be detected by the control. Moreover, we believe that
disclosure controls and procedures cannot be guaranteed to be 100% effective
all of the time. Accordingly, a control system, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
control system’s objectives will be met.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JUNE 29, 2003

Note 1: Company and Industry Information

Lam Research Corporation (the Company) designs, manufactures, markets, and
services semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of
integrated circuits. The Company’s product offerings include etch systems with
a wide range of applications, chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) and
post-CMP wafer cleaning systems as well as post-sale services and support for
these systems. The Company sells its products primarily to companies involved
in the production of semiconductors in the United States, Europe, Japan and
Asia Pacific. Credit risk evaluations, including trade references, bank
references and Dunn & Bradstreet ratings are performed on all new customers,
and subsequent to credit application approval, the Company monitors its
customers’ financial statements and payment performance. In general, the
Company does not require collateral on sales.

The semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical and has
experienced periodic downturns, which have had a material adverse effect on the
semiconductor industry’s demand for wafer processing equipment, including
equipment manufactured and marketed by the Company. Certain of the components
and subassemblies included in the Company’s products are obtained from a single
supplier or a limited group of suppliers. The Company believes that
alternative sources could be obtained and qualified to supply these products.
Nevertheless, a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could have a
severe near-term effect on the Company’s operating results and could result in
damage to customer relationships.

Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires
management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that could affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. The Company based its estimates and assumptions on
historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be
applicable, and evaluates them on an on-going basis to ensure they remain
reasonable under current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly
from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition:

The Company recognizes all revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collectibility is
reasonably assured, and the Company has completed its system installation
obligations, received customer acceptance, or is otherwise released from its
installation or customer acceptance obligations. In the event that terms of
the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, the Company
recognizes revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or
customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. In circumstances where the
practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance and in
addition, the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, the
Company recognizes revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the
delivered system meets all of the customer specifications. Revenue related to
sales of spare parts, system upgrade kits, and remanufactured systems is
generally recognized upon shipment. Revenue related to services is generally
recognized upon performance of the services requested by a customer order.
Revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed
payment amount and a term of more than one
month is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.

The Company changed its revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2001,



effective June 26, 2000, based on guidance provided in Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101), “Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements.”

Inventory Valuation:

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market
using standard costs, which approximate actual cost on a first-in, first-out
basis. The Company maintains a perpetual inventory system and continuously
records the quantity on-hand and standard cost for each product, including
purchased components, subassemblies and finished goods. The Company maintains
the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts
of quantities on hand. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the
point of title transfer to the customer. Generally, title transfer is
documented in the terms of sale. When the terms of sale do not specify when
title transfers, the Company assumes title transfers when it completes physical
delivery of the products unless other customer practices prevail.

Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of
inventory at least quarterly. The Company’s policy is to assess the valuation
of all inventories, including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process,
finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or
inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over the next
12 to 36 months is written-down to its estimated market value, if less than
cost. Inherent in the estimates of market value are management’s forecasts
related to the Company’s future manufacturing schedules, customer demand,
technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market
conditions, possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess
inventory. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable
than the Company’s projections, additional inventory write-downs may be
required, and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is
made.

Warranty:

Typically, marketing and selling semiconductor capital equipment
includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the
overall price of the system. The Company provides standard warranties on its
systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from acceptance, not to
exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer. The Company
records a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each
system upon revenue recognition. The amount recorded is based on an analysis
of historical activity, which uses factors such as type of system, customer,
geographic region and any known differences such as tool reliability
improvements. All actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods
are charged to those established reserves through the application of detailed
project record keeping.

In addition to the provision of standard warranties, the Company provides
customer-paid extended warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance
and warranty services, with a fixed payment amount and a term of more than one month, are recognized on a
straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded
either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable
and estimable.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Option Plans:

The Company
accounts for its employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) and stock option plans
under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 “Accounting
For Stock Issued to Employees” (APB 25) and Interpretation No. 44, “Accounting
for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation — an Interpretation of
APB Opinion No. 25” (FIN 44) and makes pro forma footnote disclosures as
required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure” (FAS 148), which amends
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting For
Stock-Based Compensation” (FAS 123). The Company’s
ESPP is a non-compensatory
plan, and the Company’s stock option plans are accounted for using the
intrinsic value method under the
provisions of APB 25.



Pro forma information regarding net income (loss) and net income (loss)
per share is required by FAS 123 and FAS 148 as if the Company had accounted
for its stock option and stock purchase plans under the fair value method of
FAS 123 and FAS 148. The fair value of the Company’s stock-based awards to
employees was estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and which are
fully transferable and requires the input of highly subjective assumptions,
including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each
option. The fair value of the Company’s stock-based awards to employees was
estimated assuming no expected dividends and the following weighted-average
assumptions:

The weighted-average fair value of options granted during 2003, 2002, and
2001 was $4.47, $11.77, and $12.15 per share, respectively. The
weighted-average fair value of shares granted under the ESPP plans during
fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, was $5.07, $6.34, and $6.08 per share,
respectively.

For pro forma purposes, the estimated fair value of the Company’s
stock-based awards is amortized over the option’s vesting period (for options)
and the respective four, six, twelve, or sixteen-month purchase periods (for
stock purchases under the employee stock purchase plan). The following table
illustrates the effect on net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share if
the Company had accounted for its stock option and stock purchase plans under
the fair value method of accounting under FAS 123, as amended by FAS 148:

Deferred Income Taxes

: The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce
its net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be
realized, $220.1 million at June 29, 2003. Realization of the Company’s net
deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. The Company
believes it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however,
ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and
other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that the
Company determines that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net
deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period
such determination is made. Likewise, if the Company later determines that it
is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then
the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. The Company’s
current valuation allowance of $36.7 million covers the tax benefit from the
exercise of employee stock options and foreign tax credits. When the stock
option tax benefits are realized, a portion of the valuation allowance will be
reversed and credited to capital in excess of par value. When the foreign tax
credits are realized, the remaining portion of the valuation allowance will be
reversed through the tax provision (benefit) in the statement of operations as
a reduction of income tax expense.

Fiscal Year:

The Company follows a 52/53-week fiscal reporting calendar
and its fiscal year ends on the last Sunday of June each year. The Company’s
most recent fiscal year ended on June 29, 2003 and included 52 weeks. The
fiscal year ended on June 30, 2002, included 53 weeks, and the
extra week did not have a
material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The
Company’s next fiscal year, ending on June 27, 2004, will include 52 weeks.

Principles
of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments:

All investments purchased
with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash
equivalents. All of the Company’s



short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale at the respective
balance sheet dates. The Company marks-to-market its investment portfolio. The investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at
fair value based upon quoted market prices, and any material temporary
difference between the cost and fair value of an investment is presented as a
separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The specific identification method is used to
determine the realized gains and losses on investments.

Property and Equipment:

Property and equipment is stated at cost.
Equipment is depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets, generally three to seven years. Leasehold improvements
are amortized by the straight-line method over the shorter of the life of the
related asset or the term of the underlying lease. Amortization of equipment
under capital leases is included with depreciation.

Restructuring Charges:

In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146
“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities” (FAS 146).
FAS 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with
exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and
Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring)” (EITF 94-3). The Company early-adopted
FAS 146 in the quarter
ended December 29, 2002. FAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost
associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability
is incurred, rather than when the exit or disposal plan is approved.
Accordingly, restructuring accruals are recorded when management, with the
proper level of authority, approves the specific actions under a plan,
communicates the reduction activities and severance packages to the affected
employees, and vacates the facilities included in the plan. Accruals related to
vacated facilities are calculated net of estimated sublease income, and
leasehold improvements related to vacated facilities are written off as these
items have no future economic benefit. Sublease income is estimated based on
current market estimates. If the Company is unable to sublet the vacated
properties on a timely basis, the Company adjusts the accrual accordingly.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

: The Company routinely considers whether
indicators of impairment of long-lived assets are present. If such indicators
are present, the Company determines whether the sum of the estimated
undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than
their carrying value. If the sum is less, the Company recognizes an impairment
loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their
respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted future cash
flows, appraisals or other methods. If the assets determined to be impaired
are to be held and used, the Company recognizes an impairment charge to the
extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the
asset are less than the asset’s carrying value. The fair value of the asset
then becomes the asset’s new carrying value, which the Company depreciates over
the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are
reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Investments in Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to Lam Research
Corporation Stock:

In November 2000, the FASB’s Emerging Issues Task Force
(EITF) reached final consensus on EITF Issue No. 00-19, “Determination of
Whether Share Settlement is Within the Control of the Issuer,” for the purposes
of applying EITF Issue No. 96-13, “Accounting for Derivative Financial
Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock”
(EITF 00-19). EITF Issue No. 96-13 addresses accounting for equity derivative contracts
indexed



to, and potentially settled in, a company’s own stock (equity derivatives) by

providing guidance for distinguishing between permanent equity, temporary
equity and assets and liabilities.

The Company’s equity derivatives included certain put and call options
indexed to its own stock. Application of EITF 00-19 required these instruments
to be recorded at their fair value at the end of each reporting period and the
changes in fair value recorded as a gain or loss on the Company’s statement of
operations. These equity derivatives were collateralized by restricted cash
and could not be settled in unregistered shares. They were classified as other
short-term assets and were settled in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 (See
Note 6).

Derivative Financial Instruments:

The Company holds derivative financial
instruments to hedge a variety of risk exposures including interest rate risks
associated with its long-term debt, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
on the value of its cash flows from forecasted revenue denominated in Japanese
Yen and foreign currency denominated assets. Derivatives that qualify for
hedge accounting are discussed in detail in Note 5 to these consolidated
financial statements.

The Company does not purchase derivatives for speculative or for trading
purposes. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship must meet
criteria relating both to the derivative instrument and the hedged item. These
include identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature
of the risk being hedged and how the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in
offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash
flows will be measured.

When derivative instruments are designated and qualify as effective hedges
of identified fair value exposures, the Company is able to offset changes in
the fair value of the identified exposures by changes in the fair value of the
hedging instruments. When derivative instruments are designated and qualify as
effective cash flow hedges, the Company is able to defer changes in the fair
value of the hedging instrument within accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) until the hedged exposure is realized. Consequently, with the exception
of hedge ineffectiveness recognized, the Company’s results of operations are
not subject to fluctuation as a result of changes in the fair value of the
derivative instruments. If hedges are not highly effective or if the Company
does not believe that forecasted transactions would occur, the Company may not
be able to account for its investments in derivative instruments as hedges. If
this were to occur in a future period, changes in the fair values of the
Company’s derivative instruments would be recognized in operations without the
benefits of offsets or deferrals of changes in fair value arising from hedge
accounting treatment.

To hedge foreign currency risks, the Company uses foreign currency
exchange forward contracts. These forward contracts are valued using standard
valuation formulas with assumptions about future foreign currency exchange
rates derived from existing exchange rates and interest rates observed in the
market.

The Company considers its most current outlook in determining the level of
foreign currency denominated intercompany revenues to hedge. The Company
combines these forecasts with historical trends to establish the portion of its
expected volume to be hedged. The revenues are hedged for exposures to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Should the level of revenues
expected not occur, the Company’s investments in derivatives used to hedge changes in
foreign currency exchange rates may not qualify for hedge accounting.

To hedge interest rate risk, an interest rate swap is used in connection
with the Company’s Convertible Subordinated Notes (4% Notes) in which the
Company pays a variable interest rate and receives a fixed interest rate. This
instrument is valued using the market standard methodology of netting the
discounted future fixed cash receipts and the discounted expected



variable cash payments arising under the swap. The variable cash payments are
based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observed market
interest rate curves. The Company has not changed its methods of calculating
fair values or developing the underlying
assumptions. The values of these derivatives will change over time as cash
receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change. In future
periods, if changes in the fair value of the swap are no longer effective at
hedging changes in the fair value of its fixed rate 4% Notes, the interest rate
swap may no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Information about
the fair values, notional amounts, and contractual terms of these instruments
can be found in Note 5 to these consolidated financial statements.

The Company does not believe that it is exposed to more than a nominal
amount of credit risk in its interest rate and foreign currency hedges, as
counterparties are established and well-capitalized financial institutions.
The Company’s exposures are in liquid currencies (Japanese Yen), so there is
minimal risk that appropriate derivatives to maintain our hedging program would
not be available in the future.

Foreign
Currency:

Through fiscal year 2003, the functional currencies of the Company’s European,
Japanese and Asia Pacific subsidiaries are generally the individual subsidiaries’ local
currencies. The Company’s subsidiaries primarily generate and expend cash in
their local currency; billings and receipts for their labor and services are
primarily denominated in the local currency (workforce is paid in local
currency); their individual assets and liabilities are primarily denominated in
the local foreign currency and do not materially impact the Company’s cash
flows and there is an active local sales market for the foreign subsidiaries’
products and services. Accordingly, all balance sheet accounts of these local
functional currency subsidiaries are translated at the fiscal period-end
exchange rate, and income statement accounts are translated at an average rate
for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as
cumulative translation adjustments, which are a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss).

Reclassifications:

Certain amounts presented in the comparative financial
statements for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal year
2003 presentation.

Note 3: Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Costs associated with Exit or Disposal Activities:

FAS 146 addresses
financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal
activities and nullifies EITF 94-3. The principal difference between FAS 146
and EITF 94-3 relates to FAS 146’s requirements for the timing of recognizing a
liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity. FAS 146
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal
activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Under EITF 94-3 a
liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity’s commitment
to an exit plan. FAS 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are
initiated after December 31, 2002, with early adoption encouraged. The Company
early-adopted FAS 146 in the quarter ended December 29, 2002 and applied its
accounting provisions to the restructuring activities initiated during the
quarters ended December 29, 2002, March 30, 2003, and June 29, 2003 (see Note
21). No restructuring activities were initiated during the quarter ended
September 29, 2002.

Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

: In
November 2002, the FASB’s Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on
EITF Issue No. 00-21, “Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables” (EITF 00-21). EITF 00-21 provides guidance on how to account for
arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple deliverables
(products, services, and/or rights to use assets). The provisions of EITF
00-21 will be applicable for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal
periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of EITF 00-21 is not
anticipated to have a material impact on the



Company’s financial position or results of operations.

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,
Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others:

In November 2002, the FASB issued
Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (FIN 45).
FIN 45 requires a company that is a guarantor to make specific disclosures
about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. FIN 45 also
requires the guarantor to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a
liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee. FIN
45 also incorporates, without change, the guidance in FASB Interpretation No.
34, “Disclosure of Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” which is
superseded by FIN 45. FIN 45’s disclosure requirements are effective for
financial statements for periods ending after December 15, 2002. The initial
recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable on a
prospective basis to guarantees issued after December 31, 2002. The provisions
of FIN 45 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or
results of operations upon adoption. (See Note 18).

Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure:

In
December 2002, the FASB issued FAS 148, which amends FAS 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation”. FAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition
for a voluntary change to the “fair value” method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation. In addition, FAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements
of FAS 123 and requires prominent disclosure in both annual and interim
financial statements of the method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation and the effect of the method used on a company’s financial
position and results of operations. The transition guidance and annual
disclosure requirements of FAS 148 are effective for fiscal years ending after
December 15, 2002. The Company adopted the interim disclosure requirements of
FAS 148 for financial statements in its fiscal quarter ended March 30, 2003.
The Company intends to continue to account for its stock option plans and stock
purchase plans under the provisions of APB 25 and FIN 44. Accordingly, the
adoption of FAS 148 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial
position or results of operations.

Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities:

In January 2003, the FASB
issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”
(FIN 46), an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,
“Consolidated Financial Statements”. FIN 46 establishes accounting guidance for
consolidation of a variable interest entity (VIE), sometimes formerly referred
to as a special-purpose entity. In general, a VIE is a corporation,
partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes
that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights or (b) has
equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the
entity to support its activities. FIN 46 applies to any business enterprise,
both public and private, that has a controlling interest, contractual
relationship or other business relationship with a VIE. FIN 46 provides
guidance for determining when an entity, the Primary Beneficiary, should
consolidate another entity, a VIE, that functions to support the activities of
the Primary Beneficiary. FIN 46 requires the consolidation of a VIE by a
company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the
VIE’s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the VIE’s residual
returns or both.

The effective date of the new rules under FIN 46 on the Company’s existing
operating leases is the first quarter of fiscal 2004, and immediately on any
new leases entered into after January 31, 2003, which utilize VIEs or
equivalent lease structures. FIN 46 is not anticipated to have a material
impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations because the
Company has transferred certain of its operating lease agreements to a new
lessor that does not qualify as a VIE (See Note 17).

Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities:

In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 149, “Amendment of



Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”, (FAS 149). FAS
149 amends FAS 133 for decisions made as part of the Derivatives Implementation
Group (DIG) and changes financial reporting by requiring that contracts with
comparable characteristics be accounted for
similarly. Specifically, FAS 149 (1) clarifies under what circumstances a
contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a
derivative as discussed in FAS 133, (2) clarifies when a derivative contains a
financing component that requires reporting as cash flows from financing
activities in the statement of cash flows and (3) amends the definition of an
“underlying” to correspond to the language in FIN 45. These changes will
result in more consistent reporting of contracts that are derivatives in their
entirety or that contain embedded derivatives that require separate accounting.
FAS 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30,
2003, and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. However,
the provisions of FAS 149 that codify the previous decisions made by the DIG
are already effective and should continue to be applied in accordance with
their prior respective effective dates. The adoption of FAS 149 is not
anticipated to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or
results of operations.

Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both
Liabilities and Equity:

In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments
with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity”, (FAS 150). FAS 150
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain
financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. FAS
150 represents a significant change in practice in the accounting for a number
of financial instruments including mandatorily redeemable equity instruments
and certain equity derivatives that frequently are used in connection with
share repurchase programs. FAS 150 generally requires liability classification
for two broad classes of financial instruments: (1) instruments that represent,
or indexed to, an obligation to buy back the issuer’s shares, regardless of
whether the instrument is settled on a net-cash or gross physical basis, (2)
obligations that can be settled in shares but meet one of the following
conditions: (a) derive their value predominately from some other underlying, or
(b) have a fixed value, or have a value to the counterparty that moves in the
opposite direction as the issuer’s shares. Many of the instruments within the
scope of FAS 150 were previously classified by the issuer as equity or
temporary equity. FAS 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into
or modified after May 31, 2003 and otherwise is effective the first quarter of
fiscal 2004. The adoption of FAS 150 is not anticipated to have a material
impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

Note 4: Financial Instruments

Investments at June 29, 2003 and June 30, 2002, consist of the following:



The Company marks-to-market its investment portfolio. At June 30, 2002, it was management’s estimate
that the fair market values of the Company’s investments in debt securities and
restricted cash materially approximated their carrying values (cost). Realized
gains and (losses) from investments sold were approximately $196,000 and
($92,000) in fiscal 2003 and $326,000 in fiscal 2002. Realized gains and
(losses) for investments sold are based on specific identification. Management
assesses the fair value of investments in debt securities that are not actively
traded through consideration of interest rates and their impact on the present
value of the cash flows to be received from the investments. The Company also
considers whether changes in the credit ratings of the issuer could impact the
assessment of fair value. The fair value of the Company’s investments in
auction rate preferred securities is based upon par value, which approximates
fair value due to the nature of the instruments.

The Company’s available-for-sale securities are invested in financial
instruments with a minimum rating of A2 or A, as rated by Moody’s or Standard &
Poor’s (S&P), respectively.

The amortized cost of investments in debt securities with contractual
maturities is as follows:

The fair value of the Company’s convertible subordinated notes and the
Company’s other long-term debt is estimated based on the current rates
available for debt instruments with comparable terms and maturities. The fair
value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts is estimated based
upon the Japanese Yen exchange rates at June 29, 2003 and June 30, 2002,
respectively. See Note 6 for a discussion of the equity derivative
contracts in the Company’s stock and its fair value.

At June 29, 2003, and June 30, 2002, the notional amount of outstanding
Japanese Yen forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges was $2.2
million and $48.3 million respectively. On the same dates, the notional amount
of Japanese Yen forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges
was $16.4 million and $13.7 million, respectively.

The Company has an agreement to sell specific U.S. Dollar-denominated
receivables, subject to recourse provisions to a financial institution. At
June 29, 2003 and June 30, 2002, $37.5 million and
$36.0 million of these receivables,
respectively, remained uncollected, of which $2.8 million and $3.6 million at
June 29, 2003 and June 30, 2002, respectively, were subject to recourse
provisions.

The Company had a similar agreement with a bank to sell specific Japanese
Yen-denominated receivables, subject to recourse provisions. At June 29, 2003
no sold Japanese Yen-denominated receivables were outstanding. At June 30,
2002, $2.0 million of these receivables sold to the bank remained uncollected,
of which there were no amounts subject to recourse provisions.



Note 5: Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging

The Company carries derivative financial instruments (derivatives) on the
balance sheet at their fair values. The Company has acquired and holds
derivative financial instruments to hedge a variety of risks and exposures
including interest rate fluctuation risks associated with our long-term debt,
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the value of expected cash flows
from forecasted revenue transactions denominated in Japanese Yen and foreign
currency denominated assets. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are
not designated or that do not qualify as hedges under Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities” (FAS 133) are recognized in earnings immediately. The Company does
not use derivatives for trading purposes.

The Company’s policy is to attempt to minimize short-term business
exposure to foreign exchange risks using the most effective and efficient
methods to eliminate or reduce such exposures. In Japan, the Company generally
sells its systems, spare parts and services under contracts denominated in
Japanese Yen. Therefore, in the normal course of business, the Company’s
financial position is routinely subjected to market risk associated with
foreign currency rate fluctuations. To protect against the reduction in value
of forecasted Japanese Yen-denominated cash flows resulting from sales in
Japanese Yen, the Company instituted a foreign currency cash flow hedging
program. The Company entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts
that generally expired within 12 months, and no later than 24 months. These
foreign currency forward exchange contracts, were designated as cash flow
hedges and carried on the Company’s balance sheet at fair value with the
effective portion of the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings in
the same period the hedged revenue is recognized.

For the fiscal years ended June 29, 2003 and June 30, 2002, the Company
recognized net losses of $0.1 million and net gains of $2.2 million,
respectively, for cash flow hedges that had been discontinued, because the
original forecasted transactions did not or are not expected to occur. The losses and
gains are recorded in other income (expense) in the respective June 29, 2003
and June 30, 2002, consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, for
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002, the Company recognized net losses of $0.1
million related to the time value excluded from the assessment of hedge
ineffectiveness.

At June 29, 2003, the Company expects to reclassify the balance of
deferred hedging gains and losses, net, included in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) to earnings during the next 12 months due to the
recognition in earnings of the hedged forecasted transactions.

The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge
the gains and



losses generated by the remeasurement of Japanese Yen-denominated intercompany
receivables. Under FAS 133, these are not designated hedges. Therefore, the
change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded into earnings as a
component of other income (expense) and offsets the change in fair value of the
foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables.

See Note 4 for a summary of the aggregate fair value of all outstanding
foreign currency forward contracts.

The Company also has a policy to minimize, where possible and practical,
the impact of interest rate exposure associated with its interest rate
sensitive investments and debt obligations. To limit the impact relating to
interest rate exposure associated with its fixed rate 4% Notes, the Company is
a party to an interest rate swap agreement (the swap) with a notional amount of
$300.0 million. Under the terms of the swap, the Company exchanges the fixed
interest payments on its 4% Notes for variable interest payments based on the
London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The swap is accounted for as a fair
value hedge under the provisions of FAS 133. Fluctuations in the fair value of
the 4% Notes, resulting from changes in the LIBOR interest rate sensitive
component, are recorded in earnings, and offset by changes in the fair value of
the swap, which are also recorded in earnings.

As a result of designating the swap as a hedge of its 4% Notes, the
carrying value of the 4% Notes is adjusted to reflect changes in fair value
attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. For the fiscal years
ended June 29, 2003 and June 30, 2002, the carrying value of the 4% Notes
included in long-term debt and other long-term liabilities increased by
approximately $15.8 million and $ 3.5 million, respectively. Over the same
12 month periods, the fair value of the swap, included in long-term assets,
increased by approximately $16.0 million and $3.2 million, respectively, with
the corresponding gains and losses for the twelve- month periods recorded in
other income (expense). For the fiscal years ended June 29, 2003, and June 30,
2002, the Company recognized net gains of $0.2 million and net losses of $0.3
million, respectively, in other income (expense) resulting from hedge
ineffectiveness related to differences in changes in the fair value of the swap
and changes in the fair value of the 4% Notes.

Note 6: Equity Derivative Contracts In Company Stock

The Company’s equity derivatives included certain put and call options
indexed to its own stock that were acquired in June 1999. Application of EITF
00-19, “Determination of Whether Share Settlement is Within the Control of the
Issuer”, for the purposes of applying EITF Issue No. 96-13, “Accounting for
Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a
Company’s Own Stock”, required these previously purchased instruments to be
recorded at their fair value at the end of each reporting period, commencing in
June 2001, with the change in fair value recorded as a gain or loss in the
Company’s statement of operations. The Company’s equity derivatives were
collateralized by restricted cash of $9.1 million and could not be settled in
unregistered shares. They were classified as other short-term assets ($24.8
million), at the end of fiscal 2002.

On August 23, 2002, the Company settled its outstanding equity derivative
contracts by purchasing approximately 3.5 million shares of the Company’s
common stock at an average price of $11.19 per share for a total cash payment
of $39.1 million. By settling the equity derivative contracts, the Company was
able to repurchase the shares recording a life to date gain of $8.4 million
($2.41 per share) from their then market value. As a result of this
transaction, the Company recognized an increase in treasury stock of $47.6
million.

Based on the $13.60 market price of the Company’s common stock at the
contract settlement date (August 23, 2002), the fair value of the equity
derivative contracts declined by $16.4 million



to $8.4 million, from their June 30, 2002 fair value of $24.8 million. This
$16.4 million reduction in the equity derivative contracts’ fair value was
recorded as a non-taxable loss in other expense in the June 29, 2003
consolidated statements of operations.

Note 10: Intangible Assets

Effective with the beginning of fiscal 2003, the Company adopted Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets” (FAS 142). FAS 142 requires that goodwill and certain other intangible
assets be tested for impairment at least annually and written down only when
determined to be impaired, replacing the previous



accounting practice of ratably amortizing these items over their estimated
useful lives. Intangible assets other than goodwill that have a finite life
continue to be amortized over their useful lives. The Company has no goodwill
or intangible assets with indefinite lives. The Company’s finite-lived
intangible assets consist of purchased intellectual property rights and the
licensed use of patents that are being amortized over their expected useful
lives. Consequently, there was no impact on the Company’s financial position or
results of operations upon the adoption of FAS 142. The Company performed an
annual test for impairment of these assets during fiscal 2003 and as of June
29, 2003, no impairment has been recorded.

The Company’s finite-lived intangible assets consist of the following:

property rights have an estimated useful life of 5 years and licenses have an
estimated useful life of 2.5 years. The weighted-average amortization period
of all intangible assets is approximately 4.0 years.

The Company’s 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes matured on September 2,
2002 and were repaid in full.

On January 28, 2003, the Company’s Japanese subsidiary repaid its ¥6.0
billion ($51.1 million at January 28, 2003) Japanese long-term loan in full.

At June 29, 2003, obligations under debt financing consist primarily of

respectively.

$44.93 per share subject to anti-dilution adjustments

Redemption Terms

2004 with at least 20 days and no more than 60 days
notice, at redemption prices starting at 101.0% and at
diminishing prices



thereafter, plus accrued interest

Security

4% Notes are unsecured
and subordinated in right of payment in full to all
existing and future senior indebtedness of the Company

The carrying value of the 4% Notes is adjusted to reflect changes in fair
value attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate in connection with
the Company’s fair value hedge accomplished through the swap transaction
discussed in Note 5. At June 29, 2003 and June 30, 2002, the carrying value of
the 4% Notes was increased by $15.8 million and $3.5 million, respectively (to
$319.3 million and $303.5 million, respectively), with the corresponding losses
recorded in other income (expense), offset by recorded gains of $16.0 million
and $3.2 million on the carrying value of the swap.

Under the terms of the transaction, the Company must provide collateral to
match any unfavorable mark-to-market exposure on the swap. The amount of collateral
required totals a minimum of $6.0 million plus an amount equal to unfavorable the
mark-to-market exposure on the swap. Therefore, the amount of cash collateral
the Company will have to post in the future will fluctuate from quarter to
quarter commensurate with the mark-to-market exposure on the swap instrument.
Generally, the required collateral will rise as interest rates rise. At the end
of fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002, the Company had $6.0 million and $10.5 million,
respectively, of collateral (reflected as restricted cash) recorded on the
consolidated balance sheet related to this transaction.

Note 12: Stockholders’ Equity

During fiscal 2003, the Company settled its equity derivative contracts by
purchasing approximately 3.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock for a
total cash payment of $39.1 million, which represented a discount from the
market price of the stock of approximately $2.41 per share. During fiscal
2002, the Company repurchased 600,000 shares of its common stock for $10.7
million under a share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors on
September 30, 1998, authorizing management to acquire up to 6.0 million shares
of the Company’s common stock. During fiscal 2001, the Company repurchased
approximately 2.4 million shares of the Company’s common stock for
approximately $45.1 million. At June 29, 2003, 476,000 shares remain
authorized for repurchase under this program.

During the quarter ended December 29, 2002, the Company recorded $3.4
million of deferred stock-based compensation in stockholders’ equity, which was
offset by a corresponding entry in additional paid-in capital in stockholders’
equity, in connection with the modification of terms of a fixed stock option
award previously issued to the Company’s Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer. The



modification
extended the contractual life of the stock option for a period of three years
and modified the vesting requirements. However, no changes were made to either
the number of shares of the Company’s stock subject to the option, or the
option’s exercise price. Accordingly, the modification resulted in the
remeasurement of compensation expense based on the option’s intrinsic value on
the date of modification in accordance with the provisions of APB 25 and FIN
44. The deferred compensation balance of $3.4 million is being amortized
ratably over the vesting period of the modified options, or 16 quarters. Under
the terms of this modification, if the Nasdaq National Market closing price of
the Company’s common stock reaches or exceeds $20.00 per share, all unvested
shares will immediately vest and become exercisable and all remaining deferred
compensation will be immediately recognized as compensation expense. Total
compensation expense recognized for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2003 was
$593,000. Refer to Note 26 regarding an additional modification to the
accelerated vesting provision of this stock option award subsequent to
June 29, 2003.

Note 13: Net Income (Loss) Per Share

Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income
(loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the
period. The computation of basic net income (loss) per share for all periods
presented is derived from the information on the face of the income statement,
and there are no reconciling items in either the numerator or denominator.

Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed as though all potential
common shares that are dilutive were outstanding during the period. The
following table provides a reconciliation of the denominators of the basic and
diluted computations for net income (loss) per share.

(1)  For purposes of computing diluted net income per share, weighted-average
potential common shares do not include outstanding warrants or stock options
whose exercise prices exceed the average market value of the Company’s common
stock for the period.

Options, warrants and convertible securities were outstanding during
fiscal 2003 and 2002, but approximately 10,395,000 and 24,715,000 potential common shares
were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per common share for
fiscal 2003 and 2002 respectively, because the effect would have been
antidilutive. For fiscal year 2001, diluted net income per share includes the



assumed exercise of employee stock options. The assumed conversion of the 4%
and 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes into 11,192,000 shares was antidilutive
and therefore excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share in
fiscal 2001.

Note 15: Stock Option Plans and Stock Purchase Plan

The Company has adopted stock option plans that provide for the grant to
key employees of options to purchase shares of the Company’s Common Stock. In
addition, the plans permit the grant of nonstatutory stock options to paid
consultants and employees, and provide for the automatic grant of nonstatutory
stock options to outside directors. The option price is determined by the
Board of Directors or its designee, the plan administrator, but in no event
will it be less than the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the
date of grant (no less than 85% of the fair market value at the date of grant
in the case of nonstatutory options). Options granted under the plans vest
over a period determined by the Board of Directors or the
plan administrator. Under the automatic grant program, each outside director
receives an option immediately exercisable for 12,000 shares of the Company’s
Common Stock during December of each year during which the outside director
serves, with the exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of
grant.

A summary of stock option plan transactions follows:



At June 29, 2003, 34,298,887 shares of Lam Common Stock were reserved for
future issuance under the various stock option plans.

The 1997 Stock Incentive Plan
and the 1999 Stock Option Plan provide for the
grant of non-qualified stock option awards to eligible employees, consultants
and advisors, and non-employee directors of the Company and its subsidiaries. Initially, 9.0 million
shares were reserved for issuance. The Board of Directors approved an
additional 3.0 million shares, 9.0 million shares, and 500,000 shares, in
fiscal years 2003, 2002, and 2001 respectively.

The 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the 1999 ESPP) allows employees to
designate a portion of their base compensation to be used to purchase the
Company’s Common Stock at a purchase price per share of the lower of 85% of the
fair market value of the Company’s Common



Stock on the first or last day of the
applicable offering period. Typically, each offering period lasts 12 months
and comprises three interim purchase dates. During fiscal 2003, the Board
approved an extension of the offering period to 16 months. The 1999 ESPP,
approved by the Company’s stockholders at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders on
November 5, 1998, replaced the existing 1984 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
1984 ESPP). The Company has 9.0 million shares of Lam Common Stock reserved
for issuance under the 1999 ESPP: 3.0 million shares may be issued at any time
and additional shares (up to 6.0 million total additional shares) may be issued
for each share of the Company’s Common Stock which the Company redeems in
public-market at private purchases and designated for this purpose.

During fiscal 2003, 1,257,840 shares of the Company’s Common Stock were
sold to employees under the 1999 ESPP. A total of 13,909,562 shares of the
Company’s Common Stock were issued under the 1999 and 1984 ESPP Plans through
June 29, 2003, at prices ranging from $0.09 to $31.84 per share. At June 29,
2003, 2,162,272 shares are available for purchase under all employee stock
purchase plans.

The Company’s Performance-Based Restricted Stock Plan (the RSP) was
designed to reward executives based upon the achievement of certain
predetermined goals. Grants are based on the fair market value of the
Company’s Common Stock at the end of the quarter, provided the predetermined
goals are met. The Company authorized 450,000 shares to be reserved for
issuance under the RSP. During fiscal 2000 the Board of Directors approved
that 409,428 shares, the balance in the 1996 RSP, be made available for
issuance as stock options. At June 29, 2003, 55,220 of these shares are
available for issuance as stock options, and 15,687 shares are subject to
repurchase.

Note 16: Profit Sharing and Benefit Plans

Profit sharing is awarded to employees based upon performance against
certain corporate financial and operating goals. Distributions to employees by
the Company are made semi-annually based upon a percentage of base salary,
provided that a threshold level of the Company’s financial and performance
goals are met. In addition to profit sharing the Company has other bonus plans
based on achievement of profitability and other specific performance
criteria. Charges to expense under these plans were $8.8 million, $2.7
million, and $43.4 million during fiscal years 2003, 2002, and 2001,
respectively.

The Company maintains a 401(k)-retirement savings plan for its full-time
employees in North America. Each participant in the plan may elect to
contribute from 2% to 20% in fiscal 2003 and from 2% to 15% in fiscal 2002 and
2001 of his or her annual salary to the plan, subject to statutory limitations.
The Company makes matching employee contributions in cash to the plan at the
rate of 50% of the first 6% of salary contributed. Employees participating in
the 401(k)-retirement savings plan are 100% vested in the Company matching
contributions and investments are participant directed. The Company made
matching contributions of approximately $3.1 million, $4.0 million, and $4.7
million in fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

Note 17: Commitments

Leases

The Company leases most of its administrative, research and development
(R&D) and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service offices and certain
equipment under non-cancelable operating leases, which expire at various dates
through 2021. All of the Company’s facility leases for buildings located at
its Fremont, California headquarters and certain other facility leases provide the
Company an option to extend the leases for additional periods.
Additionally, certain of the
Company’s facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on
the general rate of



inflation.

Future minimum lease payments under operating leases agreements are as

Total rent expense, net of sublease income, for all leases amounted to
approximately $14.9 million, $19.7 million, and $31.2 million, for fiscal years
2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

The Company has subleased some of its buildings and currently is entitled
to receive income of approximately $2.1 million, $2.6 million, $2.0 million,
and $0.8 million for the fiscal years 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007, respectively.

For the fiscal years ended June 29, 2003, June 30, 2002 and June 24, 2001,
the Company received sublease payments totaling $2.8 million, $3.9 million, and
$4.4 million, respectively, on its subleased facilities.

In March 2003, a lease agreement (the Agreement) relating to two
properties (land and buildings) at the Company’s Fremont, California campus was
transferred to a new lessor and amended and restated. The Agreement replaces
the former lease that was due to expire in March 2003. As part of the
Agreement, the Company has the option to purchase the buildings at any time for
approximately $54.4 million. In addition, the Company is required to guarantee
the lessor a residual value on the property of up to $48.4 million at the end
of the lease term in fiscal 2008 (in the case that the lease is not renewed,
the Company does not exercise its purchase option, and the lessor sells the
property and the sale price is less than the lessor’s cost), which is reflected
in the above future minimum lease payment table. Additionally, as part of the
lease agreement, the Company maintains cash collateral of $54.4 million as of June
29, 2003 in separate, specified interest-bearing accounts. The lessor under
the Agreement is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have
the characteristics of a VIE as defined by FIN 46, and is therefore not
consolidated by the Company.

In June 2003, two lease agreements relating to four properties (land and
buildings) at the Company’s Fremont, California campus were transferred to a
new lessor and amended and restated (the Lease Agreement). In connection with
this transaction, the leases were combined and transferred from the existing
lessors to a new lessor, under a single lease structure. At the time of the
amendment, one of the leased property’s current fair value was less than its
original cost by approximately $1.0 million. The leased property was a
building that had been part of the Company’s past restructuring activities, and
the loss was recorded as a restructuring charge during fiscal 2003. As a
result, the Company recorded a $1.0 million liability for the loss on the
leased property. As part of the Lease Agreement, the Company has the option to
purchase the buildings at any time for approximately $58.0 million. In addition, the Lease Agreement requires
the Company guarantee the lessor a residual value on the property of up to
$50.3 million at the end of the lease term in fiscal 2008 (in the case that the
lease is not renewed, the Company does not exercise its purchase option, and
the lessor sells the property and the sale price is less than the lessor’s
cost) which is reflected in the above future minimum lease payment table.
Additionally, as part of the Lease Agreement, the Company maintains cash collateral
of approximately $58.0 million in separate
specified interest bearing accounts.



The lessor under
the Lease Agreement is a substantive independent leasing company that does not
have the characteristics of a VIE as defined by FIN 46, and is therefore not
consolidated by the Company.

Purchase Obligations

During
the second half of fiscal 2002, the Company began to enter into agreements
with third parties to outsource certain elements of its manufacturing,
warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance, and information technology
functions. During fiscal 2003, the Company continued to enter into agreements
to outsource certain elements of its transactional and general and
administrative functions. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of
transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition to minimum
spending commitments, certain of these agreements provide for potential cancellation
charges including the potential assumption of leases, assets and employees. In addition
to the minimum spending commitments, these agreements provide for one-time
transition charges of approximately $0.7 million in fiscal 2003, and $3.1
million in fiscal 2002. Transition charges are expensed in the period in which
they are incurred.

The Company has certain guaranteed purchase agreements in place where the
Company is contractually obligated to purchase a minimum amount of materials
related to the manufacture of its products. At June 29, 2003, the Company’s
outstanding guaranteed purchase agreements for these agreements was
approximately $10.5 million.

Consignment inventories, which are owned by vendors but located in the
Company’s discrete storage locations and warehouses, are not reported as
inventory until title is transferred to the Company or its purchase obligation
is determined. At June 29, 2003, vendor owned inventories held at the Company
and not reported as inventory were approximately $6.4 million.

:

Guarantees

In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others.” FIN 45 requires a company that is a guarantor to make
specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has
issued. FIN 45 also requires a company (the Guarantor) to recognize, at the
inception of a guarantee, a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in
issuing the guarantee.

In March 2003 and June 2003, the Company transferred certain lease
agreements relating to various properties at its Fremont, California campus to
a new lessor (See Note 17). These agreements require the Company to guarantee
residual values of the leased properties to the lessors at the end of the lease
terms in fiscal 2008 (in the case that the leases are not renewed, the Company
does not exercise the purchase options and the lessors sell the properties and
the sale price is less than the lessors’ costs) of up to $98.7 million ($48.4
million and $50.3 million,



respectively). The terms of the
guarantees, are equal to the remaining terms of the related lease
agreements. Under the accounting provisions of FIN 45, the Company recognized
a liability of approximately $1.0 million ($0.5 million in March 2003 and $0.5
million in June 2003) for the related residual value guarantees under the
leases. The value of these guarantees was determined by computing the
estimated present value of the respective probability-weighted cash flows that
might be expended under the guarantees over the respective leases’ term,
discounted using the Company’s risk adjusted borrowing rate of approximately
2%. The values of these respective guarantees have been recorded as prepaid
rent, with the offset recorded as a liability, and the amounts are being
amortized to income (for the liability) and to expense (for the prepaid rent)
on a ratable basis over the five-year period of the leases.

The Company has issued certain indemnifications to its lessors under
certain of its operating lease agreements, such as, indemnification for certain
environmental matters. The Company has entered into certain insurance
contracts to minimize its exposure related to such indemnifications. As of
June 29, 2003 the Company has not recorded any liability on its financial
statements in connection with these indemnifications, as the Company does not
believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any amounts
will be paid under these guarantees.

The Company has agreements with two financial institutions that guarantee
payment of its Japanese subsidiary’s overdraft protection obligation. The
maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to
make under these agreements at June 29, 2003, is approximately $5.2 million,
the amount available under the overdraft protection agreement. As of June 29,
2003, the Company’s Japanese subsidiary did not owe any amounts under this
agreement. The Company has not recorded any liability in connection with these
guarantees, as the Company does not believe, based on information available,
that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees.

The Company has an agreement with a financial institution to sell to the
institution certain U.S. Dollar-denominated receivables generated from the sale
of its systems, subject to recourse provisions. The Company insures these sold
receivables for approximately 90% of their value and guarantees payment of the
remaining uninsured receivable value in the event that the payment obligation
is not satisfied. Based on historical payment patterns, the Company has
experienced negligible default on payment obligations and therefore, believes
the risk of loss
from default is minimal. The terms of these guarantees are from 90 days past
the due date of the receivable, until collected. At June 29, 2003 the maximum
potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under
this agreement is approximately $2.8 million. As of June 29, 2003, the Company
has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantees, as the
Company does not believe, based on information available, that it is probable
that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees.

Generally, the Company indemnifies, under pre-determined conditions and
limitations, its customers for infringement of third-party intellectual
property rights by its products or services. The Company seeks to limit its
liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the
products or services. The Company does not believe, based on information
available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under
these guarantees.

The Company provides standard warranties on its systems that run generally
for a period of 12 months from system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from
the date of shipment of the system to the customer. The liability amount is
based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system,
customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as the
impact of system reliability improvements.

Note 19: Income Taxes

Significant components of the provision (benefit) for income taxes
attributable to income before income taxes and cumulative effects of changes in
accounting principles are as follows:

Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and
the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the
Company’s net deferred tax assets as of June 29, 2003 and June 30, 2002 are as
follows:



Approximately $23.9 million and $24.9 million of the valuation allowance
for deferred tax assets, for fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively, are
attributable to stock option deductions, the benefit of which will be credited
to equity when realized. The change (increase/(decrease)) in valuation
allowance year over year was ($15.6) million,
$21.0 million, and ($63.5) million
for fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively

Realization of the Company’s net deferred tax assets is dependent on
future taxable income. The Company believes it is more likely than not that
such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively
impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at
this time.

At June 29, 2003, the Company has federal tax loss carryforwards of
approximately $262.0 million, which will expire in varying amounts between 2019
and 2023. The Company also has federal and state tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $81.6 million, of which approximately $67.4 million of credits, will expire in varying amounts between 2005 and 2023. The remaining
balance of $14.2 million of credit carryforwards may be carried forward
indefinitely. A valuation allowance of approximately $12.8 million in 2003 and
$27.3 million in 2002 is attributable to the portion of the deferred tax assets
related to the carryforwards.

Income before income taxes from foreign operations for fiscal years 2003,
2002, and 2001 was $(69.5) million, $(3.7) million, and $18.4 million,
respectively. In addition, the Company received royalty and other income from
foreign sources of $4.9 million, $0.3 million, and $0.9 million, in fiscal
years 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively, which is subject to foreign tax
withholding.

In April 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) closed its examination
of the Company’s tax returns for fiscal years up to and including the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1998. Resolution was reached on a number of issues
including adjustments related to research and development tax credits,
resulting in a reported approximate $24.9 million tax benefit. In addition,
tax expense of approximately $17.0 million associated with implementing
strategies to, in the longer-term, limit the Company’s tax liability on the sale
of the Company’s
products worldwide, was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.
These tax strategies are structured to align the asset ownership and functions
of the Company’s various legal entities around the world with the Company’s
expectations of the level, timing, and sources of future revenues and
profits.

Note 20: Segment, Geographic Information and Major Customers

The Company operates in one business segment: manufacturing and servicing
of front-end wafer processing semiconductor manufacturing equipment. All
products and services are marketed within the geographic regions in which the
Company operates. The Company’s current product offerings qualify for
aggregation under Financial Accounting Standard No. 131, “Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,” as its products are
manufactured and distributed in the same manner, have similar long-term gross
margins and are sold to the same customer base.

The Company operates in four geographic regions: the United States,
Europe, Asia Pacific, and Japan. The following table allocates sales based on
the region where products are manufactured or services performed, irrespective
of where such products or services are sold for fiscal years 2003, 2002, and
2001:



Sales between geographic regions are accounted for at prices that provide
a profit, and are in accordance with the rules and regulations of the
respective governing authorities. Intercompany profit and loss is eliminated
in consolidation. Revenue in each geographic region is recognized in
accordance with the Company’s revenue recognition policy based on SAB 101.

Total export revenue consisting of sales from the Company’s U.S. operating
subsidiaries to non-affiliated customers by geographic region for the three
years is as follows:

During fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2001, a single distinct customer for each
fiscal year accounted for approximately 15% of total sales, respectively. No
individual customer accounted for greater than 10% of total sales in fiscal
2002.

Note 21: Restructuring

Fiscal 2003 Restructuring Activities



The Company has developed programs and incurred restructuring charges in
response to the depressed levels of capital investment by the semiconductor
industry. This situation has caused the Company to evaluate its
revenue outlook and forecasts,
employment levels, facilities utilization and outsourcing activities, and the impact on manufacturing and administrative facilities. Based
on these evaluations, senior management of the Company committed to cost
reduction and exit activities in the quarters ended June 29, 2003 (the June
2003 Plan), March 30, 2003 (the March 2003 Plan), and December 29, 2002 (the
December 2002 Plan). Prior to the end of the June 29, 2003, March 30, 2003,
and December 29, 2002 quarters, management with the proper level of authority
approved specific actions under the respective Plans and communicated the
severance packages to potentially impacted employees in enough detail such that
the employees could determine their type and amount of benefit. None of the
severance payments were contingent on the employees’ future service to the
Company and were immediately payable. The termination of the impacted
employees occurred as soon as practical after the restructuring plans were
announced. The amount of remaining future lease payments for facilities the
Company ceased to use and included in the restructuring charges are
based on management’s estimates using known prevailing real estate market
conditions at that time. Leasehold improvements relating to the vacated
buildings were written off, as these items will have no future economic benefit
to the Company and have been abandoned.

The Company applied the accounting provisions of FAS 146 to the fiscal
2003 restructuring activities as the Company early-adopted FAS 146 during the
December 2002 quarter. Under the provisions of FAS 146, the restructuring
charges for the remaining contractual lease payments, computed as the present
value of remaining contractual payments less estimated sublease income on
vacated facilities were recognized in the quarter in which the Company ceased
to use the facility.

During fiscal 2003, the Company incurred $14.9 million of restructuring
charges, net, associated with its fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001
restructuring plans. As of June 29, 2003, the remaining restructuring reserve consisted of
approximately $11.0 million related to restructurings implemented during fiscal
2003 and approximately $8.3 million related to restructurings implemented
during fiscal 2002.

June 2003 Plan



The Company began carrying out the announced restructuring activities
prior to June 29, 2003, by reducing its workforce in North America, Europe, and
Asia by approximately 30 people and by vacating selected sales and office
facilities located in North America, Europe, and Asia determined to be no
longer critical to the Company’s operations. The employees included in the
Plan were from a broad range of organizations and at multiple levels throughout
the Company, with the majority of the reductions in North America. The Company
recorded a restructuring charge during the quarter ended June 29, 2003, of
approximately $7.6 million, consisting of severance and benefits for
involuntarily terminated employees, charges for the present value of remaining
lease payments on vacated facilities, a loss on the fair value of a vacated
facility and the write-off of related leasehold improvements. In June 2003,
two lease agreements covering four properties were amended, combined, restated,
and transferred to a new lessor under a single lease structure. One of the
transferred leases covered one of the Company’s vacated facilities at its
Fremont, California campus (See Note 17). At the time of the amendment, the
leased facility’s fair value was less than its original cost by approximately
$1.0 million. Accordingly, this amount was recorded as a loss on
the fair value of the vacated facility and included in the $6.7 million
facility-related restructuring charge.

March 2003 Plan

The Company began carrying out the announced restructuring activities
prior to March 30, 2003, by reducing its workforce in North America and Europe
by approximately 50 people and by vacating selected sales and office facilities
located in North America determined to be no longer critical to the Company’s
operations. The employees included in the Plan were from a broad range of
organizations and at multiple levels throughout the Company, with the majority
of the reductions in North America. The Company recorded a restructuring
charge during the quarter ended March 30, 2003, of approximately $4.7 million,
consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees,
charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities, and the write-off
of related leasehold improvements.

The Company began carrying out the announced restructuring activities
prior to December 29, 2002 by reducing its workforce in North America, Europe,
and Asia by approximately 120 employees and by vacating selected sales and
office facilities located in North America, Europe and Asia determined to be no
longer critical to the Company’s operations. The employees included in the
Plan were from a broad range of organizations and at multiple levels throughout
the Company, with approximately 65% from North America and approximately 35%
from Asia and Europe locations. The Company recorded a restructuring charge of
$5.7 million, consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated
employees, charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities, and the
write-off of related leasehold improvements.

Fiscal 2002 Restructuring Activities

In response to the deterioration in semiconductor sales in the first half
of fiscal 2002 which resulted in a contraction in outlook for the wafer
fabrication equipment market and therefore in the Company’s revenues, senior
management of the Company committed to cost reduction and exit activities in
the quarters ended December 30, 2001 (the December 2001 Plan) and September 23,
2001 (the September 2001 Plan). Prior to the end of the December 30, 2001 and
September 23, 2001 quarters, management, with the proper level of authority,
approved specific



actions of the respective Plans and communicated the
severance packages to potentially impacted employees in enough detail such that
the employees could determine their type and amount of benefit. The
termination of the impacted employees occurred as soon as practical after the
plans of restructuring were announced. Lease payments on vacated facilities
are based on management’s estimates using prevailing real estate market conditions. The
Company initially estimated under the plans that, given prevailing real estate
market conditions at that time, it would take approximately 24 months to
sublease its vacated facilities. The Company revised the original estimates
for lease payments on vacated facilities if prevailing real estate market
conditions were subsequently determined to be different than the initial
estimate. Leasehold improvements and certain fixed assets relating to the
vacated buildings were written off as these items have no future economic
benefit to the Company and have been abandoned.

December 2001 Plan

During the second fiscal quarter of 2002, the Company began implementing
restructuring activities which included reducing its workforce by approximately
470 employees in North America, Europe, and Asia, vacating selected office and
warehouse facilities at the Company’s Fremont, California campus determined to
be no longer critical to the Company’s operations, and the closure of certain
offices in Asia. The employees included in the Plan were from a broad range of
organizations and at multiple levels throughout the Company, with approximately
80% from North America and approximately 20% from Asia and Europe locations.
The Company recorded a restructuring charge of $33.8 million relating to
severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, charges for
remaining lease payments on vacated facilities and the write-off of related
leasehold improvements and fixed assets.

During fiscal 2003, the Company recovered approximately $3.8 million of
restructuring charges originally accrued under the December 2001 Plan, $2.1
million for benefits and services offered by the Company that were not utilized
by the terminated employees and approximately $1.7 million related to a
revision to the net amount of lease payments remaining to be paid on the
vacated facilities. In addition, during fiscal 2003, the Company recorded
approximately $3.0 million of additional restructuring charges of which $2.5
million was due to revisions the Company made for the length of time required
to sublease two of its vacated buildings in Fremont, California and
approximately $0.1 million due to additional facility restoration costs
incurred to fulfill the Company’s contractual obligations under the terms of a
lease agreement. Additionally, the Company revised its estimates related to
employee termination costs and recorded $0.4 million of additional employee
termination costs.

Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the December 2001 Plan:



The remainder of the Severance and Benefits reserve balance as of June 29,
2003, is anticipated to be utilized by the end of the 2003 calendar year. The
remainder of the reserve balance for Lease Payments on Vacated Facilities of
$7.5 million as of June 29, 2003, is anticipated to be utilized by the end of
fiscal 2008.

September 2001 Plan

During the first quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company began implementing
restructuring activities which included a reduction of approximately 550
employees in North America, Europe and Asia, vacating selected facilities at
the Company’s headquarters in Fremont, California determined to be no longer
critical to the Company’s operations and discontinuance of the manufacture of
specific products within the Company’s etch product lines. The employees were
from a broad range of organizations and at multiple levels throughout the
Company, with approximately 85% from North America and 15% from Asia and Europe
locations. The Company recorded a restructuring charge of $21.0 million which
included severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, charges
for remaining lease payments and write-offs of leasehold improvements on
vacated facilities, and write-offs for inventories of older etch product
inventories that were discontinued. The discontinued inventory charges of
approximately $7.6 million related to the Company’s decision to discontinue
manufacture of specific products within the Company’s etch product lines. In
fiscal 2003 and 2002, the Company recovered approximately $1.7 million from
unanticipated subsequent sales to the Company’s installed base of customers of
certain portions of the inventory. In addition, in fiscal 2003 and 2002, the
Company physically disposed of approximately $2.7 million of this inventory.
The Company plans to complete its disposition of the remaining quantities of the
discontinued, obsolete inventory by the end of the 2003 calendar year.

During fiscal 2002, the Company also recovered approximately $1.0 million
of the September 2001 Plan charge due to lower than estimated employee
termination costs of $0.7 million and lower than estimated expenses relating to
a vacated facility lease of $0.3 million. During fiscal 2003, approximately
$0.9 million was recovered due to $0.6 million of lower than
previously estimated employee severance and termination costs and $0.3 million was
recovered due to actual expenses being lower than estimated for vacated
facility leases. In addition, in the second quarter of fiscal 2003, the
Company recorded additional charges for the September 2001 Plan based on a
revision of its estimate of the length of time required to sublease one of its
vacated buildings in Fremont, California. Based on prevailing market
conditions, the Company extended the accrual for lease payments to the end of
the lease in June 2004 and recorded an additional $0.6 million relating to
these remaining lease payments.



Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the September 2001 Plan:

The remainder of the Severance and Benefits reserve balance of $0.2
million, as of June 29, 2003, is anticipated to be utilized by the end of the
2003 calendar year. The remainder of the reserve balance for Lease Payments on
Vacated Facilities of $0.5 million as of June 29, 2003, is anticipated to be
utilized by the end of fiscal 2004.

Fiscal 2001 Restructuring Activities

During the second quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company completed the
remaining elements of its restructuring activities under the June 2001 Plan.
An additional $1.1 million of restructuring charges was recovered due to lower
than estimated employee termination costs.

Note 22: Purchased Technology for R&D

During the second quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company made an equity
investment in, and purchased a portfolio of CMP intellectual property rights
and research and development technology from Strasbaugh. The Company
recognized a one-time charge to income of $8.0 million for the purchase of
in-process research and development technology and recorded a $6.0 million
investment in preferred stock and intangible assets. The Company’s equity
interest in Strasbaugh, representing approximately 20% of its total capital
stock, is accounted for under the equity method, and the intellectual property
rights are being amortized ratably over five years. Accumulated amortization
as of the end of fiscal 2003 and 2002 was $1.0 million and $0.6 million,
respectively.

Based on the Company’s analysis of Strasbaugh’s current and expected
financial performance, the Company determined in the third quarter of fiscal
2002 that the carrying value of its equity investment had experienced an
other-than-temporary impairment and recorded a $2.0 million charge in other
expense to write down the investment to its estimated fair value.

The Company’s equity in the income (loss) from Strasbaugh as of the end of
fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 was ($0.8) million, ($0.8) million and $0.7
million, respectively. The income (loss) from the investment in Strasbaugh has
not been material, and, therefore, has not been itemized in other income, net,
on the accompanying statements of operations.

Note 23: Asset Impairment Charge

During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company determined that the
carrying value of



certain of its laboratory and demonstration equipment exceeded its fair
value less costs to sell. Fair value was assessed using the market values of
similar used laboratory and demonstration equipment. Impairment occurred due to
rapid technological changes. In accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards No. 121, “Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of,”
the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $9.5 million. A $5.3
million write-down to fair value of certain laboratory tools was included in
R&D expenses, and $4.2 million of write-downs to fair value of demonstration
equipment were included in Selling General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses.

Note 24: Related Party Transactions

During fiscal year 2001, the Company’s President and Chief Operating
Officer signed a promissory note with the Company entitling him to borrow up to
$1.0 million dollars from the Company at 6.75% simple interest. As of June 29,
2003, the entire principal amount, $1.0 million, and accrued interest were
outstanding. The loan is secured by a mortgage on his personal residence and
is repayable, in full, together with accrued interest, at any time, but no
later than May 8, 2005.

Note 25: Litigation and Patent Settlement

During the second quarter of fiscal 2002 the Company signed a final
settlement agreement with Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc.
(Varian) in connection with the patent infringement litigation filed by Varian
in October 1993. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Varian granted
the Company nonexclusive license to the patents involved in the litigation. The
Company agreed to pay Varian $20.0 million in cash, $5.0 million in December
2001, and the remainder to be paid in equal quarterly installments of $1.25
million over a three-year period. The payments began in the third quarter of
fiscal 2002 with a quarterly payment of $1.25 million. As of June 29, 2003, a
total amount of $12.5 million was paid to Varian, which included the initial
$5.0 million in December 2001 and six additional quarterly installment payments
of $1.25 million each, totaling $7.5 million as of June 29, 2003. The total
obligation remaining as of June 29, 2003 is $7.5 million, which will be paid
$1.25 million per quarter through the second quarter of fiscal 2005 (December
2004). Additionally, the Company issued a warrant with a fair value of $21.5
million that entitled Varian to purchase 2,000,000 shares of the Company’s
Common Stock at an exercise price of $21.30 per share. As part of the full and
final settlement, Varian and the Company agreed to dismiss all pending claims
and counterclaims relating to the litigation.

In connection with the settlement, the Company recorded a charge of $38.8
million in the quarter ended December 30, 2001, which represents approximately
93% of the total value of the settlement. The remaining portion of the total
value of the settlement relating to the future licensed use of the patents,
$2.7 million, is being amortized ratably over 10 quarters. Accumulated
amortization as of the end of fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 was approximately
$1.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively.

The imputed value of the warrant was determined using the Black-Scholes
valuation model. The key assumptions used in the valuation model were an
expected life of 4 years, an expected stock price volatility of 61% and a
risk-free interest rate of 4.5%.

From time to time, the Company has received notices from third parties
alleging infringement of such parties’ patent or other intellectual property
rights by the Company’s products. In such cases it is the Company’s policy to
defend the claims, or if considered appropriate, negotiate licenses on
commercially reasonable terms. However, no assurance can be given
that in the future the
Company will be able to negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable



terms, or at all, or that any litigation resulting from such claims would
not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
position, liquidity, operating results or its consolidated financial statements
taken as a whole.

Note 26: Subsequent Events (unaudited)

During the quarter ending September 2003, the Company added a second
condition to the accelerated vesting provision contained in one of
the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer’s stock
option awards that was previously modified in the December 2002 quarter. When
and if the vesting of the award is accelerated, all unvested shares shall immediately
become fully vested and exercisable, and any remaining deferred
compensation would then be recognized as compensation expense within SG&A. The award now
provides for accelerated vesting when each of the following conditions is met:
(1) the Nasdaq national market closing price of the Company’s Common Stock reaches or
exceeds $20.00 per share and (2) applying U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles, the Company’s fiscal quarter net income exceeds $2.5 million after
deducting any incremental amortization expense that results from acceleration
of these same options. The two conditions need not be met simultaneously nor
in a specific order.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lam Research Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lam
Research Corporation as of June 29, 2003 and June 30, 2002, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended June 29, 2003. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 14(a).
These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Lam Research
Corporation at June 29, 2003 and June 30, 2002, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June
29, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
