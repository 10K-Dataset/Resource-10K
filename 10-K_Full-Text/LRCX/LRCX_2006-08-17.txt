Item 1.

Business

Lam Research Corporation (Lam or the Company), a Delaware corporation, was founded in 1980 and
is headquartered in Fremont, California. The mailing address for our principal executive offices is
4650 Cushing Parkway, Fremont, California 94538, and our telephone number is (510) 572-0200.
Additional information about Lam is available on our web site at http://www.lamresearch.com. Our
Forms 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and Forms 8-K are available online at the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) web site on the Internet. The address of that site is http://www.sec.gov. We also
make available free of charge the Forms 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and Forms 8-K and any amendments to those
reports on our corporate web site at http://www.lamresearch.com as soon as reasonably possible
after we file them with or furnish them to the SEC.

We design, manufacture, market, and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the
fabrication of integrated circuits and are recognized as a major provider of such equipment to the
worldwide semiconductor industry. Semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process
steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual integrated circuits. Our products
selectively remove portions of various films from the wafer in the creation of semiconductors. We
leverage our expertise in these areas to develop intellectual property (IP) for integrated
processing solutions.

Etch Process

Etch processes, which are repeated numerous times during the wafer fabrication cycle, are
required to manufacture every type of semiconductor device produced today. To etch devices designed
at current and future technology nodes, our etch systems employ various technologies utilized to
generate plasma sources, a critical requirement of the etch process.

The etch process defines linewidths and other microscopic and sub-microscopic features on
integrated circuits. Plasma etching was developed to meet the demand for device geometries smaller
than 3 microns. Plasma consists of charged and neutral species that react with exposed portions of
the wafer surface to remove dielectric, metal, or polysilicon material and produce the finely
delineated features and patterns of an integrated circuit.

Advanced integrated circuit manufacturing requires etch systems capable of creating structures
for the 90/65 nanometer (nm) technology node for current-generation products and for the 65 nm
and below technology nodes for future semiconductor products. At this time, memory manufacturers
are continuing to transition from aluminum to copper conductive lines, while leading logic
manufacturers are progressing with the implementation of more fragile dielectric insulating
materials (low k and porous low k). Advanced manufacturing facilities are producing integrated
circuits on 300 millimeter (mm) (12 inch) silicon wafers while other facilities use wafer diameters
of 200 mm (8 inch) and smaller. Semiconductor manufacturers will continue to require more precise


control over the etching process in order to accommodate these decreasing linewidths and increasing
wafer diameters. Our etch products and services are defined around the
Alliance

®

and 2300

®

Etch Series platforms.

Dielectric Etch Products

Exelan

®

, Exelan High Performance, Exelan HPT, 2300 Exelan, 2300 Exelan Flex™, and
2300 Exelan Flex45™ Systems

. The Exelan family of products improves productivity and enables our
customers to create today’s most advanced semiconductor devices. These systems, based on Lam’s
patented Dual Frequency Confined (DFC) technology, can be extended to keep pace with the
semiconductor industry’s roadmap for etching smaller features and newer dielectric materials.
Exelan was introduced to meet the requirements for manufacturing copper conductive lines using dual
damascene etch schemes. Exelan has been extended through a series of performance improvement
upgrades, Exelan High Performance and Exelan HPT, to meet the etch requirements for the sub-130 nm
technology node. The 2300 Exelan, which was introduced to address the industry’s transition to 300
mm wafers, is a 200 mm and 300 mm wafer capable product. The 2300 Exelan Flex and Exelan Flex45
extend the capability of the 2300 Exelan family of products to address the requirements for 65 nm
and below technology nodes.

Conductor Etch Products

TCP

®

9400 and TCP

®

9600 Series and 2300 Versys

®

Series
Systems

. The first TCP products were introduced in late 1992. They use Lam’s patented Transformer
Coupled Plasma™ source technology, a high-density, low-pressure plasma source that can etch
features for the 130 nm and below technology nodes. For 200 mm wafer sizes, we offer the
TCP

®

9400PTX and TCP

®

9400DFM for silicon etch applications, the
TCP

®

9400DSiE™ for MEMS (micro-electromechanical systems) based deep silicon etch, and
the TCP

®

9600PTX and TCP

®

9600DFM for metal etch applications. These systems
are used in the production of a broad range of advanced logic and memory devices as well as MEMS
applications.

The 2300 Versys system for etching silicon and metal films employs a scaled design of TCP
technology to address leading-edge device structure requirements. The 2300 Versys system has the
capability to process 200 mm and 300 mm wafer sizes. The 2300 Versys HP addresses metal etch
requirements for the 90 nm node and beyond. The 2300 Versys Metal45™ addresses backend metal etch
uniformity and throughput needs for memory customers at 70 nm and beyond as well as metal hard mask
applications for logic customers at 45 nm and beyond. The 2300 Versys Star™ silicon etch system
enables sequential step tuning of gas flow and wafer temperature, which provides the critical
dimension uniformity required for sub-110 nm technology nodes. The 2300 Versys Kiyo™ and Versys
Kiyo45 enable processing at sub-65 nm technology nodes.

Lam 2300 process chambers can be converted within our customers’ facilities from 200 mm to 300
mm, which has the advantage of providing customers with greater flexibility and lower costs. This
capability, combined with an overall system footprint comparable to 200 mm systems, allows
semiconductor manufacturers to develop integrated circuits using 200 mm wafers instead of more
expensive 300 mm wafers and later scale up to 300 mm wafer processing.

Resist Strip Products

Lam offers integrated strip modules that remove the photoresist following metal and silicon
etch for both 200 mm and 300 mm wafer manufacturing. Stripping the resist on the same system
prevents exposure to air, protecting the wafers from corrosion.

For 65 nm technologies and below, resist stripping after ion implantation is becoming a
critical step because of the difficulty in fully cleaning resist residues without removing too much
of the silicon. To address this emerging market, Lam has extended its successful silicon etch
product line used in combination with a microwave resist stripper for both 200 mm and 300 mm wafer
processing.

Cleaning Process

As semiconductor devices are manufactured through a series of deposition and patterning steps,
wafers must be cleaned periodically to remove residues and contamination that could degrade device
performance. These cleaning operations, which typically follow a plasma etch or strip step, involve
placing a wafer in contact with a liquid cleaning agent, which removes surface residues through a
combination of reaction and dissolution.

At the 65 nm technology node and below, wafer cleaning is becoming increasingly challenging
because the smaller, more fragile devices are more susceptible to damage from the chemistries and
mechanical forces of the cleaning process. As a result, many semiconductor manufacturers are
transitioning from batch to single-wafer cleaning systems, which enable better control of the
cleaning process. Lam provides technologies that it believes address the damage concerns of wafer
cleaning at sub-65 nm, allowing chemical cleaning to be extended to future technology nodes.



2300 cleaning products.

Based on the production-proven 2300 Etch platform, Lam’s products are
designed to offer cleaning capability for sub-65 nm technologies. Lam’s proprietary Confined
Chemical Cleaning™ technology provides a short chemical exposure time that limits contact with
device structures, thereby lowering the risk of damage. In addition, the short exposure time allows
greater flexibility in selecting cleaning chemicals for effective removal of process residues.

There were no fiscal year 2006 revenues from 2300 cleaning products.

2300 Bevel Clean product.

Lam offers bevel clean modules that remove films on the edge of
the wafer using edge confined plasma technology. For 65 nm technologies and below, a primary
source of device yield limiters are coming from defects transferred from the wafer edge. During
device patterning, complex interactions of film deposition, lithography, etching and chemical
mechanical polishing (CMP) result in a wide range of unstable film stacks on the wafer edge. In
subsequent steps these film layers can produce defects that are transported to the device area of
the wafer. Removal of these films at select points in the integration flow results in reduced
defects and higher device yields. To address this emerging market, Lam’s edge confined plasma
provides customers with the latitude to control the wafer edge at multiple steps during the device
fabrication process. Plasma processing can remove a broad range of films with precise control of
the processing zone.

There were no fiscal year 2006 revenues from 2300 Bevel Clean products.

Research and Development

The market for semiconductor capital equipment is characterized by rapid technological change
and product innovation. Our ability to maintain competitive advantage depends in part on our
continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products.
Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to R&D
programs and seek to maintain close and responsive relationships with our customers and suppliers.

Our R&D expenses during fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004 were $228.9 million, $194.1 million,
and $170.5 million, respectively. Expenditures are targeted at developing new product areas and
continued enhancements to our existing products. We believe current challenges for customers in the
pre- and post-etch applications present opportunities for us. Many of these challenges are new and
are a result of the transition to sub 90-nanometer device structures. We plan to leverage our
extensive production experience in etch and strip into new products and new capabilities for our
customers at the 65, 45, and 32-nanometer nodes, including post ion implantation strip, clean, and
patterning.

We expect to continue to make substantial investments in R&D to meet our customers’ product
needs and enhance our competitive position.

Marketing, Sales, and Service

Our marketing and sales efforts are focused on building long-term relationships with our
customers. These efforts are supported by a team of product marketing and sales professionals as
well as equipment and process engineers that work closely with individual customers to develop
solutions to their processing needs. We maintain ongoing support relationships with our customers
and have an extensive network of field service personnel in place throughout the United States,
Europe, Korea, Japan and Asia Pacific. We believe that comprehensive support programs and close
working relationships with customers are essential to maintaining high customer satisfaction and
our competitiveness in the marketplace.

We offer standard warranties for our systems that generally run for a period of 12 months from
system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer. The
warranty provides that systems shall be free from defects in material and workmanship and conform
to our published specifications. The warranty is limited to repair of the defect or replacement
with new or like-new equivalent goods and is valid when the buyer provides prompt notification
within the warranty period of the claimed defect or non-conformity and also makes the items
available for inspection and repair. We also offer extended warranty packages to our customers to
purchase as desired.



Export Sales

A significant portion of our sales and operations occur outside the United States and,
therefore, may be subject to certain risks, including but not limited to tariffs and other
barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing non-U.S. operations, adverse tax consequences,
exchange rate fluctuations, changes in currency controls, compliance with U.S. and international
laws and regulations, including U.S. export restrictions, and economic and political conditions.
There can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial position, and results of operations and cash flows. Sales were as follows:

Customers

Our customers include many of the world’s leading semiconductor manufacturers. Customers
continue to establish joint ventures, alliances and technology licensing arrangements, which have
the potential to positively or negatively impact our competitive position. In fiscal year 2006,
revenues from Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd., accounted for approximately 15% of total revenues
and revenues from Toshiba Corporation accounted for approximately 12% of total revenues. In fiscal
year 2005, revenues from Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd., accounted for approximately 13% of
total revenues, and, in fiscal year 2004, revenues from ST Microelectronics accounted for
approximately 15% of total revenues.

A material reduction in orders from our customers in the semiconductor industry could
adversely affect our results of operations and projected financial condition. Our business depends
upon the expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers. Semiconductor manufacturers’ business, in
turn, depends on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and the
availability of equipment capacity to support that demand.

Backlog

Our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems, spares, and services where written
customer requests have been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is
anticipated within the next 12 months. Our policy is to revise our backlog for order cancellations
and to make adjustments to reflect, among other things, spares volume estimates and customer
delivery date changes. We schedule production of our systems based upon purchase orders in backlog
and our customers’ delivery requirements. Included in our systems backlog are orders for which
written requests have been accepted, prices and product specifications have been agreed upon, and
shipment of systems is expected within one year. The spares and services backlog includes customer
orders for products that have not yet shipped and for services that have not yet been provided.
Where specific spare parts and customer service purchase contracts do not contain discrete delivery
dates, we use volume estimates at the contract price and over the contract period, not exceeding 12
months, in calculating backlog amounts.

As of June 25, 2006 and June 26, 2005, our backlog was approximately $521 million and $351
million, respectively. Generally, orders for our products and services are subject to cancellation
by our customers with limited penalties. Because some orders are received for shipments in the same
quarter and due to possible customer changes in delivery dates and cancellations of orders, our
backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual revenue
levels for succeeding periods.



Manufacturing

Our manufacturing operations consist mainly of assembling and testing components,
sub-assemblies, and modules that are then integrated into finished systems prior to shipment to our
customers. Most of the assembly and testing of our products is conducted in cleanroom environments.

We have agreements with third parties to outsource certain aspects of our manufacturing,
production warehousing, and logistics functions. We continue to believe that these outsourcing
contracts provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up or down in a more timely and cost
effective manner, enabling us to respond to the cyclical nature of our business. We believe that we
have selected reputable providers and have secured their performance on terms documented in written
contracts. However, it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we
expect, and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business and have a negative effect on
our operating results and financial condition. Overall, we believe we have effective mechanisms to
manage risks associated with our outsourcing relationships. Refer to Note 15 of our Consolidated
Financial Statements, included in Item 8 herein, for further information concerning our outsourcing
commitments.

Certain components and subassemblies included in our products are only obtained from a single
supplier. We believe that, in many cases, alternative sources could be obtained and qualified to
supply these products. Nevertheless, a prolonged inability to obtain these components could have an
adverse effect on our operating results and could unfavorably impact our customer relationships.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the management of hazardous
materials. We are currently not aware of any pending notices of violation, fines, lawsuits, or
investigations arising from environmental matters that would have any material effect on our
business. We believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have
obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise addressing) all necessary environmental permits to
conduct our business. Nevertheless, the failure to comply with present or future regulations could
result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, and cessation of our operations or
reduction in our customers’ acceptance of our products. These regulations could require us to alter
our current operations, to acquire significant equipment, or to incur substantial other expenses to
comply with environmental regulations. Our failure to control the use, sale, transport or disposal
of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities.

Employees

As of August 4, 2006, we had approximately 2,430 regular full-time employees.

Each of our employees is required to sign an agreement to maintain the confidentiality of our
proprietary information. All employees are required to sign an acknowledgement that they have read
and agree to abide by a statement of standards of business conduct. In the semiconductor and
semiconductor equipment industries, competition for highly skilled employees is intense. Our future
success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to attract and retain qualified
employees, particularly in the R&D and customer support functions.

Competition

The semiconductor capital equipment industry is characterized by rapid change and is highly
competitive throughout the world. In order to compete effectively, we invest significant financial
resources to continue to strengthen and enhance our product and services portfolio and to maintain
customer service and support locations globally. Semiconductor manufacturers evaluate capital
equipment suppliers in many areas, including, but not limited to, process performance,
productivity, customer support, defect control, and overall cost of ownership, which can be
affected by many factors such as equipment design, reliability, software advancements, etc. Our
ability to succeed in the marketplace will depend upon our ability to maintain existing products
and introduce product enhancements and new products on a timely basis. In addition, semiconductor
manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate new capital equipment
into semiconductor production lines. As a result, once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a
particular supplier’s equipment and qualified it for production, the manufacturer generally
maintains that selection for that specific production application and technology node. Accordingly,
we may experience difficulty in selling to a given customer if that customer has qualified a
competitor’s equipment. We must also continue to meet the expectations of our installed base of
customers through the delivery of high-quality and cost efficient spare parts in the presence of
third-party spares provider competition.

We face significant competition with all of our products and services. Certain of our existing
and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive
engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support organizations than we do.
We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current
products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with enhanced price/performance
characteristics. If our competitors make



acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers, or
other entities, covering products similar to those we sell, our ability to sell our products to
those customers could be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will continue to
compete successfully in the future. Our primary competitors in the etch market are Tokyo Electron,
Ltd. and Applied Materials, Inc.

Patents and Licenses

Our policy is to seek patents on inventions relating to new or enhanced products and processes
developed as part of our ongoing research, engineering, manufacturing, and support activities. We
currently hold a number of United States and foreign patents covering various aspects of our
products and processes. We believe that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the useful
life of the technologies and processes disclosed and claimed therein. Our patents, which cover
material aspects of our past and present core products, have current durations ranging from
approximately 3 to 17 years. We believe that, although the patents we own and may obtain in the
future will be of value, they will not alone determine our success, which depends principally upon
our engineering, marketing, support, and delivery skills. However, in the absence of patent
protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to imitate our products, manufacturing
techniques, and processes. In addition, other companies and inventors may receive patents that
contain claims applicable or similar to our products and processes. The sale of products covered by
patents of others could require licenses that may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at
all. For further discussion of legal matters, see Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” of this Form 10-K.

Other Cautionary Statements

See the discussion of risks in the section of this Form 10-K entitled Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be
carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business because such factors may
significantly impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. As a result of these
risk factors, as well as other risks discussed in our other SEC filings, our actual results could
differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. No priority or
significance is intended, or should be attached, to the order in which the risk factors appear.

Our Quarterly Revenues and Operating Results are Unpredictable

Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to
a number of factors, not all of which are in our control. We manage our expense levels based in
part on our expectations of future revenues. If revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet
our expectations, our operating results may be adversely affected. Because our operating expenses
are based in part on anticipated future revenues, and a certain amount of those expenses are
relatively fixed, a change in the timing of recognition of revenue and/or the level of gross profit
from a single transaction can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter. Factors
that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include, but are not limited to:



Further, because a significant amount of our R&D and administrative operations and capacity is
located at our Fremont, California campus, natural, physical, logistical or other events or
disruptions affecting these facilities (including labor disruptions, earthquakes, and power
failures) could adversely impact our financial performance.

We Derive Our Revenues Primarily from a Relatively Small Number of High-Priced Systems

System sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue. Our systems can typically
range in price up to approximately $6.0 million per unit, and our revenues in any given quarter are
dependent upon the acceptance of a rather limited number of such systems. As a result, the
inability to declare revenue on even a few systems can cause a significant adverse impact on our
revenues for that quarter.

Variations in the Amount of Time it Takes for Our Customers to Accept Our Systems May Cause
Fluctuation in Our Operating Results

We generally recognize revenue for new system sales on the date of customer acceptance or the
date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse. As a result, the fiscal period in which
we are able to recognize new systems revenues is typically subject to the length of time that our
customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation,
which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate.

The Semiconductor Equipment Industry Is Volatile and Reduced Product Demand Has a Negative Impact
on Shipments

Our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers,
which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and
products using integrated circuits. The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and
historically experiences periodic downturns. Business conditions historically have changed rapidly
and unpredictably.

Fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers could continue to materially
affect our aggregate shipments, revenues and operating results. Where appropriate, we will attempt
to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures
with anticipated revenue streams, which sometimes result in restructuring charges. Even during
periods of reduced revenues, we must continue to invest in research and development and maintain
extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive, which
may temporarily harm our financial results.

We Depend on New Products and Processes for Our Success. Consequently, We are Subject to Risks
Associated with Rapid Technological Change

Rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased
pressure to develop technological advances enabling such processes. We believe that our future
success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved
capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products. If new products have reliability or
quality problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs,
delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses.
We may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully, or new products that we
introduce may fail in the marketplace. Our failure to complete commercialization of these new
products in a timely manner could result in unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence, which
would adversely affect our financial results.

In order to develop new products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant
investments in R&D and to pursue joint development relationships with customers, suppliers or other
members of the industry. We must manage product transitions and joint development relationships
successfully, as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing
products. Moreover, future technologies, processes or product developments may render our current
product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive products, or obsolete inventory, or
both.



We Are Subject to Risks Relating to Product Concentration and Lack of Product Revenue
Diversification

We derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products, and we
expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near
term. Continued market acceptance of these products is, therefore, critical to our future success.
Our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could therefore be adversely
affected by:

In addition, the fact that we offer a more limited product line creates the risk that our
customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer
additional products as well. This may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with
certain customers. Such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated
with technology changes. Since we are primarily a provider of etch equipment, our business is
affected by our customers’ use of etching steps in their processes. Should technologies change so
that the manufacture of semiconductor chips requires fewer etching steps, this might have a larger
impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors.

We Have a Limited Number of Key Customers

Sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall
revenue, new orders and profitability. As a result, the actions of even one customer may subject us
to revenue swings that are difficult to predict. Similarly, significant portions of our credit risk
may, at any given time, be concentrated among a limited number of customers, so that the failure of
even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our
financial results.

Strategic Alliances May Have Negative Effects on our Business

Increasingly, semiconductor companies are entering into strategic alliances with one another
to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies. Often, one of the
outcomes of such an alliance is the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function or a
series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment. While this could work
to our advantage if Lam’s equipment becomes the basis for the function or process, it could work to
our disadvantage if a competitor’s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such
function or process. In the latter case, even if Lam’s equipment was previously used by a customer,
that equipment may be displaced in current and future applications by the tools standardized by the
alliance.

Similarly, our customers may team with, or follow the lead of, educational or research
institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps. If
those institutions utilize a competitor’s equipment when they establish those processes, it is
likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing
lines. These actions could adversely impact our market share and subsequent business.

We Are Dependent Upon a Limited Number of Key Suppliers

We obtain certain components and sub-assemblies included in our products from a single
supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We have established long-term contracts with many of
these suppliers. These long-term contracts can take a variety of forms. We may renew these
contracts periodically. In some cases, these suppliers sold us products during at least the last
four years, and we expect
that we will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we will otherwise replace
them with competent alternative suppliers. However, several of our outsourced assembly suppliers
are relatively new providers to us so that our experience with them



and their performance is
limited. Where practical, our intent is to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that
the failure of any single supplier will adversely affect our business. Nevertheless, a prolonged
inability to obtain certain components could impair our ability to ship products, lower our
revenues and thus adversely affect our operating results and result in damage to our customer
relationships.

Our Outsource Providers May Fail to Perform as We Expect

Outsource providers have played and will play key roles in our manufacturing operations and in
many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology, facilities
management, and certain elements of our finance organization. Although we aim at selecting
reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts, it is
possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure
could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, the expansive role of outsource
providers has required and will continue to require us to implement changes to our existing
operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with and manage the performance of these outsource
providers. Any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes and new procedures
could adversely affect our customer relationships and/or have a negative effect on our operating
results.

Once a Semiconductor Manufacturer Commits to Purchase a Competitor’s Semiconductor Manufacturing
Equipment, the Manufacturer Typically Continues to Purchase That Competitor’s Equipment, Making It
More Difficult for Us to Sell our Equipment to That Customer

Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer
processing equipment into a semiconductor production line. We believe that once a semiconductor
manufacturer selects a particular supplier’s processing equipment, the manufacturer generally
relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application. Accordingly, we expect it
to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor’s
equipment.

We Are Subject to Risks Associated with Our Competitors’ Strategic Relationships and Their
Introduction of New Products and We May Lack the Financial Resources or Technological Capabilities
of Certain of Our Competitors Needed to Capture Increased Market Share

We expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future competitors. We
believe that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and
are planning to introduce new products, which may affect our ability to sell our existing products.
We face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading
semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this
could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers.

We believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer
a broad range of products, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to
invest in product and process R&D. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial
resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and
support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the
semiconductor equipment industry. These competitors may deeply discount or give away products
similar to those that we sell, challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar
accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products. For these reasons, we may fail
to continue to compete successfully worldwide.

In addition, our competitors may provide innovative technology that may have performance
advantages over systems we currently, or expect to, offer. They may be able to develop products
comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving
customer requirements. In particular, while we currently are developing additional product
enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely
manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements
successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive.
Accordingly, we may be unable to continue to compete in our markets, competition may intensify, or
future competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial
condition, and/or cash flows.



Our Future Success Depends on International Sales and the Management of Global Operations

Non-U.S. sales accounted for approximately 86% in fiscal year 2006, 84% in fiscal year 2005
and 82% in fiscal year 2004 of our total revenue. We expect that international sales will continue
to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in future years.

We are subject to various challenges related to the management of global operations, and
international sales are subject to risks including, but not limited to:

Certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the U.S.
Government. Our failure or inability to obtain such licenses would substantially limit our markets
and severely restrict our revenues. Many of the challenges noted above are applicable in China,
which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of
potential significant growth for our business. As the business volume between China and the rest of
the world grows, there is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships between China, Taiwan,
Japan, and the United States, that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade
disruptions which would adversely affect our business with China and/or Taiwan and perhaps the
entire Asia region. A significant trade disruption in these areas could have a material, adverse
impact on our future revenue and profits.

We are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency
exchange rates. The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars except for
certain of our revenues in Japan that are denominated in Japanese Yen, certain of our spares and
service contracts which are denominated in other currencies, and expenses related to our non-U.S.
sales and support offices which are denominated in these countries’ local currency.

We currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact
of the exchange rate fluctuations on Japanese Yen-denominated assets and forecasted Japanese
Yen-denominated revenue where we currently believe our primary exposure to currency rate
fluctuation lies and will continue to enter into hedging transactions, for the purposes outlined,
in the foreseeable future. However, these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect
because differences between the actual timing of customer acceptances and our forecasts of those
acceptances may leave us either over- or under-hedged on any given transaction. Moreover, by
hedging our Yen-denominated assets with currency forward contracts, we may miss favorable currency
trends, that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges. Additionally, we currently do
not enter into such forward contracts for currencies other than the Yen, and we therefore are
subject to both favorable and unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact
business (including intercompany transactions) in other currencies.

Our Financial Results May Be Adversely Impacted By Higher Than Expected Tax Rates Or Exposure To
Additional Income Tax Liabilities

As a global company, our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic
composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region. We are subject to
income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and
significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities. Our effective tax
rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with
differing statutory tax rates, in the valuation of deferred tax assets, in tax laws or by



material
audit assessments, which could affect our profitability. In particular, the carrying value of
deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the United States, is dependent on our ability to
generate future taxable income in the United States. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay
is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax
authority could affect our profitability.

Changes in Accounting Standards for Equity-Based Compensation May Adversely Affect our Operating
Results, Our Stock Price, and Our Competitiveness in the Employee Marketplace

The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) required us to expense all equity-based compensation provided
to employees and directors beginning with our quarter ending September 25, 2005. The environment
for skilled employees that are knowledgeable about our products and services is a competitive one,
and we believe that equity-based compensation is an important part of the overall compensation that
we offer to attract and retain such employees. SFAS No. 123(R) has decreased and will continue to
decrease our earnings based on its measure of the value of equity-based compensation. There is some
risk that the design of our compensation plans is ineffective at balancing our profitability and
employee retention objectives.

A Failure to Comply with Environmental Regulations May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results

We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal
of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals. We believe that we are in general compliance
with these regulations and that we have obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise addressing) all
necessary environmental permits to conduct our business. These permits generally relate to the
disposal of hazardous wastes. Nevertheless, the failure to comply with present or future
regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, cessation of our
operations or reduction in our customers’ acceptance of our products. These regulations could
require us to alter our current operations, to acquire significant equipment or to incur
substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. Our failure to control the
use, sale, transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities.

If We Are Unable to Adjust the Scale of Our Business in Response to Rapid Changes in Demand in the
Semiconductor Equipment Industry, Our Operating Results and Our Ability to Compete Successfully May
Be Impaired

The business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry has historically been characterized
by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our management to adjust spending and
resources allocated to operating activities. During periods of rapid growth or decline in demand
for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and
business controls, management processes, information systems and procedures and in training,
managing, and appropriately sizing our supply chain, our work force and other components of our
business on a timely basis. Our success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our
executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these
challenges effectively. If we do not adequately meet these challenges, our gross margins and
earnings may be impaired during periods of demand decline, and we may lack the infrastructure and
resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during
periods of demand growth.

If We Choose to Acquire or Dispose of Product Lines and Technologies, We May Encounter Unforeseen
Costs and Difficulties That Could Impair Our Financial Performance

An important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would
complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, or enhance
our technological capabilities. As a result, we may make acquisitions of complementary companies,
products or technologies, or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies,
which no longer fit our long-term strategies. Managing an acquired business, disposing of product
technologies or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks, including
difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business
or product groups, diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns,
amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of
acquired or disposed operations among others. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of
product lines or technologies, or reduction in personnel or that our management, personnel, or
systems will be adequate to support continued operations. Any such inabilities or inadequacies
could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and
cash flows.



In addition, any acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances
of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of
related intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and/or the price of our Common
Stock.

The Market for Our Common Stock is Volatile, Which May Affect Our Ability to Raise Capital or Make
Acquisitions

The market price for our Common Stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the
past years. The trading price of our Common Stock could continue to be highly volatile and
fluctuate widely in response to factors, including but not limited to the following:

In addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations.
Historically, we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our Common Stock due in part
to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for
semiconductors. These broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the
price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following
volatile periods in the price of stock, many companies became the object of securities class action
litigation. If we are sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs, and it
could divert management’s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on the price for
our Common Stock.

We Rely Upon Certain Critical Information Systems for the Operation of our Business

We maintain and rely upon certain critical Information Systems for the effective operation of
our business. These Information Systems include telecommunications, the internet, our corporate
intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, network communications, and e-mail.
These Information Systems may be owned by us or by our outsource providers or even third parties
such as vendors and contractors and may be maintained by us or by such providers and third parties.
These Information Systems are subject to attacks, failures, and access denials from a number of
potential sources including viruses, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, and physical
damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines, and networking equipment. To the extent that
these Information Systems are under our control, we have implemented security procedures, such as
virus protection software and emergency recovery processes, to address the outlined risks; however,
security procedures for Information Systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability
to use or access these Information Systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the
timely and efficient operation of our business.



Intellectual Property and Other Claims Against Us Can Be Costly and Could Result in the Loss of
Significant Rights Which Are Necessary to Our Continued Business and Profitability

Third parties may assert infringement, unfair competition or other claims against us. From
time to time, other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or
other intellectual property rights. In addition, our Bylaws and indemnity obligations provide that
we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings
resulting from their service to Lam. In such cases, it is our policy either to defend the claims or
to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms. However, we may be
unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on
commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and any litigation resulting from these claims by other
parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results. Moreover, although we
seek to obtain insurance to protect us from claims and cover losses to our property, there is no
guarantee that such insurance will fully indemnify us for any losses that we may incur.

We May Fail to Protect Our Proprietary Technology Rights, Which Would Affect Our Business

Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology. While we attempt to protect our
proprietary technology through patents, copyrights and trade secret protection, we believe that our
success also depends on increasing our technological expertise, continuing our development of new
systems, increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base, and providing
comprehensive support and service to our customers. However, we may be unable to protect our
technology in all instances, or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology
independently. We currently hold a number of United States and foreign patents and pending patent
applications. However, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any
patents the United States or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue
patents for pending applications. In addition, the rights granted or anticipated under any of these
patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or, in fact provide no
competitive advantages.

We Are Subject to the Internal Control Evaluation and Attestation Requirements of Section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include in our
annual report our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
and our audited financial statements as of the end of each fiscal year. Furthermore, our
independent registered public accounting firm (Firm) is required to attest to whether our
assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is fairly stated
in all material respects and separately report on whether it believes we maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal
year. We have successfully completed our assessment and obtained our Firm’s attestation as to the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 25, 2006. In future
years, if we fail to timely complete this assessment, or if our Firm cannot timely attest to our
assessment, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and a loss of public confidence in our
internal control. In addition, any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or
difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to
fail to timely meet our regulatory reporting obligations.

Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Must Confirm Its Independence in Order for Us to
Meet Our Regulatory Reporting Obligations on a Timely Basis

Our independent registered public accounting firm communicates with us at least annually
regarding any relationships between the Firm and Lam that, in the Firm’s professional judgment,
might have a bearing on the Firm’s independence with respect to us. If, for whatever reason, our
independent registered public accounting firm finds that it cannot confirm that it is independent
of Lam based on existing securities laws and registered public accounting firm independence
standards, we could experience delays or other failures to meet our regulatory reporting
obligations.



Item 2.

Properties

Our executive offices and principal operating and R&D facilities are located in Fremont,
California, and are held under operating leases expiring from fiscal years 2008 to 2014. These
leases generally include options to renew or purchase the facilities. As a result of the
restructuring of our operations, we have subleased some of our idle facilities, (refer to Note 15
of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 herein, for further information
concerning our property leases). In addition, we lease properties for our service, technical
support and sales personnel throughout the United States, Europe, Korea, Japan, and Asia Pacific.
Our fiscal year 2006 rental payments for the space occupied during that period aggregated
approximately $8.9 million. Our facilities lease obligations are subject to periodic increases, and
we believe that our existing facilities are well-maintained and in good operating condition.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

From time to time, we have received notices from third parties alleging infringement of such
parties’ patent or other intellectual property rights by our products. In such cases it is our
policy to defend the claims, or if considered appropriate, negotiate licenses on commercially
reasonable terms. However, no assurance can be given that we will be able to negotiate necessary
licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any litigation resulting from such
claims would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity,
operating results, or our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

Market for the Registrant’s Common Stock and Related Stockholder Matters

The information required by this Item is incorporated by reference from Item 6, “Selected
Consolidated Financial Data,” below.

In October, 2004, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up
to $250 million of our common stock from the public market or in private purchases. The terms of
the repurchase program permit us to repurchase shares through September 30, 2007. In August, 2005,
we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of an additional $500
million of our common stock from the public market or private purchase. The terms of the repurchase
program permit us to repurchase shares through September 30, 2008. We plan to continue to execute
the authorized repurchases. Share repurchases under the authorizations were as follows:

of goods sold and reflected in gross margin of ($1.7) million, ($1.0) million, and $5.9
million for fiscal years 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. These amounts primarily relate
to the write-off of selected, older product line inventories in connection with our
restructuring plans and the partial recovery of the charges from the subsequent sale of a
portion of such inventories. These restructuring charges/(recoveries) are included as a
component of cost of goods sold in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force 96-9,
“Classification of Inventory Markdowns and Other Costs Associated with a Restructuring”
(EITF 96-9). There were no restructuring charges or recoveries included in cost of goods
sold in fiscal years 2006 and 2005. Fiscal year 2005 restructuring charges consist only of
additional liabilities related to prior restructuring plans.

Diluted net income per share for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2004 includes the
assumed conversion of the convertible subordinated 4% notes. Accordingly, interest expense,
net of taxes, of $3.2 million has been added back to net income for computing diluted net
earnings per share.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains
forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition,
significance, value and effect. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated
in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to
those discussed in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and other
documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See “Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

).

The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic
downturns and upturns. Today’s leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns may
not be any more reliable than in prior years. Demand for our equipment can vary significantly from
period to period as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, economic
conditions, supply, demand, and prices for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and our
ability to develop and market competitive products. For these and other reasons, our results of
operations for fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004 may not necessarily be indicative of future
operating results.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A)
provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our
Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. MD&A consists of the following sections:

Our business model, which utilizes the capabilities of outsource providers, enables us to
focus on new and existing product development, sales and marketing, and customer support. We are
focused on executing to the near term production requirements of



our customers, expanding our leadership position in Etch, leveraging our Etch expertise into
adjacent markets, and our objective of delivering best-in-class financial performance.

Customer demand increased throughout fiscal year 2006. Fiscal year 2006 new orders entered
into backlog increased 31% compared to fiscal year 2005 with growth occurring in all regions as a
function of the increase in customer demand.

Fiscal year 2006 revenues, derived from our shipment levels and installation and acceptance
timelines, increased 9% compared to fiscal year 2005 revenues reflecting the increase in customer
demand which we believe included market share gains in both the dielectric and conductor product
segments of the etch market, with the strongest geographic momentum in Japan and Korea.

Gross margin as a percent of revenues remained greater than 50% for the second consecutive
year. Fiscal year 2006 quarterly gross margin as a percent of revenues showed steady growth on
increasing volume.

Total operating expenses increased 13% during fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005,
primarily driven by increases in discretionary R&D spending consistent with our product and market
expansion plans, equity-based compensation expense, salary costs as a result of increased
headcount, planned increases in employee base compensation, and employee incentive-based costs.
Fiscal year 2005 operating expenses included $14.2 million in restructuring charges related to
prior restructuring plans.

Equity-based compensation expense recognized during fiscal year 2006 in cost of goods sold and
operating expenses was $5.0 million and $17.8 million, respectively.

Results of Operations

New Orders and Backlog

New orders entered into backlog during fiscal year 2006 are presented in the table below.

Unshipped orders in backlog as of June 25, 2006 were approximately $521 million. The basis
for recording new orders is defined in our backlog policy. Our unshipped orders backlog includes
orders for systems, spares, and services where written customer requests have been accepted and the
delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months. Our policy
is to revise our backlog for order cancellations and to make adjustments to reflect, among other
things, spares volume estimates and customer delivery date changes. Please refer to “Backlog” in
Part I Item 1, “Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our
backlog policy.



Regional geographic breakdown of new orders is as follows:

Fiscal year 2005 started with a declining trend in new orders which stabilized in
the March 2005 and June 2005 quarters. The four quarters ending June 25, 2006 showed sequentially
increasing demand in new orders driven by increased capital investments by our customers and our
market share gains. During fiscal year 2006, 300 millimeter applications represented approximately
81% of total systems new orders and 83% of total systems new orders were for applications at less
than or equal to the 90 nanometer technology node. We classify total systems new orders market
segmentation for fiscal year 2006 as Memory at approximately 54%, IDM Logic/Other at 27% and
Foundry at 19% of the total.

We expect new orders for the quarter ending September 24, 2006 to increase 5% to 10% compared
with the quarter ended June 25, 2006. This expectation is a forward-looking statement and actual
results could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to in Part I of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The increase in revenues during fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2005 reflected the
improved market environment which was evidenced by expanded levels of capital investments by
semiconductor manufacturers. We believe we have gained market share in both the dielectric and
conductor product segments of the etch market over this period, with particularly strong geographic
performance in Japan and Korea during fiscal year 2006 and the overall Asia region during fiscal
year 2005. The overall Asia region continues to account for a significant portion of our revenues
as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing
continues to occur in this region. Our deferred revenue balance increased to $229.7 million as of
June 25, 2006 compared to $150.5 million at June 26, 2005, consistent with overall business
volumes. The anticipated future revenue value of orders shipped from backlog to Japanese customers
that are not recorded as deferred revenue was approximately $74 million as of June 25, 2006: these
shipments are classified as inventory at cost until title transfers.

Our current estimate for revenues for the quarter ending September 24, 2006 ranges from
$580 million to $600 million. This is a forward-looking statement and actual results could differ
materially as a result of certain factors as referred to in Part I of this Annual Report on Form

Gross margin as a percent of revenue during fiscal year 2006 remained greater than 50%
for the second consecutive year. Gross margin as a percent of revenue for fiscal year 2006
compared with fiscal year 2005 decreased slightly, impacted by the inclusion of equity-based
compensation as a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
(revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123R) of $5.0 million, or 0.3%. The impact of
product mix was generally offset by improved installation and warranty performance, and improved
factory utilization which was facilitated by higher volumes. The increase in gross margin as a
percent of revenue during fiscal year 2005 compared with fiscal year 2004 was driven primarily by
improved product mix and effective asset management on higher sales volume.

We expect that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 51.5% for the
quarter ending September 24, 2006. This expectation is a forward-looking statement and actual
results could differ materially as a result of certain factors as referred to in Part I of this

We invested significantly in research and development focused on leading-edge plasma
etch, strip and clean product and market applications. The growth in absolute spending levels
during fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to approximately $19 million
in increased supplies and outside services, approximately $9 million in increased equity-based
compensation expense and approximately $4 million in increased salary and benefit costs due to
planned increases of employee base compensation and increased headcount. Approximately 66% of
fiscal year 2006 systems revenues were derived from products introduced over the previous two
years.

The growth in absolute spending levels during fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004
was primarily due to increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately $5 million for planned
increases of employee base compensation as well as roughly
$9 million for incentive-based compensation triggered by higher profits. The remainder of the
increase was primarily the result of an increase in R&D supplies expense of approximately $6
million.

The increase in SG&A expenses during the year ended June 25, 2006 compared with the prior
year was driven by increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately $4 million due to
planned increases of employee base compensation and increased headcount. Increases in
incentive-based cash compensation of approximately $7 million were principally due to our long-term
executive compensation program implemented during fiscal year 2006 and equity-based compensation
was approximately $9 million. Fiscal year 2005 SG&A expenses were lower due to the March 2005
receipt of an $8 million tax refund noted below.

The increase in SG&A expenses during fiscal year 2005 compared with fiscal year 2004 was
driven by increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately $5 million due to planned
increases of employee base compensation as well as roughly $14 million due to incentive-based
compensation triggered by higher profits. Also included in the increase was approximately $10
million in professional services which included, among other items, expenditures for certain
discretionary information technology projects designed to contribute to productivity improvements
across the Company. These increases were partially offset by the receipt in fiscal year 2005 of a
net $8 million tax refund from the California State Board of Equalization for previously paid sales
and use tax and approximately $3 million in equity-based compensation expense recorded in fiscal
year 2004 in connection with the modification of terms of a fixed stock option award.

The sequential increase in interest income during fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal
year 2005 was due to the combined effect of increased cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments, and restricted cash and investments balances as well as increases in interest rate
yields.

During fiscal year 2006, average interest rate yields on the Company’s portfolio increased
approximately 170 basis points compared to fiscal year 2005. The Company’s total balances of cash
and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments, increased
approximately $626 million from fiscal year 2005. This increase included the Company’s
wholly-owned
subsidiary’s drawdown against a $350 million Credit Agreement to support the Company’s foreign
earnings repatriation of $500 million under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). The
remaining increase of $276 million was primarily driven by $361 million from cash flows from
operating activities.



The sequential increase in interest income during fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year
2004 was due primarily to the increase in interest rate yields. Interest expense and debt issue
cost amortization decreased due to the early retirement of our convertible subordinated $300.0
million 4% notes (4% Notes) in June 2004.

Tax Expense

Our annual income tax expense was $105.5 million, $99.8 million, and $27.7 million, in fiscal
years 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2006 was 23.9%.
The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2006, excluding the discrete event discussed below, was
18.4%. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2006 related to the increase in
income in jurisdictions with a lower tax rate, the realization of state R&D tax credits not
previously benefited, favorable tax rulings on prior year tax returns filed and the reversal of tax
reserves with respect to the agreement of a bi-lateral advanced pricing arrangement. These
favorable adjustments for the year were offset by a discrete event for the repatriation during
fiscal year 2006 of a $500 million extraordinary dividend under the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004, combined with the impact of the accounting for equity-based awards in accordance with SFAS
No. 123R and the deductibility of those awards in some jurisdictions, and the expiration of the
research tax credit on December 31, 2005.

The fiscal year 2005 tax rate was 25.0%, which primarily reflects the impact of R&D tax
credits and foreign income taxed at lower than U.S. statutory tax rates. In fiscal year 2004, we
released a valuation allowance on specific deferred tax assets after we determined that the
valuation allowance was no longer required. This resulted in a $12.7 million credit recorded to
income tax expense, during fiscal year 2004.

Deferred Income Taxes

We had gross deferred tax assets, related primarily to reserves and accruals that are not
currently deductible, and tax credit carryforwards of $119.2 million and $142.1 million in fiscal
years 2006 and 2005, respectively. The gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax
liabilities of $27.0 million and $22.2 million in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based
Payment” (SFAS No. 123R), the additional tax benefit associated with the accumulated stock award
attributes is not recognized until the deduction reduces cash taxes payable. As such, we have
elected to net our net operating loss and tax credit carryforward deferred tax assets and related
valuation allowance for the accumulated stock award tax benefits determined under Accounting
Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (APB No. 25). We
will track these stock award attributes separately and will only realize these attributes in
accordance with Footnote 82 of SFAS 123(R). These additional tax benefits of net operating loss
and tax credit carryforwards related to the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock awards
were $125.2 million and $106.0 million in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively.

We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more
likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future
taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however,
ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not
known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to
realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in
the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than
not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation
allowance would be reversed. We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and
will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances, if any. During fiscal year
2004, we released a valuation allowance of $12.7 million on specific deferred tax assets after we
determined that the valuation allowance was no longer required.

Subsequent Events

On July 12, 2006, the Supreme Court of California denied review of lower and appellate court
judgments in favor of Lam with respect to a lawsuit filed by us alleging breach of purchase order
contracts by one of our customers. As a result of the denied review, the prior rulings from the
trial and appellate courts stand resulting in a judgment in favor of Lam of approximately $15.8
million,
which includes approximately $2.0 million in post-judgment interest. We plan to record this
amount in other income (expense), net during the quarter ending September 24, 2006.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We based our estimates
and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be
applicable, and evaluated them on an on-going basis to ensure they remained reasonable under
current conditions. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.

The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are
described in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of these significant accounting
policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. A critical accounting policy is
defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations
and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often as a result of the
need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.

We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant
judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition:

We recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling
price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have
completed our system installation obligations, received customer acceptance or are otherwise
released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations. In the event that terms of the
sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of
the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. In circumstances
where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do
not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue where it can be reliably
demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed to customer specifications. In
situations with multiple deliverables, revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate
elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our
customer acceptance obligations. Revenue from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the
separate elements based on their relative fair values, provided the elements have value on a stand
alone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the arrangement does not
include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the
undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. The maximum revenue
recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery
of additional items. Revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits is generally
recognized upon shipment. Revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of
the services requested by a customer order. Revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with
a fixed payment amount is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.

Inventory Valuation

: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard
costs, which approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. We maintain a perpetual
inventory system and continuously record the quantity on-hand and standard cost for each product,
including purchased components, subassemblies and finished goods. We maintain the integrity of
perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand. Finished goods
are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. Generally, title
transfer is documented in the terms of sale. When the terms of sale do not specify, we assume title
transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other
customer practices prevail. Transfer of title for shipments to Japanese customers generally occurs
at time of customer acceptance.

Standard costs are re-assessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs,
generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts, currently obtainable assembly
and test labor utilization levels, and overhead for internally manufactured products. Manufacturing
labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to
absorb spending at average utilization volumes. All intercompany profits related to the sales and
purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial
statements.

Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least
quarterly. Our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories, including manufacturing raw
materials, work-in-process, finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete
inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over the next 12 to
36 months is written down to its estimated market value, if less than cost. Inherent in the
estimates of market value are management’s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules,
customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions,
possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory. If future customer demand
or market



conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may
be required, and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made.

Warranty

: Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and
service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. We offer standard
warranties for our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system acceptance, not
to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer. When appropriate, we record a
provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue
recognition. The amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity, which uses factors
such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such as tool reliability
trends. All actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those
established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping.

Actual warranty expenses are incurred on a system-by-system basis, and may differ from our
original estimates. While we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities,
if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to
provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. We do not maintain
general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems.

In addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer customer-paid extended warranty
services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are
recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded
either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable.

Equity-based Compensation — Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Plans

: Beginning
on June 27, 2005 we account for our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) and stock plans under the
provisions of SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R requires the recognition of the fair value of
equity-based compensation in net income. The fair value of our restricted stock units was
calculated based upon the fair market value of Company stock at the date of grant. The fair value of
our stock options and ESPP awards was estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. This
model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions and elections in adopting and
implementing SFAS No. 123R, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of
each award. The fair value of equity-based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award
and we have elected to use the straight-line method for awards granted after the adoption of SFAS
No. 123R and continue to use a graded vesting method for awards granted prior to the adoption of
SFAS No. 123R. We make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool to determine
if there are any deficiencies which require recognition in our consolidated statements of
operations. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we accounted for our ESPP and stock option
plans under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 “Accounting For
Stock Issued to Employees” (APB No. 25) and Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Interpretation No. 44, “Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation — an
Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25” and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 148, “Accounting For Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure”, which amends SFAS No. 123, “Accounting For Stock-Based
Compensation”. Pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share disclosed in the footnotes
to our consolidated financial statements were estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation
model. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we will only recognize a benefit from
stock-based compensation in paid-in-capital if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all
other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to
account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit and the
extraterritorial income deduction through the income statement (continuing operations) rather than
through paid-in-capital. We have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated
valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated
stock award tax benefits determined under APB No. 25 for income tax footnote disclosure purposes.
We will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes
through paid-in-capital in accordance with Footnote 82 of SFAS123(R).

Income Taxes:

Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between
the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used
for income tax purposes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the
amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is
dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be
realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other
variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the event that we determine that
we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment
would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we later
determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the
previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed.



We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that
could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent
year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified.

We provide for income taxes on an interim basis on the basis of annual estimated effective
income tax rates. Our estimated effective income tax rate reflects the underlying profitability of
the Company, the level of R&D spending, the regions where profits are recorded and the respective
tax rates imposed. We carefully monitor these factors and adjust the effective income tax rate, if
necessary. If actual results differ from estimates, we could be required to record an additional
valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust our effective income tax rate, which could
have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application
of complex tax laws. Our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly
judgmental. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with the Company’s
expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operation and financial
condition. The Company accounts for the income tax contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5,
“Accounting for Contingencies.”

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation 48,
“Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties” (FIN 48). FIN 48 defines the threshold for recognizing
the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as “more-likely-than-not” to be
sustained by the taxing authority. The recently issued literature also provides guidance on the
derecognition, measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any related
interest and penalties. FIN 48 also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax
uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any
recorded income tax uncertainties.

FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Any differences
between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of FIN
48 and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment
recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings. We are currently in the process of
determining the impact, if any, of adopting the provisions of FIN 48 on our financial position,
results of operations and liquidity.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of June 25, 2006, we had $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments,
and restricted cash and investments compared with $894.3 million at June 26, 2005. We entered into
long-term debt of $350.0 million during fiscal year 2006 to provide sufficient liquidity to support
our foreign earnings repatriation of $500 million under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
The remaining increase of $276.1 million was derived from cash flows from operating activities of
$360.7 million, issuance of common stock from employee equity-based plans of $194.6 million,
partially offset by stock repurchases of $251.2 million and capital expenditures and purchases of
intangible assets of $42.1 million.

Cash Flows From Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities of $360.7 million during fiscal year 2006 consisted

Significant changes in assets and liabilities included increases in accounts receivable
and inventory of $175.3 million and $58.7 million, respectively, due to the increased volume of
business. These changes were partially offset by an increase in deferred profit of $50.4 million
due to increased volume of shipments, an increase in accounts payable of $48.3 million, and
increases in accrued liabilities of $88.4 million primarily due to VAT and income taxes payable
related to higher profit levels, and an increase in accrued compensation based on incentive-based
compensation.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2006 was $244.3 million and
consisted of a transfer to restricted cash and investments of $385.0 million due to our guarantee
agreement related to the obligations of our wholly-owned subsidiary under the $350.0 million credit
agreement entered into during the quarter ended June 25, 2006. Our obligations under the Guarantee
Agreement are collateralized by readily marketable securities in an amount equal to 110% of the
outstanding balance of our obligations under the Guarantee Agreement.

In addition, we purchased $42.1 million for capital expenditures, consisting primarily of
engineering equipment, and the purchase of intangible assets of intellectual property. Partially
offsetting these uses of cash were proceeds from the net sales of short-term investments of $182.8
million.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2006 was $310.7 million
consisting of $350.0 million from the issuance of long-term debt, $194.6 million from the issuance
of our common stock related to employee equity-based plans, and $17.8 million of excess tax
benefits on equity-based compensation plans, partially offset by stock repurchases of $251.2
million.

During fiscal year 2006, we repurchased approximately 7.0 million shares of common stock at a
total price of $251.2 million under Board authorized repurchase programs which run through
September 30, 2008. As of June 25, 2006 the total amount remaining available for repurchase under
Board authorizations was $331.7 million. We expect to continue to repurchase shares consistent with
the Board authorizations, the level of which will be determined by, including but not limited to,
the needs of the business and the stock price and daily trading volumes of our stock.

Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining
sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in R&D and
capital infrastructure. Based upon our current business outlook, our levels of cash, cash
equivalents, and short-term investments at June 25, 2006 are expected to be sufficient to support
our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, and capital
expenditures, through at least the next 12 months.

In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our
ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products. Should additional
funding be required, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or
private sales of debt or equity securities. We believe that, in the event of such requirements, we
will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives.
However, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be
no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations

We have certain obligations, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some which
are not, to make future payments under various contracts. Obligations are recorded on our balance
sheet in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The obligations recorded on
our consolidated balance sheet include restructuring liabilities and long-term debt which are
outlined in the following table and are discussed below. Our off-balance sheet arrangements include
contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the
table below. Our contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to these agreements, and our
guarantees are included in the following table:

Operating Leases

We lease most of our administrative, R&D and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service
offices and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases, which expire at various dates
through 2021. Certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our Fremont, California
headquarters and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for
additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of our facility leases provide for
periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation.

Included in the operating leases 1-3 years section of the table above is $75.0 million in
guaranteed residual values for lease agreements relating to certain properties at our Fremont,
California campus. As part of the lease agreements, we have the option to purchase the remaining
buildings at any time for a total purchase price for all remaining properties related to these
leases of approximately $85.0 million. We are required to guarantee the lessor a residual value on
the properties of up to $75.0 million at the end of the lease terms in fiscal year 2008 (in the
event that the leases are not renewed, we do not exercise the purchase options, the lessor sells
the properties and the sale price is less than the lessor’s costs). We maintain cash collateral of
$85.0 million as part of the lease agreements as of June 25, 2006 in separate, specified
certificates of deposit and interest-bearing accounts which are recorded as restricted cash and
investments in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The lessor under the lease agreements is a
substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a variable
interest entity (VIE) as defined by FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities” and is therefore not consolidated by us.

The remaining operating lease balances primarily relate to non-cancelable facility-related
operating leases.

Purchase Obligations

Purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis
or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments,
including vendor-consigned inventories. We continue to enter into new agreements and maintain
existing agreements to outsource certain activities, including elements of our manufacturing,
warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance, certain information technology functions, and
certain transactional general and administrative functions. The contractual cash obligations and
commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at June 25, 2006 under these
arrangements and others. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and
length of contractual service provided. In addition to minimum spending commitments, certain of
these agreements provide for potential cancellation charges.

Consignment inventories, which are owned by vendors but located in our storage locations and
warehouses, are not reported as our inventory until title is transferred to us or our purchase
obligation is determined. At June 25, 2006, vendor-owned inventories held at our locations and not
reported as our inventory increased to $31.1 million compared to $14.8 million at June 26, 2005,
due to the increased volume of our business.

Restructuring Liabilities

Our total restructuring reserves as of June 25, 2006 were $1.6 million, which consists
primarily of lease payments on vacated buildings. Through cash generated from operations, we expect
the remaining balance to be paid over the next twelve months.



Long-Term Debt and Interest Expense

On June 16, 2006, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Lam Research International SARL (LRI), as
borrower, entered into a $350 million Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement).

Under the Credit Agreement, on June 19, 2006, LRI borrowed $350 million in principal amount.
The loan under the Credit Agreement shall be fully repaid not later than five years following the
closing date and will bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 0.10% to 0.50%, depending
upon a consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The initial spread under
the Credit Agreement is 0.10%. LRI may prepay the loan under the Credit Agreement in whole or in
part at any time without penalty, subject to reimbursement of lenders’ breakage and redeployment
costs in certain cases. The amounts in the table above include the principal payment of $350
million due on June 19, 2011 and interest payments estimated
based on the current LIBOR rate of 5.5% and
initial spread of ten basis points. The fair value of long-term debt approximates its carrying
value due to the variable interest rate applicable to the debt.

We used the proceeds from the credit facility entered into by LRI to facilitate the
repatriation of $500 million of foreign earnings in the June 2006 quarter under the provisions of
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). We have now completed our repatriation of foreign
earnings under the provisions of the AJCA.

Guarantees

We account for our guarantees in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Interpretation No. 45 “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (FIN No. 45). FIN No. 45 requires a company that is
a guarantor to make specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has
issued. FIN No. 45 also requires a company (the Guarantor) to recognize, at the inception of a
guarantee, a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee.

We lease several facilities at our headquarters location in Fremont, California. As part of
certain of the lease agreements, we have the option to purchase the remaining buildings at any time
for a total purchase price for all remaining properties related to these leases of approximately
$85.0 million. We are required to guarantee the lessor a residual value on the properties of up to
$75.0 million at the end of the lease terms in fiscal year 2008 (in the event that the leases are
not renewed, we do not exercise the purchase options, the lessor sells the properties and the sale
price is less than the lessor’s costs). We maintain cash collateral of $85.0 million as part of
the lease agreements as of June 25, 2006 in separate, specified certificates of deposit and
interest-bearing accounts which are recorded as restricted cash and investments in our Consolidated
Balance Sheet. The lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company
that does not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity (VIE) as defined by FASB
Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” and is therefore not
consolidated by us.

We have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors under some of our agreements. We have
entered into certain insurance contracts which may limit our exposure to such indemnifications. As
of June 25, 2006, we have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection with
these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable
that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees.

In connection with the Credit Agreement entered into by LRI noted above, we entered into a
Guarantee Agreement (the Guarantee Agreement) guaranteeing the obligations of LRI under the Credit
Agreement. Our obligations under the Guarantee Agreement are collateralized by readily marketable
securities in an amount equal to 110% of the outstanding balance of our obligations under the
Guarantee Agreement, representing $385.0 million at June 25, 2006. This collateral is reflected in
the balance of restricted cash and investments in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Generally, we indemnify, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, our customers for
infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products or services. We seek to
limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products
or services subject to our indemnification obligations. We do not believe, based on information
available, that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these guarantees.

We offer standard warranties on our systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from
system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from the date of shipment of the system to the customer.
The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system,
customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as the impact of system
reliability improvements.



Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment
portfolio and variable rate long-term debt. We maintain a conservative investment policy, which
focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk,
and reinvestment risk. The table below presents principal amounts and related weighted-average tax
equivalent interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio at June 25, 2006 and
June 26, 2005:

We mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by
positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of
any investment issuer or guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active
secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of
diversification.

We conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we
are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange
rates. The majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars except for certain of
our revenues in Japan that are denominated in Japanese Yen, certain of our spares and service
contracts which are denominated in other currencies, and expenses related to our non-U.S. sales and
support offices which are denominated in these countries’ local currency. We currently enter into
foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of the exchange rate
fluctuations on Japanese Yen-denominated assets and forecasted Japanese Yen-denominated revenue
where we currently believe our primary exposure to currency rate fluctuation lies. To protect
against the reduction in value of forecasted Japanese Yen-denominated revenues, we enter into
foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts that generally expire within 12 months, and no
later than 24 months. These foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts are designated as
cash flow hedges and are carried on our Balance Sheet at fair value with the effective portion of
the contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and
subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue is recognized. We also
enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the
remeasurement of Japanese Yen-denominated net receivable balances. The change in fair value of
these balance sheet hedge contracts is recorded into earnings as a component of other income and
expense and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated intercompany and
trade receivables, recorded in other income and expense, assuming the hedge contract fully covers
the intercompany and trade receivable balances.

On June 25, 2006, the notional amount of outstanding Japanese Yen forward contracts that are
designated as balance sheet hedges was $23.5 million. The unrealized gain on the contracts on June
25, 2006, was $0.1 million. A 15% appreciation of the Japanese Yen would result in an unrealized
loss of $4.1 million. Depreciation in the exchange rate of the Japanese Yen of approximately 15%
would result in an unrealized gain of $3.1 million. These changes in fair values would be offset
in other income and expense by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency
denominated intercompany and trade receivables assuming the hedge contract fully covers the
intercompany and trade receivable balances. On June 25, 2006, the notional amount of outstanding
Japanese Yen forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges was $193.8 million. A 15%
appreciation of the Japanese Yen would



result in an unrealized loss of $34.2 million. Depreciation in the exchange rate of the
Japanese Yen of approximately 15% would result in an unrealized gain of $25.3 million.

Our outstanding long-term debt of $350.0 million bears interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging
from 0.10% to 0.50%, depending upon a consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit
Agreement. The initial spread under the Credit Agreement is 0.10%. The principal payment of $350
million is due on June 19, 2011. The fair value of long-term debt approximates its carrying value
due to the variable interest rate applicable to the debt.

Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), as of the close of fiscal year June 25, 2006, we
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e). Based
upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer along with our Chief Financial Officer, concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level.

We intend to review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures on an ongoing basis and to correct any material deficiencies that we may discover. Our
goal is to ensure that our senior management has timely access to material information that could
affect our business.



Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control—Integrated
Framework” published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to
evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Based on
that evaluation, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of June 25, 2006 at providing reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited management’s
assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report,
which is included at the end of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our most
recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.

Effectiveness of Controls

While we believe the present design of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting is effective at the reasonable assurance level, future events
affecting our business may cause us to modify our disclosure controls and procedures or internal
control over financial reporting. The effectiveness of controls cannot be absolute because the cost
to design and implement a control to identify errors or mitigate the risk of errors occurring
should not outweigh the potential loss caused by the errors that would likely be detected by the
control. Moreover, we believe that a control system cannot be guaranteed to be 100% effective all
of the time. Accordingly, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met.

Item 9B. Other Information

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JUNE 25, 2006

Note 1: Company and Industry Information

Lam Research Corporation (Lam or the Company) is a major provider of wafer fabrication
equipment and services to the world’s semiconductor industry. The Company actively markets and
sells product offerings that include single-wafer plasma etch systems with a wide range of
applications and an array of services designed to optimize
the utilization of these systems by its customers. The Company sells its products and services
primarily to companies involved in the production of semiconductors in the United States, Europe,
Japan, Korea, and Asia Pacific.

The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic
downturns and upturns. Today’s leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns may
not be any more reliable than in prior years. Demand for the Company’s equipment can vary
significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to,
economic conditions, supply, demand, and prices for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements,
and the Company’s ability to develop and market competitive products. For these and other reasons,
the Company’s results of operations for fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004 may not necessarily be
indicative of future operating results.

Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that could affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company based its estimates and
assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable,
and evaluates them on an on-going basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions.
Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition:

The Company recognizes all revenue when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the
selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is
reasonably assured, and the Company has completed its system installation obligations,
received customer acceptance or is otherwise released from its installation or customer acceptance
obligations. In the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period,
the Company recognizes revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer
acceptance, whichever occurs first. In circumstances where the practices of a customer do not
provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance
provision, the Company recognizes revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered
system meets all of the agreed to customer specifications. In situations with multiple
deliverables, revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and
when the Company receives customer acceptance or is otherwise released from its customer acceptance
obligations. Revenue from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate elements
based on their relative fair values, provided the elements have value on a stand alone basis, there
is objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the arrangement does not include a general right
of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is
considered probable and substantially in the Company’s control. The maximum revenue recognized on a
delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional
items. Revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits is generally recognized upon
shipment. Revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of the services
requested by a customer order. Revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed
payment amount is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.

Inventory Valuation

: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard
costs, which approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company maintains a
perpetual inventory system and continuously records the quantity on-hand and standard cost for each
product, including purchased components, subassemblies and finished goods. The Company maintains
the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on
hand. Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer.
Generally, title transfer is documented in the terms of sale. When the terms of sale do not
specify, the Company assumes title transfers when it completes physical transfer of the products to
the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail. Transfer of title for shipments to
Japanese customers generally occurs at time of customer acceptance.

Standard costs are re-assessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs,
generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts, currently obtainable assembly
and test labor performance levels, and overhead for internally manufactured



products. Manufacturing
labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to
absorb spending at average utilization volumes. All intercompany profits related to the sales and
purchases of inventory between the Company’s legal entities are eliminated from its consolidated
financial statements.

Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least
quarterly. The Company’s policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories, including
manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods and spare parts in each reporting
period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management’s estimated usage requirements over
the next 12 to 36 months is written down to its estimated market value, if less than cost. Inherent
in the estimates of market value are management’s forecasts related to the Company’s future
manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general
semiconductor market conditions, possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess
inventory. If future customer demand or market conditions are less
favorable than the Company’s projections,
additional inventory write-downs may be required, and would be reflected in cost of sales in the
period the revision is made.

Warranty

: Typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and
service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system. The Company offers
standard warranties for its systems that run generally for a period of 12 months from system
acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from shipment of the system to the customer. When appropriate,
the Company records a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system
upon revenue recognition. The amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity, which
uses factors such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such as
tool reliability trends. All actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are
charged to those established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping.

Actual warranty expenses are incurred on a system-by-system basis, and may differ from the
Company’s original estimates. While the Company periodically monitors the performance and cost of
warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than its estimates, the Company may
recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are
identified. The Company does not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves
are related to specific systems.

In addition to the provision of standard warranties, the Company offers customer-paid extended
warranty services. Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment
amount are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are
recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and
estimable.

Equity-based Compensation — Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Plans

: Beginning
on June 27, 2005 the Company accounts for its employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) and stock plans
under the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R requires the recognition of the fair value of
equity-based compensation in net income. The fair value of the Company’s restricted stock units was
calculated based upon the fair market value of its stock at the date of grant. The fair value of
the Company’s stock options and ESPP awards was estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation
model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions and elections in adopting and
implementing SFAS No. 123R, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of
each award. The fair value of equity-based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award
and the Company has elected to use the straight-line method for awards granted after the adoption
of SFAS No. 123R and continues to use a graded vesting method for awards granted prior to the
adoption of SFAS No. 123R. The Company makes quarterly assessments of the adequacy of its tax
credit pool to determine if there are any deficiencies which require recognition in its
consolidated statements of operations. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company
accounted for its ESPP and stock option plans under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board
(APB) Opinion No. 25 “Accounting For Stock Issued to Employees” (APB No. 25) and Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 44, “Accounting for Certain Transactions
Involving Stock Compensation — an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25” and made pro forma footnote
disclosures as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 148, “Accounting
For Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure”, which amends SFAS No. 123, “Accounting
For Stock-Based Compensation”. Pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share disclosed in
the footnotes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements were estimated using a
Black-Scholes option valuation model. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company
will only recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in paid-in-capital if an incremental
tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to the Company have been
utilized. In addition, the Company has elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based
compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income deduction through the
income statement (continuing operations) rather than through paid-in-capital. The Company has also
elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits determined under APB
No. 25 for income tax footnote disclosure purposes. The Company will track these stock award
attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paid-in-capital in
accordance with Footnote 82 of SFAS123(R).



Income Taxes

- Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between
the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used
for income tax purposes. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax
assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of the Company’s net
deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. The Company believes it is more likely
than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively
impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. In the
event that the Company determines that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net
deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is
made. Likewise, if the Company later determines that it is more likely than not that the deferred
tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed.

The Company calculates its current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and
assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during
the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified.

The
Company provides for income taxes on an interim basis on the basis of annual estimated effective income tax
rates. The Company’s estimated effective income tax rate reflects the underlying profitability of
the Company, the level of R&D spending, the regions where profits are recorded and the respective
tax rates imposed. The Company carefully monitors these factors and adjusts the effective income
tax rate, if necessary. If actual results differ from estimates, the Company could be required to
record an additional valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax
rate, which could have a material impact on its business, results of operations, and financial
condition.

The calculation of the Company’s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the
application of complex tax laws. The Company’s estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain
tax issue is highly judgmental. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with
the Company’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operation and
financial condition. The Company accounts for the income tax contingencies in accordance with SFAS
No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies.”

Fiscal Year:

The Company follows a 52/53-week fiscal reporting calendar and its fiscal year
ends on the last Sunday of June each year. The Company’s most recent fiscal year ended on June 25,
2006 and included 52 weeks. The fiscal years ended June 26, 2005 and June 27, 2004 also included 52
weeks. The Company’s next fiscal year, ending on June 24, 2007, will include 52 weeks.

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments:

All investments purchased with an original final
maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. All of the Company’s
short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale at the respective balance sheet dates.
The Company accounts for its investment portfolio at fair value. The investments classified as
available-for-sale are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices, and any material
temporary difference between the cost and fair value of an investment is presented as a separate
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss.) The specific identification method is
used to determine the realized gains and losses on investments.

Property and Equipment:

Property and equipment is stated at cost. Equipment is depreciated by
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to seven
years. Leasehold improvements are amortized by the straight-line method over the shorter of the
life of the related asset or the term of the underlying lease.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

: The Company routinely considers whether indicators of
impairment of long-lived assets are present. If such indicators are present, the Company determines
whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is
less than their carrying value. If the sum is less, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based
on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is
determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. If the assets determined
to be impaired are to be held and used, the Company recognizes an impairment charge to the extent
the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset’s
carrying value. The fair value of the asset then becomes the asset’s new carrying value, which the
Company depreciates over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. Assets to be disposed of
are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.



Derivative Financial Instruments:

The Company carries derivative financial
instruments (derivatives) on the balance sheet at their fair values in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities” (SFAS No. 133). The Company has a policy that allows the use of derivative financial
instruments, specifically foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts, to hedge foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted revenue transactions denominated in Japanese Yen
and other foreign currency denominated assets. The Company does not use derivatives for trading or
speculative purposes.

The Company’s policy is to attempt to minimize short-term business exposure to foreign
currency exchange rate risks using an effective and efficient method to eliminate or reduce such
exposures. In the normal course of business, the Company’s financial position is routinely
subjected to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. To protect
against the reduction in value of forecasted Japanese Yen-denominated revenues, the Company has
instituted a foreign currency cash flow hedging program. The Company enters into foreign currency
forward exchange rate contracts that generally expire within 12 months, and no later than 24
months. These foreign currency forward exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and
are carried on the Company’s balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the
contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and
subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue is recognized.

Each period, hedges are tested for effectiveness, using the dollar offset method, by comparing
the change in value of the derivative with the change in the value of the anticipated sales
transactions. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship must meet criteria relating
both to the derivative instrument and the hedged item. These include identification of the hedging
instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the hedging instrument’s
effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows
will be measured.

To receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at
the inception of the hedge and the hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future
cash flows on hedged transactions. When derivative instruments are designated and qualify as
effective cash flow hedges, the Company is able to defer changes in the fair value of the hedging
instrument within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged exposure is
realized. Consequently, with the exception of hedge ineffectiveness recognized, the Company’s
results of operations are not subject to fluctuation as a result of changes in the fair value of
the derivative instruments. If hedges are not highly effective or if the Company does not believe
that the underlying hedged forecasted transactions would occur, the Company may not be able to
account for its investments in derivative instruments as cash
flow hedges. If this were to occur in a future period, changes in the fair values of the
Company’s derivative instruments would be recognized in earnings without the benefits of offsets or
deferrals of changes in fair value arising from hedge accounting treatment.

The Company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts to hedge the
gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of Japanese Yen-denominated net receivable
balances. Under SFAS No. 133, these forward contracts are not designated for hedge accounting
treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded into earnings as a
component of other income and expense and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency
denominated intercompany and trade receivables, recorded in other income and expense, assuming the
hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances.

To hedge foreign currency risks, the Company uses foreign currency exchange forward contracts,
where possible and practical. These forward contracts are valued using standard valuation formulas
with assumptions about future foreign currency exchange rates derived from existing exchange rates
and interest rates observed in the market.

The Company considers its most current outlook in determining the level of foreign currency
denominated intercompany revenues to hedge as cash flow hedges. The Company combines these
forecasts with historical trends to establish the portion of its expected volume to be hedged. The
revenues are hedged and designated as cash flow hedges to protect the Company from exposures to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction
does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, the related hedge gains and losses
on the cash flow hedge are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to
interest and other income (expense) on the consolidated
statement of operations at that time.

The Company does not believe that it is or was exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit
risk in its interest rate and foreign currency hedges, as counterparties are established and
well-capitalized financial institutions. The Company’s exposures are in liquid currencies (Japanese
Yen), so there is minimal risk that appropriate derivatives to maintain the Company’s hedging
program would not be available in the future.



Guarantees:

The Company accounts for guarantees in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45,
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees
to Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and a rescission of FASB
Interpretation No. 34” (FIN No. 45). Accordingly, the Company evaluates its guarantees to determine
whether (a) the guarantee is specifically excluded from the scope of FIN No. 45, (b) the guarantee
is subject to FIN No. 45 disclosure requirements only, but not subject to the initial recognition
and measurement provisions, or (c) the guarantee is required to be recorded in the financial
statements at fair value. The Company has recorded a liability for certain guaranteed residual
values related to specific facility lease agreements. The Company has evaluated its remaining
guarantees and has concluded that they are either not within the scope of FIN No. 45 or do not
require recognition in the financial statements. These guarantees generally include certain
indemnifications to its lessors under operating lease agreements for environmental matters,
potential overdraft protection obligations to financial institutions related to one of the
Company’s subsidiaries, indemnifications to the Company’s customers for certain infringement of
third-party intellectual property rights by its products and services, and the Company’s warranty
obligations under sales of its products. Please see Note 16 for additional information on the
Company’s guarantees.

Foreign Currency Translation:

The Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate in a local
currency environment, where that local currency is the functional currency, primarily generate and
expend cash in their local currency. Billings and receipts for their labor and services are
primarily denominated in the local currency and the workforce is paid in local currency. Their
individual assets and liabilities are primarily denominated in the local foreign currency and do
not materially impact the Company’s cash flows. Accordingly, all balance sheet accounts of these
local functional currency subsidiaries are translated at the fiscal period-end exchange rate, and
income and expense accounts are translated using average rates in effect for the period, except for
costs related to those balance sheet items that are translated using historical exchange rates. The
resulting translation adjustments are recorded as cumulative translation adjustments, and are a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Translation adjustments are recorded
in other income (expense), net, where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency.

Reclassifications:

Certain amounts presented in the comparative financial statements for prior
years have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal year 2006 presentation.

Note 3: Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation 48,
“Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties” (FIN 48). FIN 48 defines the threshold for recognizing
the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as “more-likely-than-not” to be
sustained by the taxing authority. The recently issued literature also provides guidance on the
derecognition, measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any related
interest and penalties. FIN 48 also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax
uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any
recorded income tax uncertainties.

FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Any differences
between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of FIN
48 and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment
recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings. The Company is currently in the process of
determining the impact, if any, of adopting the provisions of FIN 48 on its financial position,
results of operations and liquidity.

The Company accounts for its investment portfolio at fair value. Realized gains and
(losses) from investments sold were approximately $0.1 million and $(0.5) million in fiscal year
2006 and approximately $0.1 million and $(0.9) million in fiscal year 2005. Realized gains and
(losses) for investments sold are specifically identified. Management assesses the fair value of
investments in debt securities that are not actively traded through consideration of interest rates
and their impact on the present value of the cash flows to be received from the investments. The
Company also considers whether changes in the credit ratings of the issuer could impact the
assessment of fair value. The fair value of the Company’s investments in auction rate preferred
securities is based upon par value, which approximates fair value due to the nature of the
instruments.

The Company’s available-for-sale securities are invested in financial instruments with a
minimum rating of A2 / A, as rated by two of the following three rating agencies: Moody’s, Standard
& Poor’s (S&P), or Fitch.

The amortized cost and fair value of cash equivalents and short-term investments and
restricted cash and investments with contractual maturities is as follows:

Management has the ability and intent, if necessary, to liquidate any of its investments in
order to meet the Company’s liquidity needs in the next 12 months. Accordingly, those investments
with contractual maturities greater than one year from the date of purchase have been classified as
short-term on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.



On June 16, 2006, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Lam Research International SARL
(LRI), as borrower, entered into a $350 million Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement). Under the
Credit Agreement, on June 19, 2006, LRI borrowed $350 million
in principal amount. The loan under the Credit Agreement shall be fully repaid not later than
five years following the closing date. The loan under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at
LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 0.10% to 0.50%, depending upon a consolidated leverage ratio, as
defined in the Credit Agreement. The initial spread under the Credit Agreement is 0.10%. LRI may
prepay the loan under the Credit Agreement in whole or in part at any time without penalty, subject
to reimbursement of lenders’ breakage and redeployment costs in certain cases. The fair value of
long-term debt approximates its carrying value of $350.0 million due to the variable interest rate
applicable to the debt.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk
consist principally of cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade accounts receivable and
derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities.

As noted above, the Company’s available-for-sale securities are invested in financial
instruments with a minimum rating of A2 / A, as rated by two of the following three rating
agencies: Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s (S&P), or Fitch, respectively and its policy limits the amount
of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer.

Credit risk evaluations, including trade references, bank references and Dun & Bradstreet
ratings are performed on all new customers, and subsequent to credit application approval, the
Company monitors its customers’ financial statements and payment performance. In general, the
Company does not require collateral on sales.

The fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts is estimated based upon the
Japanese Yen exchange rates at June 25, 2006 and June 26, 2005, respectively.

At June 25, 2006 and June 26, 2005, the notional amount of outstanding Japanese Yen forward
contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges was $193.8 million and $66.2 million,
respectively. At June 25, 2006 and June 26, 2005, the notional amount of Japanese Yen forward
contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges was $23.5 million and $32.6 million,
respectively.

Note 5: Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging

The Company carries derivative financial instruments (derivatives) on the balance sheet at
their fair values in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (SFAS No. 133). The Company has a
policy that allows the use of derivative financial instruments, specifically foreign currency
forward exchange rate contracts, to hedge foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted
revenue transactions denominated in Japanese Yen and other foreign currency denominated assets. The
Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

are carried on the Company’s balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the
contracts’ gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and
subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue is recognized.

Each period, hedges are tested for effectiveness, using the dollar offset method, by comparing
the change in value of the derivative with the change in the value of the anticipated sales
transactions. There were no gains or losses during fiscal years 2006 and 2005 associated with
forecasted transactions that failed to occur. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge
relationship must meet criteria relating both to the derivative instrument and the hedged item.
These include identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk
being hedged and how the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes
in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows will be measured.

To receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at
the inception of the hedge and the hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future

realized. Consequently, with the exception of
hedge ineffectiveness recognized, the Company’s results of operations are not subject to
fluctuation as a result of changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments. If hedges are
not highly effective or if the Company does not believe that the underlying hedged forecasted
transactions would occur, the Company may not be able to account for its investments in derivative
instruments as cash flow hedges. If this were to occur in a future period, changes in the fair
values of the Company’s derivative instruments would be recognized in earnings without the benefits
of offsets or deferrals of changes in fair value arising from hedge accounting treatment. At June
25, 2006, the Company expects to reclassify the entire amount of $1.2 million of losses accumulated
in other comprehensive income to earnings during the next 12 months due to the recognition in
earnings of the hedged forecasted transactions.

The Company also enters into foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts to hedge the
gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of Japanese Yen-denominated receivable balances.
Under SFAS No. 133, these forward contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment.
Therefore, the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded into earnings as a component
of other income and expense and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency
denominated intercompany and trade receivables, recorded in other income and expense, assuming the
hedge contract fully covers the intercompany and trade receivable balances.

Note 11: Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed, using the
treasury stock method, as though all potential common shares that are dilutive were outstanding
during the period. The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators
of the basic and diluted computations for net income per share.

Note 13: Equity-Based Compensation Plans

The Company has adopted stock plans that provide for the grant to employees of equity-based
awards, including stock options and restricted stock units, of Lam common stock. In addition, these
plans permit the grant of nonstatutory equity-based awards to paid consultants and outside
directors. According to the plans, the equity-based award price is determined by the Board of
Directors or its designee, the plan administrator, but in no event will it be less than the fair
market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant. Equity-based awards granted under
the plans vest over a period determined by the Board of Directors or the plan administrator. The
Company also has an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) that allows employees to purchase its
common stock.

We awarded a total of 1,053,584 restricted stock units during fiscal year 2006. Certain of
these restricted stock units contain Company-specific performance targets. 1,045,512 restricted
stock units remain subject to vesting requirements as of June 25, 2006.



The 1997 Stock Incentive Plan and the 1999 Stock Option Plan provide for the grant of
non-qualified equity-based awards to eligible employees, consultants and advisors, and non-employee
directors of the Company and its subsidiaries. Initially, 9.0 million shares were reserved for
issuance under each plan. During fiscal year 2005, an additional 6.0 million shares were reserved
for issuance under the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan evergreen provision. There were no additional
amounts reserved for issuance during fiscal years 2006 and 2004.

The 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the 1999 ESPP) allows employees to designate a portion
of their base compensation to be used to purchase the Company’s Common Stock at a purchase price
per share of the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the first
or last day of the applicable offering period. Typically, each offering period lasts 12 months and
comprises three interim purchase dates. The 1999 ESPP, approved by the Company’s stockholders at
the Annual Meeting of Stockholders on November 5, 1998, replaced the existing 1984 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (1984 ESPP). At June 29, 2003 the Company had 9.0 million shares of Lam Common Stock
reserved for issuance under the 1999 ESPP: 3.0 million shares may be issued at any time and
additional shares (previously 6.0 million total additional shares) may be issued for each share of
the Company’s Common Stock which the Company redeems in public-market or private purchases and
designated for this purpose. In fiscal year 2004, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment
to the 1999 ESPP to (i) each year automatically increase the number of shares available for
issuance under the Plan by a specific amount on a one-for-one basis with shares of Common Stock
that the Company will redeem in public market and private purchases for such purpose and (ii) to
authorize the Plan Administrator (the Compensation Committee of the Board) to set a limit on the
number of shares a Plan participant can purchase on any single Plan exercise date. The automatic
annual increase provides that the number of shares in the Plan reserve available for issuance shall
be increased on the first business day of each calendar year commencing with 2004, on a one-for-one
basis with each share of Common Stock that the Company redeems, in public-market or private
purchases, and designates for this purpose, by a number of shares equal to the lesser of (i)
2,000,000, (ii) one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the number of shares of all classes of common
stock of the Company outstanding on the first business day of such calendar year, or (iii) a lesser
number determined by the Plan Administrator. During fiscal years 2004 and 2006, the number of
shares of Lam Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 1999 ESPP increased by 2.0 million
shares in each fiscal year, subject to repurchase of an equal number of shares in public market or
private purchases. There were no increases to the reserve during fiscal year 2005.

During fiscal year 2006, 657,490 shares of the Company’s Common Stock were sold to employees
under the 1999 ESPP. A total of 9,680,601 shares of the Company’s Common Stock have been issued
under the 1999 ESPP Plan through June 25, 2006, at prices ranging from $4.11 to $31.84 per share.
At June 25, 2006, 3,313,227 shares were available for purchase under the 1999 ESPP Plan.

Prior to June 27, 2005, the Company accounted for its stock plans under the provisions of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (APB No. 25)
and FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 44, “Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation — an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25” (FIN No. 44). The Company adopted Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123R),
effective June 27, 2005 using the modified prospective transition method. Under that transition
method, equity-based compensation expense recognized during fiscal year 2006 includes: (a) ESPP
awards with offering periods commencing, and stock options and restricted stock units granted,
prior to, but not yet vested as of June 27, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in
accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (b) ESPP with offering periods
commencing and restricted stock units granted, subsequent to June 27, 2005, based on the grant-date
fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. Under the modified
prospective transition method, results for prior periods are not restated.

The Company analyzed its equity-based compensation strategies prior to the adoption of SFAS
No. 123R and made the decision to grant restricted stock units rather than stock options during
fiscal year 2006. The Company recognized equity-based compensation expense of $22.8 million during
fiscal year 2006. Included in these amounts are expenses related to restricted stock units of
$11.4 million during fiscal year 2006 which would have been included in the Company’s Consolidated
Statements of Operations under the provisions of APB No. 25. As a result of adopting SFAS No.
123R, the company’s income before income taxes and net income for the year ended June 25, 2006, are
$11.4 million and $9.3 million lower, respectively, than if it had continued to account for
equity-based compensation under APB No. 25. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the year
ended June 25, 2006 are $.07 and $.06 lower, respectively, than if the Company had continued to
account for equity-based compensation under APB No. 25.

The income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statements of operations related to
equity-based compensation expense was $4.3 million during fiscal year 2006. The estimated fair
value of the Company’s equity-based awards, less expected forfeitures, is
amortized over the awards’ vesting period on a straight-line basis for awards granted after
the adoption of SFAS No. 123R and on a graded vesting basis for awards granted prior to the
adoption of SFAS No. 123R.



The modified prospective transition method of SFAS No. 123R requires the presentation of pro
forma information, for periods presented prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, regarding net
income (loss) and net income (loss) per share as if the Company had accounted for its stock plans
under the fair value method of SFAS No. 123R. For pro forma purposes, fair value of stock options
and ESPP awards was estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model and amortized on a
graded vesting basis. The fair value of all of the Company’s equity-based awards was estimated
assuming no expected dividends and estimates of expected life, volatility and risk-free interest
rate at the time of grant. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and net income
per share if the Company had accounted for its stock plans under the fair value method of
accounting under SFAS No. 123R:

Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units

The Company did not grant any stock options during fiscal year 2006. The fair value of the
Company’s stock options issued prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R was estimated using a
Black-Scholes option valuation model. This model requires the input of highly subjective
assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. Prior
to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company used historical volatility as a basis for calculating
expected volatility.

The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and options exercisable was $127.3
million and $105.6 million, respectively, as of June 25, 2006. The total intrinsic value of
options exercised during fiscal year 2006 was $224.0 million. As of June 25, 2006,
there was $1.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock
options granted and outstanding; that cost is expected to be recognized through fiscal year 2009,
with a weighted average remaining period of 0.7 years. Cash received from stock option exercises
was $179.4 million during fiscal year 2006.

The fair value of the Company’s restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair
market value of the Company’s stock at the date of grant. As of June 25, 2006, there was $20.9
million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock units
granted; that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining period of 1.0
years.



ESPP

ESPP awards were valued using the Black-Scholes model. ESPP awards for offering periods
subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R were valued using the Black-Scholes model with expected
volatility calculated using implied volatility. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company
used historical volatility in deriving its expected volatility assumption. The Company determined,
for purposes of valuing ESPP awards, that implied volatility provides a more accurate reflection of
market conditions and is a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility.
During fiscal year 2006 ESPP was valued assuming no expected dividends and the following
weighted-average assumptions:

Expected life (years)

0.68

Expected stock price volatility

34.5

Risk-free interest rate

As of June 25, 2006, there was $0.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
the ESPP that is expected to be recognized over a remaining period of two months.

Note 14: Profit Sharing and Benefit Plans

Profit sharing is awarded to certain employees based upon performance against specific
corporate financial and operating goals. Distributions to employees by the Company are based upon a
percentage of earned compensation, provided that a threshold level of the Company’s financial and
performance goals are met. In addition to profit sharing the Company has other bonus plans based on
achievement of profitability and other specific performance criteria. Charges to expense under
these plans were $70.8 million, $63.1 million, and $30.9 million during fiscal years 2006, 2005,
and 2004, respectively.

The Company maintains a 401(k)-retirement savings plan for its full-time employees in North
America. Each participant in the plan may elect to contribute from 2% to 20% of his or her annual
salary to the plan, subject to statutory limitations. The Company makes matching employee
contributions in cash to the plan at the rate of 50% of the first 6% of salary contributed.
Employees participating in the 401(k)-retirement savings plan are 100% vested in the Company
matching contributions and investments are directed by participants. The Company made matching
contributions of approximately $3.5 million, $3.2 million, and $3.0 million in fiscal years 2006,
2005, and 2004, respectively.

Note 15: Commitments

The Company has certain obligations, some of which are recorded on its balance sheet and some
which are not, to make future payments under various contracts. Obligations are recorded on the
Company’s balance sheet in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The
obligations recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet include restructuring liabilities
and long-term debt which are outlined in the following table and are discussed below. The
Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships and are presented as
operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below. The Company’s contractual cash

Operating Leases

The Company leases most of its administrative, R&D and manufacturing facilities, regional
sales/service offices and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases, which expire at
various dates through 2021. Certain of the Company’s facility leases for buildings located at its
Fremont, California headquarters and certain other facility leases provide the Company with an
option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. Certain of the
Company’s facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of
inflation.

Included in the operating leases 1-3 years section of the table above is $75.0 million in
guaranteed residual values for lease agreements relating to certain properties at the Company’s
Fremont, California campus. As part of the lease agreements, the Company has the option to purchase
the remaining buildings at any time for a total purchase price for all remaining properties related
to these leases of approximately $85.0 million. The Company is required to guarantee the lessor a
residual value on the properties of up to $75.0 million at the end of the lease terms in fiscal
year 2008 (in the event that the leases are not renewed, the Company does not exercise the purchase
options, the lessor sells the properties and the sale price is less than the lessor’s costs). The
Company maintains cash collateral of $85.0 million as part of the lease agreements as of June 25,
2006 in separate, specified certificates of deposit and interest-bearing accounts which are
recorded as restricted cash and investments in its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The lessor under the
lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the
characteristics of a variable interest entity (VIE) as defined by FASB Interpretation No. 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” and is therefore not consolidated by the Company.

The remaining operating lease balances primarily relate to non-cancelable facility-related
operating leases.

Purchase Obligations

Purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis
or over multi-year periods related to the Company’s outsourcing activities or other material
commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories. The Company continues to enter into new
agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain activities, including elements of
its manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance, certain information technology
functions, and certain transactional general and administrative functions. The contractual cash
obligations and commitments table presented above contains the Company’s minimum obligations at
June 25, 2006 under these arrangements and others. Actual expenditures will vary based on the
volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. In addition to minimum spending
commitments, certain of these agreements provide for potential cancellation charges.

Consignment inventories, which are owned by vendors but located in the Company’s storage
locations and warehouses, are not reported as the Company’s inventory until title is transferred to
it or its purchase obligation is determined. At June 25, 2006, vendor-owned inventories held at
the Company’s locations and not reported as its inventory increased to approximately $31.1 million
as compared to $14.8 million at June 26, 2005, due to the increased volume of the Company’s
business.

Restructuring Liabilities

The Company’s total restructuring reserves as of June 25, 2006 were $1.6 million, which
consists primarily of lease payments on vacated buildings. Through cash generated from operations,
the Company expects the remaining balance to be paid over the next twelve months.

Long-Term Debt and Interest Expense

On June 16, 2006, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Lam Research International SARL
(LRI), as borrower, entered into a $350 million Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement).

Under the Credit Agreement, on June 19, 2006, LRI borrowed $350 million in principal
amount. The loan under the Credit Agreement shall be fully repaid not later than five years
following the closing date. The loan under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at LIBOR plus a
spread ranging from 0.10% to 0.50%, depending upon a consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the
Credit Agreement. The initial spread under the Credit Agreement is 0.10%. LRI may prepay the loan
under the Credit Agreement in whole or in part at any time
without penalty, subject to reimbursement of lenders’ breakage and redeployment costs in
certain cases. The amounts in the table above include the principal payment of $350 million due on
June 19, 2011 and interest payments estimated based



on the current LIBOR rate of 5.55% and initial spread of ten basis points. The fair value of
long-term debt approximates its carrying value due to the variable interest rate applicable to the
debt.

The Company used the proceeds from the credit facility entered into by LRI to facilitate the
repatriation of $500 million of foreign earnings in the June 2006 quarter under the provisions of
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA). The Company has now completed its repatriation of
foreign earnings under the provisions of the AJCA.

Note 16: Guarantees

The Company accounts for its guarantees in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 45 “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (FIN No. 45). FIN No. 45
requires a company that is a guarantor to make specific disclosures about its obligations under
certain guarantees that it has issued. FIN No. 45 also requires a company (the Guarantor) to
recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in
issuing the guarantee.

The Company leases several facilities at its headquarters location in Fremont, California. As
part of certain of the lease agreements, the Company has the option to purchase the remaining
buildings at any time for a total purchase price for all remaining properties related to these
leases of approximately $85.0 million. The Company is required to guarantee the lessor a residual
value on the properties of up to $75.0 million at the end of the lease terms in fiscal year 2008
(in the event that the leases are not renewed, the Company does not exercise the purchase options,
the lessor sells the properties and the sale price is less than the lessor’s costs). The Company
maintains cash collateral of $85.0 million as part of the lease agreements as of June 25, 2006 in
separate, specified certificates of deposit and interest-bearing accounts which are recorded as
restricted cash and investments in its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The lessor under the lease
agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a
variable interest entity (VIE) as defined by FASB Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities” and is therefore not consolidated by the Company.

The Company has issued certain indemnifications to its lessors under some of its agreements.
The Company has entered into certain insurance contracts which may limit its exposure to such
indemnifications. As of June 25, 2006, the Company has not recorded any liability on its financial
statements in connection with these indemnifications, as it does not believe, based on information
available, that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees.

In connection with the Credit Agreement entered into by LRI note above, the Company entered
into a Guarantee Agreement (the Guarantee Agreement) guaranteeing the obligations of LRI under the
Credit Agreement. The Company’s obligations under the Guarantee Agreement are collateralized by
readily marketable securities in an amount equal to 110% of the outstanding balance of its
obligations under the Guarantee Agreement, representing $385.0 million at June 25, 2006. This
collateral is reflected in the balance of restricted cash and investments in the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Generally, the Company indemnifies, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, its
customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by the Company’s products or
services. The Company seeks to limit its liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed
the sales price of the products or services subject to its indemnification obligations. The
Company does not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that any material
amounts will be paid under these guarantees.

The Company offers standard warranties on its systems that run generally for a period of 12
months from system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from the date of shipment of the system to
the customer. The liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type
of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any known differences such as the impact
of system reliability improvements.

Realization of the Company’s net deferred tax assets is based upon the weight of
available evidence, including such factors as the recent earnings history and expected future
taxable income. The Company believes it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized;
however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables
not known or anticipated at this time.



Deferred tax assets relating to tax benefits of employee stock option grants have been reduced
to reflect the exercises in fiscal year 2006. Some exercises resulted in tax deductions in excess
of previously recorded benefits based on the option value at the time of grant (“windfalls”).
Although these additional tax benefits are reflected in net operating loss carryforwards, pursuant
to SFAS 123(R), the additional tax benefit associated with the windfall is not recognized until the
deduction reduces cash taxes payable. When the tax benefit reduces cash taxes payable, the Company
will credit equity. During fiscal year 2006, the Company recorded a credit to equity
of $27.8 million. The net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards related to these tax
benefits of $125.2 million and $106.0 million are not reflected in the Company’s deferred tax
assets for fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively.

At June 25, 2006, the Company had federal tax loss carryforwards of approximately $188.4
million, non tax-effected, which will expire between fiscal years 2023 and 2026. The Company also
has federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $172.4 million of which
approximately $119.6 million will expire in varying amounts between fiscal years 2011 and 2027.
The remaining balance of $52.8 million of tax carryforwards may be carried forward indefinitely.

A reconciliation of income tax expense provided at the federal statutory rate (35% in fiscal
years 2006, 2005, and 2004) to actual income expense (benefit) is as follows:

Consistent with the proportion of earnings outside of the U.S., the Company has
negotiated a tax holiday on certain of those foreign earnings which is effective from fiscal year
2003 through June 2013. The tax holiday is conditional upon the Company meeting certain employment
and investment thresholds. The impact of the tax holiday decreased income taxes by approximately
$73.4 million for fiscal year 2006 as compared to $12.4 million in fiscal year 2005. The benefit
of the tax holiday on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.51 in fiscal year 2006 as
compared to $0.09 in fiscal year 2005.

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (“AJCA” or the “Act”) was enacted
into law. The Act provided for a special one-time elective dividends received deduction of 85% for
certain foreign earnings that are repatriated by the end of fiscal 2006. During the year ended June
25, 2006, the Company repatriated $526 million of foreign earnings of which $500 million
represented an extraordinary dividend under the AJCA. As a result, the Company recorded an
additional $24.2 million tax provision in fiscal 2006.

The Company has recently reached a settlement on a transfer pricing dispute via a bilateral
advance pricing agreement between the United States and Korea relating to fiscal years 1998 through
2005. The Company received the final closing letter from the Korean taxing authorities dated June
20, 2006. As such, the Company reversed its related tax reserve by a net $2.7 million in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2006.



Note 18: Segment, Geographic Information and Major Customers

The Company operates in one business segment: manufacturing and servicing of front-end wafer
processing semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The Company’s material operating units qualify
for aggregation under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, “Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,” due to their identical customer base and
similarities in economic characteristics, nature of products and services, and processes for
procurement, manufacturing and distribution.

The Company operates in five geographic regions: the United States, Europe, Korea, Asia
Pacific, and Japan. For geographical reporting, revenues are attributed to the geographic location
in which the customers’ facilities are located while long-lived assets are attributed to the
geographic locations in which the assets are located.

Note 19: Legal Proceedings

From time to time, the Company has received notices from third parties alleging infringement
of such parties’ patent or other intellectual property rights by the Company’s products. In such
cases it is the Company’s policy to defend the claims, or if considered appropriate, negotiate
licenses on commercially reasonable terms. However, no assurance can be given that the Company
will be able in the future to negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at
all, or that any litigation resulting from such claims would not have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s consolidated financial position or operating results.



Note 20: Subsequent Events

On July 12, 2006, the Supreme Court of California denied review of lower and appellate court
judgments in favor of Lam with respect to a lawsuit filed by Lam alleging breach of purchase order
contracts by one of its customers. As a result of the denied review, the prior rulings from the
trial and appellate courts stand resulting in a judgment in favor of Lam of approximately $15.8
million, which includes approximately $2.0 million in post-judgment interest. The Company plans to
record this amount in other income (expense), net during the quarter ending September 24, 2006.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lam Research Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lam Research Corporation as of June
25, 2006 and June 26, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 25, 2006. Our audits
also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Lam Research Corporation at June 25, 2006 and June
26, 2005, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended June 25, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of Lam Research Corporation’s internal control over
financial reporting as of June 25, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated August 14, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

As discussed in Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, under the heading
Equity-Based Compensation – Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Plans, in fiscal 2006
Lam Research Corporation changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lam Research Corporation

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Lam Research Corporation maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of June 25, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Lam Research Corporation’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Lam Research Corporation maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of June 25, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects,
based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Lam Research Corporation maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 25, 2006, based
on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Lam Research Corporation as of June 25,
2006 and June 26, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 25, 2006 of Lam Research
Corporation and our report dated August 14, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
