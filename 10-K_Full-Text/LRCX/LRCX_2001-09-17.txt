Item 1.

Business

We design, manufacture, market and service semiconductor processing
equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits.  We are recognized as a leading supplier of front-end wafer processing
equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry.  Our etch products selectively remove portions of various films to create an
integrated circuit.  Etch processes, which are repeated numerous times during the fabrication cycle, are required to manufacture
every type of semiconductor device produced today. We sell a broad range of plasma ("dry") etch products to address
specific applications. Our TCP

Ò

etchers utilize a high-density plasma process to etch device features below 100 nanometers.

Chemical Mechanical Planarization ("CMP") is used to planarize the surface of the processed wafer to
prepare it for further processing.  CMP is currently the planarization technology of choice for manufacturing 130 nanometers and
smaller integrated circuits with multiple metal layers.  Post-CMP clean processes are used to remove residues left on the wafer
after CMP processing. We market both the DSS-200

â

and Synergy

ä

product lines of post-CMP cleaners, which are used to remove residual slurries and other contaminants from wafer surfaces, both
after CMP polishing and before and after essential semiconductor process steps.  Our Teres

â

CMP integrated system leverages our post-CMP cleaning expertise to provide fully integrated
polishing and cleaning solutions.

Lam Research Corporation, a Delaware Corporation, was founded in 1980, and is headquartered in Fremont,
California.  The postal address for our principal executive offices is 4650 Cushing Parkway, Fremont, California 94538.  Our
telephone number is (510) 572-0200.

Products

Semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process steps that result in the simultaneous
creation of many individual integrated circuits. Quality assurance tests are often conducted between each step.  Our products are
currently used in the front-end of the wafer processing manufacturing cycle: etch, CMP, and post-CMP clean.  Several of our etch
products are available as standalone systems or as clusters used on the Alliance

â

multichamber

or


ä

platforms.  We also supply advanced control system software with all systems for production management.

Etch Products

The etch process defines linewidths and other microscopic features on integrated circuits.  Plasma etching was
developed to meet the demand for device geometries smaller than three microns.  Plasma consists of ions and neutral species that
react with exposed portions of the wafer to produce the finely delineated features and patterns of the integrated circuit. Today,
manufacturers of advanced integrated circuits require etch systems that create features of 130 nanometers and below (the thickness of
a human hair).  In the near future, systems capable of producing devices with feature sizes below 100 nanometers will be needed. The
trend toward features in the 100 nanometer range accompanies a transition from aluminum to copper conductive lines for faster
processing speeds. In addition to continually shrinking feature sizes, advanced manufacturing facilities are now producing integrated
circuits on 200 mm (8 inch diameter) silicon wafers and will transition to wafer diameters of 300 mm (12 inches). To accommodate
these decreasing linewidths and increasing wafer diameters, semiconductor manufacturers will increasingly require more precise
control over the etch process.  Our family of etch systems incorporates plasma technologies designed to meet both current and future
needs.

Rainbow

ä

.

The first Rainbow etch single chamber system was introduced in 1987.  The Rainbow series of products addresses processes that
utilize wafer sizes up to 200 mm and feature linewidth sizes as small as 180 nanometers in some cases.

4520XLe

ä

,

Exelan

â

and

Exelan

â

High Performance

.  The 4520XLe

ä

is a dual frequency dialectric etch system that offers extended process window and capabilities down to 180 nanometer geometries.
Exelan

â

is our dialectric etch system offering introduced in July 1999 and well suited for copper conductive lines creation
processes.  Exelan

â

High Performance, introduced in 2001, targets sub-130 nanometer geometries for advanced applications and latest
generation dialectric films.

TCP.

Our TCP

product line of high-density, low-pressure etch systems, which was introduced in late
1992, incorporates our patented Transformer Coupled Plasma

ä

source technology, which has been proven to etch features below 100 nanometers.  We currently
offer the TCP

Ò

9600SE II, TCP

Ò

9600PTX, and TCP

Ò

9600DFM for metal etch applications and the TCP

Ò

9400SE II, TCP

Ò

9400PTX and TCP

Ò

9400DFM, for polysilicon, polycide and shallow trench isolation ("STI") etch applications.  These systems are currently
used in the production of a broad range of advanced logic and memory devices, while research and development ("R&D")
has demonstrated their continued application in advanced next-generation features and production, such as STI and copper dual
damascene processes.  The TCP series operates at low pressures for improved pattern control and high plasma density for higher etch
rates.  Our TCP systems are designed to offer customers a reliable, low cost of ownership solution for their advanced processing
needs. The TCP systems are available as a standalone (chamber) configuration or on the Alliance multichamber platform.


ä

Etch Series

.  The 2300 Etch Series, introduced in November 2000, enables wafer fabrication facilities to have one platform
independent, of their need to process 200 or 300 mm wafers.  The 2300 Exelan

®

combines the benefits of our Dual
Frequency Confined

ä

("DFC"

ä

) plasma technology with state-of-the-art chamber design to provide the most advanced process performance required by copper
conductive lines creation, latest generation insulating films and high aspect ratio applications.  The 2300 Versys

ä

Silicon and 2300 Versys

ä

Metal further enhance the production capability of our proven Transformer Coupled Plasma technology giving the flexibility needed
for leading edge device structures.

CMP Product

Teres

. We offer 200 mm and 300 mm Teres CMP integrated polishing and
cleaning systems with Linear Planarization Technology

ä

("LPT"

ä

), which uses a high-speed belt instead of
the rotating table used in conventional polishers.  LPT offers a wider process window and
more flexible polishing options than conventional systems. We designed the Teres system to planarize patterned films with higher
removal rates and better uniformity and planarity than conventional systems currently offer.  The Teres is supplied with an
integrated Synergy post-CMP cleaning system (see discussion below) to provide dry in/dry out production.

Post-CMP Wafer Cleaning Products

DSS-200.

The DSS-200 Series II cleaning system has a number of features
that distinguish it from competitive cleaning methods. Double-sided scrubbing technology with chemical cleaning simultaneously scrubs
both sides of the wafer with proprietary brushes top and bottom, while limiting contact that can contaminate the backside of the
wafer resulting in improved cleaning efficiency.  In addition, single wafer processing minimizes the risks inherent in processing
wafers in batches.

Synergy

.  Synergy products combine double-sided scrubbing technology and
Chemical Mechanical Cleaning ("CMC"

ä

) technology to perform mechanical cleaning and chemical cleaning simultaneously in a single-step process. The applications for the
Synergy family include oxide, STI, tungsten and copper cleaning. In response to the worldwide demand for a dry in/dry out CMP
solution, we provide the Synergy Integra

ä

, which incorporates advanced cleaning technology with a platform that integrates polisher and cleaner.  Integrated systems are the
result of partnerships between Lam and other polishing vendors.

Research and Development

The market for semiconductor capital equipment is characterized by rapid technological change. We believe
that continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products is necessary for us to maintain our
competitive position.  Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to R&D programs and
seek to maintain close relationships with our customers to be responsive to their wafer processing needs.

Our R&D expenses during fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999 were $227.2 million, $176.9 million and $142.5 million,
respectively, and represented 15.0%, 14.4%, and 22.0% of total revenue, respectively. Current significant projects are targeted at
continued development of advanced Etch, CMP and Clean applications and enhancements to our existing products, including developing
the technology necessary to support smaller feature sizes, new insulating materials, copper-based devices and 300 mm wafers. In
addition, we maintain an in-house group of highly skilled application engineers to develop and respond to customer process needs
worldwide, when a high level of technical expertise is required.

We expect to continue to make substantial investments in R&D to meet our customers' product needs and enhance
our competitive position.

Marketing, Sales and Service

Our marketing and sales efforts are focused on building long-term relationships with our customers. These
efforts are supported by a team of product marketing professionals, sales personnel as well as equipment and process engineers that
work closely with individual customers to find solutions to their processing needs.  After-sales support is an essential element of
our marketing and sales programs. We maintain an ongoing support relationship with our customers and have an extensive network of
field service personnel in place throughout the United States, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific. We believe that our comprehensive
support programs and close working relationships are essential to our competitiveness.

We have more than 40 sales and support centers located throughout the United States, Europe, Japan, and Asia
Pacific, through which technical personnel sell and/or and service our products. We provide our customers a comprehensive warranty
package on all released products.

Export sales accounted for approximately 50%, 52%, and 33% of our net sales in fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999,
respectively.  Export sales consist of sales from our U.S. operating subsidiary to non-affiliated customers in non-U.S. countries. A
significant portion of our sales and operations will be subject to certain risks, including tariffs and other barriers, difficulties
in staffing and managing non-U.S. subsidiary and branch operations, potentially adverse tax consequences, and the potential for
difficulty in accounts receivable collection.  There can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  Reference is made to Note P of our Consolidated
Financial Statements, included in Item 8 herein, for further information concerning export sales, which information is incorporated
herein by this reference.

Customers

Our customers include the world's leading semiconductor manufacturers. In fiscal years 2001 and 2000,
revenue from STMicroelectronics accounted for 15% of total revenue. No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of our total
revenue in fiscal 1999.

Our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn depend on the
current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products utilizing integrated circuits. In fiscal 1999,
semiconductor manufacturers reduced or delayed purchases of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and construction of new fabrication
facilities because of an industry downturn.  In late fiscal 1999, we began to experience a recovery in demand for our products, which
drove sales growth through the first half of fiscal 2001. Beginning in the second half of fiscal 2001, a slowing U.S. economy and a
worldwide decline in demand for integrated circuits resulted in excess capacity in the semiconductor industry and a severe
contraction in demand for manufacturing equipment. Our current outlook is for lower revenues in the first half of fiscal 2002 and
potentially beyond compared to the second half of fiscal 2001, due to our customers' current plans to delay or reduce capital
expenditures for calendar years 2001 and early 2002.

Backlog

We schedule production of our systems based upon purchase orders in backlog and our customers'
delivery requirements.  Included in our backlog are orders for which written requests have been accepted and shipment dates assigned.
Our policy is to make adjustments to our financial backlog to reflect customer delivery dates delays, as well as order cancellations,
so that only those orders for which equipment is expected to ship within the next 12 months are reflected in our reported backlog
amounts.  As of June 24, 2001 and June 25, 2000, our order backlog was approximately $231 million and $551 million,
respectively.  All orders for our products are subject to cancellation by our customers, in some cases with limited penalties.
Because some orders are received for systems to be shipped in the same quarter and because of possible customer changes in delivery
dates and cancellations of orders, our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for succeeding
periods.

Manufacturing

Our manufacturing operations consist mainly of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that
are then integrated into finished systems. Once we have completed final testing of all electronic and electromechanical subassemblies
that make up one of our offerings, the completed modules are process tested with

defined

processes. Most of the assembly and all testing of our products is conducted in cleanroom environments.
Prior to shipping a completed system, customer representatives may perform acceptance tests at our facility.  After passing these
acceptance tests, the system is vacuum-bagged in a cleanroom environment and prepared for shipment.

During fiscal 1999, we entered into a five-year contract manufacturing agreement with Yokogawa Electric
Corporation ("Yokogawa"). Under the terms of the agreement, Yokogawa assembles Transport Modules ("TMs") from
kits supplied by our Fremont manufacturing operations.  Yokogawa integrates these TMs with completed process modules provided by us,
performs final test services for the completed units, and ships them to our customers in Japan.

Certain of the components and subassemblies included in our products are obtained from a single supplier or a
limited group of suppliers. The Company believes that alternative sources could be obtained and qualified to supply these products.
Nevertheless, a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could have a severe near-term effect on our operating results and
could result in damage to customer relationships.

We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic, volatile or
otherwise hazardous chemicals.  We believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained (or
will obtain or are otherwise addressing) all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business. These permits generally relate
to the disposal of hazardous wastes.  Nevertheless, the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines
being imposed on us, suspension of production, cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers' acceptance of our products.
These regulations could require us to alter our current operations, to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other
expenses to comply with environmental regulations.  Our failure to control the use, sale, transport or disposal of hazardous
substances could subject us to future liabilities.

Employees

As of September 7, 2001, we had approximately 3,150 full-time employees.
None of our employees are represented by a trade union, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. Our management considers
employee relations to be good.

Each of our employees signs an agreement to maintain the confidentiality of our
proprietary information, and all key employees have stock or stock option arrangements with us that provide for the vesting of their
options over several years.

Competition

The semiconductor equipment industry is highly competitive. We face substantial competition
throughout the world.  Our management believes that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a
broad range of products, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process R&D.
Certain of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering,
manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support organizations. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design
and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with enhanced price and
performance characteristics. If our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering
etch, CMP or post-CMP clean products similar to those we sell, our ability to sell our products to those customers could be adversely
affected.  No assurance can be given that we will continue to compete successfully in the United States or worldwide.

We face significant competitive factors in the equipment market, including quality, repeatability, process
capability and flexibility, and overall cost of ownership, which may be affected by factors such as reliability, software automation,
throughput, customer support and system price. Although we believe that we compete favorably with respect to many of these factors,
our ability to compete successfully in the marketplace will depend upon our ability to introduce product enhancements and new
products on a timely basis. There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future. Our primary
competitors in the etch market are Applied Materials, Inc. and Tokyo Electron Limited. Our Teres CMP integrated polishing system
faces significant competition from several competitors.  Among the companies currently offering polishing systems are Applied
Materials, Inc., Ebara Corp., and            SpeedFam-IPEC, Inc. 	In CMP slurry removal and cleaning applications, our competitors
include DaiNippon Screen Manufacturing Co. Ltd. and VERTEQ Inc.

Patents and Licenses

We have a policy of seeking patents on inventions relating to new products and processes developed as
part of our ongoing research, engineering, and manufacturing activities.  We hold United States patents and corresponding foreign
patents covering various aspects of our products and processes.  We believe that the duration of our patents generally exceeds the
life cycles of the technologies and processes disclosed and claimed therein.  Our patents, which cover material aspects of our past
and present core products, have current durations ranging from approximately eight to seventeen years.  We believe that although the
patents we own and may obtain in the future will be of value, they will not alone determine our success, which depends principally
upon our engineering, marketing, service and manufacturing skills.  However, in the absence of patent protection, we may be
vulnerable to competitors who attempt to imitate our products, manufacturing techniques, and processes. In addition, other companies
and inventors may receive patents that contain claims applicable or similar to our products and processes.  The sale of products
covered by patents of others could require licenses that may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.

From time to time, we have received notices from third parties alleging infringement of such parties' patent or
other intellectual property rights by our products.  In such cases, it is our policy  to defend the claims or negotiate licenses on
commercially reasonable terms, where considered appropriate.  However, no assurance can be given that we will be able in the future
to negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any litigation resulting from such claims would
not have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For further discussion of legal matters see Item 3
"Legal Proceedings" on page 10 of this Form 10-K.

Other Cautionary Statements

See the discussion of our risks in the section of this report entitled Item 7 "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations".

Item 2.

Properties

Our executive offices and principal manufacturing and R&D facilities are located in Fremont,
California, and are under leases expiring from 2001 to 2006. As a result of the restructuring of our operations, we have subleased
some of our idle facilities. In addition, we lease facilities for our service, technical support and sales personnel throughout the
United States, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific. Our fiscal 2001 rental payments for the space occupied as of June 24, 2001,
aggregated approximately $23.8 million and are subject to periodic increases. We believe that our existing facilities are well
maintained and in good operating condition.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

In October 1993, Varian Associates, Inc. ("Varian") brought suit against us in the United
States District Court, for the Northern District of California, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based on our alleged
infringement of certain patents held by Varian. By order of the Court, those proceedings were bifurcated into an initial phase to
determine the validity of the Varian patents and our infringement (if any), and a secondary phase to determine damages to Varian (if
any) and whether our infringement (if shown) was willful. On April 13, 1999, the Court issued an interlocutory order construing the
meaning of the terms of the patent claims at issue in the action. In September 1999, a hearing was held on a summary judgment motion,
which might dispose of a number of Varian's claims.  In early January 2001, the Court issued an order determining that we did not
literally infringe Varian's patents, but the Court also held that a question of fact remained as to whether we may have infringed
those patents by the doctrine of equivalents. There is now a trial date of November 26, 2001. There have been no findings in the
action, which have caused us reasonably to believe that any infringement, if found, or any damages, if awarded, would have a material
adverse effect on our operating results or our financial position.

In September 1999, Tegal Corporation ("Tegal") brought suit against us in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based on our alleged infringement of
certain patents held by Tegal.  Specifically, Tegal identified our 4520XLe

ä

and Exelan products as infringing the patents Tegal is asserting. On our motion, this case was transferred to California and is now
pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. To date, however, there has been no
determination as to the actual scope of those claims, or whether our products have infringed or are infringing Tegal's patents.  No
trial date is currently scheduled in the action.  Furthermore, there have been no findings in the action, which have caused us
reasonably to believe that any infringement, if found, or any damages, if awarded, could have a material adverse effect on our
operating results or our financial position.

From time to time, we have received notices from third parties alleging infringement of such parties' patent
or other intellectual property rights by our products.  In such cases, it is our policy to defend the claims or negotiate licenses on
commercially reasonable terms, where considered appropriate.  However, no assurance can be given that we will be able in the future
to negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any litigation resulting from such claims would
not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or operating results.

Item 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

See the discussion of our "Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" in
Part I of this report.

Results of Operations

Lam Research Corporation is a supplier of technically complex thin film selective removal equipment
used at the front-end of semiconductor manufacturing. The Company's product offerings include single wafer plasma etch systems with a
wide range of applications, CMP and post-CMP wafer cleaning systems.  Demand for our equipment can fluctuate significantly from
period to period as a result of various factors, including but not limited to, economic conditions, supply and demand for
semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and our ability to develop and market competitive new products. For these and other
reasons, our results of operations for fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999 may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results.

Fiscal 2001 vs. 2000

Total Revenue

Our total revenue for the fiscal year ended June 24, 2001, was $1.5 billion, compared to $1.2 billion in
fiscal 2000.  Total revenue of $1.5 billion in fiscal 2001 reflects the adoption of SAB 101, discussed below in "Changes in
Accounting Policy". Fiscal 2000 pro forma revenue, applying SAB 101, was  $1.0 billion.

The increase in revenue for fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 reflects the strong demand for our systems
which was driven by the significant increase in semiconductor production capacity in fiscal 2000 and the first half of fiscal 2001.
Revenue from our etch products experienced the greatest increase.

In December 2000, we began to see signs of a downturn resulting from a slowing economy and a worldwide decline
in demand for semiconductors.  Our orders drastically dropped in the last half of fiscal 2001 as our customers sharply reduced
capital expenditures due to excess integrated circuits inventory levels and over capacity in the semiconductor industry.  Our current
outlook is for lower revenues in the first half of fiscal 2002 and potentially beyond compared to the second half of fiscal 2001, due
to semiconductor manufacturers delaying, reducing or canceling capital equipment purchases.

Regional geographic breakdown of revenue is as follows:

Year Ended
                                    June 24, June 25,
                                    -----------------
                                      2001     2000
                                    -------- --------
North America......................      30%      29%
Europe.............................      28%      28%
Asia Pacific.......................      33%      31%
Japan..............................       9%      12%

Gross Margin

Our gross margin percentage decreased to 43.0% in fiscal 2001, compared to 44.0% for reported
fiscal 2000. The decrease in our gross margin percentage results from unabsorbed indirect overhead costs in the second half of fiscal
2001, due to the industry slowdown. Additionally, implementation of SAB 101, which generally resulted in the delay of revenue
recognition on systems until quarterly accounting periods after their manufacture, further reduced gross margins as a percent of
revenues in fiscal 2001. This is because certain indirect manufacturing costs continue to be recognized as expenses during the period
the systems were manufactured.

Our current outlook is for a decline in gross margins as a percent of revenue at least in the first half of
fiscal 2002 and potentially beyond compared to the second half of fiscal 2001, due to lower production output and utilization of
field resources. The unfavorable impact of lower output is expected to be partially offset by cost reduction activities initiated in
late fiscal 2001.

Research and Development

R&D expenses for fiscal year, 2001, were $227.2 million, 28.5% higher than the prior
fiscal year.  R&D expenses were 15.0% of total revenue for the current fiscal year, compared to 14.4% of total reported revenue
for the prior fiscal year. The increase in R&D expenses was driven by our continued investments in advanced etch and CMP/Clean
applications and enhancements to our existing products, including developing the technology necessary to support smaller feature
size, new insulating materials, copper-based devices and 300 mm wafers.

We believe that in order to remain competitive, we must continue to invest substantially in R&D.  We
expect R&D costs as a percent of revenue to further increase in the next 2 quarters and potentially beyond as revenues are
anticipated to decline while investment in R&D programs will continue at slightly reduced levels.

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses (excluding restructuring
charges/recoveries) were 14.4% of total revenue in fiscal 2001, as compared to 13.1% of total reported revenue in fiscal 2000. The
increase in absolute dollars for fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was largely a result of increased
infrastructure related to higher sales, marketing, and administrative support for our expanding business in the first half of fiscal
2001, as well as higher incentive payments to our employees.   SG&A increased as a percent of revenue largely due to the decline
in sequential quarterly revenue starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001.

In response to the industry slowdown we implemented cost reduction measures such as reducing executive and
director compensation, headcount reductions and mandatory shutdown days during the second half of fiscal 2001.  We will continue to
implement additional cost reduction programs and proactively manage variable expenses to more closely align our cost structure with
forecasted future revenues.

Fiscal 2001 Restructuring Charges

In April 2001, we announced a plan to reduce global headcount up to 15% during the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2001 ("the Plan").  The reduction in force was driven by the anticipated decline in our short-term revenues due
to the significant contraction of the semiconductor equipment market from calendar year 2000 levels. During the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2001, the Plan was approved by the appropriate level of management necessary to commit us to the specific actions of the Plan.
We began implementing the announced restructuring plan and reduced our workforce by approximately 11% prior to June 24, 2001.  We
recorded a restructuring charge of $16.8 million which, in addition to severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees,
included charges for remaining lease payments and leasehold improvements on vacated facilities, and inventories of an etch product
line that will no longer be supported by the Company. In addition, we consolidated our Fremont manufacturing facilities and wrote-off
the carrying cost of abandoned facility assets.

Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the fiscal 2001 restructuring:

LEASE
                                 SEVERANCE   PAYMENTS  ABANDONED               OTHER

                                 ========== ========== ========== ========== ========== =========

Severance and Benefits relates to the salary and fringe benefit expense for involuntarily terminated
employees.  Prior to the date of the financial statements, management, with the proper level of authority, approved and committed us
to the plan of termination and determined the benefits the employees being terminated would receive and communicated the benefits
package to employees in enough detail that they could determine their type and amount of benefit. The termination of the impacted
employees occurred as soon as practical after the plan of restructuring was announced.   The Severance and Benefits reserve balance
of $4.2 million as of June 24, 2001 will be utilized by the end of March 2002.

Lease Payments on Vacated Facilities relates to the remainder of the lease term after the
abandonment of the facility currently under long-term operating lease agreements. We estimated, given the prevailing real estate
market conditions, that it would take approximately 24 months to sub-lease its vacated facilities in Fremont, California. When
applicable, anticipated future sublease income relating to vacated buildings has been offset against the charge for the remaining
lease payments.

We wrote-off all leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings of approximately $1.5 million,
as these items will have no future economic benefit and have been abandoned. In addition, certain demonstration equipment and etch
product line inventory were abandoned and written-off.

Other exit costs relate to customer accommodations for the discontinued product line and expenses associated
with a discontinued capital improvement project related to vacated facilities.

Purchased Technology for Research & Development

During the second quarter of fiscal 2001, we made an equity investment in, and purchased a portfolio of
CMP intellectual property rights and research and development technology from Strasbaugh.  We recognized a one-time charge to income
of $8.0 million for the purchase of in process research and development technology and recorded a $6.0 million investment in
preferred stock and intangible assets. Our equity interest in Strasbaugh, representing approximately 20% of Strasbaugh's total
capital stock, is accounted for under the equity method and the intellectual property rights are being amortized ratably over five
years.

Other Income, net

Other income, net, of $15.1 million in fiscal 2001 increased from $7.0 million in fiscal
2000, driven by the increase in interest income on a substantially larger average investment portfolio than the previous fiscal
year's.

Tax Expenses

For fiscal year 2001, we recorded income tax expense of  $60.5 million, which was 30.0% of income
before taxes.  For fiscal year 2000, we recorded an income tax expense of $32.1 million, which was 13.5% of income before taxes.  The
fiscal 2000 rate reflected the benefit of net operating losses and research and development tax credits carried over from prior
periods. At June 24, 2001, we had gross deferred tax assets arising from non-deductible temporary differences and tax credit
carryforwards of $244.1 million. A valuation allowance of $31.2 million and deferred tax liabilities of $35.6 million offset the
gross deferred tax assets. Realization of the majority of the net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future
taxable income.  We believe that it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized based on forecasted income.  However,
there can be no assurance that we will meet our expectations of future income.  We will evaluate the realizability of the deferred
tax assets quarterly and assess the need for additional valuation allowance.

Changes in Accounting Principles and Policies

Revenue Recognition.

We changed our revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001,
effective June 26, 2000, based on guidance provided in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 ("SAB 101"), "Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements." We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable, collectibility is reasonably assured, and we have
completed our system installation obligations and received customer acceptance, or are otherwise released from our installation or
customer acceptance obligations.  In the event terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we
recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period.  Revenue related to spare parts sales is generally recognized
on shipment.  Revenue related to services is generally recognized upon performance of the services requested by a customer order.
Revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a term more than one month are recognized on a prorated straight-line basis
over the term of the contract.

In accordance with guidance provided in SAB 101, we recorded a non-cash charge of $122.1 million (after a reduction for income
taxes of $81.4 million), or ($0.92) per diluted share, to
reflect the cumulative effect of the accounting change as of the beginning of the fiscal year ended June 24, 2001.

The deferred revenue balance as of June 26, 2000 was $433 million.  This amount is comprised of equipment that was
shipped but had not yet been accepted as of June 25, 2000.  Of this amount $401 million was recognized as revenue in fiscal 2001.
The unaudited pro forma amounts presented in the income statement were calculated assuming the accounting change was retroactively
applied to prior periods.

Prior to fiscal year 2001, our revenue recognition policy was to recognize revenue for equipment generally at
the time of shipment.

Investments in Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to Lam Research Corporation Stock:

In November
2000, the FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") reached final consensuses on EITF Issue No. 00-19, "Determination
of Whether Share Settlement is Within the Control of the Issuer" for purposes of applying EITF Issue No. 96-13, "Accounting
for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company's Own Stock" ("EITF 00-19" or
"the Consensus").  EITF 96-13 addresses accounting for equity derivative contracts indexed to, and potentially settled in,
a company's own stock ("equity derivatives") by providing guidance for distinguishing between permanent equity, temporary
equity and assets and liabilities. EITF 00-19 addresses and clarifies whether specific contract provisions or other circumstances
cause a net-share or physical settlement alternative to be within or outside the control of the issuer. Under EITF 00-19, equity
derivatives that were issued prior to September 20, 2000, and classified as permanent equity must meet certain criteria or be
re-classified as assets or liabilities.  The consensus is required to be applied on June 24, 2001 for our contracts still outstanding as
of that date through a cumulative effect adjustment approach.  To qualify as permanent equity all the following criteria must be met:
the equity derivative contract must permit the company to settle in unregistered shares, the company must have sufficient authorized
but unissued shares available to settle the contract, the contract must contain an explicit limit on the number of shares to be
delivered in a share settlement, there can be no requirement in the contract to post collateral, there can be no "make
whole" provisions in the contract and there can be no provisions in the contract that indicate the counterparty has rights that
rank higher than those of a common shareholder. Equity derivative contracts accounted for as permanent equity are recorded at their
initial fair value and subsequent changes in fair value are not recognized unless a change in the contracts classification occurs.
Equity derivative contracts not qualifying for permanent equity accounting are recorded at fair value as an asset or liability with
subsequent changes in fair value recognized through the statement of operations.

In accordance with EITF 00-19, as of June 24, 2001, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment for the change
in accounting principle to recognize the fair value of certain put and call options indexed to our own stock as an asset. The
cumulative effect adjustment, a gain of $33.1 million ($0.25 per diluted share), reflects the non-taxable increase in the fair value
of the derivative instruments since their inception to June 24, 2001.  The fair value of these equity derivatives, $33.1 million, is
recorded in Other Assets.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Derivative Instruments and Hedging.

On July 1, 2000, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133").  SFAS 133
requires us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.  Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to
fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the
derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings (fair
value hedges) or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings (cash flow hedges).  The
ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings.  The adoption of SFAS 133 did not
have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or operating results.

Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities

. In September 2000, the
FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140 ("FAS 140"), "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing
of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities -- a Replacement of FASB Statement No. 125".  FAS 140 revised the
criteria for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and collateral.  In addition, FAS 140 expands
related financial statement disclosures.  FAS 140 is effective for transfers of financial assets occurring after March 31, 2001.  The
adoption of FAS 140 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or operating results.

Business Combinations and Goodwill and other Intangible Assets.

In July 2001, the FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.141 ("FAS 141"), "Business Combinations" and
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.142 ("FAS 142"), "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets".  FAS 141 requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase
method.  Under FAS 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized, but are reviewed annually for
impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.  Separable intangible assets that have finite lives will continue to be
amortized over their useful lives.  The amortization provisions of FAS 142 apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to
July 1, 2001.  We are required to adopt FAS 142 effective July 1, 2002, but may adopt the new statement beginning July 1, 2001.  FAS
141 and FAS 142 are not expected to materially impact our consolidated financial position or operating results

.

Transition to Single European Currency

During fiscal 1999, we established a team to address issues raised by the introduction of the Single
European Currency ("Euro") for initial implementation as of January 1, 1999 and through the transition period to January 1,
2002.  We met all related legal requirements by January 1, 1999, and we expect to meet all legal requirements through the transition
period.  We do not expect the cost of any related system modifications to be material and do not currently expect that the
introduction and use of the Euro will materially affect our foreign exchange and hedging activities, or will result in any material
increase in transaction costs.  We will continue to evaluate the impact over time of the introduction of the Euro; however, based on
currently available information, our management does not believe that the introduction of the Euro had or will have a material
adverse impact on our financial condition or results of our operations.

Fiscal 2000 vs. 1999

Total Revenue

Our total revenue for the fiscal year ended June 25, 2000 was $1.2 billion ($1.0 billion on a pro forma
basis), 90% higher than prior fiscal year revenue of $648 million ($761 million on a pro forma basis). We experienced increased
revenue for all of our product lines due to the expansion of the semiconductor capital equipment industry in fiscal 2000.

The first nine months of fiscal 1999 were unfavorably impacted from the semiconductor industry slowdown driven
by depressed DRAM pricing, production over-capacity, as well as uncertainty in the worldwide financial markets. In the last quarter
of fiscal 1999, the global semiconductor equipment industry began to recover, which lead to increased sales and profitability.

Gross Margin

Our gross margin percentage increased to 44.0% for fiscal 2000, compared to 36.0% for fiscal 1999.  During
fiscal 2000, our gross margin percentage was favorably impacted by higher sales volume, the efficiencies of "lean"
manufacturing techniques, and continued material cost reductions compared to fiscal 1999.

Research and Development

R&D expenses for the fiscal year ended June 25, 2000, were $176.9 million, 24.1% higher than the prior
fiscal year. However, as a percentage of revenue, R&D expenses were 14.4% of total revenue for fiscal year 2000, compared to
22.0% of total revenue for the prior fiscal year. The decrease in R&D expenses as a percent of revenue was mainly due to the
significant increase in revenue in fiscal 2000.

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were 13.1% of total revenue in fiscal
2000, as compared to 22.5% of total revenue in fiscal 1999, but increased in absolute dollars from $145.7 million in fiscal 1999 to
$161.3 million in fiscal 2000.  SG&A expenses decreased as a percent of revenue mainly due to the significant increase in revenue
in fiscal 2000.

The increase in SG&A expenses was largely a result of higher sales and marketing expenses related to higher
sales volume and an overall increase in headcount. In addition, incentive payments to employees and management in fiscal 2000 were
greater than those paid in fiscal 1999.

Restructuring Charges and Recoveries

During the second quarter of fiscal 1999 and as a result of economic contraction in the semiconductor
industry, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $53.4 million, relating to severance compensation and benefits for
involuntarily terminated employees worldwide (representing approximately 15% of the global workforce), lease payments on abandoned
facilities, the write-off of related leasehold improvements and fixed assets and returned equipment credits issued to certain
customers.

Beginning in late fiscal 1999, there were indications of a recovery in the semiconductor industry.  On a
global basis, semiconductor makers began adding new capacity to address an increase in the demand for integrated circuits.  In
addition to new capacity, the semiconductor industry accelerated a migration to new materials such as copper and the new interconnect
processes required to implement them.  In early calendar year 2000, we concluded that the upturn would be sustainable and that it was
likely to continue through the end of the calendar year.

During fiscal 2000, we completed the remaining elements of our prior restructuring activities in accordance with
established and announced plans.  As a result of the stronger than anticipated recovery of the semiconductor capital equipment
market, we were able to recover approximately $35.9 million of the restructuring charges recorded in prior periods. Of this amount,
$10.9 million was recovered due to lower severance and termination costs than we had planned for certain employees and executives as
well as guaranteed outplacement services and other exit costs not being utilized.  Another $9.5 million was recovered because we were
able to reoccupy or successfully sublease certain manufacturing and administrative facilities under long term operating leases.
Additionally, we determined it would utilize leasehold improvements of $5.8 million in certain manufacturing and administration
facilities under operating leases which have been reoccupied as a result of the stronger than anticipated rebound in business. We
also recovered $3.1 million through the sale of its previously abandoned and written-off facility in Korea. Another $4.4 million was
recovered due to customers not utilizing system return credits they had originally requested and which were issued as a result of our
decision to exit certain product lines. We also recovered approximately $1.4 million from the sale of previously written-off
inventory. In addition, approximately $0.8 million was recovered from the salvage of inventories previously segregated
and written-off due to requests from former customers to purchase certain piece parts.

At June 24, 2001, $1.8 million of prior years' restructuring charges remains in accrued liabilities, relating
primarily to executive severance and lease payments on abandoned equipment.  The reserve balance will be utilized to make scheduled
fixed cash payments through the remainder of the employee separation contracts and equipment lease contracts.

Purchased Technology for Research & Development

During the second quarter of fiscal 2000, we purchased intellectual property rights related to
the semiconductor equipment industry from Oliver Design, Inc ("Oliver").  We recognized an expense for the purchase of
research development technology of approximately $7.5 million and capitalized $1.5 million related to acquired patents, which are
being amortized ratably over their estimated useful life of five years. The technology is being used in a single discrete next
generation post-CMP wafer cleaning product development project and has no future alternative use.

In the third quarter of fiscal 1998, we purchased a non-exclusive license for Trikon
Technologies' M

Æ

RI

ä

source
technology. During fiscal 1999, $5.0 million in additional fees for the purchase of a
non-exclusive license for M

Æ

RI source technology became
payable (separate from royalties owed on shipments of M

Æ

RI
souce-based systems determined by rates prescribed in the license). This completed the purchase payments for this technology. The
technology was used in a single discrete etch product development project and has no future alternative use.

Other Income, Net

Other income, net, of $7.0 million in fiscal 2000 increased from
$0.3 million in fiscal 1999, largely due to greater foreign exchange currency gains on Japanese Yen-denominated receivables. Another
contributor to our higher other income was the increase in interest income as a result of a larger investment portfolio and a higher
rate of return on our investments than during the previous fiscal year, consistent with the higher interest rates prevailing in the
U.S. market.

Tax Expense

For fiscal year 2000, we recorded an income tax expense of  $32.1 million, which was 13.5% of
income before taxes. This rate reflects the benefit of net operating losses and research and development tax credits carried over
from prior periods. For fiscal year 1999, we did not record an income tax benefit on the loss before income taxes. No net tax benefit
was recorded in fiscal 1999 because it was offset by a valuation allowance against net operating loss carryforwards arising from the
net loss.  At June 25, 2000, we had gross deferred tax assets arising from non-deductible temporary differences and tax loss and tax
credit carryforwards of $202.5 million. The gross deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance of $94.7 million and
deferred tax liabilities of $19.0 million.

Functional Currency

The functional currency of our European, Japanese and Asia Pacific subsidiaries is the individual
subsidiary's local currency. Our subsidiaries primarily generate and expend cash in their local currency; billings and receipts for
their labor and services are primarily denominated in the local currency (workforce is paid in local currency); their individual
assets and liabilities are primarily denominated in the local foreign currency and do not materially impact our cash flows and there
is an active local sales market for the foreign subsidiaries' products and services. All balance sheet accounts of these local
functional currency subsidiaries are translated at the current exchange rate, and income statement accounts are translated at an
average rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as currency translation adjustments, which are a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of June 24, 2001, we had $925.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and
restricted cash compared with $432.1 million at June 25, 2000. Our $100.0 million syndicated bank line of credit, against which we
had no borrowings, expired in April 2001 and was not renewed.  At June 24, 2001, we were in compliance with all our financial and
other covenants.

During May 2001, we completed an offering of $300.0 million of 4% Convertible Subordinated Notes ("the 4%
Notes"), which mature on June 1, 2006. Interest on the 4% Notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing
December 1, 2001. The 4% Notes are convertible into shares of Lam Common Stock at any time prior to the close of business on the
maturity date, unless previously redeemed, at a conversion price of $44.93 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The 4% Notes
are redeemable, in whole or in part, at our option beginning on June 5, 2004 with at least 20 days and no more than 60 days notice,
at redemption prices starting at 101.0% and at diminishing prices thereafter, plus accrued interest. The 4% Notes are unsecured and
subordinated in right of payment in full to all existing and future senior indebtedness, as defined, of the Company.  Expenses
associated with the offering of approximately $8.5 million have been deferred in other assets and are being amortized to other
expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 4% Notes.

In August 1997, we completed an offering of $310.0 million of 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes ("the 5%
Notes"), which mature on September 2, 2002.  Interest on the 5% Notes is payable on September 1 and March 1 of each year,
commencing March 1, 1998.  The 5% Notes are convertible into shares of Lam Common Stock at any time prior to the close of business on
the maturity date, unless previously redeemed, at a conversion price of $29.26 per share, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. The
5% Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at our option beginning on September 6, 2000 with at least 20 days notice, at
redemption prices starting at 102.0% and at diminishing prices thereafter, plus accrued interest, if the closing price of Lam Common
Stock is at least 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending
within five trading days prior to the notice of redemption.  The 5% Notes are unsecured and subordinated in right of payment in full
to all existing and future senior indebtedness, as defined, of the Company.  Expenses associated with the offering of approximately
$9.0 million were deferred in other assets and are being amortized to other expense using the effective interest method over the term
of the 5% Notes.

Additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, in order to fund our Japanese subsidiary operations,
we entered into a three-year Yen-denominated term loan for approximately ¥6.0 billion ($49.3 million at June 24, 2001) with
syndicated financial institutions.  This credit facility replaces borrowings of ¥1.7 billion under a separate credit facility which were
held with other financial institutions and which were repaid in June 2001. The entire principal amount under the new term loan is due
at maturity, June 11, 2004, and has a floating interest rate, which at year end was 1.8% per annum. The new facility reflects terms
that were more favorable than the previous Yen-denominated loan.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $261.3 million in fiscal 2001. This amount consisted of net
income of $52.1 million, non-cash adjustments from the cumulative net effect of changes in accounting principles totaling $89.0
million, and non-cash charges of $76.0 million for depreciation and amortization, restructuring and other, offset by net uses of
working capital of $5.2 million, net of a tax benefit of $49.4 million related to tax deductions received for stock option exercises.
Focus in accelerating collections and sales of accounts receivable resulted in a decline in accounts receivable of $68.6 million, but
were offset by increases in inventories of $73.1 million. The increase in inventories resulted from significant levels of customer
push-outs and order cancellations within manufacturing lead times during the second half of fiscal 2001.

Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2001 was $427.5 million. Net purchases of short-term
investments used $341.2 million.  Net capital expenditures were $64.4 million and cash totaling $14.0 million was used for strategic
technology investments.

Net cash flows provided by financing activities during fiscal 2001 were $321.9 million
due primarily from net proceeds of $292.0 million from our 4% Note offering in June 2001, and $50.0 million in borrowings from the
Yen-denominated term loan.  During fiscal 2001 we made principal payments on long-term debt and capital lease obligations of $23.9
million. We also repurchased $45.1 million of common stock and reissued $24.5 million of our treasury stock through our employee
option and stock purchase programs. Net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock generated $6.7 million. We plan to use the net
proceeds from our debt offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2001, we entered into a five-year operating lease agreement relating to
certain buildings at our Fremont, California campus.  As part of the agreement, we are required to provide a guaranteed residual
value of $27.5 million to the lessor at the end of the lease term.

In fiscal 1999, we entered into certain option transactions with independent third parties (the "third
parties") for the purchase and sale of our Common Stock. Our Board of Directors authorized us to acquire from the third parties
options to purchase up to 10.5 million shares of our Common Stock. These call options are to be acquired to offset the anticipated
dilutive effect of a potential conversion into Common Stock of the 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes previously issued by us, and due
September 2, 2002.  As part of the program, the Board of Directors also authorized us to enter into put options with the same third
parties covering up to 15.75 million shares of our Common Stock. We anticipated that the premiums we would receive over the course of
the program from the sale of the put options to the third parties would offset in full the premium cost of our purchase of the call
options from those same third parties. Consequently, we do not expect to exchange cash over the course of the program with the third
parties in conjunction with our purchase of the call options.

Pursuant to the authorization described above, we have, as of June 24, 2001, acquired call options to purchase
3.72 million shares of our Common Stock; the weighted average exercise price of these options is $11.29. The call options provide
that our maximum benefit at expiration is $17.97 per option share (the difference between $29.26, which is the conversion price of
the 5% Notes issued in August 1997, and the weighted average exercise price of the call options). We have also entered into put
option contracts with the same third parties covering 5.58 million shares of our Common Stock, giving those third parties the right
to sell to us shares of our Common Stock at a weighted average price of $9.48 per share.

The call and put options are European style options exercisable upon expiration; all of the options expire no
later than September 3, 2002, which is the business day following the date on which the 5% Notes must either be converted or retired.
Upon option exercise, we have the ability, at our option, to permit the options to be physically settled (i.e., shares would be
delivered to us against payment of the exercise price), settled in cash (i.e., by a payment from one party to the other of the value
of the option being exercised) or "net settled" in shares (i.e., by delivery of a number of shares of common stock having a
value equal to the value of the option being exercised).  Certain scenarios may require that we deliver cash to the counter-party to
achieve full settlement under the terms of the instruments. We can also terminate the options prior to expiration for a settlement
value determined from time to time by the appropriate third party. While the options are only exercisable at expiration, the terms of
the contracts with the third parties provide for early termination and settlement of the options upon the occurrence of certain
events (in a form determined by us which includes net settlement of shares), including without limitation our material breach of the
agreement, default on certain indebtedness or covenants relating to our financial condition, reduction in our S&P credit rating
below B or a drop in the price of our Common Stock to less than $1.67 per share.

We account for these derivative financial instruments, indexed and potentially settled in our stock, under the
provisions of EITF 00-19.  At June 24, 2001, the instruments had a net fair value of $33.1 million in our favor and are included in
"Other Assets".

If the average stock price is below $9.48 during any period, the required number of shares to net settle the
Company's obligation under the put option agreement would be considered dilutive securities in our dilutive earnings per share
("EPS") calculation.

Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintenance of sufficient
liquidity reserves is important to ensure our ability to maintain levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure through
ensuing business cycles. Based upon our current business outlook, our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at
June 24, 2001, combined with proactive cost reduction activities, are expected to be sufficient to support our currently
anticipated levels of operations and capital expenditures through at least December 2002.

Risk Factors

Our Quarterly Revenues and Operating Results are Unpredictable

Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of
factors, not all of which are in our control.  These factors include, but are not limited to:

economic conditions in the semiconductor industry generally, and the equipment industry specifically;

customer capacity requirements;

customer acceptances of equipment;

the size and timing of orders from customers;

customer cancellations or delays in our shipments and/or installations;

our ability in a timely manner to develop, introduce and market new, enhanced and competitive products;

our competitors' introduction of new products;

legal or technical challenges to our products and technology;

new or modified accounting regulations;

changes in average selling prices and product mix;

changes in import/export regulations; and

exchange rate fluctuations.

We manage our expense levels in part on our expectations of future revenues.  If revenue
levels in a particular quarter do not meet our expectations, our operating results may be  adversely affected.

We derive our revenue primarily from the sale of a relatively small number of high-priced systems.  Our
systems can range in price from approximately $400,000 to $4 million per unit.  Our operating results for a quarter may suffer
substantially if:

we sell fewer systems than we anticipate in any quarter;

we do not receive anticipated orders in time to enable shipment and acceptance of equipment during a given
quarter;

one or more customers delay or cancel anticipated shipments and/or installations;

shipments are delayed by procurement shortages or manufacturing difficulties or;

our customers delay final acceptance of our shipments due to delays in their evaluation of our
systems.

Further, because most of our manufacturing operations and capacity is located at our Fremont, California
facility, natural, physical, logistical or other events or disruptions affecting this facility (including labor disruptions) could
adversely impact our financial performance.

Variations in the Amount of Time it Takes for Our Customers to Accept Our Systems May Cause Fluctuation in
Our Operating Results

In December 1999 the Securities and Exchange Commission issued SAB No. 101 "Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements."  SAB 101 provides guidance on the recognition of revenue for sales that involve contractual customer
acceptance provisions and product installation commitments. Based on the guidance provided by SAB 101, we changed our revenue
recognition policy for equipment sales effective June 26, 2000. Prior to SAB 101, the Company generally recognized systems revenue on
the date the equipment was shipped to customers. Under SAB 101, the Company now recognizes revenue on the date of customer acceptance
or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse.  As a result, the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize
systems revenues is subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after
shipment and installation, which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate.

The Semiconductor Equipment Industry is Volatile; and the Industry is Currently Experiencing Reduced Product
Demand which is Expected to have a Negative Impact on Shipments and Equipment Acceptance Cycle Time

Our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn
depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products using integrated circuits.  The
semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and historically experiences periodic downturns.  During the past three years the
semiconductor industry has experienced severe swings of product demand and volatility in product pricing.  In early fiscal 1998 and
fiscal 1999, the semiconductor industry reduced or delayed significantly purchases of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and
construction of new fabrication facilities because of an industry downturn. However, beginning in late fiscal 1999, we experienced a
recovery in demand for our products, which drove sales growth throughout fiscal 2000 and early fiscal 2001.  In the second half of
the December 2000 quarter, we began to see signs that this upturn was slowing and that customers were likely to reduce equipment
purchases during the first half of calendar year 2001.  These signs were confirmed in the March 2001 quarter as semiconductor
manufacturers canceled or delayed many orders as a result of overcapacity.  These order reductions are expected to have a negative
impact on the level of system shipments and the cycle time of acceptances in at least the first half of fiscal 2002 and potentially
beyond.

Fluctuating levels of investment by the semiconductor manufacturers and pricing volatility will continue to
materially affect our aggregate bookings, revenues and operating results.  Even during periods of reduced revenues, we must continue
to invest in research and development and to maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain
competitive, which may temporarily harm our financial results

We Depend on New Products and Processes for Our Success.  For this Reason, We are Subject to Risks Associated
with Rapid Technological Change

Rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to
develop technological advances enabling such processes.  We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to
develop, manufacture, and successfully introduce new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing
products.  Due to the risks inherent in transitioning to new products, we must accurately forecast demand for new products while
managing the transition from older products.  If new products have reliability or quality problems our performance may be impacted by
reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty
expenses.  We may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully, or new products that we introduce may fail in the
marketplace, which would materially and adversely affect our results from operations.

We expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and to pursue joint
development relationships with customers or other members of the industry.  We must manage product transitions and joint development
relationships successfully, as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products.  Future
technologies, processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, or we may be unable in a timely
manner to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products which satisfy customer needs or achieve market
acceptance. In addition, in connection with the development of new products, we will invest in pilot production inventory.  Our
failure, to complete commercialization of these new products in a timely manner could result in inventory obsolescence, which would
adversely affect our financial results.

We are Subject to Risks Associated with the Introduction of New Products

We expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future competitors. We believe that
other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and are planning to introduce new products to this
market, which may affect our ability to sell our new products. Furthermore, new products represent significant investments of our
resources and their success, or lack thereof, could have a material effect on our financial results.

We are Subject to Risks Relating to Product Concentration and Lack of Product Revenue Diversification

We derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products, and we expect these
products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term.  Continued market acceptance of our primary
products is, therefore, critical to our future success.  Our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could
therefore be adversely affected by:

a decline in demand for our products;

a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our products;

an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the market we participate in;

technological change that we are unable to address with our products; and

a failure to release new enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis.

We are Dependent Upon a Limited Number of Key Suppliers

We obtain certain components and sub-assemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a
limited group of suppliers. Each of our key suppliers has a one-year blanket purchase contract under which we may issue purchase
orders. We may renew these contracts periodically.  Each of these suppliers sold us products during at least the last four years, and
we expect that we will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we will otherwise replace them with competent
alternative source suppliers. Nevertheless, a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could adversely affect our operating
results and result in damage to our customer relationships.

Once a Semiconductor Manufacturer Commits to Purchase a Competitor's Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment, the
Manufacturer Typically Continues to Purchase that Competitor's Equipment, Making it More Difficult for Us to Sell our Equipment to
that

Customer

Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate capital processing
equipment into a semiconductor production line.  We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier's
processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application.
Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor's
equipment.  We believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products,
to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process research and development.

We May Lack the Financial Resources or Technological Capabilities of Certain of Our Competitors Needed to
Capture Increased Market Share

Certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering,
manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore are increasingly dominating the
semiconductor equipment industry. In addition, there are smaller, emerging semiconductor equipment companies that may provide
innovative technology that may have performance advantages over systems we currently, or expect to, offer.

We anticipate our competitors will continue to improve the design and performance of their current products
and processes and to introduce new products and processes with enhanced performance characteristics.  If our competitors enter into
strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, it could
adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers.  In addition, competitors with higher levels of financial
resources than we have may continue to deeply discount products similar to those we sell.  For these reasons, we may fail to continue
to compete successfully worldwide.

Our present or future competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or
that adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements.  In particular, while we currently are developing
additional product enhancements that we believe will address customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the
development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve
market acceptance or be competitive.   Accordingly, we may be unable to continue to compete effectively in our markets, competition
may intensify or future competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial condition, and
cash flows.

Our Future Success Depends on International Sales

International sales accounted for approximately 70% of our total revenue in fiscal 2001, 71% in fiscal
2000 and 54% in fiscal 1999.  We expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total
revenue in future years.  International sales are subject to risks, including, but not limited to:

foreign exchange risks;

changing import/export requirements;

foreign trade disputes; and

economic, political, banking and currency problems in the relevant region.

We currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of exchange rate
fluctuations on Yen-denominated sales and assets, and will continue to enter into hedging transactions for the foreseeable
future.

A Failure to Comply with Environmental Regulations May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results

We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic,
volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals.  We believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have
obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise addressing) all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business. These permits
generally relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes.  Nevertheless, the failure to comply with present or future regulations could
result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers' acceptance
of our products.  These regulations could require us to alter our current operations, to acquire significant equipment or to incur
substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations.  Our failure to control the use, sale, transport or disposal of
hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities.

Our Ability to Manage Potential Growth or Decline; Integration of Potential Acquisitions and Potential
Disposition of Product Lines and Technologies Creates Risks for Us

Currently, the semiconductor equipment industry is experiencing a severe decrease in demand for its
products, which challenges our management to reduce spending on operating activities.  Alternatively, if we experience rapid growth
in the future we may face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes,
information systems and procedures on a timely basis, and expanding, training, and managing our work force.  There can be no
assurance that we will be able to perform such actions successfully.  In the future, we may make acquisitions of complementary
companies, products or technologies, or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies, which no longer fit our
long-term strategy.   Managing an acquired business, disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entails numerous
operational and financial risks, including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing
business or product groups, diversion of management's attention to other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible
assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations amongst others.  Our success will depend,
to a significant extent, on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond
to these challenges effectively.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such growth,
decline, integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of product lines or technologies, or reduction in personnel or that our
management, personnel or systems will be adequate to support continued operations.  Any such inabilities or inadequacies would have a
material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.

An important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our
existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, or enhance our technological capabilities.   We may acquire
additional businesses, products or technologies in the future.  Any acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive
issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of related intangible assets and
goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations and/or the price of our Common Stock.

The Market for Our Common Stock is Volatile, which May Affect our Ability to Raise Capital
or Make Acquisitions

The market price for our Common Stock is extremely volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past
years.  The trading price of our Common Stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to factors,
including but not limited to the following:

general market or semiconductor industry conditions;

global economic fluctuations;

variations in our quarterly operating results;

variations  in our revenues or earnings from levels securities analysts forecast;

announcements of restructurings, technological innovations, reductions in force, departure of key employees,
consolidations of operations or introduction of new products;

government regulations;

developments in or claims relating to patent or other proprietary rights;

disruptions with key customers; or

political, economic or environmental events occurring globally or in our key sales regions.

In addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations.  Recent volatility in the
price of our Common Stock was tied in part to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for
semiconductors.  These broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual
operating performance.  In the past, following volatile periods in the price of stock, many companies become the object of securities
class action litigation.  If we are sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs and it could divert
management's attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on the price for our Common Stock.

Risk Associated with Our Call and Put Options

We have entered into third party option transactions for the purchase and sale of our stock.  The option
positions will be of value to us if our stock price exceeds the exercise price of the call options at the time the options are
exercised.  Conversely, our stock price could also decline. If our stock price on the exercise date of the options were below the put
option exercise price, we would have to settle the put obligation by paying cash or the equivalent value in Common Stock.

If settlement were to occur prior to option expiration because of the occurrence of an event giving the third
parties the right to terminate the transactions, we will be required both to pay to the third parties the value of their position
(which would depend on a number of factors, including the time remaining to expiration and the volatility of Lam Common Stock) which
could be greater or lesser than the difference between the options' exercise prices and the then market price of Lam Common Stock, as
well as any costs or expenses incurred by the third parties as a result of unwinding the transactions.

The Potential Anti-Takeover Effects of Our Bylaws Provisions and the Rights Plan We have in Place May Affect
Our Stock Price and Inhibit a Change of Control Desired by Some of Our Stockholders

In 1997, we adopted a Rights Plan (the "Rights Plan") in which rights were distributed as a
dividend at the rate of one right for each share of our Common Stock, held by stockholders of record as of the close of business on
January 31, 1997, and thereafter.  In connection with the adoption of the Rights Plan, our Board of Directors also adopted a number
of amendments to our Bylaws, including amendments requiring advance notice of stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder
proposals.

Our Rights Plan may have certain anti-takeover effects.  Our Rights Plan will cause substantial dilution to a
person or group that attempts to acquire Lam in certain circumstances.  Accordingly, the existence of the Rights Plan and the
issuance of the related rights may deter certain acquirers from making takeover proposals or tender offers.  The Rights Plan,
however, is not intended to prevent a takeover. Rather it is designed to enhance the ability of our Board of Directors to negotiate
with a potential acquirer on behalf of all of our stockholders.

In addition, our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes issuance of 5,000,000 shares of undesignated
Preferred Stock.  Our Board of Directors, without further stockholder approval, may issue this Preferred Stock on such terms as the
Board of Directors may determine, which also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Lam.  The
issuance of Preferred Stock could also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our Common Stock, including causing the
loss of voting control.  Our Bylaws and indemnity agreements with certain officers, directors and key employees provide that we will
indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to Lam.
Moreover, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law restricts certain business combinations with "interested
stockholders", as defined by that statute.

Intellectual Property and Other Claims Against Us Can Be Costly and Could Result in the Loss of Significant
Rights which are Necessary to Our Continued Business and Profitability

Other parties may assert infringement, unfair competition or other claims against us.  Additionally, from
time to time, other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights.
In such cases, it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses on commercially reasonable terms.  However, we
may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and any litigation resulting
from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results.

In October 1993, Varian Associates, Inc. sued us in the United States District Court for the Northern District
of California, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based on our alleged infringement of certain patents Varian held.  We
asserted defenses that the subject patents are invalid and unenforceable, and that our products do not infringe these patents.
Litigation is inherently uncertain and we may fail to prevail in this litigation.  However, we believe that the Varian lawsuit will
not materially adversely affect our operating results or financial position.  See Part I Item 3 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of
the Varian lawsuit.

Additionally, in September 1999, Tegal Corporation sued us in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Virginia, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based on our alleged infringement of certain patents Tegal
holds.  Specifically, Tegal identified our 4520XLe and Exelan products as infringing the patents Tegal is asserting. Litigation is
inherently uncertain and we may fail to prevail in this litigation.  However, we believe that the Tegal lawsuit will not materially
adversely affect our operating results or financial position.  See Part I Item 3 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the Tegal
lawsuit.

We May Fail to Protect Our Proprietary Technology Rights, which Would Affect Our Business

Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology.  While we attempt to protect our proprietary
technology through patents, copyrights and trade secret protection, we believe that our success also depends on increasing our
technological expertise, continuing our development of new systems, increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base,
and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers.  However, we may be unable to protect our technology in all
instances, or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology independently.  We currently hold a number of United
States and foreign patents and pending patent applications.  However, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or
circumvent any patents the United States or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue pending
applications.  In addition, the rights granted or anticipated under any of these patents or pending patent applications may be
narrower than we expect or in fact provide no competitive advantages.

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate
primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt obligations. We maintain a strict investment policy, which focuses on the
safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, and reinvestment risk. The table below presents

We mitigate default risk by targeting investments in high credit quality securities and by constantly
positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or
guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity
and maintain a prudent amount of diversification.

We have no cash flow exposure related to our fixed rate $309.8 million and $300.0 million Convertible Subordinated
Notes, or on our current capital lease obligations. However, we do have cash flow exposures on the interest expense related to our
new ¥6.0 billion Japanese Yen-denominated bank term loan because the lending rates we receive under that term loan vary with TIBOR.
At April 13, 2001, our $100.0 million line of credit expired and was not replaced.

We conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As
such, we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. For this reason, we
enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the value of our
Yen-denominated assets. We recognize realized and unrealized gains and losses through income on these contracts and offset them against
realized and unrealized gains and losses from the related Yen-denominated receivables. In addition, we periodically hedge anticipated
transactions with foreign currency forward contracts. We defer the gains and losses on these contracts and recognize them in income
during the same period as the hedged transaction. At June 24, 2001, the notional amount of outstanding foreign currency exchange
contracts was $47.0 million. The unrealized gain on the contracts at June 24, 2001, was $4.8 million.  An appreciation in the
exchange rate of the Yen from inception of the contracts of approximately 15% would result in an unrealized loss of $8.3 million. A
depreciation in the exchange rate of the Yen of approximately 15% would result in an unrealized gain of $6.1 million.

During fiscal 1999, we entered into third party option transactions for the purchase and sale of our Common Stock,
in order to offset the dilutive effect of a potential conversion into Common Stock of the $309.8 million 5% Convertible Subordinated
Notes which are due September 2, 2002.  As of June 24, 2001, we have acquired call options to purchase 3.72 million shares of our
Common Stock. The weighted average exercise price of these options is $11.29. The call options provide that our maximum benefit at
expiration is $17.97 per option share (the difference between $29.26, which is the conversion price of the Notes, and the weighted
average exercise price of the call options). We have also entered into put option contracts with the same third parties covering 5.58
million shares of our Common Stock, giving those third parties the right to sell to us shares of our Common Stock at a weighted
average price of $9.48 per share.

Below is a table showing, at assumed exercise prices for the put and call options and market prices for our Common
Stock, our anticipated gain or (loss) under the put and call options upon exercise or upon maturity of the options transaction.

In November 2000, the FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force reached final consensuses on the rules for accounting
for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a company's own stock.  In accordance with the provisions
of EITF 00-19 we recorded the fair value of our put and call options as a long-term asset on the Balance Sheet at fiscal 2000 year
end.  Their value as of June 24, 2001 was $33.1 million, which is recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment in the fourth quarter
fiscal 2001 Statement of Operations. For future quarters, the value of these derivatives will be re-calculated based on their market
value at quarter end and the change in value will be reported as a gain or loss in Other Income and Expense.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JUNE 24, 2001

Note A: Company and Industry Information

Lam Research Corporation ("the Company") is a supplier of technically complex thin film
selective removal equipment used at the front-end of semiconductor manufacturing. The Company's product offerings include single
wafer plasma etch systems with a wide range of applications, Chemical Mechanical Planarization ("CMP") and post-CMP wafer
cleaning systems. The Company sells its products primarily to companies involved in the production of semiconductors in the United
States, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific. Credit evaluations are performed on all customers, and the Company does not usually require
collateral on sales.

The semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical and has experienced periodic downturns, which have
had a material adverse effect on the semiconductor industry's demand for wafer processing equipment, including equipment manufactured
and marketed by the Company. Certain of the components and subassemblies included in the Company's products are obtained from a
single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. The Company believes that alternative sources could be obtained and qualified to
supply these products. Nevertheless, a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could have a severe near-term effect on the
Company's operating results and could result in damage to customer relationships.

Note B: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Effective fiscal year 2000, the Company changed its reporting period to a 52/53-week fiscal year. The
Company's fiscal year end will fall on the last Sunday of June each year.  The Company's current fiscal year ended on June 24, 2001
and included 52 weeks. The Company's next fiscal year ending June 30, 2002 will include 53 weeks.  Adoption of the change in fiscal
year did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Cash Equivalents:

All highly-liquid investments purchased with an original
maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.

Accounting Changes - Revenue Recognition:

The Company changed its revenue recognition policy in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, effective June 26, 2000, based on guidance provided in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101
("SAB 101"), "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements."  The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable,
collectibility is reasonably assured, and the Company has completed its system installation obligations and received customer
acceptance, or is otherwise released from its installation or customer acceptance obligations.  In the event terms of the sale
provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, the Company recognizes revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance
period.  Revenue related to spare parts sales is generally recognized on shipment.  Revenue related to services is generally
recognized upon performance of the services requested by a customer order.  Revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a
term more than one month are recognized on a prorated straight-line basis over the term of the contract.

In accordance with guidance provided in SAB 101, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $122.1 million (after a
reduction for income taxes of $81.4 million), or ($0.92) per diluted share, to reflect the cumulative effect of the accounting change
as of the beginning of the fiscal year ended June 24, 2001.

The deferred revenue balance as of June 26, 2000 was $433 million. This amount is comprised of equipment that was
shipped but had not yet been accepted as of June 25, 2000.  Of this amount $401 million was recognized as revenue in fiscal 2001.
The unaudited pro forma amounts presented in the income statement were calculated assuming the accounting change was retroactively
applied to prior periods.

Prior to fiscal year 2001, the Company's revenue recognition policy was to recognize revenue for equipment
generally at the time of shipment.

Accounting Changes - Investments in Derivative Financial Instruments
Indexed to Lam Research Corporation  Stock:

In November 2000, the FASB's Emerging Issues
Task Force ("EITF") reached final consensuses on EITF Issue No. 00-19,
"Determination of Whether Share Settlement is Within the Control of the Issuer" for
purposes of applying EITF Issue No.  96-13, "Accounting for Derivative Financial
Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company's Own Stock"  ("EITF
00-19" or "the Consensus").  EITF 96-13 addresses accounting for equity derivative contracts indexed to,
and potentially settled in, a company's own stock ("equity derivatives") by providing guidance for distinguishing between
permanent equity, temporary equity and assets and liabilities. EITF 00-19 addresses and clarifies whether specific contract
provisions or other circumstances cause a net-share or physical settlement alternative to be within or outside the control of the
issuer. Under EITF 00-19, equity derivatives that were issued prior to September 20, 2000, and classified as permanent equity must
meet certain criteria or be re-classified as assets or liabilities.  The consensus is required to be applied on June 24, 2001 for our
contracts still outstanding as of that date through a cumulative effect adjustment approach.  To qualify as permanent equity all the
following criteria must be met: the equity derivative contract must permit the company to settle in unregistered shares, the company
must have sufficient authorized but unissued shares available to settle the contract, the contract must contain an explicit limit on
the number of shares to be delivered in a share settlement, there can be no requirement in the contract to post collateral, there can
be no "make whole" provisions in the contract and there can be no provisions in the contract that indicate the counterparty
has rights that rank higher than those of a common shareholder. Equity derivative contracts accounted for as permanent equity are
recorded at their initial fair value and subsequent changes in fair value are not recognized unless a change in the contracts
classification occurs. Equity derivative contracts not qualifying for permanent equity accounting are recorded at fair value as an
asset or liability with subsequent changes in fair value recognized through the statement of operations.

In accordance with EITF 00-19, as of June 24, 2001, the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment for
the change in accounting principle to recognize the fair value of certain put and call options indexed to its own stock as an asset.
The cumulative effect adjustment, a gain of $33.1 million ($0.25 per diluted share), reflects the non-taxable increase in the fair
value of the derivative instruments since their inception to June 24, 2001.  The fair value of these equity derivatives, $33.1
million, is recorded in Other Assets.

Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. The
Company evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory on a quarterly basis. The Company's policy is to assess
the valuation of all inventory, including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods and spare parts. Obsolete
inventory or inventory in excess of the Company's estimated usage for the next 12 to 24 months' requirements is written down to its
estimated market value, if less than its cost. Inherent in the estimates of market value are management's estimates related to the
Company's future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, obsolescence, possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of
potential excess inventory.

Property

and

Equipment:

Property and equipment is stated at cost. Equipment is
depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to seven years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized by the straight-line method over the shorter of the life of the related asset or the term of the
underlying lease. Amortization of equipment under capital leases is included with depreciation.

Foreign Currency:

The Company's functional currency of its European, Japanese and Asia Pacific
subsidiaries is the individual subsidiary's local currency. The Company's subsidiaries primarily generate and expend cash in their
local currency; billings and receipts for their labor and services are primarily denominated in the local currency (workforce is paid
in local currency); their individual assets and liabilities are primarily denominated in the local foreign currency and do not
materially impact the Company's cash flows and there is an active local sales market for the foreign subsidiaries' products and
services. All balance sheet accounts of these local functional currency subsidiaries are translated at the current exchange rate, and
income statement accounts are translated at an average rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as
currency translation adjustments, which are a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts:

The Company enters into foreign currency
forward contracts to minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the value of its cash flows from forecasted revenue
denominated in Japanese Yen and foreign currency denominated assets. Foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated and
qualifying as cash flow hedges are treated as hedges for accounting purposes.  The effective portion of the contracts' gains or
losses is recorded in other comprehensive income (a component of stockholders' equity) and subsequently recognized in earnings in the
same period the hedged revenue is recognized. Foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the
remeasurement of foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables recorded on Lam Research U.S. books are adjusted to fair value
through operations as a component of other income and expense and offset the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated
intercompany receivables. The Company does not use derivatives for trading purposes.

Employee Stock Plans

: The Company accounts for its stock option plans and its employee stock purchase plans
using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 "Accounting For Stock Issued
to Employees" ("APB 25") and makes pro forma footnote disclosures as though the fair value method under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, "Accounting For Stock-Based Compensation" ("FAS 123"), were followed.

Use of Estimates:

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications:

Certain amounts presented in the comparative financial statements for prior years have
been reclassified to conform to the 2001 presentation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

: On July 1, 2000, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("FAS 133").  FAS 133 requires
the Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.  Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to
fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the
derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings (fair
value hedges) or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings (cash flow hedges).  The
ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings.  The adoption of FAS 133 did not
have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or operating results.

In September 2000, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140 ("FAS 140"),
"Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities -- a Replacement of FASB
Statement No. 125".  FAS 140 revised the criteria for accounting for securitizations and other transfers of financial assets and
collateral.  In addition, FAS 140 expands related financial statement disclosures.  FAS 140 is effective for transfers of financial
assets occurring after March 31, 2001.  The adoption of FAS 140 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated
financial position or operating results.

In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 ("FAS
141"), "Business Combinations" and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 ("FAS
142"), "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets".  FAS 141 requires all business combinations initiated after June 30,
2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method.  Under FAS 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no
longer amortized, but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.  Separable intangible
assets that have finite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives.  The amortization provisions of FAS 142 apply to
goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to July 1, 2001.  The Company is required to adopt FAS 142 effective July 1, 2002. FAS
141 and FAS 142 are not expected to materially impact the Company's consolidated financial position or operating results.

auction rate preferreds is based upon par value, which approximated fair value due to the nature of the instruments. The fair value
of the Company's foreign currency forward contracts is estimated based upon the Yen exchange rate at June 24, 2001 and June 25, 2000,
respectively. The fair value of the Company's convertible subordinated notes and the Company's other long-term debt is estimated
based on the current rates offered to the Company for similar debt instruments with comparable terms and maturities.

At June 24, 2001 and June 25, 2000, the notional amount of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were
$46,987,000 and $175,982,000 respectively. Of the total outstanding contracts at June 24, 2001 and June 25, 2000, $15,706,000 and
$104,116,000, respectively, were to hedge Yen-denominated intercompany receivables, and $31,281,000 and $71,866,000, respectively,
were to hedge forecasted Yen-denominated revenues from Japanese sales.

The Company has an agreement with a bank to sell specific Japanese Yen-denominated receivables, subject to
recourse provisions. At June 24, 2001 and June 25, 2000,  $7,966,000 and $17,295,000 of these receivables sold to the bank,
respectively, remained uncollected, of which $7,966,000 and $6,994,000 at June 24, 2001 and June 25, 2000, respectively, were subject
to recourse provisions.

The Company has a similar agreement to sell specific U.S. Dollar-denominated receivables, subject to recourse
provisions to two financial institutions. At June 24, 2001 and June 25, 2000, $44,580,000 and $47,640,000 of these receivables,
respectively, remained uncollected, of which $4,912,000 and $4,743,000 at June 24, 2001 and June 25, 2000, respectively, were subject
to recourse provisions.

Note D: Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging

On July 1, 2000, the Company adopted FAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities", as discussed in Note B.  FAS 133 requires the Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair
value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income.

In most countries, system sales are generally transacted in U.S. dollars while the sales of spare parts and
services are generally conducted in the local country's currency.  In Japan, the Company generally sells its systems and spare parts
in Japanese Yen. Therefore, in the normal course of business, the Company's financial position is routinely subjected to market risk
associated with foreign currency rate fluctuations.

The Company's policy is to minimize short-term business exposure to foreign exchange risks using the most
effective and efficient methods to eliminate or reduce such exposures.  The Company generally enters into foreign currency forward
contracts to minimize the impact of the exchange rate fluctuations on the value of its forecasted Yen-denominated cash flows
resulting from sales by the Company's Japanese subsidiary to third-party customers and foreign currency denominated intercompany
receivables.

To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted Yen-denominated cash flows resulting from sales by the
Company's Japanese subsidiary to third-party customers, the Company has instituted a foreign currency cash flow hedging program.  The
Company purchases foreign currency forward contracts generally expiring within 12 months, and no later than 24 months, to hedge
portions of its forecasted revenue denominated in Japanese Yen.  These foreign currency forward exchange contracts, designated as
cash flow hedges, are carried on the Company's balance sheet at fair value with the effective portion of the contracts' gains or
losses recorded in other comprehensive income (a component of stockholders' equity) and subsequently recognized in earnings in the
same period the hedged revenue is recognized. The Company does not use derivatives for trading purposes.

Effectiveness tests for foreign currency forward contracts entered into prior to October 2000, compare the
foreign currency spot rate at inception to the current market spot rate.  Subsequent hedges are tested for effectiveness by comparing
the foreign currency forward rates at inception to the current market forward rate. The change reflects the Company's conclusion that
under FAS 133 hedge effectiveness would not be substantively impacted by including time value in hedge effectiveness testing.  For
the 12-month period ended June 24, 2001, the Company recognized a net gain of  $3,276,000 related to the time value excluded from the
assessment of hedge effectiveness.

At June 24, 2001, the Company expects to reclassify the amount accumulated in other comprehensive income to
earnings during the next 12 months due to the recognition in earnings of the hedged forecasted transactions. If a cash flow hedge
should be discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur, the net gain or loss in
accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings as a component of other income and expense.  No such
amounts were recorded in earnings during the 12-month period ended June 24, 2001.

The following table summarizes activity in other comprehensive income related to derivatives classified as
cash flow hedges held by the Company during fiscal year 2001.

At June 24, 2001, $436,000 of the beginning cumulative transition gain has been reclassified into
earnings.

Additionally, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses
generated by the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables recorded on Lam Research U.S. books. These
derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore, the change in fair value of these derivatives are adjusted to fair
value through income as a component of other income and expense and offset the change in fair value of the foreign currency
denominated intercompany receivables.

During May 2001, the Company completed an offering of $300.0 million of Convertible Subordinated Notes
("the 4% Notes"), which mature on June 1, 2006.  Interest on the 4% Notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year,
commencing December 1, 2001. The 4% Notes are convertible into shares of Lam Common Stock at any time prior to the close of business
on the maturity date, unless previously redeemed, at a conversion price of $44.93 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The 4%
Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company beginning on June 5, 2004 with at least 20 days and no more
than 60 days notice, at redemption prices starting at 101.0% and at diminishing prices thereafter, plus accrued interest. The 4%
Notes are unsecured and subordinated in right of payment in full to all existing and future senior indebtedness, as defined, of the
Company.  Expenses associated with the offering of approximately $8.5 million have been deferred in other assets and are being
amortized to other expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 4% Notes.

In August 1997, the Company completed an offering of $310.0 million of 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes
("the 5% Notes"), which mature on September 2, 2002.  Interest on the 5% Notes is payable on September 1 and March 1 of
each year, commencing March 1, 1998.  The 5% Notes are convertible into shares of Lam Common Stock at any time prior to the close of
business on the maturity date, unless previously redeemed, at a conversion price of $29.26 per share, subject to anti-dilution
adjustments. The 5% Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company beginning on September 6, 2000 with at
least 20 days notice, at redemption prices starting at 102.0% and at diminishing prices thereafter, plus accrued interest, if the
closing price of Lam Common Stock is at least 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30
consecutive trading days ending within five trading days prior to the notice of redemption.  The 5% Notes are unsecured and
subordinated in right of payment in full to all existing and future senior indebtedness, as defined, of the Company.  Expenses
associated with the offering of approximately $9.0 million were deferred in other assets and are being amortized to other expense
using the effective interest method over the term of the 5% Notes.

Additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, in order to fund our Japanese subsidiary operations, the
Company entered into a three-year Yen-denominated term loan for approximately ¥6.0 billion ($49.3 million at June 24, 2001) with
syndicated financial institutions.  This credit facility replaces borrowings of ¥1.7 billion under a separate credit facility which were
held with other financial institutions and which were repaid in June 2001. The entire principal amount under the new term loan is due
at maturity, June 11, 2004, and has a floating interest rate, which at year end was 1.8% per annum. The new facility reflects terms
that were more favorable than the previous Yen-denominated loan.

The Board of Directors of the Company has authorized the Company to acquire from independent third parties
(the "third parties") options to purchase up to 10.5 million shares of Lam common stock.  These call options are to be
acquired to offset the anticipated dilutive effect of a potential conversion into common stock of the 5% Notes  issued by the Company
in August 1997 and due September 2, 2002.  As part of the program, the Board of Directors also authorized the Company to enter into
put options with the same third parties covering up to 15.75 million shares of Lam Common Stock. The Board of Directors anticipated
that the premiums the Company would receive over the course of the program from the sale of the put options to the third parties
would offset in full the premium cost to the Company of its purchase of the call options from those same third parties.
Consequently, the Company does not expect to exchange cash over the course of the program with the third parties in conjunction with
the Company's purchase of the call options.

Pursuant to the authorization described above, the Company has as of June 24, 2001, acquired call options to
purchase 3.72 million shares of Lam Common Stock; the weighted average exercise price of these options is $11.29.  The call options
provide that the maximum benefit to the Company of the call options at expiration is $17.97 per option share (the difference between
$29.26, which is the conversion price of the debentures, and the weighted average exercise price of the call options).  The Company
has also entered into put option contracts with the same third parties covering 5.58 million shares of its common stock, giving those
third parties the right to sell to the Company shares of Lam Common Stock at a weighted average price of $9.48 per share.

The call and put options are European style options exercisable upon expiration; all of the options expire no
later than September 3, 2002, which is the business day following the date on which the 5% Notes must either be converted or retired.
Upon option exercise, the Company has the ability, at its option, to permit the options to be physically settled (i.e., shares would
be delivered to the Company against payment of the exercise price), settled in cash (i.e., by a payment from one party to the other
of the value of the option being exercised) or "net settled" in shares (i.e., by delivery of a number of shares of common
stock having a value equal to the value of the option being exercised).  Certain scenarios may require the Company deliver cash to
the counter-party to achieve full settlement under the terms of the instruments.  The Company can also terminate the options prior to
expiration for a settlement value determined from time to time by the appropriate third party.  While the options are only
exercisable at expiration, the terms of the contracts with the third parties provide for early termination and settlement of the
options upon the occurrence of certain events (in a form determined by the Company which includes net settlement of shares),
including without limitation the Company's material breach of the agreement, default on certain indebtedness or covenants relating to
the Company's financial condition, reduction in the Company's S&P credit rating below B or a drop in the price of the Company's
Common Stock to less than $1.67 per share.

The Company accounts for these derivative financial instruments indexed and potentially settled in its own
stock, under the provisions of EITF 00-19.  At June 24, 2001, the instruments had a net fair value of $33.1 million in favor of the
Company and are included in "Other Assets".

If the average stock price is below $9.48 during any period, the required number of shares to net settle the
Company's obligation under the put option agreement would be considered dilutive securities in the Company's dilutive earnings per
share calculation.

As of June 24, 2001, the Company has deposited $9.4 million as security for its obligations under the put options.
The Company is required to increase this amount if the Company enters into additional option transactions with the third parties.
The Company will also have to increase the amount of this security deposit by the amount from time to time that the put options are
actually in the money.

A $100.0 million syndicated bank line of credit, against which the Company had no borrowings, was allowed to
expire in April 2001.

At June 24, 2001, future maturities of long-term debt and minimum payments for capital lease obligations are as

Note I: Stockholders' Equity

During fiscal 2001, the Company repurchased 2,405,000 shares of Lam Common Stock for $45.1 million
under a share acquisition program approved by the Board of Directors on September 30, 1998, authorizing management to acquire up to
6,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock.  During fiscal 2000, the Company repurchased 1,049,000 shares of Lam Common Stock for
$31.6 million.  At June 24, 2001, 1,076,000 shares remain available for repurchase under the share repurchase program authorized by
the Board of Directors.

Note J: Net Income (Loss) Per Share

Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The computation of basic net income (loss) per share for all
years presented is derived from the information on the face of the income statement and there are no reconciling items in either the
numerator or denominator.

Diluted earnings per share is computed as though all potential common shares that
are dilutive were outstanding during the period.  The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and the
denominators of the basic and diluted per-share computations for income from continuing operations.

Basic net income (loss) per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during
the period.  For fiscal year 2001, diluted net income per share includes the assumed exercise of employee stock options. The assumed
conversion of the convertible subordinated notes into 11,192,000 shares was antidilutive and therefore excluded from the computation
of diluted net income per share. For fiscal year 2000, diluted net income per share includes the assumed exercise of employee stock
options and the assumed conversion of the 5% convertible subordinated notes to common shares.  Options and convertible securities
were outstanding during fiscal 1999, but all 17,756,000 potential common shares were excluded from the computation of diluted net
loss per common share because the effect would have been antidilutive.  The shares potentially issuable under the put option
agreement have been excluded from the computation of dilutive net income (loss) per share because the effect would have been
antidilutive for all periods presented.

Note L: Stock Option Plans and Stock Purchase Plan

The Company has adopted stock option plans that provide for the granting to qualified employees of
stock options to purchase shares of Lam Common Stock. In addition, the plans permit the granting of nonstatutory stock options to
paid consultants and employees, and provide for the automatic grant of nonstatutory stock options to outside directors. The option
price is determined by the Board of Directors, but in no event will it be less than the fair market value of Lam Common Stock on the
date of grant (no less than 85% of the fair market value at the date of grant in the case of nonstatutory options).  Options granted
under the plans vest over a period determined by the Board of Directors. Under the automatic grant program, each outside director
receives an option immediately exercisable for 12,000 shares of Lam Common Stock during December of each year during which the
outside director serves, with the exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant.

A summary of stock option plan transactions follows:

During fiscal 1999, the Board of Directors of the Company amended the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan to
provide for annual non-employee director options to be granted in December, as opposed to January, of each calendar year, and to
allow for re-pricing of stock options held by eligible employees who, at the time of any such re-pricing, are not a member of the
Board of Directors, a member of the Company's senior management or a principal stockholder of the Company.

During fiscal 1999, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the 1999 Stock Option Plan, which provides
for the grant of non-qualified stock option awards to eligible employees, consultants and advisors of the Company and its
subsidiaries.  However, employees who are also members of the Board of Directors or of the Company's senior management, or who are a
principal stockholder of the Company, are not eligible to receive stock option awards under this plan. Initially, 9,000,000 shares
were reserved for issuance. In fiscal 2001, the Board of Directors approved an additional 500,000 and in fiscal 2000, stockholders
approved an additional 6,000,000 shares for issuance under the 1999 Stock Option Plan.  In addition, during fiscal 2001 the Board of
Directors approved that 409,428 shares, the balance in the 1996 Performance-Based Restricted Stock Plan (the "RSP"), be
made available for issuance.

In fiscal 1999, the Company adopted the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "1999 ESPP"). The
1999 ESPP allows employees to designate a portion of their base compensation to be used to purchase Lam Common Stock at a purchase
price per share of the lower of 85% of the fair market value of Lam Common Stock on the first or last day of the applicable offering
period. Typically, each offering period lasts 12 months and comprises three interim purchase dates. The 1999 ESPP, approved by the
Company's stockholders at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders on November 5, 1998, replaced the existing 1984 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the "1984 ESPP").  The Company has 9,000,000 shares of Lam Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 1999 ESPP:
3,000,000 shares may be issued at any time and additional shares (up to 6,000,000 total additional shares) may be issued for each
share of Lam Common Stock which the Company redeems in public-market at private purchases and designated for this purpose.

During fiscal 2001, 1,177,179 shares of Lam Common Stock were sold to employees under the 1999 ESPP.  A total
of 11,467,105 shares of the Lam's Common Stock were issued under the 1999, and 1984 Plans through June 24, 2001, at prices ranging
from $0.09 to $31.84 per share.  At June 24, 2001, 4,605,573 shares remain available for purchase under all employee stock purchase
plans.

In fiscal 1996, the Company adopted the RSP designed to reward executives based upon the achievement of
certain predetermined goals. Grants are based on the fair market value of the Lam's Common Stock at the end of the quarter, provided
the predetermined goals are met. The Company authorized 450,000 shares to be reserved for issuance under the Performance-Based Stock
Plan. At June 24, 2001, 14,817 of these shares have vested, 25,755 have not vested and are subject to repurchase and the remaining,
409,428 shares, have been made available for stock options.

Pro forma information regarding net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share is required by FAS 123 for
awards granted after June 30, 1995, as if the Company had accounted for its stock-based awards to employees under the fair value
method of FAS 123. The fair value of the Company's stock-based awards to employees was estimated using a Black-Scholes option
valuation model.  The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which
have no vesting restrictions and which are fully transferable. In addition, the Black-Scholes model requires the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility.  Because the Company's stock-based awards to employees have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can
materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of the Company's stock-based awards to employees. The fair value of the Company's stock-based awards to
employees was estimated assuming no expected dividends and the following weighted-average assumptions:

OPTIONS                  ESPP
                                 ----------------------- -----------------------

Risk-free interest rate.........    4.9%    6.2%    4.9%    4.9%    6.2%    4.9%

The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2001, 2000, and 1999 was $12.15, $17.09 and $9.25
per share, respectively. The weighted average fair value of shares granted under the ESPP plans during fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999 was
$6.08, $3.46, and $5.39 per share, respectively.

For pro forma purposes, the estimated fair value of the Company's stock-based awards to employees is amortized
over the option's vesting period (for options) and the respective four, six or 12-month purchase periods (for stock purchases under
the respective employee stock purchase plans).  The Company's pro forma information follows:

Note M: Profit Sharing Plan and Benefit Plans

Profit sharing is awarded to employees based upon performance against certain corporate financial and
operating goals. Distributions to employees by the Company are made bi-annually based upon a percentage of base salary, provided that
a threshold level of the Company's financial and performance goals are met. In addition to profit sharing the Company has other bonus
plans based on achievement of profitability and other specific performance criteria.  Charges to expense under these plans were,
$43,445,000, $27,741,000, and $2,121,000 during fiscal years 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

The Company maintains a 401(k)-retirement savings plan for its full-time employees in North America. Each
participant in the plan may elect to contribute from 2% to 15% of his or her annual salary to the plan, subject to statutory
limitations. The Company matches employee contributions to the plan at the rate of 50% of the first 6% of salary contributed. The
Company made matching contributions of $4,713,000, $3,832,000 and $3,610,000 in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Note N: Commitments

The Company leases most of its administrative, R&D and manufacturing facilities, regional
sales/service offices and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases, which expire at various dates through 2021. All of
the Company's facility leases for buildings located at its Fremont, California headquarters and certain operating leases provide the
Company an option to extend the leases for additional periods. Certain of the Company's other facility leases provide for periodic
rent increases based on the general rate of inflation.

Future minimum lease payments under operating leases are as follows:

Lease agreements relating to certain buildings at the Company's Fremont, California campus, require the
Company to provide guaranteed residual values totaling $97.1 million at the end of the respective lease terms which are reflected in
the preceding table.  Additionally, as part of the collateral restrictions of a lease agreement, the Company is required to maintain
a certain amount of cash, $51.4 million at June 24, 2001 and June 25, 2000, in restricted specified interest bearing accounts.  These
restricted cash accounts must be maintained through March 2003 (unless the agreement is otherwise terminated or the amount of
maintained cash is reduced), as the underlying obligation is paid down.

Total rent expense for all leases amounted to approximately $31,184,000, $26,505,000, and $33,144,000, for
fiscal years 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

The Company has subleased some of its buildings and currently is entitled to receive income of approximately
$3,690,000, $2,958,000, $1,627,000, $1,512,000, and $903,000 for the fiscal years 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively.

For the fiscal years ended June 24, 2001, June 25, 2000, and June 30, 1999, the Company received income
totaling $4,418,000, $4,671,000, and $3,226,000, respectively, on its subleased facilities.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the
Company's net deferred tax assets as of June 24, 2001 and June 25, 2000 are as follows:

Approximately $13.1 million and $71.9 million of the valuation allowance for deferred taxes, for fiscal 2001
and 2000, respectively, is attributable to stock option deductions, the benefit of which will be credited to equity when
realized.

Realization of the Company's net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income.  The Company
believes it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by
market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time.

At June 24, 2001 the Company has federal tax loss carryforwards of approximately $37.5 million, which will
expire in 2020. The Company also has federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $31.0 million, of which
approximately $18.0 million will expire in varying amounts between 2003 and 2006. The remaining balance of $13.0 million of tax
carryforwards may be carried forward indefinitely. A valuation allowance has been provided for a portion of the deferred tax assets
related to the carryforwards.

Note Q: Restructuring

In April 2001, the Company announced a plan to reduce global headcount up to 15% during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2001 ("the Plan").  The reduction in force was driven by the anticipated decline in the Company's short-
term revenues due to the significant contraction of the semiconductor equipment market from calendar year 2000 levels. During the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the Plan was approved by the appropriate level of management necessary to commit the Company to the
specific actions of the Plan. The Company began implementing the announced restructuring plan and reduced its workforce by
approximately 11% prior to June 24, 2001. The Company recorded a restructuring charge of $16.8 million which, in addition to
severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, included charges for remaining lease payments and leasehold
improvements on vacated facilities, and inventories of an etch product line that will no longer be supported by the Company. In
addition, the Company consolidated its Fremont manufacturing facilities and wrote-off the carrying cost of abandoned facility
assets.

Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the fiscal 2001 restructuring:

                                 ========== ========== ========== ========== ========== =========

Severance and Benefits relates to the salary and fringe benefit expense for involuntarily terminated
employees.  Prior to the date of the financial statements, management, with the proper level of authority, approved and committed the
Company to the plan of termination and determined the benefits the employees being terminated would receive and communicated the
benefits package to employees in enough detail that they could determine their type and amount of benefit. The termination of the
impacted employees occurred as soon as practical after the plan of restructuring was announced.   The Severance and Benefits reserve
balance of $4.2 million as of June 24, 2001 will be utilized by the end of March 2002.

Lease Payments on Vacated Facilities relates to the remainder of the lease term after the
abandonment of the facility currently under long-term operating lease agreements. The Company estimated, given the prevailing real
estate market conditions, that it would take approximately 24 months to sub-lease its vacated facilities in Fremont, California. When
applicable, anticipated future sublease income relating to vacated buildings has been offset against the charge for the remaining
lease payments.

The Company wrote off all leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings of approximately $1.5
million, as these items will have no future economic benefit and have been abandoned. In addition, certain demonstration equipment
and etch product line inventory were abandoned and written-off.

Other exit costs relate to customer accommodations for the discontinued product line and expenses associated
with a discontinued capital improvement project related to vacated facilities.

During the second quarter of fiscal 1999 and as a result of economic contraction in the semiconductor
industry, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $53.4 million, relating to severance compensation and benefits for
involuntarily terminated employees worldwide (representing approximately 15% of the global workforce), lease payments on abandoned
facilities, the write-off of related leasehold improvements and fixed assets and returned equipment credits issued to certain
customers.

Beginning in late fiscal 1999, there were indications of a recovery in the semiconductor industry.  On a
global basis, semiconductor makers began adding new capacity to address an increase in the demand for integrated circuits.  In
addition to new capacity, the semiconductor industry accelerated a migration to new materials such as copper and the new interconnect
processes required to implement them.  In early calendar year 2000, the Company concluded that the upturn would be sustainable and
that it was likely to continue through the end of the calendar year.

During fiscal 2000, the Company completed the remaining elements of its prior restructuring activities in
accordance with established and announced plans.  As a result of the stronger than anticipated recovery of the semiconductor capital
equipment market, the Company was able to recover approximately $35.9 million of the restructuring charges recorded in prior periods.
Of this amount, $10.9 million was recovered due to lower severance and termination costs than the Company had planned for certain
employees and executives as well as guaranteed outplacement services and other exit costs not being utilized.  Another $9.5 million
was recovered because the Company was able to reoccupy or successfully sublease certain manufacturing and administrative facilities
under long term operating leases. Additionally, the Company determined it would utilize leasehold improvements of $5.8 million in
certain manufacturing and administration facilities under operating leases which have been reoccupied as a result of the stronger
than anticipated rebound in business. The Company also recovered $3.1 million through the sale of its previously abandoned and
written-off facility in Korea. Another $4.4 million was recovered due to customers not utilizing system return credits they had
originally requested and which were issued as a result of the Company's decision to exit certain product lines. The Company also
recovered approximately $1.4 million from the sale of previously written off inventory. In addition, approximately $0.8 million was
recovered from the salvage of inventories previously segregated and written-off due to requests from former customers to purchase
certain piece parts.

At June 24, 2001, $1.8 million of prior years' restructuring charges remains in accrued liabilities, relating
primarily to executive severance and lease payments on abandoned equipment.  The reserve balance will be utilized to make scheduled
fixed cash payments through the remainder of the employee separation contracts and equipment lease contracts.

Note R: Purchased Technology for R&D

During the second quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company made an equity investment in, and purchased a portfolio
of CMP intellectual property rights and research and development technology from Strasbaugh.  The Company recognized a one-time
charge to income of $8.0 million for the purchase of in process research and development technology and recorded a $6.0 million
investment in preferred stock and intangible assets.  The Company's equity interest in Strasbaugh, representing approximately 20% of
Strasbaugh's total capital stock, is accounted for under the equity method and the intellectual property rights are being amortized
ratably over five years. Accumulated amortization as of June 24,2001 was $200,000.

Equity income from the Company's investment in Strasbaugh of $689,000 has to date  not been material, and,
therefore, is included in other income, net, on the accompanying statements of operations

In the second quarter of fiscal 2000, the Company purchased intellectual property rights related to
the semiconductor equipment industry from Oliver Design, Inc, ("Oliver").  The Company recognized an expense for the
purchase of research development technology of approximately $7.5 million and capitalized $1.5 million related to acquired patents,
which are being amortized ratably over their estimated useful life of five years. Accumulated amortization as of the end of fiscal
2001 and 2000 was $300,000 and $150,000, respectively. The technology is being used in a single discrete next generation post-CMP
wafer cleaning product development project and has no future alternative use.

In the third quarter of fiscal 1998, the Compny purchased a
non-exclusive license for Trikon's M

Æ

RI

ä

source technology. During fiscal 1999, $5.0 million in additional fees for the purchase of a
non-exclusive license for M

Æ

RI source technology became payable (separate from royalties owed on shipments of M

Æ

RI souce-based systems determined by rates prescribed in the license). This completed the purchase payments for this technology. The
technology was used in a single discrete etch product development project and has no future alternative use.

Note S: Litigation

In October 1993, Varian Associates, Inc. ("Varian") brought suit against the
Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief
based on alleged infringement of certain patents held by Varian. By order of the Court, those proceedings were bifurcated into an
initial phase to determine the validity of the Varian patents and the Company's infringement (if any), and a secondary phase to
determine damages to Varian (if any) and whether the Company's infringement (if shown) was willful. On April 13, 1999, the Court
issued an interlocutory order construing the meaning of the terms of the patent claims at issue in the action. In September 1999, a
hearing was held on a summary judgment motion, which might dispose of a number of Varian's claims.  In early January 2001, the Court
issued an order determining that the Company did not literally infringe Varian's patents, but the Court also held that a question of
fact remained as to whether the Company may have infringed those patents by the doctrine of equivalents. A November 26, 2001 trial
date has been scheduled. There have been no findings in the action which have caused the Company reasonably to believe that any
infringement, if found, or any damages, if awarded, would have a material adverse effect on its operating results or our financial
position.

In September 1999, Tegal Corporation ("Tegal") brought suit against the Company in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based on an alleged infringement
of certain patents held by Tegal.  Specifically, Tegal identified the Company's 4520XLe and Exelan products as infringing the patents
Tegal is asserting. On a Company initiated motion, this case was transferred to California and is now pending in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California. To date, however, there has been no determination as to the actual scope of
those claims, or whether the Company's products have infringed or are infringing Tegal's patents.  No trial date is currently
scheduled in the action.  Furthermore, there have been no findings in the action, which have caused the Company reasonably to believe
that any infringement, if found, or any damages, if awarded, could have a material adverse effect on its operating results or
financial position.

From time to time, the Company has received notices from third parties alleging infringement of such parties'
patent or other intellectual property rights by the Company's products.  In such cases, it is the Company's policy to defend the
claims or negotiate licenses on commercially reasonable terms, where considered appropriate.  However, no assurance can be given that
the Company will be able in the future to negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any
litigation resulting from such claims would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or operating
results.

Note U: Subsequent Event (unaudited)

On August 31, 2001, the Company announced a plan to further reduce its global workforce by approximately
10% during the first quarter of fiscal 2002 ("the Plan") and implement other actions to further reduce operating expenses.
The Company determined a reduction in force was needed to reduce its cost structure in line with the projected decline in revenues.
The majority of impacted employees were terminated shortly after the Plan was announced. The Company expects to finalize its
restructuring plan and record an additional restructuring charge in the quarter ending September 23, 2001.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Stockholders and Board of Directors

Lam Research Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lam Research
Corporation as of June 24, 2001 and  June 25, 2000, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years  in the period
ended June 24, 2001. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
Index at Item 14(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Company's management.  Our  responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States.  Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free  of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the  financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management,  as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our  opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the  consolidated financial position of Lam Research Corporation at
June 24, 2001 and June 25, 2000, and the consolidated results of its  operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 24, 2001, in conformity with
accounting principles  generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein.

As discussed in Note B to the financial statements, in fiscal 2001 the
Company changed its method of accounting  for revenue recognition in accordance with guidance
provided in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101), "Revenue  Recognition in
Financial Statements" and adopted the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force Consensus
No. 00-19, "Accounting  for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially
Settled in, a Company's Own Stock".
