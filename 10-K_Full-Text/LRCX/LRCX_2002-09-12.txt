Item 1.

Business

Lam Research Corporation ("Lam"), a Delaware corporation, was founded in 1980,
and is headquartered in Fremont, California.  The mailing address for our principal executive offices is 4650 Cushing Parkway,
Fremont, California 94538 and our telephone number is (510) 572-0200.  Additional information about Lam is available on our website
at http://www.lamrc.com. Our Form 10-K is available online at the Securities and Exchange Commission's website at
http://www.sec.gov.

We design, manufacture, market and service semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of
integrated circuits.  We are recognized as a leading supplier of such equipment to the worldwide semiconductor industry.
Semiconductor wafers are subjected to a complex series of process steps that result in the simultaneous creation of many individual
integrated circuits. Etch and Chemical Mechanical Planarization ("CMP") products selectively remove portions of various
films from the wafer to create an integrated circuit.

Etch processes, which are repeated numerous times during the fabrication cycle, are required to manufacture
every type of semiconductor device produced today. Our etch systems employ Lam's TCP

Ò

high density and Dual Frequency Confined

TM

(DFC

TM

) medium density plasma sources to etch device features as
small as 100 nanometers (nm), or smaller, in size.

CMP is used to planarize the surface of the wafer to prepare it for further processing.  CMP is currently the
planarization technology of choice for manufacturing integrated circuits with features 130-nm and smaller with multiple metal layers.
Our Teres

â

CMP integrated systems provide fully integrated polishing and cleaning solutions.

Etch Process

The etch process defines linewidths and other microscopic features on integrated circuits.  Plasma etching
was developed to meet the demand for device geometries smaller than three microns. Plasma consists of ions and neutral species that
react with exposed portions of the wafer surface to remove dielectric, metal, or polysilicon material and produce the finely
delineated features and patterns of an integrated circuit.

Current generation advanced integrated circuit manufacturing requires etch systems that create features of
0.13 micron (130-nm), and for future semiconductor products below 100-nm.  The trend toward feature sizes in the 100-nm range
accompanies a transition from aluminum to copper conductive lines for faster device processing speeds.  Subsequent feature size
reductions below 100-nm will begin to integrate more fragile dielectric materials (low k and porous low k).  In addition to
continually shrinking feature sizes, advanced manufacturing facilities are now producing integrated circuits on 200-mm (8-inch)
silicon wafers and transitioning to wafer diameters of 300-mm (12 inch).  To accommodate these decreasing linewidths and increasing
wafer diameters, semiconductor manufacturers will increasingly require more precise control over the etch process.

Several of our etch products are available as standalone systems or as clusters used on the Alliance

â

or 2300

TM

Etch multichamber platforms.

Dielectric Etch Products

4520 Series Systems.

The 4520 system processes wafer sizes up to 200 mm and linewidths as small as 180-nm.

4520XLE

TM

System

.  The 4520XLE

ä

system introduced Lam's proprietary Dual Frequency Confined ("DFC") plasma technology, which reduces plasma volume and sidewall
polymer accumulation for cleaner, low-cost operation.  Additionally, it offers a wider process window than the 4520 system with
capabilities below 180-nm geometries.

Exelan

â

, Exelan

â

High Performance, Exelan

â

HPT, and 2300 Exelan

â

Systems.

The Exelan family of products extends DFC technology to create smaller feature sizes, as well as, to mix sequential
etch processes in the same chamber, which improves productivity and lowers cost of ownership.  Exelan

was introduced in
July 1999 to define the structures required for manufacturing copper conductive lines in semiconductors. Exelan

High
Performance, introduced in 2001, extends Exelan's capabilities for etching newer low k insulating films.  Exelan HPT, introduced
early in 2002, targets sub-130-nm geometries.

The 2300 Exelan

â

system addresses sub-90-nm requirements for 200-mm and 300-mm wafer sizes

.

Process chambers are upgradable from 200-mm to
300-mm.  This capability, combined with an overall system footprint comparable to 200-mm systems, has allowed semiconductor
manufacturers to develop processes using 200-mm wafers instead of more expensive 300-mm wafers, which can later be scaled up.

Conductor Etch Products

TCP

Ò

9400 and TCP

Ò

9600 Series and 2300 Versys

TM

Systems

.  The first TCP products were introduced in late 1992.  They utilize Lam's
patented Transformer Coupled Plasma

ä

source technology, a high-density, low-pressure plasma source that can etch features well below 100-nm. For 200-mm wafer sizes, we
offer the TCP

Ò

9400SE II, TCP

Ò

9400PTX, and TCP

Ò

9400DFM addressing silicon etch applications and the TCP

Ò

9600SE II, TCP

Ò

9600PTX, and TCP

Ò

9600DFM for metal etch applications.  These systems are used in the production of a broad range of advanced logic and memory devices
with feature sizes below 130-nm.

The 2300 Versys system for silicon and metal films scale TCP technology to address leading-edge device
structure requirements. The 2300 Versys systems have the capability to process 200 or 300-mm wafer sizes.  The newly introduced 2300
Versys Star

TM

silicon etch system, in production at several customer sites, enables sequential step tuning of gas flow and
wafer temperature.  This capability is targeted at sub-90-nm, next-generation, critical dimension uniformity requirements.

CMP and Post-CMP Wafer Cleaning Processes

CMP is a relatively new process step that was adopted by the semiconductor industry a few years ago.  With
increasingly smaller geometries, more layers are required to connect the individual devices of an integrated circuit.  Each
additional layer exaggerates the uneven topography of the previous ones, creating a depth of focus problem for subsequent
photolithographic steps, which diminishes the precision of the linewidth dimensions.  The CMP process removes excess material from
the wafer surface by a combination of chemical and abrasive actions to provide a flatter surface improving photolithography results.
Additionally, CMP processes are required for the creation of copper conductive lines.  Removing the residue of the abrasive and
chemical materials used in CMP requires special cleaning techniques following processing.

CMP and Post-CMP Clean Products

Teres

®

.

We offer 200-mm Teres CMP systems integrated with our Synergy
Integra

TM

cleaning systems and 300-mm systems integrated with a proprietary vertical brush cleaner.  These tools target
advanced copper/low k and shallow trench isolation (STI) applications.  Both systems incorporate our Linear Planarization
Technology

TM

(LPT

TM

) which uses a high-speed belt combined with patented air-bearing platen capability. These
features achieve uniformity control across the wafer surface by changing the shape of the belt (pad) using air pressure.  Independent
zones can be adjusted to change the pad pressure instead of bending the wafer backside so that fragile 300-mm wafers and multi-layer
low k film stacks are not unnecessarily stressed during processing.

DSS-200

®

.

The DSS-200 Series of cleaning systems simultaneously scrub both sides of the
wafer with top and bottom side brushes.

Synergy

TM

. Synergy products combine DSS technology and Chemical Mechanical Cleaning

TM

(CMC

TM

) technology to perform mechanical and chemical cleaning in a single-step process.  The Synergy Integra incorporates
Synergy's cleaning technology with a platform that can be integrated with other suppliers' polishing systems.  Certain integrated
systems in the industry are the result of partnerships between Lam and other polishing vendors.

Research and Development

The market for semiconductor capital equipment is characterized by rapid technological change and product
innovation. Our ability to maintain competitive advantage depends in part on our continued and timely development of new products and
enhancements to existing products.  Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to R&D
programs and seek to maintain close relationships with our customers and be responsive to their wafer processing needs.

Our R&D expenses during fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000 were $179.2 million, $227.2 million, and $176.9 million,
respectively, and represented 19.0%, 15.0%, and 14.4% of total revenue, respectively. Expenditures are targeted at continued
development of advanced etch, CMP and post-CMP Clean applications and enhancements to our existing products, including developing the
technology necessary to support our customers' transition to smaller feature sizes, (90-nm, 65-nm), new materials, copper-based
devices and 300-mm wafers.

We expect to continue to make substantial investments in R&D to meet our customers' product needs and enhance
our competitive position.

Marketing, Sales and Service

Our marketing and sales efforts are focused on building long-term relationships with our customers. These
efforts are supported by a team of product marketing professionals, sales personnel as well as equipment and process engineers that
work closely with individual customers to develop solutions to their processing needs.  After-sales support is an essential element
of our marketing and sales programs. We maintain ongoing support relationships with our customers and have an extensive network of
field service personnel in place throughout the United States, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific. We believe that comprehensive support
programs and close working relationships with customers are essential to maintaining our competitiveness in the marketplace.

We have approximately 40 sales and support centers around the world, through which technical personnel sell and/or
service our products. We provide our customers comprehensive warranty packages on all released products.

Export Sales

Export sales accounted for approximately 44%, 50%, and 52% of our net sales in fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000,
respectively.  Export sales consist of sales from any of our U.S. operating subsidiaries to non-affiliated customers outside the U.S.
As a result, a significant portion of our sales and operations will be subject to certain risks, including tariffs and other
barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing non-U.S. subsidiary and branch operations, potentially adverse tax consequences,
exchange rate fluctuations, and the potential for difficulty in accounts receivable collection.  There can be no assurance that any
of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations and cash
flows.  Refer to Note Q of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 herein, for further information concerning
export sales.

Customers

Our customers include many of the world's leading semiconductor manufacturers. No individual customer
accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in fiscal 2002. In fiscal years 2001 and 2000, revenue from STMicroelectronics
accounted for approximately 15% of total revenue.

A material reduction in orders from several of our larger customers, due to market or business conditions in
the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our results of operations and projected financial conditions. Our business depends
upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for
integrated circuits and products utilizing integrated circuits. In fiscal 2000 and the first half of fiscal 2001, we experienced
strong demand for our systems, driven by semiconductor manufacturers needs for additional capacity and new technology. Beginning in
the second half of fiscal 2001, a slowing U.S. economy and worldwide decline in demand for integrated circuits resulted in excess
capacity in the semiconductor industry and a severe contraction of the manufacturing equipment market. Our customers reduced their
level of capital expenditures, which caused a steep decline in demand for our products in fiscal 2002.  A modest recovery in our
served market during the last half of fiscal 2002 supports our current outlook for slightly higher revenues in the first fiscal
quarter of 2003, compared to the prior quarter.

Backlog

Company backlog includes orders for systems, spares and services where written customer requests have
been accepted and the delivery of products or provision of services is anticipated within the next 12 months. Our policy is to make
adjustments to our backlog to reflect customer delivery date changes, as well as order cancellations. We schedule production of our
systems based upon purchase orders in backlog and our customers' delivery requirements.  Included in our systems backlog are orders
for which written requests have been accepted, prices agreed and shipment dates assigned. The spares and services backlog includes
customer orders for products that have not yet shipped and for services that have not yet been provided.  Where specific customer
service and spares contracts do not contain specific delivery dates, we use volume estimates at the contract price and over the
contract period, not exceeding 12 months, in calculating backlog amounts.

As of June 30, 2002 and June 24, 2001, our backlog was approximately $287 million and $231 million,
respectively.  All orders for our products and services are subject to cancellation by our customers, generally, with limited
penalties.  Because some orders are received for shipments in the same quarter and because of possible customer changes in delivery
dates and cancellations of orders, our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual revenues for succeeding
periods.

Manufacturing

Our manufacturing operations consist mainly of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that
are then integrated into finished systems. Most of the assembly and testing of our products is conducted in cleanroom environments.
Prior to shipping a completed system, customer representatives may perform acceptance tests at our facility.  After passing these
acceptance tests, the system is vacuum-bagged in a cleanroom environment and prepared for shipment.

During fiscal 2002, we entered into agreements with third parties to outsource certain elements of our
manufacturing, production warehousing and logistics functions.  We believe that entering into these outsourcing contracts will
provide us more flexibility to scale our operations up and down in a more timely and cost effective manner, to respond to the
cyclical nature of our business. We believe that we have selected reputable providers and are securing their performance on terms
documented in written contracts. However, it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and
such failure could have an adverse impact on our business.  In addition, the expanded role of outsource providers has required us to
implement changes to our existing operations and to adopt new procedures to effectively manage the performance of those outsource
providers. We believe that we have implemented adequate supervision procedures.  Even so, any delay or failure in the implementation
of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely affect our customer relationships and have a negative effect on our
operating results. Refer to Note U of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 herein, for further information
concerning our outsourcing commitments.

Certain of the components and subassemblies included in our products are obtained from a single supplier or a
limited group of suppliers. We believe that alternative sources could be obtained and qualified to supply these products.
Nevertheless, a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could have an adverse short-term effect on our operating results and
could unfavorably impact our customer relationships.

Environmental Matters

We are currently not aware of any pending notices of violation, fines, lawsuits or investigations
arising from environmental matters that would have any material effect on our business.

We are subject
to a variety of governmental regulations related to the management of hazardous materials.  We believe that we are in general
compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise addressing) all necessary environmental
permits to conduct our business. Nevertheless, the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being
imposed on us, suspension of production, cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers' acceptance of our products.
These regulations could require us to alter our current operations, to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other
expenses to comply with environmental regulations.  Our failure to control the use, sale, transport or disposal of hazardous
substances could subject us to future liabilities.

Employees

As of September 3, 2002, we had approximately 2,500 regular full-time
employees.

Each of our employees signs an agreement to maintain the confidentiality of our
proprietary information, and most of our employees have stock or stock option arrangements with us that provide for the vesting of
their options over several years.

In the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries, competition for highly skilled employees is
intense. Our future success depends to a significant extent upon our continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees,
particularly in R&D and customer support functions.

Competition

The semiconductor equipment industry is highly competitive throughout the world. Our management
believes that to compete effectively, we must invest significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products, to maintain
customer service and support centers worldwide, and to develop enhanced product capabilities.  Certain of our existing and potential
competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer
service and support organizations. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current
products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with enhanced price performance characteristics. If our
competitors make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering etch, CMP or
post-CMP clean products similar to those we sell, our ability to sell our products to those customers could be adversely affected. In
addition, semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate processing equipment into a
semiconductor production line.  As a result, once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a particular supplier's tool set, the
manufacturer generally maintains that selection for that specific production application. Accordingly, we may experience difficulty
in selling to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor's system. There can be no assurance that in the future
we will be able to compete successfully on a worldwide basis.

We face significant competitive factors in the equipment market, including quality, repeatability, process
capability and flexibility, and overall cost of ownership, which may be affected by factors such as reliability, software automation,
throughput, customer support and system price. Although we believe that we compete favorably with respect to many of these factors,
our ability to succeed in the marketplace will depend upon our ability to introduce product enhancements and new products on a timely
basis. There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully in the future. Our primary competitors in the etch
market are Applied Materials, Inc. and Tokyo Electron Limited. Our Teres CMP integrated polishing system faces significant
competition from Applied Materials, Inc., Ebara Corp., and SpeedFam-IPEC, Inc. In CMP slurry removal and cleaning applications, our
competitors include DaiNippon Screen Manufacturing Co. Ltd. and VERTEQ Inc.

Patents and Licenses

Our policy is to seek patents on inventions relating to new or enhanced products and processes
developed as part of our ongoing research, engineering, manufacturing, and support activities.  We hold United States patents and
non-U.S. patents covering various aspects of our products and processes.  We believe that the duration of our patents
generally exceeds the useful life of the technologies and processes disclosed and claimed therein.  Our patents, which cover material
aspects of our past and present core products, have current durations ranging from approximately seven to seventeen years.  We believe
that although the patents we own and may obtain in the future will be of value, they will not alone determine our success, which
depends principally upon our engineering, marketing, service and manufacturing skills.  However, in the absence of patent protection,
we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to imitate our products, manufacturing techniques, and processes. In addition, other
companies and inventors may receive patents that contain claims applicable or similar to our products and processes.  The sale of
products covered by patents of others could require licenses that may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.

From time to time, we have received notices from third parties alleging infringement of such parties' patent or
other intellectual property rights by our products. In such cases it is our policy to defend the claims, or if considered
appropriate, negotiate licenses on commercially reasonable terms.  However, no assurance can be given that we will be able, in the
future, to negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any litigation resulting from such
claims would not have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For further discussion of legal matters see
Item 3 "Legal Proceedings" of this Form 10-K.

Other Cautionary Statements

See the discussion of risks in the section of this report entitled Item 7 "Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations".

Item 2.

Properties

Our executive offices and principal manufacturing and R&D facilities are located in Fremont,
California, and are under operating leases expiring from 2002 to 2007. As a result of the restructuring of our operations, we have
subleased some of our idle facilities. In addition, we lease facilities for our service, technical support and sales personnel
throughout the United States, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific. Our fiscal 2002 rental payments for the space occupied during that
period, aggregated approximately $16.8 million, net of sublease income of $3.9 million. Our facilities lease obligations are subject
to periodic increases and we believe that our existing facilities are well maintained and in good operating condition.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

On December 19, 2001, we signed a final settlement agreement with Varian Semiconductor Equipment
Associates, Inc. ("Varian") in connection with the patent infringement litigation filed by Varian in October 1993.  Under the terms
of the settlement agreement, Varian granted us a nonexclusive license to the patents involved in the litigation.  We agreed to pay
Varian $20.0 million in cash and issued a warrant that entitles Varian to purchase 2,000,000 shares of Lam Common Stock at an
exercise price of $21.30 per share.  As part of the full and final settlement, Lam and Varian agreed to dismiss all pending claims
and counterclaims relating to the litigation.

In September 1999, Tegal Corporation ("Tegal") brought suit against us seeking monetary damages and
injunctive relief based on our alleged infringement of certain patents held by Tegal.  Specifically, Tegal identified our
4520XLe

ä

and Exelan

â

products as infringing the patents Tegal is asserting. On our motion, this case was transferred to California and is now pending in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. To date, however, there has been no determination as to the
actual scope of those claims, or whether our products have infringed or are infringing Tegal's patents.  No trial date is currently
scheduled in the action.  Furthermore, there have been no findings in the action which have caused us reasonably to believe that any
infringement, if found, or any damages, if awarded, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or our financial
position.

From time to time, we have received notices from third parties alleging infringement of such parties' patent
or other intellectual property rights by our products. In such cases it is our policy to defend the claims, or if considered
appropriate, negotiate licenses on commercially reasonable terms.  However, no assurance can be given that in the future we
will be able to negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any litigation resulting
from such claims would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or operating
results.

Item 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations

Results of Operations

Lam Research Corporation is a leading supplier of technically complex thin film selective removal
equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits. Our product offerings include single wafer plasma etch systems with a wide
range of applications, CMP and post-CMP wafer cleaning systems and an array of services designed to optimize the utilization of these
systems by our customers.

The semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and
upturns.  Over the past three business cycles, the severity of the semiconductor business cycle has increased.   Demand for our
equipment can fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, including but not limited to, economic
conditions, supply and demand for semiconductors, customer capacity requirements, and our ability to develop and market competitive
new products.  For these and other reasons, our results of operations for fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000 may not necessarily be
indicative of future operating results.

Total Revenue

Our total revenues were $943.1 million, $1,519.8 million and $1,230.8 million for fiscal year 2002, 2001,
and 2000, respectively. Total revenue of $1,519.8 million in fiscal 2001 reflected the adoption of SAB 101 as of the beginning of
that year.    The decrease in revenue for fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 is due to a worldwide decline in demand for integrated
circuits which resulted in excess capacity in the semiconductor industry and a severe contraction in the semiconductor manufacturing
equipment market.  During the third quarter of fiscal 2001, we began to see signs of a downturn. Excess inventory of
telecommunication products, diminished personal computer sales and a slowing economy caused semiconductor companies to sharply reduce
capital expenditures and delay or cancel equipment orders.  These order reductions had a negative impact on the level of our systems
shipments starting in the June 2001 quarter. Revenues decreased across nearly all product lines in fiscal 2002. While the overall industry
slowed, our customers continued to make selective purchases to support development of processes needed for smaller device feature
sizes and for copper and new materials integration, as well as the transition to 300-mm size wafers.

Revenue in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 reflected a period of expansion in our served markets driven by
semiconductor manufacturers needs for increased capacity.  In addition, our customers were transitioning to smaller geometries and
new materials such as copper.  Proportionally, more of our revenue growth can be attributed to our etch family of products.

We changed our revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, effective June 26, 2000, based
on guidance provided in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 ("SAB 101"), "Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements." Refer to our discussion of "Critical Accounting Policies" for additional information about our revenue recognition
policy.

Based on the guidance provided by SAB 101, we generally recognize new systems revenue upon customer
acceptance. As a result, the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize systems revenue is subject to the length of time that
our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation. Systems revenue recognition
generally occurs from two to seven months after the date of shipment.

Regional geographic breakdown of revenue is as follows:

Year Ended
                                    --------------------------
                                    June 30, June 24, June 25,
                                      2002     2001     2000
                                    -------- -------- --------
North America......................      29%      30%      29%
Europe.............................      21%      28%      28%
Asia Pacific.......................      35%      33%      31%
Japan..............................      15%       9%      12%

A modest recovery in demand for wafer fabrication equipment during the last half of fiscal 2002 supports our
current outlook for slightly higher revenues in the first fiscal quarter, 2003, compared to the prior quarter, as current
manufacturing activity by our customers has improved.

Gross Margin

Gross margin was $266.1 million, $653.5 million and $541.9 million in fiscal year 2002, 2001, and
2000, respectively. As a percentage of total revenue, gross margins were 28.2%, 43.0% and 44.0% in fiscal year 2002, 2001, and 2000,
respectively.  The decrease in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 stems from unabsorbed manufacturing
overhead costs due to lower production volumes. Additionally inventory write-downs of approximately $24.1 million and a patent litigation
settlement charge of $38.8 million, in the second fiscal quarter of 2002, and inventory related net restructuring charges, after
recoveries, of $5.9 million unfavorably impacted gross margins in fiscal 2002. The decrease in our gross margin percentage in fiscal
2001 compared to fiscal 2000 resulted primarily from unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs in the second half of fiscal 2001, due
to the industry slowdown.

During the last quarter of fiscal 2002, we experienced a favorable gross margin progression due to better
capacity utilization of both our factory and field service resources and from the impact of cost reduction programs. Excluding
restructuring reserve recovery, gross margin for the June 2002 quarter was 35.9% of total revenue, compared to 33.5% of total revenue
in the March 2002 quarter. Our current outlook is for gross margin as a percent of revenue to rise sequentially in the first fiscal
quarter, 2003, due to higher revenues and increased production efficiencies.

Research and Development

R&D expenses were $179.2 million, $227.2 million and $176.9 million in fiscal year
2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expenses were 19.0%, 15.0% and 14.4% for fiscal year
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in R&D expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal
2001 is primarily the result of lower sales volume. The decrease in R&D expenses in absolute dollars in fiscal 2002 compared to
fiscal 2001 results from controlled spending on general R&D programs, consistent with the downturn in the business cycle.

The increase in R&D expenses in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was driven by expanded levels of
investment in advanced etch and CMP/Clean applications, including developing the technology necessary to support smaller geometries,
new insulating materials, copper-based devices and 300 mm size wafers.

We believe that in order to remain competitive, we must continue to invest substantially in R&D.
Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to these programs.  We expect to continue
making sizeable investments in advanced etch and CMP/Clean applications and in enhancing our existing products during fiscal
2003.

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses (excluding restructuring
charges/recoveries) were  $161.9 million, $218.9 million and $161.3 million in fiscal year 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. As a
percentage of total revenue, SG&A expenses (excluding restructuring charges/recoveries) were 17.2%, 14.4% and 13.1% in fiscal
2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 is largely due to
manpower reductions, lower incentive payments to employees, shutdown days and other cost reduction programs. The increase in SG&A
expenses as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2002, is primarily the result of lower sales volume. The increase in absolute dollars
for fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was driven by infrastructure expansion needed to sustain higher sales,
marketing, and administrative support for our expanding business in the first half of fiscal 2001.  SG&A increased as a percent of revenue in fiscal 2001, largely
due to the decline in sequential quarterly revenue starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001.

Restructuring Charges

We have developed restructuring plans in response to changes in business outlook with the intent
to align our cost structure with anticipated revenue levels.  Expenses have been incurred associated with cost containment activities
including downsizing and reorganizations and business exit activities related to discontinued product lines.  Accounting for
restructuring activities requires an evaluation of formally agreed upon and approved plans.  Although management makes every attempt
to consolidate all known restructuring activities into one plan, the nature of our extreme cycles and rapidly changing forecasting
environment places practical limitations on achieving this objective.  The recognition of a restructuring event does not necessarily
exclude similar but unrelated actions in future periods.

In April 2001, we announced plans to reduce our global workforce up to 15% during the fourth quarter of fiscal
2001 ("the June 2001 Plan").  The reduction in force was driven by the then anticipated level of decline in our revenues
due to the forecasted contraction of our served market from calendar year 2000 levels. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the
June 2001 Plan was approved by the appropriate level of management necessary to commit to the specific actions of the plan. We began
implementing the announced restructuring plan and reduced our workforce by approximately 11% prior to June 24, 2001.  We recorded a
restructuring charge of $16.8 million which included severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, charges for
remaining lease payments and leasehold improvements on vacated facilities, and charges for inventories of an etch product line that
has been discontinued. In addition, we consolidated our Fremont manufacturing facilities and wrote-off the carrying cost of abandoned
facility assets. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we determined that outplacement services guaranteed by us for terminated
employees and other employee benefit costs were not going to be fully utilized and therefore recovered $1.4 million of restructuring
charges recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. We also recovered $0.9 million from certain of our etch product line
inventory, previously segregated and written-off.

Severance and Benefits relates to the salary and fringe benefit expense for involuntarily terminated
employees.  Prior to the date of the financial statements, management, with the proper level of authority, approved and committed to
the plan of termination and determined the benefits the employees being terminated would receive and communicated the severance
package to employees in enough detail that they could determine their type and amount of benefit. The termination of the impacted
employees occurred as soon as practical after the plan of restructuring was announced.   The majority of the Severance and Benefits
reserve balance of $0.5 million as of June 30, 2002 is anticipated to be utilized by December 2002.

Lease Payments on Vacated Facilities relates to the remainder of the lease term after the abandonment of
certain facilities currently under long-term operating lease agreements. We estimated, given the prevailing real estate market
conditions, that it would take approximately 24 months to sub-lease our vacated buildings in Fremont, California. When applicable,
anticipated future sublease income relating to vacated buildings has been offset against the charge for the remaining lease
payments.

We wrote-off all leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings of approximately $1.5 million, as
these items will have no future economic benefit and have been abandoned. In addition, certain demonstration equipment and etch
product line inventory were abandoned and written-off.

Other exit costs relate to customer accommodations for the discontinued product line and expenses associated
with capital improvements to the vacated facilities.

Our business outlook in mid to late summer of 2001, indicated further deterioration in semiconductor sales
from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, resulting in a lower outlook for the wafer fabrication equipment market and therefore in our
revenues.  Consequently, in August 2001, we announced a new plan ("the September 2001 Plan") to further reduce our fixed
cost infrastructure, including an approximate 10% reduction-in-force. During the first quarter of fiscal 2002, the September 2001
Plan was approved by the appropriate level of management necessary to commit to the specific actions of the plan. We began
implementing the announced restructuring activities and reduced our workforce by approximately 550 employees, worldwide prior to
September 23, 2001.  We recorded a restructuring charge of $21.0 million which included severance and benefits for involuntarily
terminated employees, write-offs for remaining lease payments and leasehold improvements on vacated facilities, and charges for
inventories of selected, older etch product lines that were discontinued.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we determined
that outplacement services guaranteed by us for terminated employees and other employee benefit costs were not going to be fully
utilized and therefore recovered $0.7 million of restructuring charges recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. We also
recovered $0.8 million from certain of  our older etch inventories, previously segregated and written-off and $0.3 million from
facilities leases.

and wrote-off the related discontinued manufacturing inventory.

The continued and severe degradation in the wafer fabrication equipment market in late calendar year 2001 and
its impact on our near-term financial forecast necessitated another restructuring plan ("the December 2001 Plan").  In December 2001,
we publicly announced our intention to reduce global employment by approximately 12% and further consolidate our facilities. During
the second fiscal quarter, the December 2001 Plan was approved by the appropriate level of management necessary to commit to the
specific actions of the plan. We began implementing the announced restructuring activities and reduction of our workforce by
approximately 470 employees, worldwide prior to December 30, 2001.  We recorded a restructuring charge of $33.8 million relating to
severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, charges for remaining lease payments on vacated facilities and the
write-off of related leasehold improvements and fixed assets.

termination, determined the benefits the terminated employees would receive and communicated the severance package to employees in

million as of June 30, 2002 is anticipated to be utilized by December 2002.

Lease Payments on Vacated Facilities relates to 24 months of rent (or the remainder of the lease term, if
less) after the abandonment of certain facilities currently under long-term operating lease agreements. We estimated, given
prevailing real estate market conditions, that it would take approximately 24 months to sublease the vacated facilities in Fremont,
California.

We wrote off leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings of approximately $8.8 million, as these
items will have no future economic benefit and have been abandoned. Additionally, certain fixed assets of approximately $1.1 million
associated with these facilities had no future economic benefit and have been abandoned and written-off.

As summarized above, restructuring activities have had a significant impact on our operating results. As
discussed under "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" below, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 146 "

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

" (FAS
146).  Had FAS 146 been applicable when we undertook our restructuring activities, the timing and amount of the charges recognized
may have been different than those reported. FAS 146 is applicable to restructuring activities initiated on or after December 31,
2002 with early adoption encouraged. FAS 146 does not apply to our previous restructuring activities.

Asset Impairment Charges

During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we determined that the carrying value of certain laboratory and
demonstration equipment to be disposed of exceeded its fair value less cost to sell. Fair value was assessed using the market values
of similar used laboratory and demonstration equipment. Impairment  occurred due to rapid technological changes brought
about by the semiconductor industry's move to copper and 300-mm applications.
In accordance with FAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed Of", we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $9.5 million. A $5.3 million write-down to
fair value of certain laboratory tools is included in R&D expenses and $4.2 million of write-downs to fair value of demonstration
equipment are included in SG&A expenses. Remaining equipment with carrying values totaling $1.1 million is reviewed quarterly
for incremental impairment and is anticipated to be disposed of within the next 12 months.

Patent Litigation Settlement

On December 19, 2001, we signed a final settlement agreement with Varian Semiconductor Equipment
Associates, Inc. in connection with the patent infringement litigation filed by Varian in October 1993.  Under the terms of the
settlement agreement, Varian granted us a nonexclusive license to the patents involved in the litigation.  We agreed to pay Varian
$20.0 million in cash ($5.0 million in December 2001 and the balance of $15.0 million to be paid quarterly over the next 3 years) and
issued a warrant with a fair value of $21.5 million that entitled Varian to purchase 2,000,000 shares of our Common Stock at an
exercise price of $21.30 per share.  As part of the full and final settlement, Varian and Lam agreed to dismiss all pending claims
and counterclaims relating to the litigation.

In connection with the settlement, we recorded a charge of $38.8 million in the quarter ended December 30,
2001, which represents approximately 93% of the total value of the settlement.  The remaining portion of the total value of the
settlement relating to the future licensed use of the patents, $2.7 million, is being amortized ratably over 10 quarters.

The imputed value of the warrant was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model.  The key assumptions
used in the valuation model were an expected life of 4 years, anticipated stock price volatility of 61% and a risk-free interest rate
of 4.5%.

Purchased Technology for Research & Development

During the second quarter of fiscal 2001, we made an equity investment in, and purchased a portfolio of
CMP intellectual property rights and research and development technology from Strasbaugh.  We recognized a one-time charge to income
of $8.0 million for the purchase of in-process research and development technology and recorded a $6.0 million investment in
preferred stock and intangible assets.  Our equity interest in Strasbaugh, representing approximately 20% of Strasbaugh's total
capital stock, is accounted for under the equity method and the intellectual property rights are being amortized ratably over five
years.

Based on our analysis of Strasbaugh's current and expected financial performance, we determined in the third
quarter of fiscal 2002 that the carrying value of our equity investment had experienced an other-than-temporary impairment and
recorded a $2.0 million charge in other expense to write down the investment to its estimated fair value.

Our equity in the income (loss) from Strasbaugh as of the end of fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 was
($0.8) million and $0.7 million, respectively.  The income (loss) has not been material, and, therefore, has not been itemized in
other income, net, on the accompanying statements of operations.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2000, we purchased intellectual property rights related to the
semiconductor equipment industry from Oliver Design, Inc ("Oliver").  We recognized an expense for the purchase of research
and development technology of approximately $7.5 million and capitalized $1.5 million related to acquired patents, which are being
amortized ratably over their estimated useful life of five years. The technology is being used in a next generation product
development project and has no future alternative use.

Other Income (expense), net

Other income (expense), net, was ($8.2) million, $15.1 million and $7.0 million in fiscal
year 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.  The increase in net other expense in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was driven by
lower yields on investments due to declining interest rates in fiscal 2002, the non-taxable loss on our equity derivatives indexed to
Lam stock, and the decrease in foreign currency exchange gains due to lower foreign currency balances.  The increase in fiscal 2001
compared to fiscal 2000 was driven by higher interest income on a substantially larger average investment portfolio.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we applied Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 00-19,
in accounting for our equity derivatives indexed to our own stock. In accordance with EITF 00-19, we recorded a cumulative effect
adjustment for the change in accounting principle to recognize the fair value of certain put and call options indexed to our own
stock as an asset. The cumulative change was not recorded net of tax because the option settlement, if any, will be
non-taxable. We adjust the carrying value of these derivative instruments to their fair value at the end of each reporting period, with
the change in fair value being recorded as a gain or lose in our statement of operations. For additional information about our
accounting for these equity derivatives, refer to our discussion of Investments in Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to Lam
Research Corporation Stock, included in Critical Accounting Polices in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.

Based on a June 28, 2002 stock price of $17.98, the fair value of the equity derivatives was $24.8 million,
which resulted in a non-taxable loss of $8.2 million for fiscal 2002.

Tax Expense (Benefit)

Our effective annual income tax rate was 31.7%, excluding the loss on equity derivative contracts
indexed to our stock in fiscal year 2002, and 30.0% and 13.5% in fiscal years 2001 and 2000, respectively. The cumulative loss from
the change in fair value of our equity derivatives indexed to our stock is non-taxable.   The fiscal year 2000 rate reflected the
benefit of net operating losses and research and development tax credits carried over from prior periods.  During the first quarter
of fiscal 2002, income tax benefit was recorded using a 10.0% tax rate estimate; income tax benefit in subsequent fiscal 2002
quarters was recorded using a 30.0% tax benefit rate estimate. The increase in the tax benefit rate results from the tax benefit of
the R&D credit being proportionately greater in subsequent quarters due to lower projected pretax income and our continued and
substantial investment in engineering and development programs qualifying for R&D tax benefits.

Deferred Tax Assets

We had gross deferred tax assets arising from non-deductible temporary differences and tax credit
carryforwards of $290.4 million, $244.1 million and $202.5 million in fiscal year 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The gross
deferred tax assets are offset by valuation allowances of $52.2 million, $31.2 million and $94.7 million and deferred tax liabilities
of $26.7 million, $35.6 million and $19.0 million in fiscal year 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.  Realization of the majority of
the net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income and we believe that it is more likely than
not that the assets will be realized based on forecasted profitability.  However, there can be no assurance that we will meet our
expectations of future income.  We evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assess the need for additional
valuation allowances, if any.

Outsourcing

We define aspects of our business as either core or critical capabilities and those that are in support of
these capabilities. We have identified as critical for success in the marketplace our ability to develop leading edge products, to
market and sell what we develop and to service and support directly with our customers, what we sell.  Most other activities in the
company are in support of product development, marketing and selling and customer service. Consequently, over the last 15 months, we
began implementation of an outsourcing strategy to obtain certain support services from third parties. Accordingly, during fiscal
2002, we entered into agreements to outsource elements of our manufacturing, warehousing, facilities management and information
technology functions. We believe that entering into these outsourcing programs may provide us more flexibility to scale our
operations up and down, in a more timely and cost effective manner to respond to requirements generated by the cyclical nature of our
business.  Implementing this outsourcing strategy is intended to lead to proportionally more of our employees supporting core
activities and decrease our reliance on temporary workforce during peak business cycles as well as reduce the fluctuation in
employment that occurs due to the cyclical nature of our business.

Related Party Transactions

During fiscal year 2001, our President and Chief Operating Officer signed a promissory note with Lam
entitling him to borrow up to $1.0 million dollars at 6.75% simple interest. At June 30, 2002, the entire principal amount, $1.0
million, and accrued interest was outstanding. The loan is secured by a mortgage on his personal residence and is repayable, in full, together with
accrued interest, at any time, but no later than May 8, 2005.

Subsequent Events

The 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes, ("5% Notes"), matured on September 2, 2002 and were repaid in
full. This resulted in a cash outlay of approximately $309.8 million.

At the end of August 2002, we repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares of our common stock with a market value of
$47.6 million ($13.60 per share) by physically settling certain put and call option contracts (equity derivative contracts), which
gave us the right to repurchase the shares for $39.1 million ($11.19 per share) from independent third parties. By settling the
equity derivative contracts, we were able to repurchase the shares at a discount of $8.4 million ($2.41 per share) from their fair
market value. As a result of this transaction, we recognized an increase in treasury stock of $47.6 million. From June 30, 2002
through the settlement date, the fair value of the equity derivative contracts declined by $16.4 million to $8.4 million as a result
of changes in the fair value of our common stock over the same period. This reduction in the equity derivative contracts fair value
will be included in our earnings for the quarter ending September 29, 2002.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Use of Estimates

: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that could affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition:

We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery
has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collectibility is reasonably assured, and we
have completed our system installation obligations and received customer acceptance, or are otherwise released from our installation
or customer acceptance obligations.  In the event terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize
revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance whichever occurs first.  In circumstances where
the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance and in addition, the terms of sale do not include a lapsing
acceptance provision, we will recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the
customer specifications.  Revenue related to spare parts sales, system upgrade kits and remanufactured systems is generally
recognized upon shipment.  Revenue related to services is generally recognized upon performance of the services requested by a
customer order.  Revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a term more than one month is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the term of the contract.

We changed our revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, effective June 26, 2000, based
on guidance provided in Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 ("SAB
101"), "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements."  Prior to fiscal year 2001, the Company's revenue recognition
policy was generally to recognize revenue for sales of equipment at the time of shipment.

As a result of our change in revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, and the
cumulative effect of the change on our financial statements, the deferred revenue balance upon adopton of SAB 101, as of June 26,
2000, was $433.0 million, consisting of equipment that was shipped but had not yet been accepted as of June 25, 2000.  Of this
amount, we recognized revenue of $29.1 million and $401.0 million during fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively.  At June 30, 2002, the
deferred revenue balance, including $2.9 million attributable to the cumulative effect adjustment, was approximately  $121.2 million.

Investments in Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to Lam Research Corporation Stock:

In November
2000, the FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") reached final consensus on EITF Issue No. 00-19, "Determination
of Whether Share Settlement is Within the Control of the Issuer", for the purposes of applying EITF Issue No. 96-13,
"Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company's Own Stock" ("EITF
00-19").  EITF 96-13 addresses accounting for equity derivative contracts indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company's
own stock ("equity derivatives") by providing guidance for distinguishing between permanent equity, temporary equity and
assets and liabilities.  Under EITF 00-19, equity derivatives that were issued prior to September 20, 2000, and classified as
permanent equity must meet certain criteria or be re-classified as assets or liabilities. To qualify as permanent equity, all the
following criteria must be met: the equity derivative contract must permit the company to settle in unregistered shares, the company
must have sufficient authorized but unissued shares available to settle the contract, the contract must contain an explicit limit on
the number of shares to be delivered in a share settlement, there can be no requirement in the contract to post collateral, there can
be no "make whole" provisions in the contract that require cash settlement and there can be no provisions in the contract
that indicate the counterparty has rights that rank higher than those of a common shareholder. Equity derivative contracts accounted
for as permanent equity are recorded at their initial fair value, and subsequent changes in fair value are not recognized unless a
change in the contract classification occurs. Equity derivative contracts not qualifying for permanent equity accounting are recorded
at fair value as an asset or liability with subsequent changes in fair value recognized through the statement of operations.

Lam equity derivatives include certain put and call options indexed to our own stock.  Application of EITF
00-19 requires these instruments be recorded at their fair value at the end of each reporting period, the change in fair value being
recorded as a gain or loss on our statement of operations. Our equity derivatives are collateralized by restricted cash of $9.1
million and may not be settled in unregistered shares.

In accordance with EITF 00-19, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment
for the change in accounting principle to recognize the fair value of these put and call options indexed to our own stock as an
asset. The June 24,

2001 cumulative effect adjustment, a gain of $33.1 million ($0.25 per diluted share), was based on a
June 24, 2001 stock price of $28.50. The cumulative change in fair value was not recorded net of tax because the option settlement
will be non-taxable.

Based on a June 28, 2002, stock price of $17.98, the $24.8 million fair value of the equity derivatives
resulted in a non-taxable loss of $8.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2002. The loss is recorded in Other Income (Expense)in
the June 2002 Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. The fair value of the options is recorded in Other Current Assets.

See "Subsequent Events" included herein Item 7
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"for
information concerning the settlement of our equity derivatives.

Refer to Item 7A,  "Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk" for additional
information about our investments in equity derivative financial instruments.

Inventory Valuation:

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market
using standard costs, which approximate actual cost.  We maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity
on-hand and standard cost for each product, including purchased components, subassemblies and finished goods. We  maintain the
integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand.  Finished goods are reported as
inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer.  Generally, title transfer is documented in the terms of sale. When
the terms of sale do not specify when title transfers, we assume title transfers when we complete physical delivery of the products.

Standard costs are generally re-assessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs, generally
the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts and currently achievable assembly and test labor and overhead for
manufactured products. Manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned
to fully absorb spending at average utilization volumes.  All intercompany profits related to the sale and purchase of inventory
between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements.

The assembly outsourcing initiative has and will continue to alter the composition of reported cost of sales.
Over time, proportionately more costs will comprise purchased materials and less will represent manufacturing labor and overhead,
reflecting the substitution of our assembly activities with the purchase of completed modules and integrated units from new outsource
assembly vendors.

Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly.  Our
policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories, including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods and
spare parts in each reporting period. Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management's estimated usage requirements over the
next 12 to 36 months based on estimated customer product orders is written-down to its estimated market value, if less than cost.
Inherent in the estimates of market value are management's estimates related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand,
technological and or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, possible alternative uses and ultimate realization
of excess inventory. If future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory
write-downs may be required, and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made.

Installation and Warranty:

Typically, part of marketing and selling semiconductor capital equipment
includes installing and providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system.  We generally
record actual labor and material expenses for installation activities to cost of sales upon equipment acceptance and revenue
recognition.  We also provide a contractual performance warranty on our systems, the period of which runs concurrent with the system
installation process, generally 12 months from system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from the date of shipment of the system to
the customer.  We record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition. The
amount recorded is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified
for any known differences such as a new, simpler installation process or the impact of system reliability improvements.   Where
customer and system specific installation and warranty reserves are established, all actual parts and labor costs incurred in
subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping.

Actual warranty expenses incurred on a system-by-system basis, and overall, may differ from our original
estimates. While we consistently monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred
are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are
identified.  Accordingly, actual costs that exceed the estimates are expensed as incurred and at the same time, additional probable
and estimable liabilities recorded.

We do not maintain general or unspecified provisions or reserves; all warranty reserves are related to
specific systems.  Historically, including the most recent 12 months ended June 30 2002, all warranty obligations have been
determined with reasonable estimates.

In addition to the provision of standard warranties, the company provides customer paid extended warranty
services.  Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services, with a term of more than one month, are recognized on a prorated
straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are
determined to be probable and estimable.

At June 30, 2002, warranty reserves were $15.5 million, compared to $28.3 million at June 24, 2001.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Option Plans:

We account for our stock
purchase plan and stock option plans under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 "Accounting For Stock
Issued to Employees" ("APB 25") and make pro forma footnote disclosures as though the fair value method under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, "Accounting For Stock-Based Compensation" ("FAS 123"), were
followed.  Our employee stock purchase plan is a non-compensatory plan and our stock option plans are accounted for using
the intrinsic value method under the provisions of APB 25.

Pro forma net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share disclosed in the footnotes to our consolidated
financial statements are estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model.  The Black-Scholes option valuation model was
developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and which are fully transferable.
In addition, the Black-Scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility
and the estimated life of each option.  Because our stock-based awards to employees have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair
value estimate, in management's opinion the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of
our stock-based awards to employees.

Deferred Income Taxes

: We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred taxes to the amount that
is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered future estimated taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in
determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of
our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination
is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the
previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. Our current valuation allowance covers the tax benefit from the exercise
of employee stock options. When these tax benefits are realized, the valuation allowance will be reversed and credited to capital in
excess of par value.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Impairment or Disposals of Long-Lived Assets

: In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 ("FAS 144"), "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-
Lived Assets". FAS 144 supersedes FAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to Be Disposed Of", and applies to all long-lived assets (including discontinued operations). We are required to adopt
FAS 144 at the beginning of fiscal 2003.  FAS 144 is applied prospectively upon adoption and is not anticipated to have a material
impact on our consolidated financial position or operating results.

Costs associated with Exit or Disposal Activities:

In July 2002, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 146 "

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

" ("FAS
146").  FAS 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies EITF
Issue No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including
Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)" ("EITF 94-3").  The principal difference between FAS 146 and EITF 94-3 relates to FAS
146's requirements for the timing of recognizing a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity. FAS 146
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred.
Under EITF 94-3 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity's commitment to an exit plan.  FAS 146 is
effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002, with early adoption encouraged.  FAS 146 is
applied prospectively upon adoption and is not anticipated to have a material impact on our current financial position or results of
operations.

Consolidation of Certain Special-Purpose Entities

: In June 2002, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft of a proposed
Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51,

Consolidated Financial Statements

"Consolidation of Certain
Special-Purpose Entities"(the proposed Interpretation or Exposure Draft)

that establishes accounting guidance for consolidation
of special-purpose entities ("SPE"). The proposed Interpretation will apply to any business enterprise, both public and private, that
has a controlling interest, contractual relationship or other business relationship with an SPE. The Exposure Draft provides guidance
for determining when an entity, the Primary Beneficiary, should consolidate another entity, a SPE, that
functions to support the activities of the Primary Beneficiary. The proposed Interpretation may result in our having to consolidate
the operating results of a SPE or similar entity, which is a lessor under one of our operating lease agreements. The FASB expects to
issue the Interpretation in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2002. The effective date of these proposed new rules on our current
operating leases could be as early as the beginning of our fiscal quarter ending June 2003, and sooner on any new leases entered into
after the new rules' effective date which utilize SPEs or equivalent lease structures. Implementation of this
Exposure Draft, when and if it becomes a final accounting rule, could require us to consolidate the activities of the SPE and
recognize the asset and related liability.

Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others:

In May 2002, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft of a proposed Interpretation that would require a company that is a
guarantor to make specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued.  The proposed
Interpretation would also require a company ("the guarantor") to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the
obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The proposed Interpretation does not provide guidance on the subsequent
measurement of the guarantor's recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee. The proposed Interpretaton would also
incorporate, without change, the guidance in FASB Interpretation No. 34,

"Disclosure of Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others

"

which is being superseded.  Implementation of this Exposure Draft, when and if it becomes a final accounting rule
would be effective for financial statements for periods ending after December 25, 2002 and would be applied only on a prospective
basis to guarantees issued after December 31, 2002. The proposed Interpretation is not anticipated to have a material impact on our
current financial position or results of operations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of June 30, 2002, we had $945.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and
restricted cash compared with $925.4 million at June 24, 2001.

Subsequent event: The 5% Notes, principal amount of $309.8 million, matured on September 2, 2002, and were redeemed in cash. The
proceeds we used to redeem the 5% Notes came primarily from short-term investments that had matured subsequent to June 30, 2002.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $21.8 million in fiscal 2002. Net loss for the year of $90.1
million adjusted for non-cash charges of  $138.5 million, resulted in positive cash flow of  $48.4 million, which was partially
offset by uses of working capital totaling  $26.6 million. Non-cash charges include items such as depreciation and amortization,
patent litigation settlement, restructuring charges, deferred income taxes, impairment charges and the adjustment for the loss on
equity derivative contracts in company stock.

Significant changes in current assets and liabilities resulted from improved accounts receivable turnover and
the continued use of programs to selectively sell accounts receivables, which resulted in a $118.2 million improvement. Additionally,
highly controlled purchasing processes combined with lower shipments and inventory write-downs for excess, obsolete, and older-
generation products reduced inventory by approximately $96.5 million. Accrued liabilities declined by $65.4 million due to reduced
compensation and warranty liabilities. Deferred profits for shipments not yet recognized as revenue fell $187.4 million,
in line with equipment delivery trends.

Net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2002 was $88.1 million, down from $427.5 million in 2001.
Significant uses of cash in fiscal 2002 included net purchases of short-term investments of $65.4 million and limited capital
expenditure projects of $10.6 million. Additionally, restricted cash increased $10.5 million, mostly due to collateral requirements
of our interest rate swap agreement.

Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2002 was $16.3
million. Net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock generated $19.4 million. We repurchased $10.7 million of common stock and
reissued $16.3 million of treasury stock through the employee stock purchase program.  Principal payments on debt and capital lease
obligations were $8.7 million.

Property and equipment was $67.5 million at June 30, 2002, compared to $126.5 million at June 24, 2001. The
decrease in property and equipment in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 is primarily due to minimum expenditures for capital
projects during fiscal 2002, write-offs of leasehold improvements and certain fixed assets related to buildings that we have vacated
due to restructuring activities, and impairments of certain laboratory and demonstration equipment.

At June 30, 2002, our contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to our debt retirements, lease
payments, other long-term liabilities, and outsourced functions are as follow:

Debt and other               Outsourcing

(1) The 5% Notes, principal amount of $309.8 million, mature on September 2, 2002 and are included in the Current
Liabilities section of the Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2002.

Debt financing includes two Convertible Subordinated Notes and a Yen-denominated term loan.  Details of the
Convertible notes are:

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we entered into a three-year Yen-denominated term loan
for approximately ¥6.0 billion ($48.5 million at June 30, 2002) with a syndicate of financial institutions, in order to fund our
Japanese subsidiary operations. The entire principal amount under the new term loan is due at maturity, June 11, 2004, and has a
floating interest rate based on the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate ("TIBOR"), which at June 30, 2002, was 2.6% per annum.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional
amount of $300 million in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the Company's 4% Notes, attributable to changes in the
benchmark interest rate. The transaction swapped 4% fixed interest payments for variable interest payments based on the London
Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") based interest rate, resulting in interest expense savings of approximately $3.5 million
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2002. Should 6-month LIBOR interest rates rise above approximately 5% per annum in future periods,
incremental interest expense to the Company may be incurred. Under the terms of the transaction, we must provide collateral to match
any mark-to-market exposure on the swap. The amount of collateral required totals a minimum of $6.0 million plus an amount equal to
the mark-to-market exposure on the swap.  Therefore, the amount of cash collateral we will have to post in the future will fluctuate
from quarter to quarter commensurate with the mark-to-market exposure on the swap instrument. Generally the required collateral will
rise as interest rates rise. At the end of fiscal 2002 we have $10.5 million in restricted cash on our balance sheet (classified as a
long-term asset) related to this transaction.

The swap is accounted for as a fair value hedge under the provisions of FAS 133. This discussion should be
read in conjunction with Note E of our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this Form 10K.

On December 19, 2001, we signed a final settlement agreement with Varian in connection with the patent
infringement litigation filed by Varian in October 1993.  Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Varian granted us a
nonexclusive license to the patents involved in the litigation.  We agreed to pay Varian $20.0 million in cash ($5.0 million in
December 2001 and the balance of $15.0 million to be paid quarterly over the next 3 years). The contractual cash obligations and
commitments table presented above includes our cash obligations at June 30, 2002, related to the Varian settlement.

We lease most of our administrative, R&D and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service offices
and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases, which expire at various dates through 2021. Generally, all of our facility leases
for buildings located at our Fremont, California headquarters and certain operating leases provide us with an option to extend the
leases for additional periods. Certain of our other facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of
inflation.

Lease agreements relating to certain buildings at our Fremont, California campus, require us to provide
guaranteed residual values totaling $97.1 million at the end of the respective lease terms which are reflected in the preceding table
($44.4 million in 2003, $25.2 million in 2005 and $27.5 million in 2006). The lessor associated with one of these lease agreements is
a SPE or equivalent structure. Presently, we account for this lease as an operating lease while the SPE owns and accounts for the
leased assets and related liabilities. The FASB has issued an Exposure Draft

"Consolidation of Certain Special Purpose
Entites"

, a proposed Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51, "

Consolidated Financial Statements"

that
establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of SPEs. Implementation of this Exposure Draft, when and if it becomes a final
accounting rule, could require us to consolidate the activities of the SPE and recognize the asset and related liability.

Additionally, one of our lease agreements includes collateral restrictions that require us to maintain a
certain amount of cash, $51.4 million at June 30, 2002, in restricted specified interest bearing accounts.  These restricted cash
accounts must be maintained through March 2003 (unless the agreement is otherwise terminated or the amount of required cash
collateral is reduced), as the underlying obligation is paid down by the lessor.

During the second half of fiscal 2002, we entered into agreements with third parties to outsource certain
elements of our manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, facilities maintenance and information technology functions. These outsourced
services should provide us with more flexibility to scale our operations in a more timely manner to respond to the cyclical nature of
our business. The contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum outsourcing obligations at
June 30, 2002 under these arrangements. Actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual
service provided. In addition to minimum spending commitments, these agreements provide for potential cancellation charges including
the assumption of leases, assets and employees.

Consignment inventories, which are owned by vendors but located in our storage locations and warehouses, are
not reported as inventory until title is transferred or our purchase obligation is determined. At June 30, 2002, vendor owned
inventories held at Lam and not reported as inventory were approximately $15 million.

In fiscal 1999, we entered into certain option transactions with independent third parties (the "third
parties") for the purchase and sale of our Common Stock. Our Board of Directors authorized us to acquire from the third parties
options to purchase up to 10.5 million shares of our Common Stock. These call options were to be acquired to offset the anticipated
dilutive effect of a potential conversion into Common Stock of the 5% Convertible Subordinated Notes previously issued by us, and
which became due September 2, 2002.  As part of the program, the Board of Directors also authorized us to enter into the sale of put
options with the same third parties covering up to 15.75 million shares of our Common Stock. We anticipated that the premiums we
would receive over the course of the program from the sale of the put options to the third parties would offset in full the premium
cost of our purchase of the call options from those same third parties.

Pursuant to the authorization described above, as of June 30, 2002, we have acquired call options to
purchase 3.72 million shares of our Common Stock; the weighted-average exercise price of these options is $11.29. The call options
provide that our maximum benefit at expiration is $17.97 per option share (the difference between $29.26, which is the conversion
price of the 5% Notes issued in August 1997, and the weighted average exercise price of the call options). We also entered into put
option contracts with these same third parties covering 5.58 million shares of our Common Stock, giving those third parties the right
to sell to us shares of our Common Stock at a weighted average price of $9.48 per share

.

On June 1, 2002, all but one of these
outstanding put option contracts expired.  As of June 30, 2002, we have one remaining put option contract with a third party covering
3.04 million shares of our Common Stock, giving the third party the right to sell to us shares
of our Common Stock at a weighted-average price of $9.32 per share.

The call and put options are European style options exercisable upon expiration; all of the options expire no
later than September 3, 2002, which is the business day following the date on which the 5% Notes must either be converted or retired.
Upon option exercise, we have the ability, at our discretion, to permit the options to be physically settled (i.e., shares would be
delivered to us against payment of the exercise price), settled in cash (i.e., by a payment from one party to the other of the value
of the option being exercised) or "net settled" in shares (i.e., by delivery of a number of shares of common stock having a
value equal to the value of the option being exercised).  Certain scenarios may require that we deliver cash to the counter-party to
achieve full settlement under the terms of the instruments. We can also terminate the options prior to expiration for a settlement
value determined from time to time by the appropriate Third Party. While the options are only exercisable at expiration, the terms of
the contracts with the third parties provide for early termination and settlement of the options upon the occurrence of certain
events (in a form determined by us which includes net settlement of shares), including without limitation our material breach of the
agreement, default on certain indebtedness or covenants relating to our financial condition, reduction in our S&P credit rating
below B or a drop in the price of our Common Stock to less than $1.67 per share.

We account for these derivative financial instruments, indexed and potentially settled in our stock, under the
provisions of EITF 00-19.  At June 30, 2002, the instruments had a net fair value of $24.8 million and are included in "Other
Current Assets".

If the average stock price is below $9.32 during any period, the required number of shares to net settle the
Company's obligation under the put option agreement would be considered dilutive securities in our dilutive earnings per share
("EPS") calculation.

See "Subsequent Events" included herein Item 7
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"
for information concerning the repayment of our 5%  Notes that matured September 2, 2002 and  the settlement of our equity
derivatives.

Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintenance of sufficient
liquidity reserves is important to ensure our ability to sustain levels of investment in R&D and capital infrastructure through
ensuing business cycles. Based upon our current business outlook, our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at
June 30, 2002, combined with cash conservation activities, are expected to be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels
of operations, investments, capital expenditures,  settlement in cash of our 5% Notes which matured on September 2 2002, and settlement
of equity derivative contracts through at least the end of calendar year 2003.

In the longer-term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues, and our ability to appropriately size our
business based on demand for our products.

Risk Factors

Our Quarterly Revenues and Operating Results are Unpredictable

Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number
of factors, not all of which are in our control.  These factors include, but are not limited to:

economic conditions in the semiconductor industry generally, and the equipment industry specifically;

the extent that customers use our products and services in their business;

customer acceptances of equipment;

the size and timing of orders from customers;

customer cancellations or delays in our shipments, installations and/or acceptances;

our ability in a timely manner to develop, introduce and market new, enhanced and competitive products;

our competitors' introduction of new products;

legal or technical challenges to our products and technology;

new or modified accounting regulations;

changes in average selling prices and product mix;

exchange rate fluctuations; and

exposure on interest rate swap agreements.

We manage our expense levels in part on our expectations of future revenues. If revenue levels in a particular
quarter do not meet our expectations, our operating results may be adversely affected. We derive our revenue primarily from the
shipment and acceptance of a relatively small number of high-priced systems.  Our systems can range in price from approximately
$400,000 to $4 million per unit. Because our operating expenses are based on anticipated future revenues, and a high percentage of
those expenses are relatively fixed, a change in the timing of recognition of revenue and the level of gross profit from a single
transaction can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter.

Our operating results for a quarter may suffer substantially if:

we ship fewer systems than we anticipate in any quarter;

our customers delay final acceptance of our shipments;

we do not receive anticipated purchase orders in time to enable shipment or acceptance of equipment during a
given quarter;

one or more customers delays or cancels anticipated shipments and/or installations;

shipments are delayed by procurement shortages or manufacturing or transportation difficulties; or

our suppliers or outsource vendors fail to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with our expectations.

Further, because most of our manufacturing and administrative operations and capacity is located at our
Fremont, California facility, natural, physical, logistical or other events or disruptions affecting this facility (including labor
disruptions, earthquakes and power failures) could adversely impact our financial performance.

Variations in the Amount of Time it Takes for Our Customers to Accept Our Systems May Cause Fluctuation in Our
Operating Results

In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued SAB No. 101 "Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements."  SAB 101 provides guidance on the recognition of revenue for sales that involve contractual customer
acceptance provisions and product installation commitments.  Prior to SAB 101, we generally recognized new systems revenue on the
date the equipment was shipped to customers. Under SAB 101, we now generally recognize revenue for new equipment on the date of
customer acceptance or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse.  As a result, the fiscal period in which we are
able to recognize new systems revenues is subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our
equipment after shipment and installation, which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate.

The Semiconductor Equipment Industry is Volatile and Reduced Product Demand has a Negative Impact on
Shipments

Our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in
turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products using integrated circuits.  The
semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and historically experiences periodic downturns.  In late fiscal 1999, increased demand
for our products drove revenue growth throughout fiscal 2000 and early fiscal 2001.  In the later part of the December 2000 quarter,
we began to see signs that this upturn was slowing and that customers were considering reductions in equipment purchases during the
first half of calendar year 2001.  These signs were confirmed in calendar year 2001, as semiconductor manufacturers canceled or
delayed delivery of orders as a result of overcapacity.  The resulting demand contraction had a negative impact on the level of
system shipments during fiscal 2002.

Fluctuating levels of investment by the semiconductor manufacturers and pricing volatility are expected to
continue to materially affect our aggregate shipments, revenues and operating results.  We will continue to respond to these
fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at alignment of our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams, which sometimes
result in restructuring charges.  Even during periods of reduced revenues, we must continue to invest in product research and
development and to maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive, which may
temporarily harm our financial results.

We Depend on New Products and Processes for Our Success.  For this Reason, We are Subject to Risks
Associated with Rapid Technological Change

Rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure
to develop technological advances enabling such processes.  We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to
develop, manufacture, and successfully introduce new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing
products.  Due to the risks inherent in transitioning to new products, we strive to accurately forecast demand for new products while
managing the transition from older products.  If new products have reliability or quality problems our performance may be impacted by
reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty
expenses.  We may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully, or new products that we introduce may fail in the
marketplace, which would materially and adversely affect our results from operations.

We expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and to pursue joint
development relationships with customers or other members of the industry.  We must manage product transitions and joint development
relationships successfully, as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products.  Future
technologies, processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive
products, or obsolete inventory, or both.  We may be unable in a timely manner to develop and introduce new products or enhancements
to our existing products which satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance. In addition, in connection with the development
of new products, we will invest in pilot production inventory.  Our failure to complete commercialization of these new products in a
timely manner could result in inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results.

We are Subject to Risks Associated with the Introduction of New Products

We expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future competitors. We believe
that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and are planning to introduce new products,
which may affect our ability to sell our products. Furthermore, our own introduction of new products represents significant
investments of our resources and their success, or lack thereof, could have a material effect on our financial results.

We are Subject to Risks Relating to Product Concentration and Lack of Product Revenue Diversification

We derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products, and we expect
these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term.  Continued market acceptance of our
primary products is, therefore, critical to our future success.  Our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows
could therefore be adversely affected by:

a decline in demand for our products;

a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our products;

an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the market we participate in;

technological change that we are unable to address with our products; and

a failure to release new enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis.

We are Dependent Upon a Limited Number of Key Suppliers

We obtain certain components and sub-assemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a
limited group of suppliers. Generally, each of our key suppliers has a one-year blanket purchase contract under which we may issue
purchase orders. We may renew these contracts periodically.  Each of these component suppliers sold us products during at least the
last four years, and we expect that we will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we will otherwise replace them
with competent alternative source suppliers. Several of our outsourced assembly suppliers are new providers to Lam; where practical
our intent is to establish alternative sources.  Nevertheless, a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could impair our
ability to ship products, lower our revenues and thus adversely affect our operating results and result in damage to our customer
relationships.

Our Outsource Providers May Fail to Perform as We Expect

We are expanding the role that outsource providers play in our business.  We anticipate that these
outsource providers will play keys roles in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative
functions.  Although we aim at selecting reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts,
it is possible that one or more of these providers will fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on
our business.  In addition, the expanded role of outsource providers will require us to implement changes to our existing operations
and to adopt new procedures to deal with and manage the performance of these outsource providers.  Any delay or failure in the
implementation of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely affect our customer relationships and have a negative
effect on our operating results.

Once a Semiconductor Manufacturer Commits to Purchase a Competitor's Semiconductor Manufacturing Equipment,
the Manufacturer Typically Continues to Purchase that Competitor's Equipment, Making it More Difficult for Us to Sell our Equipment
to that

Customer

Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer
processing equipment into a semiconductor production line.  We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular
supplier's processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application.
Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor's
equipment.

We May Lack the Financial Resources or Technological Capabilities of Certain of Our Competitors Needed to
Capture Increased Market Share

We believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad
range of products, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process research and
development. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing,
marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the
semiconductor equipment industry. In addition, there are smaller, emerging semiconductor equipment companies that may provide
innovative technology that may have performance advantages over systems we currently, or expect to, offer.

We anticipate our competitors will continue to improve the design and performance of their current products
and processes and to introduce new products and processes with enhanced performance characteristics.  If our competitors enter into
strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, it could
adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers.  In addition, competitors with higher levels of financial
resources than we have may deeply discount or give away products similar to those we sell.  For these reasons, we may fail to
continue to compete successfully worldwide.

Our present or future competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or
may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements.  In particular, while we currently are developing
additional product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete
the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve
market acceptance or be competitive.  Accordingly, we may be unable to continue to compete in our markets, competition may intensify
or future competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash
flows.

Our Future Success Depends on International Sales

Non-U.S. sales accounted for approximately 71% of our total revenue in fiscal 2002, 70% in fiscal 2001
and 71% in fiscal 2000.  We expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue
in future years.  International sales are subject to risks, including, but not limited to:

foreign exchange risks;

changing import/export requirements;

foreign trade disputes; and

economic, political, banking and currency problems in the relevant region.

We currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of exchange rate
fluctuations on Yen-denominated sales and assets, and will continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined in
the foreseeable future.

A Failure to Comply with Environmental Regulations May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results

We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic,
volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals.  We believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have
obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise addressing) all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business. These permits
generally relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes.  Nevertheless, the failure to comply with present or future regulations could
result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers' acceptance
of our products.  These regulations could require us to alter our current operations, to acquire significant equipment or to incur
substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations.  Our failure to control the use, sale, transport or disposal of
hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities.

Our Ability to Manage Potential Growth or Decline; Integration of Potential Acquisitions and Potential
Disposition of Product Lines and Technologies Creates Risks for Us

Current conditions in the semiconductor equipment industry challenges our management to control
spending on operating activities. If we experience rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we may face
significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems and
procedures on a timely basis and training, managing and appropriately sizing our work force.  There can be no assurance that we will
be able to perform such actions successfully.

In the future, we may make acquisitions of complementary companies, products or technologies, or we may reduce
or dispose of certain product lines or technologies, which no longer fit our long-term strategies. Managing an acquired business,
disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entail

numerous operational and financial risks,
including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups,
diversion of management's attention to other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key
employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations among others.  Our success will depend, to a significant extent, on the
ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such growth, decline, integration of potential
acquisitions, disposition of product lines or technologies, or reduction in personnel or that our management, personnel or systems
will be adequate to support continued operations.  Any such inabilities or inadequacies would have a material adverse effect on our
business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.

An important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our
existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, or enhance our technological capabilities.   We may acquire
additional businesses, products or technologies in the future.  Any acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive
issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of related intangible assets and
goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations, and/or the price of our Common Stock.

The Market for Our Common Stock is Extremely Volatile, which May Affect our Ability to Raise Capital or Make
Acquisitions

The market price for our Common Stock is extremely volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the
past years.  The trading price of our Common Stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to factors,
including but not limited to the following:

general market, semiconductor, or semiconductor equipment industry conditions;

global economic fluctuations;

variations in our quarterly operating results;

variations  in our revenues or earnings from levels that securities analysts forecast;

announcements of restructurings, technological innovations, reductions in force, departure of key employees,
consolidations of operations or introduction of new products;

government regulations;

developments in, or claims relating to, patent or other proprietary rights;

disruptions with key customers or suppliers; or

political, economic or environmental events occurring globally or in  any of our key sales regions.

In addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations.  Recent volatility in the
price of our Common Stock was tied in part to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for
semiconductors.  These broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our Common Stock,
regardless of our actual operating performance.  In the past, following volatile periods in the price of stock, many companies become
the object of securities class action litigation.  If we are sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs, and
it could divert management's attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on the price for our Common Stock.

Risk Associated With Our Interest Rate Swap Agreement

We aim to limit the impact of interest rate exposure associated with our interest rate sensitive
investments and debt obligations. To minimize the effect of the interest rate exposure associated with our 4% Notes, we have entered
into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $300 million.  We entered into the swap in order to hedge changes in
the fair value of our 4% Notes, attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate, by swapping 4% fixed interest payments for
variable interest payments based on the LIBOR based interest rate.

If 6-month LIBOR based interest rates remain at current levels or decrease we expect the swap will result in
interest savings. However, a rise in 6-month LIBOR based interest rates above approximately

5 % per annum in future periods
could result in incremental levels of interest expense.

The Potential Anti-Takeover Effects of Our Bylaws Provisions and the Rights Plan We have in Place May Affect
Our Stock Price and Inhibit a Change of Control Desired by Some of Our Stockholders

In 1997, we adopted a Rights Plan (the "Rights Plan") in which rights were distributed as a
dividend at the rate of one right for each share of our Common Stock, held by stockholders of record as of the close of business on
January 31, 1997, and thereafter.  In connection with the adoption of the Rights Plan, our Board of Directors also adopted a number
of amendments to our Bylaws, including amendments requiring advance notice of stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder
proposals.

Our Rights Plan may have certain anti-takeover effects.  Our Rights Plan will cause substantial dilution to a
person or group that attempts to acquire Lam in certain circumstances.  Accordingly, the existence of the Rights Plan and the
issuance of the related rights may deter certain acquirers from making takeover proposals or tender offers.  The Rights Plan,
however, is not intended to prevent a takeover. Rather it is designed to enhance the ability of our Board of Directors to negotiate
with a potential acquirer on behalf of all of our stockholders.

In addition, our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes issuance of 5,000,000 shares of undesignated
Preferred Stock.  Our Board of Directors, without further stockholder approval, may issue this Preferred Stock on such terms as the
Board of Directors may determine, which also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of Lam.  The
issuance of Preferred Stock could also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our Common Stock, including causing the
loss of voting control. Moreover, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law restricts certain business combinations with
"interested stockholders", as defined by that statute.

Intellectual Property and Other Claims Against Us Can Be Costly and Could Result in the Loss of Significant
Rights which are Necessary to Our Continued Business and Profitability

Third parties may assert infringement, unfair competition or other claims against us.  Additionally,
from time to time, other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property
rights. In addition, our Bylaws and indemnity agreements with certain officers, directors and key employees provide that we will
indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to Lam.  In
such cases, it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses on commercially reasonable terms.  However, we may
be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all and any litigation resulting from
these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results.

In September 1999, Tegal Corporation sued us seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based on our
alleged infringement of certain patents Tegal holds.  Specifically, Tegal identified our 4520XLe

ä

and Exelan

â

products as infringing the patents Tegal is asserting. Litigation is inherently uncertain, and we may fail to prevail in this
litigation.  However, we believe that the Tegal lawsuit will not materially adversely affect our operating results or financial
position. See Part I Item 3 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the Tegal lawsuit.

We May Fail to Protect Our Proprietary Technology Rights, which Would Affect Our Business

Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology.  While we attempt to protect our
proprietary technology through patents, copyrights and trade secret protection, we believe that our success also depends on
increasing our technological expertise, continuing our development of new systems, increasing market penetration and growth of our
installed base, and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers.  However, we may be unable to protect our
technology in all instances, or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology independently.  We currently hold
a number of United States and foreign patents and pending patent applications.  However, other parties may challenge or attempt to
invalidate or circumvent any patents the United States or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue
pending applications.  In addition, the rights granted or anticipated under any of these patents or pending patent applications may
be narrower than we expect or in fact provide no competitive advantages.

Item 7A

.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate
primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt obligations. We maintain a conservative investment policy, which focuses on
the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, and reinvestment risk. The table below
presents principal amounts and related weighted-average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and long-term
debt obligations at June 30, 2002, and June 24, 2001:

We mitigate default risk by targeting investments in high credit quality securities and by constantly
positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or
guarantor. The portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity
and maintain a prudent amount of diversification.

We have no cash flow exposure related to our fixed rate $309.8 million and $300.0 million Convertible
Subordinated Notes.  However, we do have cash flow exposures on the interest expense related to our ¥6.0 billion ($48.5 million at
June 30, 2002) Yen-denominated bank term loan because the lending rates under that term loan vary with TIBOR.

We conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies. As such, we are
potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates.  For this reason, we enter into
foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the value of our Yen-denominated assets.
The changes in the fair value of these contracts are adjusted to fair value and recorded in other income and expense.  In addition,
we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts. We defer the gains and losses on
these contracts and recognize them in income during the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income.

On June 30, 2002, the notional amount of outstanding yen forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was
$48.3 million. The unrealized loss on the contracts on June 30, 2002, was $0.8 million. A 15% appreciation of the yen would result in
an unrealized loss of $8.5 million, while depreciation in the exchange rate of the yen of approximately 15% would result in an
unrealized gain of $6.4 million.

On June 30, 2002, the notional amount of outstanding yen forward contracts designated as balance sheet hedges
was $13.7 million. The unrealized loss on the contracts on June 30, 2002, was $8.6 thousand.  A 15% appreciation of the yen would
result in an unrealized gain of $2.4 million.  Depreciation in the exchange rate of the yen of approximately 15% would result in an
unrealized loss of $1.8 million.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional
amount of $300.0 million in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the Company's 4% Notes, attributable to changes in the
benchmark interest rate, by swapping 4% fixed interest payments for variable interest rates payments based on the LIBOR based
interest rate. At June 30, 2002, the fair value of the swap, $3.2 million, is recorded in Other Long-Term Assets. An increase in
rates by 1% would result in an incremental loss of $9.9 million.  A decrease in rates by 1% would result in an incremental gain of
$10.3 million.

During fiscal 1999, we entered into third party option transactions for the purchase and sale of our Common
Stock, in order to offset the dilutive effect of a potential conversion into Common Stock of the $309.8 million 5% Convertible
Subordinated Notes due September 2, 2002.  As of June 30, 2002, we acquired call options to purchase 3.72 million shares of our
Common Stock. The weighted-average exercise price of these options is $11.29. The call options provide that our maximum benefit at
expiration is $17.97 per option share (the difference between $29.26, which is the conversion price of the Notes, and the weighted
average exercise price of the call options). We also entered into put option contracts with these same third parties covering 5.58
million shares of our Common Stock, giving those third parties the right to sell to us shares of our Common Stock at a weighted
average price of $9.48 per share. On June 1, 2002, all but one of these outstanding put option contracts expired.  As of June 30,
2002, we have one remaining put option contract with a third party covering 3.04 million shares of our Common Stock, giving the third
party the right to sell to us shares of our Common Stock at a weighted-average price of $9.32 per share.

See "Subsequent Events" included herein Item 7
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"
for information concerning the repayment of our 5%  Notes that matured September 2, 2002 and  the settlement of our equity
derivatives.

Below is a table showing, at assumed exercise prices for the put and call options and market prices for
our Common Stock, our anticipated gain or (loss) under the put and call options upon exercise or upon maturity of the options
transaction.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JUNE 30, 2002

Note A: Company and Industry Information

Lam Research Corporation ("the Company") is a supplier of technically complex thin film
selective removal equipment used at the front-end of semiconductor manufacturing. The Company's product offerings include single
wafer plasma etch systems with a wide range of applications, Chemical Mechanical Planarization ("CMP") and post-CMP wafer
cleaning systems as well as post-sale services and support for these systems. The Company sells its products primarily to companies
involved in the production of semiconductors in the United States, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific. Credit risk evaluations, including
trade references, bank references and Dunn & Bradstreet ratings are performed on all new customers, and subsequent to credit
application approval, the Company monitors its customers' financial statements and payment performance. In general, the Company does
not usually require collateral on sales.

The semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical and has experienced periodic downturns, which have
had a material adverse effect on the semiconductor industry's demand for wafer processing equipment, including equipment manufactured
and marketed by Lam. Certain of the components and subassemblies included in the Company's products are obtained from a single
supplier or a limited group of suppliers. The Company believes that alternative sources could be obtained and qualified to supply
these products. Nevertheless, a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could have a severe near-term effect on Lam's
operating results and could result in damage to customer relationships.

Note B: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates

: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that could affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition:

The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collectibility is reasonably
assured, and we have completed our system installation obligations and received customer acceptance, or are otherwise released from
our installation or customer acceptance obligations.  In the event terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance
period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first.  In
circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance and in addition, the terms of sale do not
include a lapsing acceptance provision, the Company will recognize revenue when it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered
system meets all of the customer specifications.  Revenue related to spare parts sales, system upgrade kits and remanufactured
systems is generally recognized upon shipment.  Revenue related to services is generally recognized upon performance of the services
requested by a customer order.  Revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a term more than one month is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the term of the contract.

The Company changed its revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, effective June 26,
2000, based on guidance provided in Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101
("SAB 101"), "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements." Prior to fiscal year 2001, the Company's revenue
recognition policy was generally to recognize revenue for sales of equipment at the time of shipment.

As a result of the Company's change in revenue recognition policy in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, and
the cumulative effect of the change on its financial statements, the deferred revenue balance upon adoption of SAB 101, as of June
26, 2000, was $433.0 million, consisting of equipment that was shipped but had not yet been accepted as of June 25, 2000.  Of this
amount, the Company recognized revenue of $29.1 million and $401.0 million during fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively.  At June 30,
2002, the deferred revenue balance, including $2.9 million attributable to the cumulative effect adjustment, was approximately $121.2
million.

Investments in Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to Lam Research Corporation Stock:

In November
2000, the FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") reached final consensus on EITF Issue No. 00-19, "Determination
of Whether Share Settlement is Within the Control of the Issuer", for the purposes of applying EITF Issue No. 96-13,
"Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company's Own Stock" ("EITF
00-19").  EITF 96-13 addresses accounting for equity derivative contracts indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company's
own stock ("equity derivatives") by providing guidance for distinguishing between permanent equity, temporary equity and
assets and liabilities.  Under EITF 00-19, equity derivatives that were issued prior to September 20, 2000, and classified as
permanent equity must meet certain criteria or be re-classified as assets or liabilities. To qualify as permanent equity, all the
following criteria must be met: the equity derivative contract must permit the company to settle in unregistered shares, the company
must have sufficient authorized but unissued shares available to settle the contract, the contract must contain an explicit limit on
the number of shares to be delivered in a share settlement, there can be no requirement in the contract to post collateral, there can
be no "make whole" provisions in the contract that require cash settlement and there can be no provisions in the contract
that indicate the counterparty has rights that rank higher than those of a common shareholder. Equity derivative contracts accounted
for as permanent equity are recorded at their initial fair value, and subsequent changes in fair value are not recognized unless a
change in the contract classification occurs. Equity derivative contracts not qualifying for permanent equity accounting are recorded
at fair value as an asset or liability with subsequent changes in fair value recognized through the statement of operations.

Lam equity derivatives include certain put and call options indexed to its own stock.  Application of EITF 00-
19 requires these instruments to be recorded at their fair value at the end of each reporting period and the change in fair value
being recorded as a gain or loss on the Company's statement of operations. The Company's equity derivatives are collateralized by
restricted cash of $9.1 million and may not be settled in unregistered shares; accordingly they are classified as Other Short Term
Assets ($24.8 million), at the end of fiscal 2002.

In accordance with EITF 00-19, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 the Company recorded a cumulative effect
adjustment for the change in accounting principle to recognize the fair value of certain put and call options indexed to the Company's
stock as an asset. The June 24,

2001 cumulative effect adjustment, a gain of $ 33.1 million ($0.25 per diluted share), was
based on a June 24, 2001 stock price of $28.50. The cumulative change in fair value was not recorded net of tax because the option
settlement will be non-taxable.

Based on a June 28, 2002, stock price of $17.98, the $24.8 million fair value of the equity derivatives
resulted in a non-taxable loss of $8.2 million for year ended June 30, 2002. The loss is recorded in Other Income (Expense), in the
June 30, 2002 Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. The fair value of the options is recorded in Other Current Assets.

Inventory Valuation:

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or
market.  The Company maintains a perpetual inventory system continuously recording the quantity on-hand and standard cost for each
product, including purchased components, subassemblies and finished goods. The Company maintains the integrity of perpetual inventory
records through periodic physical counting.  Finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the
customer.

Management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly.  Obsolete
inventory or inventory in excess of management's estimated usage for the next 12 to 36 months customer requirements is written-down
to its estimated market value, if less than cost.  Inherent in the estimates of market value are management's estimates related to
our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and or market obsolescence, possible alternative uses and ultimate
realization of excess inventory.

Installation and Warranty:

The Company generally records actual labor and material expense for
installation activities to cost of sales upon equipment acceptance and revenue recognition.  The Company also provides a performance
warranty on its systems, the contractual warranty period of which runs concurrent with the system installation process, generally for
a period 12 months from system acceptance, not to exceed 14 months from the date of shipment to the customer.  The Company records a
provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon customer acceptance and revenue recognition. The
amount recorded is based on actual historical spending activity by type of system, customer, and geographic region, modified for any
known differences, such as a new, simpler installation process or the impact of system reliability improvements.

In addition to the provision of standard warranties, the Company provides customer paid extended warranty
services.  Revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services, with a term of more than one month, are recognized on a
straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Related costs are recorded as incurred.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Employee Stock Option Plans:

The Company accounts for its stock
purchase plan and stock option plans under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 "Accounting For Stock
Issued to Employees" ("APB 25") and makes pro forma footnote disclosures as though the fair value method under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, "Accounting For Stock-Based Compensation" ("FAS 123"), were
followed.  The Company's employee stock purchase plan is a non-compensatory plan and its stock option plans are accounted for using
the intrinsic value method under the provisions of APB 25.

Deferred Income Taxes

: Deferred income taxes arise from differences between the financial reporting
and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax laws and tax rates when those changes are enacted. The
Company uses the applicable tax rates in the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The Company records a valuation
allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that are deemed more likely than not to be realized. The provision for
income taxes represents the total of income taxes paid or payable for the current year, plus the change in deferred taxes during the
year.

Fiscal Year:

The Company follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar and its fiscal year ends on the last
Sunday of June each year.  The Company's most recent fiscal year ended on June 30, 2002 and included 53 weeks. The extra week was
included in the quarter ended December 30, 2001 and did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial
statements. The Company's next fiscal year, ending on June 29, 2003, will include 52 weeks.

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Cash Equivalents:

All investments purchased with an original maturity of three
months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.

Property

and

Equipment:

Property and equipment is stated at cost. Equipment is
depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to seven years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized by the straight-line method over the shorter of the life of the related asset or the term of the
underlying lease. Amortization of equipment under capital leases is included with depreciation.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

: The Company routinely considers whether indicators of impairment of
long-lived assets are present. If such indicators are present, the Company determines whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted
cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value. If less, the Company recognizes an impairment loss
based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is determined by discounted
future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. If the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used, the Company
recognizes an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than
the asset's carrying value. The fair value of the asset then becomes the asset's new carrying value, which the Company depreciates
over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or
fair value less cost to sell.

Foreign Currency:

The  functional currencies of the Company's European, Japanese and Asia Pacific
subsidiaries are the individual subsidiaries' local currencies. The Company's subsidiaries primarily generate and expend cash in
their local currency; billings and receipts for their labor and services are primarily denominated in the local currency (workforce
is paid in local currency); their individual assets and liabilities are primarily denominated in the local foreign currency and do
not materially impact the Company's cash flows and there is an active local sales market for the foreign subsidiaries' products and
services. Accordingly, all balance sheet accounts of these local functional currency subsidiaries are translated at the fiscal
period-end exchange rate, and income statement accounts are translated at an average rate for the period. The resulting translation
adjustments are recorded as cumulative translation adjustments, which are a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss).

Foreign Currency Exchange Forward Contracts:

The Company enters into foreign currency exchange
forward contracts to minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the value of its cash flows from forecasted revenue
denominated in Japanese Yen and foreign currency denominated assets. Foreign currency exchange forward contracts designated and
qualifying as cash flow hedges are treated as hedges for accounting purposes.  The effective portion of the contracts' gains or
losses is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders' equity, and subsequently recognized in earnings
in the same period the hedged revenue is recognized. Foreign currency exchange forward contracts acquired to hedge the gains and losses
generated by the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables recorded on Lam Research Corporation's U.S.
books, are adjusted to fair value and recorded as other income or expense. The Company does not use derivatives for trading purposes.

Reclassifications:

Certain amounts presented in the comparative financial statements for prior years
have been reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation.

Note C: R

ecent Accounting Pronouncements

Impairment or Disposals of Long-Lived Assets:

In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 ("FAS 144"), "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets". FAS 144 supersedes FAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
Be Disposed Of", and applies to all long-lived assets (including discontinued operations). The Company is required to adopt FAS
144 effective at the beginning of fiscal 2003.  FAS 144 is applied prospectively upon adoption and is not antcipated to have a material
impact on the Company's current financial position or results of operations.

Costs associated with Exit or Disposal Activities:

In July 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 146 "

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

" (FAS 146).  FAS
146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies EITF Issue No.
94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain
Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)" (EITF 94-3).  The principal difference between FAS 146 and EITF 94-3 relates to FAS 146's
requirements for the timing of recognizing a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity. FAS 146 requires that
a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred.  Under EITF 94-3 a
liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity's commitment to an exit plan.  FAS 146 is effective for exit or
disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002, with early adoption encouraged.  FAS 146 is applied prospectively
upon adoption and is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company's current financial position or results of
operations.

Consolidation of Certain Special-Purpose Entities

: In June 2002, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft of a proposed
Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51,

Consolidated Financial Statements

"Consolidation of Certain
Special-Purpose Entities"(the proposed Interpretation or Exposure Draft)

that establishes accounting guidance for consolidation
of special-purpose entities ("SPE"). The proposed Interpretation will apply to any business enterprise, both public and private, that
has a controlling interest, contractual relationship or other business relationship with a SPE. The Exposure Draft provides guidance
for determining when an entity, the Primary Beneficiary, should consolidate another entity, a SPE, that functions to support the
activities of the Primary Beneficiary. The proposed Interpretation may result in the Company having to consolidate the operating
results of a special purpose entity or similar entity, which is a lessor under one of the Company's operating lease agreements. The
FASB expects to issue the Interpretation in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2002. The effective date of these proposed new rules
on the Company's current operating leases could be as early as the beginning of our fiscal quarter ending June 2003, and sooner on
any new leases entered into after the new rules' effective date which utilize special purpose entities or equivalent lease
structures. Implementation of this Exposure Draft, when and if it becomes a final accounting rule, could require the Company to
consolidate the activities of the SPE and recognize the asset and related liability.

Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others:

In May 2002, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft of a proposed Interpretation that would require a company that is a
guarantor to make specific disclosures about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued.  The proposed
Interpretation would also require a company ("the guarantor") to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the
obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The proposed Interpretation does not provide guidance on the subsequent
measurement of the guarantor's recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee. The proposed Interpretaton would also
incorporate, without change, the guidance in FASB Interpretation No. 34,

"Disclosure of Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others

"

which is being superseded.  Implementation of this Exposure Draft, when and if it becomes a final accounting rule
would be effective for financial statements for periods ending after December 25, 2002 and would be applied only on a prospective
basis to guarantees issued after December 31, 2002. The proposed Interpretation is not anticipated to have a material impact on the
Company's current financial position or results of operations.

In management's estimate, the fair market values of the Company's investments in debt securities and
restricted cash materially approximate their carrying values (cost) at June 30, 2002 and June 24, 2001. Management assesses the fair
value of investments in debt securities that are not actively traded through consideration of interest rates and their impact on the
present value of the cash flows to be received from the investments. The Company also considers whether changes in the credit ratings
of the issuer could impact the assessment of fair value. The fair value of the Company's investments in auction rate preferred
securities is based upon par value, which approximates fair value due to the nature of the instruments.

The Company's available-for-sale securities are invested in financial instruments with a minimum rating of A2 or A, as rated
by Moody's or Standard & Poor's ("S&P"), respectively.

The amortized cost of investments in debt securities with contractual maturities, is as follows:

Management has the ability to liquidate any of its investments in order to meet the Company's liquidity needs
in the next twelve months. Accordingly, those investments with contractual maturities greater than one year from the date of purchase
have been classified as short-term on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

The fair value of the Company's convertible subordinated notes and the Company's other long-term debt is
estimated based on the current rates available for debt instruments with comparable terms and maturities. The fair value of the
Company's foreign currency forward contracts is estimated based upon the Yen exchange rates at June 30, 2002 and June 24, 2001,
respectively. See Footnotes B and I for a discussion of the equity collar and its fair value.

At June 30, 2002 and June 24, 2001, the notional amount of outstanding yen forward contracts designated as
cash flow hedges was $48,262,000 and $31,281,000, respectively.  On the same dates, the notional amount of yen forward contracts
designated as balance sheet hedges

was $13,743,000 and $15,706,000, respectively.

The Company has an agreement with a bank to sell specific Japanese Yen-denominated receivables, subject to
recourse provisions. At June 30, 2002 and June 24, 2001,  $2,017,000 and $7,966,000 of these receivables sold to the bank,
respectively, remained uncollected, of which $0 at June 30, 2002, and, $7,966,000 at June 24, 2001, were subject to recourse
provisions.

The Company has a similar agreement to sell specific U.S. Dollar-denominated receivables, subject to recourse
provisions to two financial institutions. At June 30, 2002 and June 24, 2001, $36,018,000 and $44,580,000 of these receivables,
respectively, remained uncollected, of which $3,602,000 and $4,912,000 at June 30, 2002 and June 24, 2001, respectively, were subject
to recourse provisions.

Note E: Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging

The Company carries derivative financial instruments (derivatives) on the balance sheet at their fair
value.  Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated or that do not qualify as hedges under Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("FAS 133") are recognized in
earnings immediately.  If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the
derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings (fair
value hedges) or recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) ("OCI") until the hedged item is recognized in earnings
(cash flow hedges).  The ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings.

In most countries, system sales are generally transacted in U.S. dollars. Spare parts and service sales,
in Europe and the U.S. are generally denominated in U.S. dollars and in Asia Pacific they are generally denominated in the local
country's currency. In Japan, the Company generally sells its systems and spare parts in Japanese Yen.
Therefore, in the normal course of business, the Company's financial position is routinely subjected to market risk associated with
foreign currency rate fluctuations.

The Company's policy is to minimize short-term business exposure to foreign exchange risks using the most
effective and efficient methods to eliminate or reduce such exposures.  To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted Yen-
denominated cash flows resulting from sales in Japanese Yen, the Company has instituted a foreign currency cash flow hedging program.
The Company purchases foreign currency forward exchange contracts generally expiring within 12 months, and no later than 24 months.
These foreign currency forward exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, are carried on the Company's balance sheet at fair
value with the effective portion of the contracts' gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and
subsequently recognized in earnings in the same period the hedged revenue is recognized. The Company does not use derivatives for
trading purposes.

Cash flow hedges include time value and are tested for effectiveness by comparing the foreign currency forward
rates at inception to the current market forward rate.  For the 12-month period ended June 30 2002, the Company recognized net losses
of $104,600 related to the time value excluded from the assessment of hedge ineffectiveness.

If a cash flow hedge is discontinued because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not
occur, the net gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified into earnings as a
component of Other Income (Expense), net.  For the 12-month period ended June 30, 2002, the Company recorded a $2.2 million gain for
cash flow hedges that have been discontinued, because the original forecasted transactions did not occur. The gains are recorded in
Other Income (Expense), net, in the June 2002 Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.

The following table summarizes activity in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to
derivatives classified as cash flow hedges held by the Company:

                                           ========== =========

At June 30, 2002, the Company expects to reclassify the balance of deferred hedging gains and losses, net,
included in accumulated comprehensive income (loss) to earnings during the next 12 months due to the recognition in earnings of the
hedged forecasted transactions.

The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the
remeasurement of foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables. Under FAS 133, these are not designated hedges. Therefore,
the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded in income as a component of Other Income (Expense), net and offsets the
change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables.

See Footnote D for a summary of the aggregate fair value of all outstanding foreign currency forward
contracts.

The Company also has a policy to, where possible and practical, minimize the impact of interest rate exposure
associated with its interest rate sensitive investments and debt obligations. To limit the impact relating to interest rate exposure
associated with its fixed rate 4% Notes, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement ("the swap") with a
notional amount of $300 million.  The Company entered into the swap in order to hedge changes in the fair value of its 4% Notes,
attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate, by exchanging 4% fixed interest payments for variable interest payments based
on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") rate. The swap is accounted for as a fair value hedge under the provisions
of FAS 133 with fluctuations in the fair value of the 4% Notes, resulting from changes in the LIBOR interest rate sensitive
component, recorded in earnings, and offset by changes in the fair value of the swap, which are also recorded in earnings.

Hedge ineffectiveness associated with the swap results when changes in the fair value of the swap differ from
changes in the fair value of the 4% Notes (the specific component of the underlying hedged instrument being hedged). For the 12-month
period ended June 30 2002, the Company recognized net losses of $303,000 in Other Income (Expense), net, resulting from hedge
ineffectiveness related to differences in changes in the fair value of the swap and changes in the fair value of the 4% Notes. See
Footnote D.

(1) Other, in fiscal 2002 includes a long-term patent settlement obligation. (See Footnote W).

Capital lease obligations at June 24, 2001 were collateralized by equipment with a cost and accumulated
depreciation and amortization of $4,725,000 and $(4,286,000), respectively.

Debt financing includes two Convertible Subordinated Notes and a Yen-denominated term loan.  Details of the
Convertible notes are:

The carrying value of the 4% Notes is adjusted to reflect changes in fair value attributable to changes in
the benchmark interest rate in connection with the Company's fair value hedge accomplished through the swap transaction discussed in
Footnote E. At June 30, 2002, the carrying value of the 4% Notes was increased by $3.5 million (to $303.5 million) with the
corresponding loss recorded in Other Income (Expense), net, offset by a $3.2 million gain on the carrying value of the swap.

Under the terms of the transaction, the Company must provide collateral to match any mark-to-market exposure
on the swap. The amount of collateral required totals a minimum of $6.0 million plus an amount equal to the mark-to-market exposure
on the swap. Therefore, the amount of cash collateral we will have to post in the future will fluctuate from quarter to quarter
commensurate with the mark-to-market exposure on the swap instrument. Generally the required collateral will rise as interest rates
rise. At the end of fiscal 2002 the Company has  $10.5 million of collateral (reflected as restricted cash) recorded on the
consolidated balance sheet related to this transaction.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, in order to fund the Company's Japanese subsidiary operations, the
Company entered into a three-year Yen-denominated term loan for approximately ¥6.0 billion ($48.5 million at June 30, 2002) with a
syndicate of financial institutions. The entire principal amount under the new term loan is due at maturity, June 11, 2004, and has a
floating interest rate based on the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate ("TIBOR"), which at June 30, 2002, was 2.6% per annum.

At June 30, 2002, future maturities of debt obligations are as follows:

In connection with the 5% Notes, the Board of Directors of the Company has authorized the Company to acquire from
independent third parties (the "third parties") options to purchase up to 10.5 million shares of Lam common stock. These
call options were to be acquired to offset the anticipated dilutive effect of a potential conversion into common stock of the 5%
Notes issued by the Company in August 1997 and due September 2, 2002.  As part of the program, the Board of Directors also authorized
the Company to enter into put options with the same third parties covering up to 15.75 million shares of Lam Common Stock. The Board
of Directors anticipated that the premiums the Company would receive over the course of the program from the sale of the put options
to the third parties would offset in full the premium cost to the Company of its purchase of the call options from those same third
parties.

Pursuant to the authorization described above, the Company has as of June 30, 2002, acquired call
options to purchase 3.72 million shares of Lam Common Stock; the weighted average exercise price of these options is $11.29.  The
call options provide that the maximum benefit to the Company of the call options at expiration is $17.97 per option share (the
difference between $29.26, which is the conversion price of the debentures, and the weighted average exercise price of the call
options

).

The Company also entered into put option contracts with these same third parties covering 5.58 million shares of its
Common Stock, giving those third parties the right to sell to the Company shares of Lam Common Stock at a weighted average price of
$9.48 per share

.

On June 1, 2002, all but one of these outstanding put option contracts expired.  As of June 30, 2002, the
Company has one remaining put option contract with a third party covering 3.04 million shares of its Common Stock, giving the third
party the right to sell to the Company shares of its Common Stock at a weighted-average price of $9.32 per share.

The call and put options are European style options exercisable upon expiration; all of the options
expire no later than September 3, 2002, which is the business day following the date on which the 5% Notes must either be converted
or retired.  Upon option exercise, the Company has the ability, at its option, to permit the options to be physically settled (i.e.,
shares would be delivered to the Company against payment of the exercise price), settled in cash (i.e., by a payment from one party
to the other of the value of the option being exercised) or "net settled" in shares (i.e., by delivery of a number of
shares of common stock having a value equal to the value of the option being exercised).  Certain scenarios may require the Company
deliver cash to the counter-party to achieve full settlement under the terms of the instruments.  The Company can also terminate the
options prior to expiration for a settlement value determined from time to time by the appropriate third party.  While the options
are only exercisable at expiration, the terms of the contracts with the third parties provide for early termination and settlement of
the options (in a form determined by the Company which includes net settlement of shares), upon the occurrence of certain events
including without limitation the Company's material breach of the agreement, default on certain indebtedness or covenants relating to
the Company's financial condition, reduction in the Company's S&P credit rating below B or a drop in the price of the Company's
Common Stock to less than $1.67 per share.

The Company accounts for these derivative financial instruments indexed and potentially settled in its own
stock, under the provisions of EITF 00-19.  At June 30, 2002, the instruments had a net fair value of $24.8 million and are included
in "Other Current Assets".

As of June 24, 2001, the Company has deposited $9.1 million as security for its obligations under the put options.
The Company is required to increase this amount if the Company enters into additional option transactions with the third parties.
The Company will also have to increase the amount of this security deposit by the amount from time to time that the put options are
actually in the money.

Equity

During fiscal 2002, the Company repurchased 600,000 shares of Lam Common Stock for $10.7 million
under a share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors on September 30, 1998, authorizing management to acquire up to
6,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock.  During fiscal 2001, the Company repurchased 2,405,000 shares of Lam Common Stock for
$45.1 million.  At June 30, 2002, 476,000 shares remain authorized for repurchase under this program.

Note K: Net Income (Loss) Per Share

Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss)
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The computation of basic net income (loss) per share
for all years presented is derived from the information on the face of the income statement and there are no reconciling items in
either the numerator or denominator.

Diluted earnings per share is computed as though all potential common shares that
are dilutive were outstanding during the period.  The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and the
denominators of the basic and diluted per-share computations for income (loss) from continuing operations.

Options, warrants and convertible securities were outstanding during fiscal 2002, but 29,779,000 potential
common shares were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per common share because the effect would have been
antidilutive. For fiscal year 2001, diluted net income per share includes the assumed exercise of employee stock options. The assumed
conversion of both convertible subordinated notes into 11,192,000 shares was antidilutive and therefore excluded from the computation
of diluted net income per share in fiscal 2001. For fiscal year 2000, diluted net income per share includes the assumed exercise of
employee stock options and the assumed conversion of the 5% convertible subordinated notes to common shares.

Options to purchase 4,838,000 and 845,214, shares of common stock at weighted-average prices of $40.15 and
$46.03 during fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000, respectively, were outstanding, but were excluded from the computation of diluted net
income per common share because the assumed exercise price exceeded the average market price of the Company's stock  for the period
and, therefore, would have been antidilutive.

Note M: Stock Option Plans and Stock Purchase Plan

The Company has adopted stock option plans that provide for the grant to key employees of options to
purchase shares of Lam Common Stock. In addition, the plans permit the grant of nonstatutory stock options to paid consultants and
employees, and provide for the automatic grant of nonstatutory stock options to outside directors. The option price is determined by
the Board of Directors or their designee, but in no event will it be less than the fair market value of Lam Common Stock on the date
of grant (no less than 85% of the fair market value at the date of grant in the case of nonstatutory options).  Options granted under
the plans vest over a period determined by the Board of Directors. Under the automatic grant program, each outside director receives
an option immediately exercisable for 12,000 shares of Lam Common Stock in December of each year during which the outside
director serves, with the exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant.

A summary of stock option plan transactions follows:

The 1997 Stock Incentive Plan provides for annual non-employee director options to be granted in December. 	The
1999 Stock Option Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified stock option awards to eligible employees, consultants and advisors of
the Company and its subsidiaries.  However, employees who are also members of the Board of Directors or of the Company's senior
management, or who are a principal stockholder of the Company, are not eligible to receive stock option awards under this plan.
Initially, 9,000,000 shares were reserved for issuance. The Board of Directors approved an additional 9,000,000 shares, 500,000
shares, and 6,000,000 shares in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000 respectively. In addition, during fiscal 2000, the Board of Directors
approved that the balance in the 1996 Performance-Based Restricted Stock Plan (the "RSP"), be made
available for issuance as stock options. At June 30, 2002, 55,720 of these shares are available for issuance.

The 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "1999 ESPP") allows employees to designate a portion of
their base compensation to be used to purchase Lam Common Stock at a purchase price per share of the lower of 85% of the fair market
value of Lam Common Stock on the first or last day of the applicable offering period. Typically, each offering period lasts 12 months
and comprises three interim purchase dates. The 1999 ESPP, approved by the Company's stockholders at the Annual Meeting of
Stockholders on November 5, 1998, replaced the existing 1984 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "1984 ESPP").  The Company
has 9,000,000 shares of Lam Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 1999 ESPP: 3,000,000 shares may be issued at any time and
additional shares (up to 6,000,000 total additional shares) may be issued for each share of Lam Common Stock which the Company
redeems in public-market at private purchases and designated for this purpose.

During fiscal 2002, 1,184,617 shares of Lam Common Stock were sold to employees under the 1999 ESPP. A total
of 12,651,722 shares of the Lam's Common Stock were issued under the 1999, and 1984 ESPP Plans through June 30, 2002, at prices
ranging from $0.09 to $31.84 per share.  At June 30, 2002, 3,420,082 shares are available for purchase under all employee stock
purchase plans.

The Company's RSP was designed to reward executives based upon the achievement of certain predetermined goals.
Grants are based on the fair market value of Lam's Common Stock at the end of the quarter, provided the predetermined goals are met.
The Company authorized 450,000 shares to be reserved for issuance under the Performance-Based Stock Plan. During fiscal 2000, the
Board of Directors approved that the balance in the 1996 Performance-Based Restricted Stock Plan (the
"RSP"), be made available for issuance as stock options. At June 30, 2002, 55,720 of these shares are available for issuance
as stock optons and 43,059 shares are subject to repurchase.

Pro forma information regarding net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share is required by FAS 123 for
awards granted after June 30, 1995, as if the Company had accounted for its stock-based awards to employees under the fair value
method of FAS 123. The fair value of the Company's stock-based awards to employees was estimated using a Black-Scholes option
valuation model.  The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which
have no vesting restrictions and which are fully transferable. In addition, the Black-Scholes model requires the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility.  Because the Company's stock-based awards to employees have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can
materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
measure of the fair value of the Company's stock-based awards to employees. The fair value of the Company's stock-based awards to
employees was estimated assuming no expected dividends and the following weighted-average assumptions:

Risk-free interest rate.........    4.1%    4.9%    6.2%    4.1%    4.9%    6.2%

The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2002, 2001, and 2000 was $11.77, $12.15 and $17.09
per share, respectively. The weighted average fair value of shares granted under the ESPP plans during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000 was
$6.34, $6.08 and $3.46 and per share, respectively.

For pro forma purposes, the estimated and approximate fair value of the Company's stock-based awards to employees is amortized
over the option's vesting period (for options) and the respective four, six or 12-month purchase periods (for stock purchases under
the respective employee stock purchase plans).  The Company's pro forma information follows:

Note N: Profit Sharing and Benefit Plans

Profit sharing is awarded to employees based upon performance against certain corporate financial and
operating goals. Distributions to employees by the Company are made bi-annually based upon a percentage of base salary, provided that
a threshold level of the Company's financial and performance goals are met. In addition to profit sharing the Company has other bonus
plans based on achievement of profitability and other specific performance criteria. Charges to expense under these plans were;
$2,720,000, $43,445,000, and $27,741,000 during fiscal years 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

The Company maintains a 401(k)-retirement savings plan for its full-time employees in North America. Each
participant in the plan may elect to contribute from 2% to 15% of his or her annual salary to the plan, subject to statutory

Lease agreements relating to certain buildings at the Company's Fremont, California campus, require the
Company to provide guaranteed residual values totaling $97.1 million at the end of the respective lease terms ($44.4 million in 2003,
$25.2 million in 2005 and $27.5 million in 2006) which are reflected in the preceding table.  Additionally, as part of the collateral
restrictions of a lease agreement, the Company is required to maintain a certain amount of cash, $51.4 million at June 30, 2002 and
June 24, 2001, in restricted specified interest bearing accounts.  These restricted cash accounts must be maintained through March
2003 (unless the agreement is otherwise terminated or the amount of maintained cash is reduced), as the underlying obligation is paid
down.

Total rent expense, net of sublease income, for all leases amounted to approximately $19,719,000,
$31,184,000, and $26,505,000, for fiscal years 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

The Company has subleased some of its buildings and currently is entitled to receive income of approximately
$2,510,000, $1,446,000, $1,512,000, and $903,000 for the fiscal years 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively.

For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2002, June 24, 2001, and June 25, 2000, the Company received sublease
payments totaling $3,944,000, $4,418,000, and $4,671,000, respectively, on its subleased facilities.

Under FAS 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes", deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant

Approximately $24.9 million and $13.1 million of the valuation allowance for deferred taxes, for fiscal 2002
and 2001, respectively, is attributable to stock option deductions, the benefit of which will be credited to equity when
realized.

Realization of the Company's net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income.  The Company
believes it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by
market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time.

At June 30, 2002, the Company has federal tax loss carryforwards of approximately $201.0 million, which will
expire in 2019 and 2022. The Company also has federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $54.8 million, of which
approximately $44.9 million will expire in varying amounts between 2002 and 2022. The remaining balance of $9.9 million of tax
carryforwards may be carried forward indefinitely. A valuation allowance has been provided for a portion of the deferred tax assets
related to the carryforwards.

$18,405,000, and $25,780,000, respectively. In addition, the Company received royalty and other income from foreign sources of
$303,000, $933,000, and $369,000, in fiscal years 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively, which is subject to foreign tax withholding.

Note Q: Segment, Geographic Information and Major Customers

The Company operates in one business segment: manufacturing and servicing of front-end wafer processing
semiconductor manufacturing equipment. All products and services are marketed within the geographic regions in which the Company
operates. The Company's current product offerings qualify for aggregation under FAS 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information," as its products are manufactured and distributed in the same manner, have similar long-term
gross margins and are sold to the same customer base.

The Company operates in four geographic regions: the United States, Europe, Asia Pacific and Japan. The
summary of local operations by geographic region for fiscal years 2002, 2001, and 2000 is as follows:

Sales between geographic regions are accounted for at prices that provide a profit, and are in accordance with
the rules and regulations of the respective governing authorities.  Intercompany profit and loss is eliminated in consolidation.  In
fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001, revenue in each geographic region was recognized in accordance with the Company's revenue recognition
policy based on SAB 101. During fiscal 2000, revenue in each geographic area was generally recognized upon shipment from locations
within a designated geographic region.

Total export revenue consisting of sales from the Company's U.S. operating subsidiaries to non-affiliated

No individual customer accounted for greater than 10% of total sales in fiscal 2002.  During fiscal 2001 and
fiscal 2000, a single customer accounted for approximately 15% of total sales.

Note R: Restructuring

In April 2001, the Company announced its intention to reduce its global workforce up to 15% during
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 ("the June 2001 Plan").  The reduction in force was driven by the then anticipated level
of decline in the Company's revenues due to the forecasted level of contraction of the Company's served market from calendar year
2000. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the appropriate level of management necessary to commit to the specific actions of
the plan approved the June 2001 Plan. The Company began implementing the announced restructuring plan and reduced its workforce by
approximately 11% prior to June 24, 2001.  The Company recorded a restructuring charge of $16.8 million which included severance and
benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, charges for remaining lease payments and leasehold improvements on vacated
facilities, and charges for inventories of an etch product line that has been discontinued. In addition, the Company consolidated its
Fremont manufacturing facilities and wrote-off the carrying cost of abandoned facility assets. During the fourth quarter of fiscal
2002, the Company determined that outplacement services guaranteed by the Company for terminated employees and other employee benefit
costs were not going to be fully utilized and therefore recovered $1.4 million of restructuring charges recorded in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2001. The Company also recovered $0.9 million from  certain of its etch product line inventory previously
segregated and written off.

Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the June 2001 Plan:

Severance and Benefits relates to the salary and fringe benefit expense for involuntarily terminated
employees.  Prior to June 24, 2001, management, with the proper level of authority, approved and committed to the plan of
termination, determined the benefits the terminated employees would receive and communicated the severance package to employees in
enough detail that they could determine their type and amount of benefit. The termination of the impacted employees occurred as soon
as practical after the plan of restructuring was announced. The majority of the Severance and Benefits reserve balance of $0.5
million as of June 30, 2002 is anticipated to be utilized by December 2002.

Lease Payments on Vacated Facilities relates to 24 months of rent (or the remainder of the lease term, if
less) after the abandonment of certain facilities currently under long-term operating lease agreements. The Company estimated, given
prevailing real estate market conditions, that it would take approximately 24 months to sublease its vacated buildings in Fremont,
California. When applicable, anticipated future sublease income relating to vacated buildings has been offset against the charge for
the remaining lease payments.

The Company wrote-off all leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings of approximately $1.5
million, as these items will have no future economic benefit and have been abandoned. In addition, certain demonstration equipment
and etch manufacturing inventory were abandoned and written-off.

Other exit costs relate to customer accommodations for the discontinued product line and expenses associated
with capital improvements to the vacated facilities.

By mid to late summer of 2001, further deterioration in semiconductor sales resulted in a lower outlook for
the wafer fabrication equipment market and therefore in the Company's revenues.  Consequently, in August 2001, the Company announced
a new plan ("the September 2001 Plan") to further reduce its fixed cost infrastructure, including an approximate 10%
reduction-in-force. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2002, the September 2001 Plan was approved by the appropriate level of
management necessary to commit to the specific actions of the plan. The Company began implementing the announced restructuring
activities and reduced its workforce by approximately 550 employees, worldwide prior to September 23, 2001.  The Company recorded a
restructuring charge of $21.0 million which included severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, charges for
remaining lease payments and leasehold improvements on vacated facilities, and write-offs for inventories of selected, older etch
product lines that were discontinued. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company determined that outplacement services
guaranteed by the Company for terminated employees and other employee benefit costs were not going to be fully utilized and therefore
recovered  $0.7 million of restructuring charges recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. The Company also recovered $0.8
million from certain of its  older etch inventories previously segregated and written-of and $0.3 million from facilities leases.

Below is a table summarizing activity relating to the September 2001 Plan:

Severance and Benefits relates to the salary and fringe benefit expense for involuntarily terminated
employees.  Prior to September 23, 2001, management, with the proper level of authority, approved and committed to the plan of
termination, determined the benefits the terminated employees would receive and communicated the severance package to employees in
enough detail that they could determine their type and amount of benefit. The termination of the impacted employees occurred as soon
as practical after the plan of restructuring was announced.  The majority of the Severance and Benefits reserve balance of $0.9
million as of June 30, 2002 is anticipated to be utilized by December 2002.

Lease Payments on Vacated Facilities relates to 24 months of rent (or the remainder of the lease term, if
less) after the abandonment of certain facilities currently under long-term operating lease agreements. The Company estimated, given
prevailing real estate market conditions, that it would take approximately 24 months to sublease its vacated facilities in Fremont,
California.

The Company wrote-off all leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings of approximately $935,000,
as these items have no future economic benefit and have been abandoned. Additionally, the Company exited selected, older etch product
lines and wrote-off the related discontinued manufacturing inventory.

The continued and severe degradation in the wafer fabrication equipment market in late calendar year 2001 and
its impact on the Company's near-term financial forecast necessitated another restructuring plan ("the December 2001 Plan").  On
December 20, 2001, the Company publicly announced its intention to reduce its global employment by approximately 12%, and further
consolidate its facilities. During the second fiscal quarter, the December 2001 Plan was approved by the appropriate level of
management necessary to commit to the specific actions of the plan. The Company began implementing the announced restructuring
activities and reduction of its workforce by approximately 470 employees, worldwide prior to December 30, 2001.  The Company recorded
a restructuring charge of $33.8 million relating to severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees, charges for
remaining lease payments on vacated facilities and the write-off of related leasehold improvements and fixed assets.

employees.  Prior to December 30, 2001, management, with the proper level of authority, approved and committed to the plan of
termination, determined the benefits the terminated employees would receive and communicated the severance package to employees in
enough detail that they could determine their type and amount of benefit. The termination of the impacted employees occurred as soon
as practical after the plan of restructuring was announced.  The majority of the Severance and Benefits reserve balance of $3.6
million, as of June 30, 2002 is anticipated to be utilized by December 2002.

Lease Payments on Vacated Facilities relates to 24 months of rent (or the remainder of the lease term, if
less) after the abandonment of certain facilities currently under long-term operating lease agreements. The Company estimated, given
prevailing real estate market conditions, that it would take approximately 24 months to sublease the vacated facilities in Fremont,
California.

The Company wrote off leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings of approximately $8.8 million,
as these items will have no future economic benefit and have been abandoned. Additionally, certain fixed assets of approximately $1.1
million associated with these facilities had no future economic benefit and have been abandoned and written-off.

Note S: Purchased Technology for R&D

During the second quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company made an equity investment in, and purchased a portfolio
of CMP intellectual property rights and research and development technology from Strasbaugh.  The Company recognized a one-time
charge to income of $8.0 million for the purchase of in-process research and development technology and recorded a $6.0 million
investment in preferred stock and intangible assets.  The Company's equity interest in Strasbaugh, representing approximately 20% of
Strasbaugh's total capital stock, is accounted for under the equity method and the intellectual property rights are being amortized
ratably over five years.  Accumulated amortization as of the end of fiscal 2002 and 2001 was $600,000 and $200,000, respectively.

Based on the Company's analysis of Strasbaugh's current and expected financial performance, the Company
determined in the third quarter of fiscal 2002 that the carrying value of its equity investment had
experienced an other-than-temporary impairment and recorded a $2.0 million charge in other expense to
write down the investment to its estimated fair  value.

The Company's equity in the income (loss) from Strasbaugh as of the end of fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 was
($0.8) million and $0.7 million, respectively.  The income (loss) from the investment in Strasbaugh has not been material, and,
therefore, has not been itemized in other income, net, on the accompanying statements of operations.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2000, the Company purchased in-process technology and intellectual
property rights related to the semiconductor equipment industry from Oliver Design, Inc, ("Oliver").  The Company
recognized an expense for the purchase of research development technology of approximately $7.5 million and capitalized $1.5 million
related to acquired patents, which are being amortized ratably over their estimated useful life of five years. Accumulated
amortization as of the end of fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001, was $750,000 and $450,000, respectively. The acquired R&D technology
is being used in a discrete next generation product development project and has no future alternative use.

Note T: Asset Impairment Charge

During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company determined that the carrying value of certain of its
laboratory and demonstration equipment exceeded its fair value less costs to sell. Fair value was assessed using the market values
of similar used laboratory and demonstration equipment. Impairment occurred due to rapid technological changes brought about
by the semiconductor industry's move to copper and 300-mm applications.  In accordance with FAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be disposed Of", the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $9.5
million. A $5.3 million write-down to fair value of certain laboratory tools was included in R&D expenses and a $4.2
million of write-downs to fair value of demonstration equipment were included in SG&A expenses. Remaining equipment with carrying
values totaling $1.1 million is reviewed quarterly for incremental impairment and is anticipated to be disposed of within the next
12 months.

Note U: Outsourcing Contractual Commitments

During fiscal 2002, the Company entered into agreements with third parties to outsource certain elements
of its manufacturing, warehousing, facilities management and information technology functions. In addition to the minimum materials
purchase and service spending commitments, these agreements provide for one-time transition charges of $3.1 million and cancellation
charges of $2.7 million. Transition charges are expensed in the period when incurred.

Our contractual cash obligations relating to the Company's outsourcing commitments as of June 30, 2002 are as
follow:

Outsourcing
                       Commitments
                       ---------

2003................  $  22,885
2004 ...............      6,026
2005 and thereafter.         --
                       ---------
  Total ............  $  28,911
                       =========

Note V: Related Party Transactions

During fiscal year 2001, the Company's President and Chief Operating Officer signed a promissory note with
the Company entitling him to borrow up to $1.0 million dollars from the Company at 6.75% simple interest. As of June 30, 2002, the
entire principal amount, $1.0 million, and accrued interest was outstanding. The loan is secured by a mortgage on his personal residence and is repayable,
in full, together with accrued interest, at any time, but no later than May 8, 2005.

Note W: Litigation and Patent Settlement

On December 19, 2001, the Company signed a final settlement agreement with Varian
Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. ("Varian") in connection with the patent infringement litigation filed by Varian
in October 1993.  Under the terms of the settlement agreement, Varian granted the Company a nonexclusive license to the patents
involved in the litigation.  The Company agreed to pay Varian $20.0 million in cash ($5.0 million in December 30, 2001 and the
balance of $15.0 million to be paid quarterly over the next 3 years) and issued a warrant with a fair value of $21.5 million that
entitles Varian to purchase 2,000,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock at an exercise price of $21.30 per share. As part of the
full and final settlement, Varian and the Company agreed to dismiss all pending claims and counterclaims relating to the
litigation.

In connection with the settlement, the Company recorded a charge of $38.8 million in the quarter ended
December 30, 2001, which represents approximately 93% of the total value of the settlement.  The remaining portion of the total value
of the settlement relating to the future licensed use of the patents, $2.7 million, is being amortized ratably over 10 quarters.
Accumulated amortization as of the end of fiscal 2002 was $540,000.

The imputed value of the warrant was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model.  The key assumptions
used in the valuation model were an expected life of 4 years, an expected stock price volatility of 61% and a risk-free interest rate
of 4.5%.

In September 1999, Tegal Corporation ("Tegal") brought suit against the Company seeking monetary
damages and injunctive relief based on our alleged infringement of certain patents held by Tegal.  Specifically, Tegal identified our
4520XLe

ä

and Exelan

â

products as infringing the patents Tegal is asserting. On the Company's motion, this case was transferred to California and is now
pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. To date, however, there has been no
determination as to the actual scope of those claims, or whether the mentioned products have infringed or are infringing Tegal's
patents.  No trial date is currently scheduled in the action.  Furthermore, there have been no findings in the action which have
caused the Company to reasonably believe that any infringement, if found, or any damages, if awarded, could have a material adverse
effect on our operating results or our financial position.

From time to time, the Company has received notices from third parties alleging infringement of such parties'
patent or other intellectual property rights by Lam's products.  In such cases, it is the Company's policy to defend the claims or,
if considered appropriate, negotiate licenses on commercially reasonable terms.  However, no assurance can be given that in the
future the Company will be able to negotiate necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any litigation
resulting from such claims would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or operating results.

Note X: Subsequent Events  (unaudited)

The 5% Notes matured on September 2, 2002 and were repaid in full. This resulted in a cash outlay of
approximately $309.8 million.

At the end of August 2002, the Company repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares of its common stock with a market value of $47.6
million ($13.60 per share) by physically settling certain put and call option contracts (equity derivative contracts), which gave the
Company the right to repurchase the shares for $39.1 million ($11.19 per share) from independent third parties. By settling the
equity derivative contracts, the Company was able to repurchase the shares at a discount of $8.4 million ($2.41 per share) from their
fair market value. As a result of this transaction, the Company recognized an increase in treasury stock of $47.6 million. From June
30, 2002 through the settlement date, the fair value of the equity derivative contracts declined by $16.4 million to $8.4 million as
a result of changes in the fair value of the Company's common stock over the same period. This reduction in the equity derivative
contracts fair value will be included in the Company's earnings for the quarter ending September 29, 2002.
