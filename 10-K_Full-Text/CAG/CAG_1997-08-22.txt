ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

a)   General Development of Business
     
     Nebraska Consolidated Mills Company, which was originally incorporated in
     Nebraska on September 29, 1919, changed its name to ConAgra, Inc.
     ("ConAgra" or the "Company") on February 25, 1971, and since December 5,
     1975, has been incorporated in Delaware.
     
b)   Financial Information About Industry Segments
     
     The Company's businesses are classified into three industry segments:
     Grocery & Diversified Products, Refrigerated Foods and Food Inputs &
     Ingredients.  The contributions of each industry segment to net sales and
     operating profit, and the identifiable assets attributable to each industry
     segment set forth in Note 15 "Business Segments" on pages 58 and 59 of the
     Company's 1997 Annual Report to Stockholders are incorporated herein by
     reference.
     
c)   Narrative Description of Business
     
     The information set forth in the "Business Review" on pages 15 through 33
     of the Company's 1997 Annual Report to Stockholders is incorporated herein
     by reference.
     
     The following comments pertain to the Company as a whole.
     
     ConAgra is a diversified food company that operates across the food chain,
     from basic agricultural inputs to production and sale of branded consumer
     products.  As a result, ConAgra uses many different raw materials, the bulk
     of which are commodities.  Raw materials are generally available from
     several different sources and ConAgra presently believes that it can obtain
     these as needed.
     
     Each business is highly competitive.  Many companies compete in one or more
     of the markets served by ConAgra, some of which have greater sales and
     assets than ConAgra.
     
     Quality control processes at principal manufacturing places emphasize
     applied research and technical services directed at product improvement and
     quality control.  In addition, the Refrigerated Foods and the Grocery &
     Diversified Products segments conduct research activities related to the
     development of new products.
     
     Many of ConAgra's facilities and products are subject to various laws and
     regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture,
     the Federal Food and Drug Administration, and other federal, state, local
     and foreign governmental agencies relating to the quality of products,
     sanitation, safety and environmental control.  The Company believes that it
     complies with such laws and regulations in all material respects, and that
     continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect
     upon capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the
     Company.
     
     ConAgra and its subsidiaries have more than 80,000 employees, primarily in
     the United States.



ITEM 1.   BUSINESS (Continued)
     
d)   Foreign Operations
     
     The information set forth in the "Business Review" on pages 15 through 33
     of the Company's 1997 Annual Report to Stockholders is incorporated herein
     by reference.  The Company is not engaged in material operations in foreign
     countries, nor are material portions of sales or revenues derived from
     customers in foreign countries.
     
ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES

      The Company's corporate headquarters are located in Omaha, Nebraska.  The

      The Company maintains a number of distribution facilities, in addition to
distribution facilities and warehouse space available at substantially all of

      Utilization of manufacturing capacity varies by type of product
manufactured, plant and week.  In general, ConAgra operates most of its
manufacturing facilities in excess of 80% of standard industry capacity. 
Standards vary by industry from 40 hours per week to 144 hours per week.
      
      Most principal manufacturing facilities are held in fee.  However, certain
parcels of land, machinery and buildings, and substantially all of ConAgra's
transportation equipment used in its processing and merchandising operations,
including covered rail hopper cars and river barges, are leased.

ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
      
     In fiscal 1991, ConAgra acquired Beatrice Company ("Beatrice").  As a
result of the acquisition and the significant pre-acquisition tax and other
contingencies of the Beatrice businesses and its former subsidiaries, the
consolidated post-acquisition financial statements of ConAgra reflected
significant liabilities and valuation allowances associated with the estimated
resolution of these contingencies.

     As a result of a settlement reached with the Internal Revenue Service in
fiscal 1995, ConAgra released $230.0 million of a valuation allowance and
reduced non-current liabilities by $135.0 million, with a resulting reduction of
goodwill associated with the Beatrice acquisition of $365.0 million.  Various
state tax returns of Beatrice remain open.  However, after taking into account
the foregoing adjustments, management believes that the ultimate resolution of
all remaining pre-acquisition Beatrice tax contingencies should not exceed the
reserves established for such matters.

     Beatrice is also engaged in various litigation and environmental
proceedings related to businesses divested by Beatrice prior to its acquisition
by ConAgra.  The environmental proceedings include litigation and administrative
proceedings involving Beatrice's status as a potentially responsible party at 42
Superfund, proposed Superfund or state-equivalent sites.  Beatrice has paid or
is in the process of paying its liability share at 40 of these sites. 
Substantial reserves for these matters have been established based on the
Company's best estimate of its undiscounted remediation liabilities, which
estimates include evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required
cleanup, the known volumetric contribution of Beatrice and other potentially
responsible parties and its experience in remediating sites.

     In March 1996, the Environmental Protection Agency filed an action in
federal district court in Idaho against the Company as owner and operator of a
beef packing plant in Nampa, Idaho seeking civil monetary penalties for alleged
violations of the Clean Water Act.  In March 1997, the Environmental Protection
Agency filed an action in federal district court in Colorado against a
subsidiary of the Company which operates a pesticide formulation facility in
Greeley, Colorado seeking civil monetary penalties for violation of the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act.  The Company is defending both actions.     

     In March 1997, the Company agreed to pay $8.3 million to settle charges
against its Peavey Company unit in federal district court in Indiana.  The
charges related to mishandling of grain at twelve grain elevators in the
southeast region over a four-year period ending in 1992.  The criminal plea
agreement included one felony and three misdemeanors.  The Company also entered
into a compliance agreement with the United States Department of Agriculture
which required the implementation of further control systems at grain
elevators.

     ConAgra is party to a number of other lawsuits and claims arising out of
the operation of its businesses.  After taking into account liabilities recorded
for all of the foregoing matters, management believes the ultimate resolution of
such matters should not have a material adverse effect on ConAgra's financial
condition, results of operations or liquidity.
