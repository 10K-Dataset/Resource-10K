General

The following comments pertain to each of the company's reporting segments.

ConAgra
Foods is a food company that operates in many different areas of the food business, from basic agricultural inputs to production and sale of branded consumer products. As a
result, ConAgra Foods uses many different raw materials, the bulk of which are commodities. Raw materials are generally available from several different sources and ConAgra Foods presently believes
that it can obtain these as needed.


The company experiences intense competition for sales of its principal products in its major markets. The company's products compete with widely advertised, well-known,
branded products, as well as private label products. The company has major competitors in all of its reporting segments.

Quality
control processes at principal manufacturing locations emphasize applied research and technical services directed at product improvement and quality control. In addition, the
Refrigerated Foods and the Packaged Foods segments conduct research activities related to the development of new products.

Many
of ConAgra Foods' facilities and products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug
Administration and other federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies relating to the quality of products, sanitation, safety and environmental control. The company believes that it
complies with such laws and regulations in all material respects, and that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings or the
competitive position of the company.

ConAgra
Foods and its subsidiaries have more than 89,000 employees, primarily in the United States.

d) Foreign Operations

Foreign operations information is set forth in Note 20 "Business Segments and Related Information" on pages 56 through 58 of the company's 2001 Annual

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In fiscal 1991, the company acquired Beatrice Company ("Beatrice"). As a result of the acquisition and the significant pre-acquisition
contingencies of the Beatrice businesses and its former subsidiaries, the consolidated post-acquisition financial statements of the company reflect significant liabilities associated with
the estimated resolution of these contingencies. These include various litigation and environmental proceedings related to businesses divested by Beatrice prior to its acquisition by the company. The
environmental proceedings include litigation and administrative proceedings involving Beatrice's status as a potentially responsible party at 41 Superfund, proposed Superfund or state-equivalent
sites. Beatrice has paid or is in the process of paying its liability share at 35 of these sites. Substantial reserves for these matters have been established based on the company's best estimate of
its


undiscounted remediation liabilities, which estimates include evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required cleanup, the known volumetric contribution of Beatrice and other potentially
responsible parties and its experience in remediating sites.

On
June 22, 2001, the company filed an amended annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 28, 2000. The filing includes restated
financial information for fiscal years 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000. The restatement, due to accounting and conduct matters at its United Agri Products, Inc. subsidiary, was based upon an
investigation undertaken by the company and the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors. That investigation, and an informal inquiry by the staff of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, are continuing. The restatement was principally related to revenue recognition for deferred delivery sales and vendor rebates, advance vendor rebates, and bad debt reserves.

On
August 10, 2001, a purported class action lawsuit was filed against the company and certain of its executive officers. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated the
federal securities laws in connection with the events resulting in the company's restatement of its financial statements. The complaint seeks (a) a declaration that the action is maintainable
as a class action and that the plaintiff is a proper class representative, (b) unspecified compensatory damages, (c) reasonable attorneys' fees, and (d) any other relief deemed
proper by the court. The lawsuit was filed in United States District Court for Nebraska and is entitled Gebhardt v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., et. Al. Case No. 810CV427. The company believes
the lawsuit is without merit and plans to vigorously defend the action.

The
company is a party to a number of other lawsuits and claims arising out of the operation of its businesses. After taking into account liabilities recorded for all of the foregoing
matters, management believes the ultimate resolution of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
