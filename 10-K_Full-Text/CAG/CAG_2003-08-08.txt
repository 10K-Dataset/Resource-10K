posted on the company’s website.

a) General
Development of Business

ConAgra Foods,
Inc. (“ConAgra Foods” or the “company”) is a leading packaged food company serving
a wide variety of food customers.  The
company’s packaged foods and food ingredients segments accounted for
approximately 92% of its fiscal 2003 net sales of $19.8 billion.

Over time, the
company, which was first incorporated in 1919, has grown through acquisitions,
operations and internal brand development. 
The company’s more significant acquisitions have included Beatrice
Company in 1990, Golden Valley Microwave Foods in 1992 and International Home
Foods in 2001.  In recent years, ConAgra
Foods has been pursuing an acquisition and divestiture strategy to shift its
focus toward its core branded and value-added food products.

During fiscal
2003, the company divested a controlling interest in its fresh beef and pork
business (“fresh beef and pork divestiture”), its canned seafood operations,
significant cheese operations, and committed to a plan to sell its chicken
operations.  On June 9, 2003, the
company announced an agreement to sell its chicken operations; the company
expects to close the transaction in the summer of 2003.  These divestitures are part of an ongoing
program to focus on higher-margin opportunities to improve overall company
financial results.

b) Financial
Information about Reporting Segments

The company’s
operations are classified into four reporting segments: Packaged Foods, Food
Ingredients, Agricultural Products and Meat Processing.  The contributions of each reporting segment
to net sales and operating profit, and the identifiable assets attributable to
each reporting segment are set forth in Note 21 “Business Segments and
Related Information” on pages 68 through 70 of the company’s 2003 Annual Report
to Stockholders and are incorporated herein by reference.  As a result of the fresh beef and pork
divestiture and the planned chicken business divestiture, the company will no
longer have any Meat Processing segment activities beginning in fiscal 2004.

c) Narrative
Description of Business

The company
competes throughout the food industry and focuses on adding value for customers
who sell into the retail food, foodservice, ingredients and agricultural
products channels.

ConAgra Foods
reporting segments are described below. The ConAgra Foods companies and
locations, including distribution facilities, within each reporting segment,
are described in Item 2.


Packaged Foods

In its
Packaged Foods segment, ConAgra Foods produces shelf-stable, frozen and
refrigerated foods which are processed and packaged for sales through grocery
and convenience stores, mass merchandisers, restaurants, institutions, sports
and recreation venues and other retail, deli and foodservice customers.

Shelf-stable
products include tomato products, pasta products, cooking oils, popcorn, soup,
puddings, meat snacks, canned beans, canned pasta, canned chili, cocoa mixes
and peanut butter for retail, foodservice, institutional and specialty market
customers.  Shelf-stable major brands

institutional and specialty market customers. 
Frozen food major brands include Healthy Choice, Banquet, Marie Callender’s,
Kid Cuisine, MaMa Rosa’s, Papa G’s, Gilardi’s, Lamb Weston, Holly Ridge,
Fernando’s, Rosarita, The Max, Morton, Patio, LaChoy, Artel and Wolfgang Puck.

Refrigerated

products, ethnic foods, kosher products, meat alternative products (e.g.,
soy-based hot dogs and patties), tablespreads, egg alternatives and dessert
toppings for retail, foodservice, institutional and specialty market
customers.  Refrigerated food major

Choice, Louis Kemp, Texas BBQ, Ready Crisp, Casa de Oro, Zoll, Hebrew National,
Brown ‘N Serve, Golden Star, Lightlife, National Deli, Parkay, Blue Bonnet,
Fleischmann’s, Egg Beaters and Reddi-wip.

Food
Ingredients

The Food Ingredients
segment includes the company’s specialty spice operations, milled operations
and its basic ingredients business. 
Specialty spice operations include seasonings, blends and flavorings.  Milled operations include flour, corn and
oat milling.  The basic ingredients
business includes commodity procurement and merchandising functions which
originates, markets, merchandises and trades agricultural and energy
commodities and byproducts, and provides risk management services.

Agricultural Products

Through its
Agricultural Products segment, ConAgra Foods distributes crop protection
chemicals, fertilizers and seeds at wholesale and retail levels.  Major agricultural brands include Clean
Crop, ACA,  Savage, Shotgun, Saber,
Signature, and Loveland Industries.  The
Agricultural Products segment experiences some seasonality.  This seasonality coincides with normal
agricultural growing seasons and is subject to a variety of economic,
governmental and weather related conditions.

Meat Processing

In its Meat
Processing segment, ConAgra Foods produced and marketed fresh beef and pork for
retail and foodservice customers.  In
fiscal 2003, the company sold a controlling interest in its fresh beef and pork
business and committed to a plan to sell its chicken business.  As a result of these divestitures, the
company will no longer have Meat Processing segment activities beginning in
fiscal 2004.

Unconsolidated
Joint Ventures

The company
has a number of unconsolidated joint ventures with third-parties.  The more significant joint ventures are
involved in fresh beef and pork processing, barley malting, and potato
production.  The company’s fresh beef
and pork joint venture was established in fiscal 2003 when the company sold a
controlling interest in its fresh beef and pork operations.


Discontinued
Operations

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, the company committed to a
plan to sell its chicken business.  On
June 9, 2003, the company announced an agreement to sell its chicken business
to Pilgrim’s Pride Corporation.  As a
result of the pending chicken divestiture, the operations of the chicken
business are classified as discontinued operations, and accordingly are not included
in the Meat Processing segment.

General

The following
comments pertain to each of the company’s reporting segments.

ConAgra Foods
is a food company that operates in many different areas of the food industry,
with a significant focus on the sale of branded and value-added consumer
products.  ConAgra Foods uses many
different raw materials, the bulk of which are commodities.  Raw materials are generally available from
several different sources and ConAgra Foods presently believes that it can
obtain these as needed.

The company
experiences intense competition for sales of its principal products in its
major markets.  The company’s products
compete with widely advertised, well-known, branded products, as well as
private label and customized products. 
The company has major competitors in all of its reporting segments.

Quality
control processes at principal manufacturing locations emphasize applied
research and technical services directed at product improvement and quality
control.  In addition, the company
conducts research activities related to the development of new products.

Many of
ConAgra Foods’ facilities and products are subject to various laws and
regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the
Federal Food and Drug Administration and other federal, state, local and
foreign governmental agencies relating to the quality of products, sanitation,
safety and environmental control. The company believes that it complies with
such laws and regulations in all material respects, and that continued
compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital
expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the company.

At May 25,
2003, ConAgra Foods and its subsidiaries had approximately 63,000 employees,
primarily in the United States.

d) Foreign Operations

Foreign
operations information is set forth in Note 21 “Business Segments and
Related Information” on pages 68 through 70 of the company’s 2003 Annual Report
to Stockholders and is incorporated herein by reference.

Risk Factors

The following factors could affect the company’s operating results and
should be considered in evaluating the company.

The company must
identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to
meet their preferences.

Consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of the company’s
food products depends on the company’s ability to identify the tastes and
dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their
preferences.  The company introduces new
products and improved products in all of its business segments from time to
time and incurs significant development and marketing cost.  For example, the company believes weaker
sales results for the company’s foodservice products in fiscal 2003 reflected
changing consumer preferences resulting from business travel and consumer
spending at certain types of restaurants being negatively impacted by softer
economic conditions.  If the company’s
products fail to meet consumer preference, then the company’s strategy to grow
sales and profits with


new
products will be less successful.

If the company does
not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive food
industry, its profitability could decrease.

The company’s success depends in part on its ability to achieve the
appropriate cost structure and be efficient in the highly competitive food
industry.  The company has in recent
years eliminated excess costs and achieved additional efficiencies by aligning
sales, marketing, and manufacturing functions. 
If the company does not continue to manage costs and achieve additional
efficiencies, its competitiveness and its profitability could decrease.

Increased competition
may result in reduced sales for the company.

The food industry is highly competitive, and increased competition
reduces sales for the company.  For
example, sales of seasonings, blends and flavorings declined in fiscal 2003, as
a result of poor performance for the company’s garlic operations due to lost
volume related to increased competition from Chinese garlic producers.

The consolidation of the company’s retail
customers has resulted in large sophisticated customers with increased buying
power.

The company’s retail customers, such as supermarkets and warehouse
clubs, have consolidated in recent years. 
These consolidations have produced large, sophisticated customers with
increased buying power who are more capable of resisting price increases and
operating with reduced inventories. 
These customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space,
currently used for company products, for their private label products.  If the larger size of these  customers results in additional negotiating
strength or less shelf space for company products, the company’s profitability
will decline.

The company may be
subject to product liability claims and product recalls, which could negatively
impact its profitability.

The company sells food products for human consumption, which involves
risks such as product contamination or spoilage, product tampering and other
adulteration of food products.  The
company may be subject to liability if the consumption of any of its products
causes injury, illness or death.  In
addition, the company will voluntarily recall products in the event of
contamination or damage.  In the past,
the company has issued recalls and has from time to time been involved in
lawsuits relating to its food products. 
A significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall
may negatively impact the company’s profitability for a period of time
depending on product availability, competitive reaction and consumer
attitudes.  Even if a product liability
claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity
surrounding any assertion that company products caused illness or injury could
adversely affect the company’s reputation with existing and potential customers
and its corporate and brand image.

For the Agricultural
Products segment, downturns in the agricultural industry reduce product demand,
create a difficult product pricing environment, and make credit collection more
difficult.

The agricultural industry is cyclical and subject to a variety of
economic, governmental and weather related conditions.  Weather patterns, livestock and crop
diseases, uncertainty over farm policy, and other farming related factors have
caused downturns in the agricultural industry in recent years.  Factors that negatively affect the
agricultural industry reduce farm income, which results in less demand for
agricultural products and a less favorable product pricing environment and
negatively affects the ability of customers to pay for products purchased on
credit.  These factors negatively
affected the fiscal 2002 operating results for the company when the
Agricultural Products segment represented approximately 13% of the company’s
total sales but less than 1% of the company’s total operating profit.

Commodity price
increases will increase operating costs and may reduce profits.

The company uses many different commodities, including wheat, corn,
oats, soybeans, beef, pork, poultry and energy.  Commodities are subject to price volatility caused by commodity
market fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuations, and changes in
governmental agricultural programs. 
Commodity price increases will result in


increases
in raw material costs and operating costs. 
The company may not be able to increase its product prices to offset
these increased costs; and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume
and profitability.  The company has many
years’ experience in hedging against commodity price increases; however,
hedging practices reduce but do not eliminate the risk of increased operating costs
from commodity price increases.  For
example, higher commodity prices in fiscal 2002 and significant energy price
increases, such as were experienced in fiscal 2001, have impacted the company’s
results.

If
the company fails to comply with the many laws applicable to its business, it
may incur significant fines and penalties.

The company’s
facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered
by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug
Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental
agencies relating to the processing, packaging, storage, distribution,
advertising, labeling, quality, and safety of food products.  The company’s failure to comply with
applicable laws and regulations could subject it to administrative penalties
and injunctive relief, civil remedies, including fines, injunctions and recalls
of its products.  The company’s
operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations
administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, which pertain to the
discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of
wastes.  Failure to comply with these
regulations can have serious consequences, including civil and administrative
penalties and negative publicity.

The company incurs
significant costs in complying with laws and regulations.

The company incurs significant capital and operating expenditures to
comply with laws and regulations.  For
example, the company’s financial statement footnote on “Contingencies”
describes continuing costs for compliance with environmental laws.  Future material changes in these laws and
regulations could increase the company’s operating costs.  Various governments throughout the world are
considering regulatory proposals relating to genetically modified organisms or
ingredients, food safety, and market regulation which, if adopted, will
increase the company’s operating costs. 
If any of these or other proposals are enacted, the company may not be
able to pass on these cost increases to customers without experiencing volume
and profit losses.

ITEM
3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In fiscal
1991, ConAgra Foods acquired Beatrice Company (“Beatrice”). As a result of the
acquisition and the significant pre-acquisition contingencies of the Beatrice
businesses and its former subsidiaries, the consolidated post-acquisition
financial statements of the company reflect significant liabilities associated
with the estimated resolution of these contingencies. These include various
litigation and environmental proceedings related to businesses divested by
Beatrice prior to its acquisition by the company. The environmental proceedings
include litigation and administrative proceedings involving Beatrice’s status
as a potentially responsible party at 34 Superfund, proposed Superfund or
state-equivalent sites; these sites involve locations previously owned or
operated by predecessors of Beatrice which used or produced petroleum, pesticides,
fertilizers, dyes, inks, solvents, PCBs, acids, lead, sulfur, tannery wastes,
and / or other contaminants. Beatrice has paid or is in the process of paying
its liability share at 29 of these sites. Adequate reserves for these matters
have been established based on the company’s best estimate of its undiscounted
remediation liabilities, which estimates include evaluation of investigatory
studies, extent of required cleanup, the known volumetric contribution of
Beatrice and other potentially responsible parties and its experience in
remediating sites. The reserves for Beatrice environmental matters totaled
$121.2 million as of May 25, 2003, and $119.3 million as of May 26, 2002, a
majority of which relates to the Superfund and state equivalent sites referenced
above. Expenditures for these matters are expected to occur over a period of 5
to 20 years.

On June 22,
2001, the company filed an amended annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended May 28,


2000.  The filing included restated financial information for fiscal
years 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000. The restatement, due to accounting and conduct
matters at its United Agri Products, Inc. subsidiary (“UAP”), was based upon an
investigation undertaken by the company and the Audit Committee of its Board of
Directors. The restatement was principally related to revenue recognition for
deferred delivery sales and vendor rebates, advance vendor rebates, and bad
debt reserves. The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued a formal
order of nonpublic investigation dated September 28, 2001. The company is
cooperating with the SEC investigation, which relates to the UAP matters
described above, as well as other aspects of the company’s financial statements,
including the level and application of certain of the company’s reserves.

On August 10,
2001, a purported class action lawsuit, Gebhardt v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., et.
al. Case No. 810CV427, was filed in United States District Court for Nebraska
against the company and certain of its executive officers alleging violations
of the federal securities laws in connection with the events resulting in the
company’s restatement of its financial statements. The complaint seeks a
declaration that the action is maintainable as a class action and that the
plaintiff is a proper class representative, unspecified compensatory damages,
reasonable attorneys’ fees and any other relief deemed proper by the
court.  On July 23, 2002, the federal
district court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the lawsuit and
entered judgment in favor of the company and the executive officers. On June
30, 2003, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal and
remanded the action for further proceedings in the district court.  The company believes the lawsuit is without
merit and plans to vigorously defend the action.

On September
26, 2001, a shareholder derivative action was filed, purportedly on behalf of
the company, by plaintiffs Anthony F. Rolfes and Sandra S. Rolfes in the Court
of Chancery for the State of Delaware in New Castle County, Case No. 19130NC.
The complaint alleges that the defendants, directors of the company during the
relevant times, breached fiduciary duties in connection with events resulting
in the company’s restatement of its financial statements. The action seeks,
inter alia, recovery to the company, which is named as a nominal defendant in
the action, of damages allegedly sustained by the company and a direction to
the defendants to establish programs to prevent wrongful and illegal practices.
On October 9, 2001, a second shareholder derivative action was filed,
purportedly on behalf of the company, by plaintiff Harbor Finance Partners in
the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska, Case No.
401CV3255. The complaint contains allegations and seeks relief similar to the
Delaware derivative action. The directors named as defendants in these actions
intend to vigorously defend the allegations and believe the actions are without
merit.

The company is
a party to a number of other lawsuits and claims arising out of the operation
of its businesses. After taking into account liabilities recorded for all of
the foregoing matters, management believes the ultimate resolution of such
matters should not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial
condition, results of operations or liquidity.
