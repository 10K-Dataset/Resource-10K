ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

a)     General Development of Business

       Nebraska Consolidated Mills Company, which was originally incorporated in
       Nebraska on September 29, 1919, changed its name to ConAgra, Inc.
       ("ConAgra" or the "Company") on February 25, 1971, and since December 5,
       1975, has been incorporated in Delaware.

b)     Financial Information About Industry Segments

       The Company's businesses are classified into three industry segments:
       Packaged Foods, Refrigerated Foods and Agricultural Products. The
       contributions of each industry segment to net sales and operating profit,
       and the identifiable assets attributable to each industry segment are set
       forth in Note 19 "Business Segments" on pages 57 and 58 of the Company's
       1999 Annual Report to Stockholders.

c)     Narrative Description of Business

       The information set forth in the "Business Review" on pages 12 through 31
       of the Company's 1999 Annual Report to Stockholders is incorporated
       herein by reference.

       The following comments pertain to the Company as a whole.

       ConAgra is a diversified food company that operates across the food
       chain, from basic agricultural inputs to production and sale of branded
       consumer products. As a result, ConAgra uses many different raw
       materials, the bulk of which are commodities. Raw materials are generally
       available from several different sources and ConAgra presently believes
       that it can obtain these as needed.

       Each business is highly competitive. Many companies compete in one or
       more of the markets served by ConAgra, some of which have greater sales
       and assets than ConAgra.

       Quality control processes at principal manufacturing locations emphasize
       applied research and technical services directed at product improvement
       and quality control. In addition, the Refrigerated Foods and the Packaged
       Foods segments conduct research activities related to the development of
       new products.

       Many of ConAgra's facilities and products are subject to various laws and
       regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture,
       the Federal Food and Drug Administration, and other federal, state, local
       and foreign governmental agencies relating to the quality of products,
       sanitation, safety and environmental control. The Company believes that
       it complies with such laws and regulations in all material respects, and
       that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material
       effect upon capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of
       the Company.

       ConAgra and its subsidiaries have more than 80,000 employees, primarily
       in the United States.





ITEM 1.    BUSINESS (CONTINUED)

d)     Foreign Operations

       The information set forth in the "Business Review" on pages 12 through 31
       of the Company's Annual Report to Stockholders is incorporated herein by
       reference. The Company is not engaged in material operations in foreign
       countries, nor are material portions of sales or revenues derived from
       customers in foreign countries.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

The Company's corporate headquarters are located in Omaha, Nebraska. The
headquarters and principal operating locations of each business are set forth on
the following list of "ConAgra Locations."

The Company maintains a number of distribution facilities, in addition to
distribution facilities and warehouse space available at substantially all of
its manufacturing facilities.

Utilization of manufacturing capacity varies by type of product manufactured,
plant and week. In general, ConAgra operates most of its manufacturing
facilities in excess of 80% of standard industry capacity. Standards vary by
industry from 40 hours per week to 144 hours per week.

Most principal manufacturing facilities are held in fee. However, certain
parcels of land, machinery and buildings, and substantially all of ConAgra's
transportation equipment used in its processing and merchandising operations,
including covered rail hopper cars and river barges, are leased.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In fiscal 1991, ConAgra acquired Beatrice Company ("Beatrice"). As a result of
the acquisition and the significant pre-acquisition contingencies of the
Beatrice businesses and its former subsidiaries, the consolidated
post-acquisition financial statements of ConAgra reflect significant liabilities
associated with the estimated resolution of these contingencies.

Beatrice also is engaged in various litigation and environmental proceedings
related to businesses divested by Beatrice prior to its acquisition by ConAgra.
The environmental proceedings include litigation and administrative proceedings
involving Beatrice's status as a potentially responsible party at 44 Superfund,
proposed Superfund or state-equivalent sites. Beatrice has paid or is in the
process of paying its liability share at 41 of these sites. Substantial reserves
for these matters have been established based on the Company's best estimate of
its undiscounted remediation liabilities, which estimates include evaluation of
investigatory studies, extent of required cleanup, the known volumetric
contribution of Beatrice and other potentially responsible parties, and its
experience in remediating sites.

ConAgra is party to a number of other lawsuits and claims arising out of the
operation of its businesses. After taking into account liabilities recorded for
all of the foregoing matters, management believes the ultimate resolution of
such matters should not have a material adverse effect on ConAgra's financial
condition, results of operations or liquidity.
