BUSINESS

a)

General
    Development of Business

ConAgra Foods, Inc. (“ConAgra Foods”,
    “Company”, “we”, “us”, or
    “our”) is one of North America’s leading food
    companies, with brands in 96% of America’s households.
    ConAgra Foods also has a strong

business-to-business

presence, supplying frozen potato and sweet potato products, as
    well as other vegetable, spice, and grain products to a variety
    of well-known restaurants, foodservice operators, and commercial
    customers.

ConAgra Foods is focused on growing sales, expanding profit
    margins, and improving returns on capital over time. To that
    end, we have significantly changed our portfolio of businesses
    over a number of years, focusing on branded, value-added
    opportunities, while divesting commodity-based and lower-margin
    businesses. Executing this strategy has involved the acquisition
    over time of a number of brands such as

Banquet

®

,

Chef
    Boyardee

®

,

PAM

®

,

    and

Alexia

®

,

    and more recently, has focused on product innovations such as

Healthy
    Choice

®

Café
    Steamers

Fresh
    Mixers

,

Healthy

®

All Natural Entrées,

    Callender’s

®

Pasta Al Dente, and others. More notable divestitures have
    included a trading and merchandising business, packaged meat
    operations, a poultry business, beef and pork businesses, and
    various other businesses. For more information about our more
    recent acquisitions and divestitures, see
    “Acquisitions” and “Divestitures” below.

As part of this strategy, we have also prioritized improving our
    overall operational effectiveness, focusing on better innovation
    and marketing programs, reducing manufacturing and selling,
    general, and administrative costs, and enhancing our business
    processes, which are intended to drive profitable sales growth,
    expand profit margins, and improve returns on capital.

Currently we are focusing on the following initiatives, designed
    to enhance the performance of our five strategic product groups:
    convenient meals, potatoes, snacks, meal enhancers, and
    specialty businesses:

•

World-class and high-impact marketing;

•

Innovation focused on “fewer, bigger, and better”
    initiatives;

•

Sales growth initiatives focused on penetrating the fastest
    growing channels, achieving better returns on customer trade
    arrangements, optimizing shelf placement for our most profitable
    brands, and aligning with customers to leverage consumer
    insights;

•

Reducing costs throughout the supply chain and the general and
    administrative functions; and

•

Delivering consistent customer service and high standards of
    food safety and quality.

We were initially incorporated as a Nebraska corporation in 1919
    and were reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in December
    1975.

b)

Financial
    Information about Reporting Segments

We report our operations in two reporting segments: Consumer
    Foods and Commercial Foods. The contributions of each reporting
    segment to net sales, operating profit, and the identifiable
    assets are set forth in Note 22 “

Business Segments
    and Related Information

” to the consolidated financial
    statements.

c)

    each reporting segment, are described in Item 2.

    for all periods prior to divestiture.

During fiscal 2008, we completed the divestiture of the

    Knott’s business are classified as assets and liabilities
    held for sale within our consolidated balance sheets for all
    periods prior to divestiture.

General

The following comments pertain to both of our reporting segments.

ConAgra Foods is a food company that operates in many sectors of
    the food industry, with a significant focus on the sale of
    branded and value-added consumer products. We also manufacture
    and sell private label products. We use many different raw
    materials, the bulk of which are commodities. The prices paid
    for raw materials used in our products generally reflect factors
    such as weather, commodity market fluctuations, currency
    fluctuations, tariffs, and the effects of governmental
    agricultural programs. Although the prices of raw materials can
    be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors, we
    believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and
    generally available from numerous sources. We have faced
    increased costs for many of our significant raw materials,
    packaging, and energy inputs. We seek to mitigate the higher
    input costs through productivity and pricing initiatives, and
    through the use of derivative instruments used to economically
    hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption.

We experience intense competition for sales of our principal
    products in our major markets. Our products compete with widely
    advertised, well-known, branded products, as well as private
    label and customized products. Some of our competitors are
    larger and have greater resources than we have. We compete
    primarily on the basis of quality, value, customer service,
    brand recognition, and brand loyalty.

We employ processes at our principal manufacturing locations
    that emphasize applied research and technical services directed
    at product improvement and quality control. In addition, we
    conduct research activities related to the development of new
    products. Research and development expense was $78 million,
    $78 million, and $67 million in fiscal 2010, 2009, and
    2008, respectively.

Demand for certain of our products may be influenced by
    holidays, changes in seasons, or other annual events.

We manufacture primarily for stock and fill customer orders from
    finished goods inventories. While at any given time there may be
    some backlog of orders, such backlog is not material in respect
    to annual net sales, and the changes of backlog orders from time
    to time are not significant.


Our trademarks are of material importance to our business and
    are protected by registration or other means in the United
    States and most other markets where the related products are
    sold. Some of our products are sold under brands that have been
    licensed from others. We also actively develop and maintain a
    portfolio of patents, although no single patent is considered
    material to the business as a whole. We have proprietary trade
    secrets, technology, know-how, processes, and other intellectual
    property rights that are not registered.

Many of our facilities and products are subject to various laws
    and regulations administered by the United States Department of
    Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, the
    Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other
    federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies
    relating to the quality and safety of products, sanitation,
    safety and health matters, and environmental control. We believe
    that we comply with such laws and regulations in all material
    respects, and that continued compliance with such regulations
    will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures,
    earnings, or our competitive position.

Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates,
    accounted for approximately 18%, 17%, and 15% of consolidated
    net sales for fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

At May 30, 2010, ConAgra Foods and its subsidiaries had
    approximately 24,400 employees, primarily in the United
    States. Approximately 53% of our employees are parties to
    collective bargaining agreements. Of the employees subject to
    collective bargaining agreements, approximately 25% are parties
    to collective bargaining agreements that are scheduled to expire
    during fiscal 2011. We believe that our relationships with
    employees and their representative organizations are good.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

The following risks and uncertainties could affect our operating
    results and should be considered in evaluating us. While we
    believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk
    factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks
    and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not
    currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect
    our business, performance, or financial condition in the future.

Deterioration
    of general economic conditions could harm our business and
    results of operations.

Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected
    by changes in national or global economic conditions, including
    inflation, interest rates, availability of capital markets,
    consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs
    (including fuel surcharges), and the effects of governmental
    initiatives to manage economic conditions.

The continued volatility in financial markets and the
    deterioration of national and global economic conditions could
    impact our business and operations in a variety of ways,
    including as follows:

•

consumers may shift purchases to lower-priced private label or
    other value offerings or may forego certain purchases altogether
    during economic downturns, which may adversely affect the
    results of our Consumer Foods operations;

•

decreased demand in the restaurant business, particularly casual
    and fine dining, may adversely affect our Commercial Foods
    operations;

•

volatility in the equity markets or interest rates could
    substantially impact our pension costs and required pension
    contributions;

•

it may become more costly or difficult to obtain debt or equity
    financing to fund operations or investment opportunities, or to
    refinance our debt in the future, in each case on terms and
    within a time period acceptable to us; and

•

a downgrade to our credit ratings would increase our borrowing
    costs and could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our
    short-term and longer-term borrowing needs.

Increases
    in commodity costs may have a negative impact on
    profits.

We use many different commodities such as wheat, corn, oats,
    soybeans, beef, pork, poultry, and energy. Commodities are
    subject to price volatility caused by commodity market
    fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuations, and
    changes in governmental agricultural programs. Commodity price
    increases will result in increases in raw material costs and
    operating costs. We may not be able to increase our product
    prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these
    increased costs; and increasing prices may result in reduced
    sales volume and profitability. We have experience in hedging
    against commodity price increases; however, these practices and
    experience reduce, but do not eliminate, the risk of negative
    profit impacts from commodity price increases.

Increased
    competition may result in reduced sales or profits.

The food industry is highly competitive, and increased
    competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or
    the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer
    pressures. Competitive pressures also may restrict our ability
    to increase prices, including in response to commodity and other
    cost increases. In most product categories, we compete not only
    with other widely advertised branded products, but also with
    generic and private label products that are generally sold at
    lower prices. A strong competitive response from one or more of
    our competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a consumer shift
    towards private label offerings, could result in us reducing
    pricing, increasing marketing or other expenditures, or losing
    market share. Our profits could decrease if a reduction in
    prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased
    sales volume.


The
    sophistication and buying power of our customers could have a
    negative impact on profits.

Many of our customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs,
    and food distributors, have consolidated in recent years and
    consolidation is expected to continue. These consolidations and
    the growth of supercenters have produced large, sophisticated
    customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength
    who are more capable of resisting price increases and operating
    with reduced inventories. These customers may also in the future
    use more of their shelf space, currently used for our products,
    for their private label products. We continue to implement
    initiatives to counteract these pressures. However, if the
    larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating
    strength

and/or

increased private label competition, our profitability could
    decline.

We must
    identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer
    food products to meet their preferences.

Consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of our
    food products depends on our ability to identify the tastes and
    dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to
    their preferences, including concerns of consumers regarding
    health and wellness, obesity, product attributes, and
    ingredients. Introduction of new products and product extensions
    requires significant development and marketing investment. If
    our products fail to meet consumer preference, or we fail to
    introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, then the
    return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our
    strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in marketing
    and innovation will be less successful. Similarly, demand for
    our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding
    the health effects of ingredients such as sodium, trans fats,
    sugar, processed wheat, or other product ingredients or
    attributes.

If we do
    not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly
    competitive food industry, our profitability could
    decrease.

Our success depends in part on our ability to achieve the
    appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly
    competitive food industry, particularly in an environment of
    volatile input costs. We continue to implement profit-enhancing
    initiatives that impact our supply chain and general and
    administrative functions. These initiatives are focused on
    cost-saving opportunities in procurement, manufacturing,
    logistics, and customer service, as well as general and
    administrative overhead levels. If we do not continue to
    effectively manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies,
    our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease.

We may be
    subject to product liability claims and product recalls, which
    could negatively impact our profitability.

We sell food products for human consumption, which involves
    risks such as product contamination or spoilage, product
    tampering, and other adulteration of food products. We may be
    subject to liability if the consumption of any of our products
    causes injury, illness, or death. In addition, we will
    voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or
    damage. We have issued recalls and have from time to time been
    and currently are involved in lawsuits relating to our food
    products. A significant product liability judgment or a
    widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and
    profitability for a period of time depending on product
    availability, competitive reaction, and consumer attitudes. Even
    if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully
    pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that
    our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our
    reputation with existing and potential customers and our
    corporate and brand image.

If we
    fail to comply with the many laws applicable to our business, we
    may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and
    penalties.

Our facilities and products are subject to many laws and
    regulations administered by the United States Department of
    Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, the
    Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other
    federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies
    relating to the processing, packaging, storage, distribution,
    advertising, labeling, quality, and safety of food products, the
    health and safety of our employees, and the protection of the
    environment. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and
    regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative
    penalties and injunctive relief, civil remedies, including
    fines,


injunctions, and recalls of our products. Our operations are
    also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations
    administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, which
    pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and
    the handling and disposition of wastes. Failure to comply with
    these regulations can have serious consequences, including civil
    and administrative penalties and negative publicity. Changes in
    applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations
    thereof, including increased government regulations to limit
    carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of
    concern over climate change, may result in increased compliance
    costs, capital expenditures, and other financial obligations for
    us, which could affect our profitability or impede the
    production or distribution of our products, which could affect
    our net operating revenues.

Our
    information technology resources must provide efficient
    connections between our business functions, or our results of
    operations will be negatively impacted.

Each year we engage in billions of dollars of transactions with
    our customers and vendors. Because the amount of dollars
    involved is so significant, our information technology resources
    must provide connections among our marketing, sales,
    manufacturing, logistics, customer service, and accounting
    functions. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the
    resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology
    infrastructure and to maintain the related automated and manual
    control processes, we could be subject to billing and collection
    errors, business disruptions, or damage resulting from security
    breaches. We began implementing new financial and operational
    information technology systems in fiscal 2008 and placed systems
    into production during fiscal 2008, 2009, and 2010. Additional
    changes and enhancements will be placed into production at
    various times in fiscal 2011. If future implementation problems
    are encountered, our results of operations could be negatively
    impacted.

Our headquarters are located in Omaha, Nebraska. In addition,
    certain shared service centers are located in Omaha, Nebraska,
    including a product development facility, supply chain center,
    business services center, and an information technology center.
    The general offices and location of principal operations are set

    many sales offices mainly in the United States.

We maintain a number of stand-alone distribution facilities. In
    addition, there is warehouse space available at substantially
    all of our manufacturing facilities.

Utilization of manufacturing capacity varies by manufacturing
    plant based upon the type of products assigned and the level of
    demand for those products. Management believes that our
    manufacturing and processing plants are well maintained and are
    generally adequate to support the current operations of the
    business.

We own most of the manufacturing facilities. However, a limited
    number of plants and parcels of land with the related
    manufacturing equipment are leased. Substantially all of our
    transportation equipment and forward-positioned distribution
    centers and most of the storage facilities containing finished
    goods are leased or operated by third parties. Information about
    the properties supporting our two business segments follows.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

In fiscal 1991, we acquired Beatrice Company
    (“Beatrice”). As a result of the acquisition and the
    significant pre-acquisition contingencies of the Beatrice
    businesses and its former subsidiaries, our consolidated
    post-acquisition financial statements reflect liabilities
    associated with the estimated resolution of these contingencies.
    These include various litigation and environmental proceedings
    related to businesses divested by Beatrice prior to its
    acquisition by us. The litigation includes suits against a
    number of lead paint and pigment manufacturers, including
    ConAgra Grocery Products and the Company as alleged successors
    to W. P. Fuller Co., a lead paint and pigment manufacturer owned
    and operated by Beatrice until 1967. Although decisions
    favorable to us have been rendered in Rhode Island, New Jersey,
    Wisconsin, and Ohio, we remain a defendant in active suits in
    Illinois and California. The Illinois suit seeks

class-wide

relief in the form of medical monitoring for elevated levels of
    lead in blood. In California, a number of cities and counties
    have joined in a consolidated action seeking abatement of the
    alleged public nuisance.

The environmental proceedings include litigation and
    administrative proceedings involving Beatrice’s status as a
    potentially responsible party at 36 Superfund, proposed
    Superfund, or state-equivalent sites; these sites involve
    locations previously owned or operated by predecessors of
    Beatrice that used or produced petroleum, pesticides,
    fertilizers, dyes, inks, solvents, PCBs, acids, lead, sulfur,
    tannery wastes,

and/or

other
    contaminants. Beatrice has paid or is in the process of paying
    its liability share at 33 of these sites. Reserves for these
    matters have been established based on our best estimate of the
    undiscounted remediation liabilities, which estimates include
    evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required

clean-up,

the known volumetric contribution of Beatrice and other
    potentially responsible parties, and our experience in
    remediating sites. The reserves for Beatrice environmental
    matters totaled $70 million as of May 30, 2010, a
    majority of which relates to the Superfund and state-equivalent
    sites referenced above. The reserve for Beatrice environmental
    matters reflects a reduction in pre-tax expense of approximately
    $15 million made in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 due to
    favorable regulatory developments at one of the sites. We expect
    expenditures for Beatrice environmental matters to continue for
    up to 20 years.

We are a party to a number of lawsuits and claims arising out of
    the operation of our business, including lawsuits and claims
    related to the February 2007 recall of our peanut butter
    products and litigation we initiated against an insurance
    carrier to recover our settlement expenditures and defense
    costs. We recognized a charge of $25 million during the
    third quarter of fiscal 2009 in connection with the disputed
    coverage with this insurance carrier. During the second quarter
    of fiscal 2010, a Delaware state court rendered a decision on
    certain matters in our claim for the disputed coverage favorable
    to the insurance carrier. We intend to appeal this decision and
    continue to pursue this matter vigorously.

An investigation by the Division of Enforcement of the
    U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
    (“CFTC”) of certain commodity futures transactions of
    a former Company subsidiary has led to an investigation of us by
    the CFTC. The investigation may result in litigation by the CFTC
    against us. The former subsidiary was sold on June 23,
    2008, as part of the divestiture of our trading and
    merchandising operations. The CFTC’s Division of


Enforcement has advised us that it questions whether certain
    trading activities of the former subsidiary violated the
    Commodity Exchange Act and that the CFTC has been evaluating
    whether we should be implicated in the matter based on the
    existence of the parent-subsidiary relationship between the two
    entities at the time of the trades. Based on information we have
    learned to date, we believe that both we and the former
    subsidiary have meritorious defenses. There have been
    discussions with the CFTC concerning resolution of this matter.
    We also believe the sale contract with the purchaser of the
    business provides us indemnification rights. Accordingly, we do
    not believe any decision by the CFTC to pursue this matter will
    have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or
    results of operations. If litigation ensues, we intend to defend
    this matter vigorously.

After taking into account liabilities recognized for all of the
    foregoing matters, management believes the ultimate resolution
    of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

charges totaling $33 million ($20 million after-tax)
    related to a product recall and associated insurance coverage
    dispute,

•

a gain of $19 million ($11 million after-tax)
    resulting from the

Pemmican

®

beef jerky divestiture, and

•

net tax benefits of approximately $6 million primarily
    related to changes in estimates.


In addition, fiscal 2009 diluted income per share benefited by
    approximately $0.03 as a result of the fiscal year including
    53 weeks.

Recent developments in our strategies and action plans include:

Garner,
    North Carolina Accident

On June 9, 2009, an accidental explosion occurred at our
    manufacturing facility in Garner, North Carolina (the
    “Garner accident”). This facility was the primary
    production facility for our

Slim
    Jim

®

branded meat snacks. On June 13, 2009, the U.S. Bureau
    of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives announced its
    determination that the explosion was the result of an accidental
    natural gas release, and not a deliberate act.

We maintain comprehensive property (including business
    interruption), workers’ compensation, and general liability
    insurance policies with very significant loss limits that we
    believe will provide substantial and broad coverage for the
    anticipated losses arising from this accident.

The costs incurred and insurance recoveries recognized, to date,
    are reflected in our consolidated financial statements, as
    follows:

The amounts in the table, above, exclude lost profits due to the
    interruption of the business, as well as any related business
    interruption insurance recoveries.

Through May 30, 2010, we had received payment advances from
    the insurers of approximately $85 million for our initial
    insurance claims for this matter, $58 million of which has
    been recognized as a reduction to selling, general and
    administrative expenses. We anticipate final settlement of the
    claim will occur in fiscal 2011. Based on management’s
    current assessment of production options, the expected level of
    insurance proceeds, and the estimated potential amount of losses
    and impact on the

Slim
    Jim

®

brand, we do not believe that the accident will have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
    condition, or liquidity. We expect

Slim
    Jim

®

profitability to reach pre-accident levels by fiscal 2012.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we determined that certain
    additional equipment located in the facility, with a carrying
    value of approximately $12 million, was impaired
    (impairment included in the table above). We expect to be
    reimbursed by our insurers for the cost of replacing these
    assets, and we have recognized a $12 million insurance
    recovery in fiscal 2010 (included in the table above),
    representing the carrying value of these destroyed assets.

Restructuring
    Plans

In March 2010, we announced a plan, authorized by our Board of
    Directors, related to the long-term production of our meat snack
    products. The plan provides for the closure of our meat snacks
    production facility in Garner, North Carolina, and the movement
    of production to our existing facility in Troy, Ohio. Since the
    Garner accident, the Troy facility has been producing a portion
    of our meat snack products. Upon completion of the plan’s
    implementation, which is expected to be in the second quarter of
    fiscal 2012, the Troy facility will be our primary meat snacks
    production facility. This plan is expected to result in the
    termination of approximately 500 employee positions in
    Garner and the creation of approximately 200 employee
    positions in Troy.


In May 2010, we made a decision to move certain administrative
    functions from Edina, Minnesota, to Naperville, Illinois. We
    expect to complete the transition of these functions in the
    first half of fiscal 2011. This plan, together with the plan to
    move production of our meat snacks from Garner, North Carolina
    to Troy, Ohio, are collectively referred to as the 2010
    restructuring plan (“2010 plan”). In connection with
    the 2010 plan, we expect to incur pre-tax cash and non-cash
    charges for asset impairments, accelerated depreciation,
    severance, relocation, and site closure costs of
    $67 million. In fiscal 2010, we recognized charges of
    approximately $39 million in relation to these plans.

As part of a focus on cost reduction, we previously initiated
    restructuring plans focused on streamlining our supply chain,
    reducing selling, general, and administrative costs

(“2006-2008

restructuring plan”), and streamlining the Consumer Foods
    international operations

(“2008-2009

restructuring plan”). As part of the

2006-2008

restructuring plan, we began construction of a new production
    facility in fiscal 2007. As a result of an updated assessment of
    manufacturing strategies and the related impact on this
    partially completed production facility, we decided to divest
    this facility. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of fiscal
    2010, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of
    $33 million, representing a write-down of the carrying
    value of the assets to fair value based on anticipated proceeds
    from the sale. This charge is reflected in selling, general and
    administrative expenses within the Consumer Foods segment.

Acquisitions

In June 2010, subsequent to the end of our fiscal 2010, we
    acquired the assets of American Pie, LLC, a manufacturer of
    frozen fruit pies, thaw and serve pies, fruit cobblers, and pie
    crusts under the licensed

Marie
    Callender’s

®

and

Claim
    Jumper

®

trade names, as well as frozen dinners, pot pies, and appetizers
    under the

Claim
    Jumper

®

trade name. This business is included in the Consumer Foods
    segment.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we completed the
    acquisition of Elan Nutrition (“Elan”), a privately
    held formulator and manufacturer of private label snack and
    nutrition bars, for approximately $103 million in cash. We
    expect the acquisition to add approximately $100 million to
    our Consumer Foods segment net sales in fiscal 2011, and we
    expect this acquisition to be accretive to operating cash flows
    immediately.

Divestiture
    of Gilroy Dehydrated Vegetable Business

In July 2010, subsequent to the end of our fiscal 2010, we
    completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of

Gilroy Foods &
    Flavors

tm

dehydrated garlic, onion, capsicum and Controlled
    Moisture

tm

,

    GardenFrost

®

,

Redi-Made

,

    and fresh vegetable operations for $250 million in cash,
    subject to final working capital adjustments. Based on our
    estimate of proceeds from the sale of this business, we
    recognized impairment and related charges totaling
    $59 million ($40 million after-tax) in the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2010. We reflected the results of these
    operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Sweet
    Potato Investment

In August 2009, we announced plans to build a new,
    environmentally friendly potato processing facility near Delhi,
    Louisiana, designed primarily to process sweet potatoes from the
    region into french fries and related products. As anticipated,
    the new facility is scheduled to open in the fall of 2010.

SEGMENT
    REVIEW

We report our operations in two reporting
    segments:  Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods.

Consumer
    Foods

The Consumer Foods reporting segment includes branded and
    private label food products that are sold in various retail and
    foodservice channels, principally in North America. The products
    include a variety of categories (meals, entrees, condiments,
    sides, snacks, and desserts) across frozen, refrigerated, and
    shelf-stable temperature classes.


During fiscal 2010, we completed the transition of the direct
    management of the Consumer Foods reporting segment from the
    Chief Executive Officer to the Consumer Foods President
    position. In conjunction with this organizational change,
    beginning in fiscal 2010, we have aligned our segment reporting
    to be consistent with the manner in which our operating results
    are presented to, and reviewed by, our Chief Executive Officer.
    All prior periods have been recast to reflect this change.

In February 2010, we completed the sale of our

Luck’s

®

brand for proceeds of approximately $22 million in cash,
    resulting in a pre-tax gain of $14 million ($9 million
    after-tax), reflected in selling, general and administrative
    expenses.

In June 2009, we completed the divestiture of the

Fernando’s

®

foodservice business for proceeds of $6 million in cash. We
    reflect the results of these operations as discontinued
    operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities
    of the divested

Fernando’s

®

business have been reclassified as assets and liabilities held
    for sale within our consolidated balance sheets for all periods
    prior to divestiture.

Commercial
    Foods

The Commercial Foods reporting segment includes commercially
    branded foods and ingredients, which are sold principally to
    foodservice, food manufacturing, and industrial customers. The
    segment’s primary products include: specialty potato
    products, milled grain ingredients, and a variety of vegetable
    products, seasonings, blends, and flavors, which are sold under
    brands such as

ConAgra
    Mills

®

,

Lamb
    Weston

®

,

    and

Spicetec

®

.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we transferred the
    management of the

Alexia

®

frozen food operations from the Consumer Foods segment to the
    Commercial Foods segment. Segment results have been recast to
    reflect this change.

As discussed above, we reflected the results of the

Gilroy
    Foods &
    Flavors

TM

operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
    The assets and liabilities of the divested

Gilroy
    Foods &

    and liabilities held for sale within our consolidated balance
    sheets for all periods presented.

Presentation of Derivative Gains (Losses) for Economic Hedges
    of Forecasted Cash Flows in Segment Results

In fiscal 2009, following the sale of our trading and
    merchandising operations and related organizational changes, we
    transferred the management of commodity hedging activities
    (except for those related to our milling operations) to a
    centralized procurement group. Beginning in the first quarter of
    fiscal 2009, we began to reflect realized and unrealized gains
    and losses from derivatives (except for those related to our
    milling operations) used to economically hedge anticipated
    commodity consumption in earnings immediately within general
    corporate expenses. The gains and losses are reclassified to
    segment operating results in the period in which the underlying
    item being economically hedged is recognized in cost of goods
    sold. We believe this change results in better segment
    management focus on key operational initiatives and improved
    transparency to derivative gains and losses.

Foreign currency derivatives used to manage foreign currency
    risk of forecasted cash flows are not designated for hedge
    accounting treatment. We believe these derivatives provide
    economic hedges of the foreign currency risk of certain
    forecasted transactions. As such, these derivatives are
    recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized
    gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses. The
    gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating
    results of the reporting segments in the period in which the
    underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in
    earnings.


The following table presents the net derivative gains (losses)
    from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the
    foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions, under
    this methodology (in millions):

Based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the
    underlying hedged items, we expect to reclassify losses of
    $5 million and gains of $2 million to segment
    operating results in fiscal 2011 and 2012 and thereafter,
    respectively. Amounts allocated, or to be allocated, to segment
    operating results during fiscal 2010 and 2011 include
    $5 million of losses incurred during fiscal 2009.

During fiscal 2008, derivative instruments used to create
    economic hedges of such commodity inputs were

marked-to-market

each period with both realized and unrealized changes in market
    value immediately included in cost of goods sold within segment
    operating profit. In fiscal 2008, net derivative gains from
    economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and foreign
    currency risk of certain forecasted transactions were
    $63 million in the Consumer Foods segment and
    $23 million in the Commercial Foods segment.

Overall, our net sales decreased $347 million to

    2009 including 53 weeks, as well as lower flour milling net
    sales in fiscal 2010 resulting from lower underlying wheat costs
    passed on to customers. This decrease was partially offset by
    improved pricing and mix in the Consumer Foods segment and the

specialty potato products business in the Commercial Foods
    segment. Volume reflected a benefit of approximately 2% in
    fiscal 2009 due to the inclusion of the additional week of

Consumer Foods net sales for fiscal 2010 were $8.0 billion,
    basically flat as compared to fiscal 2009. Results reflected
    flat volume and essentially unchanged net pricing and mix.
    Volume reflected a benefit of approximately 2% in fiscal 2009

Commercial Foods net sales were $4.08 billion in fiscal
    2010, a decrease of $370 million, or 8% compared to fiscal
    2009. Net sales in our flour milling business were approximately
    $330 million lower in fiscal 2010 than in fiscal 2009,
    principally reflecting the pass-through of lower wheat prices.
    Results also reflected a slight decrease in sales in our

Lamb
    Weston

specialty potato products business, reflecting lower volume of
    approximately 2%, partially offset by improved pricing and mix.
    Volume reflected a benefit of approximately 2% in fiscal 2009
    due to the inclusion of the additional week of results.
    Excluding the impact of the additional week, volume was
    essentially unchanged in fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009.

Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses (includes General Corporate
    Expense) (“SG&A”)

SG&A expenses totaled $1.82 billion for fiscal 2010,
    an increase of 8% compared to fiscal 2009. We estimate that the
    inclusion of the extra week in the fiscal 2009 results increased
    SG&A expenses by approximately 2% in that fiscal year.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2010
    reflected the following:

•

an increase in incentive compensation expense of
    $99 million,

•

charges totaling $36 million in connection with the
    Company’s 2010 plan, consisting of charges related to the
    Company’s decision to move manufacturing activities in
    Garner, North Carolina to Troy, Ohio, and the Company’s
    decision to move administrative functions in Edina, Minnesota to
    Naperville, Illinois,

•

a charge of $33 million in connection with the impairment
    of a partially completed production facility,

•

an increase in advertising and promotion expense of
    $29 million,

•

an increase in self-insured medical expense of $15 million,

•

a benefit of $15 million associated with a favorable
    adjustment to an environmental-related liability,

•

transaction-related costs of $14 million associated with
    securing federal tax benefits related to the Delhi, LA sweet
    potato production facility (the associated income tax benefits
    will be recognized in future periods),

•

a $14 million gain on the sale of the

Luck’s

®

brand,

•

increase in stock-based compensation expense of $13 million,

•

a decrease in charitable donations of $9 million, and

•

a net benefit of $8 million, representing SG&A
    expenses associated with the Garner accident that were more than
    offset by insurance recoveries.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2009
    reflected the following:

•

a charge of $50 million representing the net premium and
    fees paid to retire certain debt instruments prior to maturity,

•

a charge of $25 million related to a coverage dispute with
    an insurer,

•

a gain of $19 million from the sale of the

Pemmican

brand,

•

charges related to peanut butter and pot pie recalls of
    $11 million,

•

charges of $10 million related to the execution of our
    restructuring plans, and

•

$5 million of income, net of direct pass-through costs, for
    reimbursement of expenses related to transition services
    provided to the buyers of certain divested businesses.

Consumer Foods operating profit increased $164 million in

    profits were $262 million higher in fiscal 2010 than in
    fiscal 2009 driven by the impact of lower commodity input costs
    and the benefit of supply chain cost savings initiatives.
    Consumer Foods SG&A expenses were higher in fiscal 2010
    than in fiscal 2009, reflecting a $35 million increase in
    incentive compensation expenses and a $22 million increase
    in advertising and promotion expenses. The Consumer Foods
    segment recognized a $14 million gain on the sale of the

Luck’s

®

brand in fiscal 2010. Charges totaling $36 million were
    recognized in the Consumer Foods segment in fiscal 2010 in
    connection with our 2010 plan, including charges related to our
    decision to move manufacturing activities in Garner, North
    Carolina to Troy, Ohio, and our decision to move administrative
    functions in Edina, Minnesota to Naperville, Illinois. An
    additional charge of $33 million was recognized in
    connection with the impairment of a production facility, as we
    made a decision to divest the partially completed facility. The
    Consumer Foods segment recognized a $19 million gain on the
    sale of the

Pemmican

®

brand, incurred costs of product recalls classified as SG&A
    expense of $11 million, and incurred costs of
    $8 million in connection with our restructuring plans in
    fiscal 2009. The impact of foreign currencies, including related
    economic hedges, resulted in a reduction of operating profit of
    approximately $9 million in fiscal 2010, as compared to
    fiscal 2009.

The Garner accident in June 2009 resulted in charges within
    SG&A totaling $47 million for the impairment of
    property, plant and equipment, workers’ compensation, site

clean-up,

and other related costs in fiscal 2010 (in addition to inventory
    write-downs and other related costs of $12 million
    recognized in cost of goods sold). The impact of these charges
    was offset by insurance recoveries of $58 million in fiscal
    2010 for the involuntary conversion of assets. Gross profits
    from

Slim
    Jim

®

branded products were $25 million and $51 million in
    fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively, reflecting the impact of the
    disruption of production due to the accident.

Commercial Foods operating profit decreased $4 million in
    fiscal 2010 versus the prior year to $539 million. Improved
    gross profits in the flour milling business were partially
    offset by reduced gross profits in the specialty blend and
    flavorings business and the specialty potato business. Gross
    profits continued to be negatively impacted by challenging
    conditions in the foodservice channel as well as high production
    costs associated with a high cost and poor quality potato crop
    in our specialty potato business. Commercial Foods SG&A
    expenses were higher in fiscal 2010 than in fiscal 2009,
    reflecting a $5 million increase in incentive compensation
    expenses. Commercial Foods operating profit for fiscal 2009
    reflected the benefit of the additional week of operations.

Interest
    Expense, Net

In fiscal 2010, net interest expense was $160 million, a
    decrease of $26 million, or 14%, from fiscal 2009. The
    reduction in net interest expense is primarily the result of
    increased capitalized interest and increased interest income in
    fiscal 2010. Interest income includes $83 million and
    $73 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively, from the

payment-in-kind

notes received in June 2008 in connection with the divestiture
    of our trading and merchandising operations.

Income
    Taxes

Our income tax expense was $362 million and
    $319 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. The
    effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax
    expense to pre-tax income from continuing operations, inclusive
    of equity method investment earnings) was 33% for fiscal 2010
    and 34% in fiscal 2009. The lower effective tax rate in fiscal
    2010 was reflective of favorable changes in estimates and audit
    settlements, as well as certain income tax


credits and deductions identified in fiscal 2010 that related to
    prior periods. These benefits were offset, in part, by
    unfavorable tax consequences of the Patient Protection and
    Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education
    Reconciliation Act of 2010.

The Company expects its effective tax rate in fiscal 2011,
    exclusive of any unusual transactions or tax events, to be
    approximately 34%.

Equity
    Method Investment Earnings

We include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based
    on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates.
    Significant affiliates produce and market potato products for
    retail and foodservice customers. Our share of earnings from our
    equity method investments was $22 million ($2 million
    in the Consumer Foods segment and $20 million in the
    Commercial Foods segment) and $24 million ($3 million
    in the Consumer Foods segment and $21 million in the
    Commercial Foods segment) in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively.
    Equity method investment earnings in the Commercial Foods
    segment reflects continued difficult market conditions for our
    foreign and domestic potato ventures.

Results
    of Discontinued Operations

Our discontinued operations generated an after-tax loss of
    $22 million in fiscal 2010 and earnings of
    $361 million in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, we decided to
    divest our dehydrated vegetable operations. As a result of this
    decision, we recognized an after-tax impairment charge of
    $40 million in fiscal 2010, representing a write-down of
    the carrying value of the related long-lived assets to fair
    value, based on the anticipated sales proceeds. In fiscal 2009,
    we completed the sale of the trading and merchandising
    operations and recognized an after-tax gain on the disposition
    of approximately $301 million. In the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2009, we decided to sell certain small foodservice
    brands. The sale of these brands was completed in June 2009. We
    recognized after-tax impairment charges of $6 million in
    fiscal 2009, in anticipation of this divestiture.

Earnings
    Per Share

Our diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2010 were $1.62
    (including earnings of $1.67 per diluted share from continuing
    operations and a loss of $0.05 per diluted share from
    discontinued operations). Our diluted earnings per share in
    fiscal 2009 were $2.15 (including earnings of $1.36 per diluted
    share from continuing operations and $0.79 per diluted share
    from discontinued operations) See

    $7.98 billion, an increase of 8% compared to fiscal 2008.
    Results reflected an increase of 7% from improved net pricing
    and product mix and flat volume. Volume reflected a benefit of
    approximately 2% in fiscal 2009 due to the inclusion of an
    additional week of results. The strengthening of the
    U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies resulted in a
    reduction of net sales of approximately 1% as compared to fiscal
    2008.

Commercial Foods net sales were $4.45 billion in fiscal
    2009, an increase of $599 million, or 16% compared to
    fiscal 2008. Increased net sales reflected the pass through of
    higher wheat prices by the segment’s flour milling
    operations and higher selling prices in our

Lamb
    Weston

®

specialty potato products business, partially offset by lower
    foodservice volumes for our potato products. Results reflected a
    benefit of approximately 2% due to the inclusion of an
    additional week in fiscal 2009. Net sales from Watts Brothers
    and Lamb Weston BSW, businesses acquired in the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2008 and the second quarter of fiscal 2009,
    respectively, contributed $119 million to net sales in
    fiscal 2009.

SG&A
    Expenses (includes General Corporate Expense)
    (“SG&A”)

SG&A expenses totaled $1.68 billion for fiscal 2009, a
    decrease of 4% compared to fiscal 2008. We estimate that the
    inclusion of an extra week in the fiscal 2009 results increased
    SG&A expenses by approximately 2%.

SG&A expenses for fiscal 2009 reflected the following:

•

a decrease in incentive compensation expense of $53 million,

•

a charge of $50 million representing the net premium and
    fees paid to retire certain debt instruments prior to maturity,

•

a decrease in pension expense of $18 million,

•

a decrease in postretirement expense of $8 million,

•

a charge of $25 million related to a coverage dispute with
    an insurer,

•

a gain of $19 million from the sale of the

Pemmican

®

brand,

•

a decrease in stock compensation expense of $17 million,

•

an increase in salaries expense of $10 million,

•

charges related to peanut butter and pot pie recalls of
    $11 million,

•

charges of $10 million related to the execution of our
    restructuring plans,

•

$5 million of income, net of direct pass-through costs, for
    reimbursement of expenses related to transition services
    provided to the buyers of certain divested businesses, and

•

an increase in advertising and promotion expense of
    $4 million.

Included in SG&A expenses for fiscal 2008 were the
    following items:

•

charges of $22 million related to the execution of our
    restructuring plans,

•

charges related to product recalls of $21 million, and

•

$14 million of income, net of direct pass-through costs,
    for reimbursement of expenses related to transition services
    provided to the buyers of certain divested businesses.

Consumer Foods operating profit increased $119 million in
    fiscal 2009 versus the prior year to $949 million. Consumer
    Foods gross profit for fiscal 2009 was $2.03 billion, an
    increase of $45 million, or 2%, compared to fiscal 2008.
    The increase in gross profit reflected improved net pricing and
    mix and significant supply chain productivity savings, partially
    offset by significantly higher input costs. Consumer Foods gross
    profit in fiscal 2008 included approximately $28 million of
    costs related to the recalls of pot pie and peanut butter
    products. The increase in operating profit was also reflective
    of a number of other factors, including:

•

restructuring costs included in SG&A expenses of
    $8 million and $19 million in fiscal 2009 and 2008,
    respectively,

•

costs of the product recalls classified in SG&A expenses of
    approximately $11 million and $21 million in fiscal
    2009 and 2008, respectively,

•

a decrease in incentive compensation expense of
    $21 million, and

•

a gain of approximately $19 million related to the sale of
    the

Pemmican

®

brand.

Commercial Foods operating profit increased $77 million to
    $543 million in fiscal 2009. Operating profit improvement
    was principally driven by the improved gross profit. Commercial
    Foods gross profit was $758 million for fiscal 2009, an
    increase of $90 million, or 13%, compared to fiscal 2008.
    All major businesses in this segment experienced significantly
    higher input costs in fiscal 2009 than in fiscal 2008 and
    increased pricing to offset these higher costs. Improved results
    reflected increased gross profit in our flour milling operations
    due to high quality wheat crops and improved flour conversion
    margins. Our Lamb Weston BSW specialty potato business achieved
    increased gross profit in fiscal 2009, reflecting gross profit
    of $28 million from the Watts Brothers business acquired in
    late fiscal 2008 and the Lamb Weston BSW business acquired in
    the second quarter of fiscal 2009, as well as increased pricing
    that more than offset increased input costs and lower volume.

Interest
    Expense, Net

In fiscal 2009, net interest expense was $186 million, a
    decrease of $67 million, or 26%, from fiscal 2008. The
    reduction in net interest expense reflects interest income of
    $78 million in fiscal 2009, largely due to the

payment-in-kind

notes received in June 2008 in connection with the divestiture
    of our trading and merchandising operations.

Income
    Taxes

Our income tax expense was $319 million and
    $210 million in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. The
    effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax
    expense to pre-tax income from continuing operations, inclusive
    of equity method investment earnings) was 34% for fiscal 2009
    and 30% in fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2008, we adjusted our
    estimates of income taxes payable due to increased benefits from
    a domestic manufacturing deduction and lower foreign income
    taxes.

Equity
    Method Investment Earnings

We include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based
    on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates.
    Significant affiliates produce and market potato products for
    retail and foodservice customers. Our share of earnings from our
    equity method investments were $24 million ($3 million
    in the Consumer Foods segment and


$21 million in the Commercial Foods segment) and
    $50 million ($1 million in the Consumer Foods segment
    and $49 million in the Commercial Foods segment) in fiscal
    2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in equity method
    investment earnings in Commercial Foods was driven by the
    reduced profits of a foreign potato venture, resulting primarily
    from excess supply of potato products in the foreign potato
    venture’s market.

Results
    of Discontinued Operations

Our discontinued operations generated after-tax earnings of
    $361 million in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009, we completed
    the sale of the trading and merchandising operations and
    recognized an after-tax gain on the disposition of approximately
    $301 million. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we
    decided to divest certain small foodservice brands. The sale of
    these brands was completed in June 2009, subsequent to our
    fiscal 2009. We recognized after-tax impairment charges of
    $6 million in fiscal 2009, in anticipation of this
    divestiture.

Our discontinued operations generated after-tax earnings of
    $439 million in fiscal 2008.

Earnings
    Per Share

Our diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2009 were $2.15
    (including earnings of $1.36 per diluted share from continuing
    operations and $0.79 per diluted share from discontinued
    operations). Our diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2008 were
    $1.90 (including earnings of $1.00 per diluted share from
    continuing operations and $0.90 per diluted share from
    discontinued operations).

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Sources
    of Liquidity and Capital

Our primary financing objective is to maintain a prudent capital
    structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth
    objectives. If necessary, we use short-term debt principally to
    finance ongoing operations, including our seasonal requirements
    for working capital (accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and
    other current assets, and inventories, less accounts payable,
    accrued payroll, and other accrued liabilities) and a
    combination of equity and long-term debt to finance both our
    base working capital needs and our noncurrent assets.

Commercial paper borrowings (usually less than 30 days
    maturity) are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets
    within notes payable. At May 30, 2010, we had a
    $1.5 billion multi-year revolving credit facility with a
    syndicate of financial institutions which matures in December
    2011. The multi-year facility has historically been used
    principally as a

back-up

facility for our commercial paper program. As of May 30,
    2010, there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility.
    Borrowings under the multi-year facility bear interest at or
    below prime rate and may be prepaid without penalty. The
    multi-year facility requires that our consolidated funded debt
    not exceed 65% of our consolidated capital base, and that our
    fixed charges coverage ratio be greater than 1.75 to 1.0. As of
    the end of fiscal 2010, the Company was in compliance with these
    financial covenants.

As of the end of fiscal 2010, our senior long-term debt ratings
    were all investment grade. A significant downgrade in our credit
    ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the
    revolving credit facility, although borrowing costs would
    increase. A downgrade of our short-term credit ratings would
    impact our ability to borrow under our commercial paper program
    by negatively impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter
    durations, as well as making access to commercial paper more
    difficult.

We have repurchased shares of our common stock from time to time
    after considering market conditions as well as repurchase limits
    authorized by our Board of Directors. In February 2010, our
    Board of Directors approved a $500 million share repurchase
    program with no expiration date. We repurchased approximately
    4 million shares of our common stock for approximately
    $100 million under this program in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2010. We completed an accelerated share repurchase
    program during fiscal 2009. We paid $900 million and
    received 38.4 million shares in the first quarter of fiscal
    2009 when the program was initiated and an additional
    5.6 million shares in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009
    under this program.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we issued
    $1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes
    ($500 million maturing in 2014 and $500 million
    maturing in 2019), with an average blended interest rate of


approximately 6.4%. We subsequently repaid approximately
    $900 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes
    with maturities of 2010, 2011, and 2027. We incurred charges of
    $50 million for the premium paid and transaction costs
    associated with the debt retirement.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we sold our trading and
    merchandising operations for proceeds of: 1) approximately
    $2.2 billion in cash, net of transaction costs,
    2) $550 million (original principal amount) of

payment-in-kind

debt securities issued by the purchaser that were recorded at an
    initial estimated fair value of $479 million (the
    “Notes”), 3) a short-term receivable of
    $37 million due from the purchaser (which was subsequently
    collected in December 2008), and 4) a four-year warrant to
    acquire approximately 5% of the issued common equity of the
    parent company of the divested operations, which has been
    recorded at an estimated fair value of $1.8 million. In May
    2010, we received $115 million as payment in full of all
    principal and interest due on the first tranche of notes from
    the purchaser, in advance of the scheduled June 19, 2010
    maturity date. The remaining Notes had a carrying value of
    $490 million at May 30, 2010.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we completed the sale
    of approximately 17,600 acres of farmland to an unrelated
    buyer and immediately entered into a long-term lease of the land
    with an affiliate of the buyer. We received proceeds of
    approximately $75 million in cash, removed the land from
    our balance sheet, and recorded a deferred gain of approximately
    $30 million (reflected primarily in noncurrent
    liabilities). The lease agreement has an initial term of ten
    years and two five-year renewal options. This lease will be
    accounted for as an operating lease. We will recognize the
    deferred gain as a reduction of rent expense over the lease term.

In July 2010, subsequent to the end of our fiscal 2010, we
    completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of

    and fresh vegetable operations for $250 million in cash,
    subject to final working capital adjustments.

Cash
    Flows

In fiscal 2010, we generated $710 million of cash, which
    was the net result of $1.47 billion generated from
    operating activities, $355 million used in investing
    activities, and $405 million used in financing activities.

Cash generated from operating activities of continuing
    operations totaled $1.44 billion for fiscal 2010 as
    compared to $987 million generated in fiscal 2009,
    reflecting increased income from continuing operations in fiscal
    2010 and successful execution of our working capital management
    initiatives. Improvement in our accounts payable and inventory
    balances reflect the impact of our working capital initiatives
    as well as lower commodity costs in our flour milling business.
    The

year-over-year

improvement in operating cash flows also reflects lower
    incentive payments made in fiscal 2010 (earned in fiscal 2009),
    than those made in fiscal 2009. We also contributed
    $123 million to our Company-sponsored pension plans in
    fiscal 2010. Also included in cash generated from operating
    activities of continuing operations are insurance advances of
    $50 million for reimbursement of

out-of-pocket

expenses and foregone profits associated with the Garner, North
    Carolina accident. Cash generated from operating activities of
    discontinued operations was $30 million in fiscal 2010,
    primarily reflecting income from operations of the discontinued

Gilroy Foods &
    Flavors

tm

dehydrated vegetable business and reduced inventory balances
    within that business. Cash used in operating activities of
    discontinued operations was $863 million in fiscal 2009,
    primarily due to the increase in commodity inventory balances
    and derivative assets in the trading and merchandising business
    during the brief period we held that business prior to its
    divestiture in June 2008.

Cash used in investing activities of continuing operations
    totaled $353 million in fiscal 2010 and $461 million
    in fiscal 2009. Investing activities of continuing operations in
    fiscal 2010 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of
    $483 million and acquisitions of businesses and intangibles
    (including Elan) totaling $107 million, partially offset by
    sales of businesses and brands (including the

Luck’s

®

brand) of $22 million and sales of property, plant and
    equipment of $88 million. Also included in investing
    activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2010 was a cash
    inflow of $92 million (of the total receipt of
    $115 million) representing the payment in full of all
    principal and interest due on the first tranche of Notes from
    Gavilon, LLC, in advance of the scheduled maturity date (the
    remaining $23 million is reflected as cash generated from
    operating activities of continuing operations), and insurance
    advances of $35 million for the replacement of property,
    plant and equipment destroyed in the Garner accident. Investing
    activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2009 consisted
    primarily of capital expenditures of $430 million and
    expenditures of $80 million for acquisition of businesses
    and intangible assets. We generated


$2.25 billion of cash from investing activities of
    discontinued operations in fiscal 2009 from the disposition of
    the trading and merchandising business.

Cash used in financing activities totaled $405 million in
    fiscal 2010, as compared to cash used in financing activities of
    $1.83 billion in fiscal 2009. During fiscal 2010, we paid
    dividends of $347 million and repurchased approximately
    4 million shares of our common stock for $100 million.
    During fiscal 2010, we also received net proceeds of
    $55 million from employees exercising stock options and tax
    payments related to issuance of stock awards. During fiscal
    2009, we repurchased $900 million of our common stock as
    part of our share repurchase program, we reduced our short-term
    borrowings by $578 million, and paid dividends of
    $348 million. We refinanced certain of our long-term debt
    in fiscal 2009, issuing $1 billion aggregate principal
    amount of senior notes ($500 million maturing in 2014 and
    $500 million maturing in 2019.) We repaid $950 million
    aggregate principal amount of senior and subordinated notes
    throughout the year (net losses of $49 million on the
    retirement of debt are also reflected as financing cash
    outflows).

We estimate our capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 will be
    approximately $525 million, which will be partly offset by
    anticipated insurance proceeds related to the Garner accident.
    Management believes that existing cash balances, cash flows from
    operations, existing credit facilities, and access to capital
    markets will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our working
    capital needs, planned capital expenditures, and payment of
    anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve
    months.

OFF-BALANCE
    SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We use off-balance sheet arrangements (e.g., operating leases)
    where the sound business principles warrant their use. We
    periodically enter into guarantees and other similar
    arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of
    business. These are described further in “

Obligations
    and Commitments

,” below.

In September 2008, we formed a potato processing venture, Lamb
    Weston BSW, with Ochoa Ag Unlimited Foods, Inc. We provide all
    sales and marketing services to the venture. We have determined
    that Lamb Weston BSW is a variable interest entity and that we
    are the primary beneficiary of the entity. Accordingly, we
    consolidate the financial statements of Lamb Weston BSW. We also
    consolidate the assets and liabilities of several entities from
    which we lease corporate aircraft. Each of these entities has
    been determined to be a variable interest entity and we have
    been determined to be the primary beneficiary of each of these
    entities.

Due to the consolidation of the variable interest entities, we
    reflected in our balance sheets (in millions):

The liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating Lamb
    Weston BSW do not represent additional claims on our general
    assets. The creditors of Lamb Weston BSW have claims only on the
    assets of the specific variable


interest entity to which they have advanced credit. The assets
    recognized as a result of consolidating Lamb Weston BSW are the
    property of the venture and are not available to us for any
    other purpose.

OBLIGATIONS
    AND COMMITMENTS

As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements
    that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as
    debt agreements, lease agreements, and unconditional purchase
    obligations (i.e., obligations to transfer funds in the future
    for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or
    minimum prices, such as

“take-or-pay”

contracts). The unconditional purchase obligation arrangements
    are entered into in our normal course of business in order to
    ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available. Of
    these items, debt and capital lease obligations, which totaled
    $3.6 billion as of May 30, 2010, were recognized as
    liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease
    obligations and unconditional purchase obligations, which
    totaled approximately $692 million as of May 30, 2010,
    were not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance
    sheet, in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles.

A summary of our contractual obligations at the end of fiscal
    2010 was as follows (including obligations of discontinued
    operations):

We are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our
    long-term debt and capital lease obligations. The weighted
    average interest rate of the long-term debt obligations
    outstanding as of May 30, 2010 was approximately 6.9%.

We consolidate the assets and liabilities of certain entities
    that have been determined to be variable interest entities and
    for which we have been determined to be the primary beneficiary
    of these entities. The amounts reflected in contractual
    obligations from long-term debt, in the table above, include
    $83 million of liabilities of these variable interest
    entities to the creditors of such entities. The long-term debt
    recognized as a result of consolidating Lamb Weston BSW entity
    does not represent additional claims on our general assets. The
    creditors of Lamb Weston BSW have claims only on the assets of
    the specific variable interest entity.

The purchase obligations noted in the table above do not reflect
    approximately $458 million of open purchase orders, some of
    which are not legally binding. These purchase orders will be
    settled in the ordinary course of business in less than one year.

As part of our ongoing operations, we also enter into
    arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments only
    upon the occurrence of a future event (e.g., guarantee debt or
    lease payments of a third party should the third party be unable
    to perform). In accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, the following commercial commitments are not
    recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. A
    summary of our commitments, including commitments associated
    with equity method investments, as of the end of fiscal 2010, is

In certain limited situations, we will guarantee an obligation
    of an unconsolidated entity. We guarantee certain leases and
    other commercial obligations resulting from the 2002 divestiture
    of our fresh beef and pork operations. The remaining terms of
    these arrangements do not exceed six years and the maximum
    amount of future payments we have guaranteed was approximately
    $16 million as of May 30, 2010. We have also
    guaranteed the performance of the divested fresh beef and pork
    business with respect to a hog purchase contract. The hog
    purchase contract requires the divested fresh beef and pork
    business to purchase a minimum of approximately 1.2 million
    hogs annually through 2014. The contract stipulates minimum
    price commitments, based in part on market prices, and in
    certain circumstances also includes price adjustments based on
    certain inputs.

We are a party to various potato supply agreements. Under the
    terms of certain such potato supply agreements, we have
    guaranteed repayment of short-term bank loans of the potato
    suppliers, under certain conditions. At May 30, 2010, the
    amount of supplier loans effectively guaranteed by us was
    approximately $29 million. We have not established a
    liability for these guarantees, as we have determined that the
    likelihood of our required performance under the guarantees is
    remote.

We are a party to a supply agreement with an onion processing
    company. We have guaranteed repayment of a portion of a loan of
    this supplier, under certain conditions. At May 30, 2010,
    the term of the loan is 14 years. The amount of our
    guaranty was $25 million as of May 30, 2010. In the
    event of default on this loan by the supplier, we have the
    contractual right to purchase the loan from the lender, thereby
    giving us the rights to underlying collateral. We have not
    established a liability in connection with this guaranty, as we
    believe the likelihood of financial exposure to us under this
    agreement is remote.

Federal income tax credits were generated related to our sweet
    potato production facility currently under construction in
    Delhi, Louisiana. Third parties invested in certain of these
    income tax credits. We have guaranteed these third parties the
    face value of these income tax credits over their statutory
    lives, a period of seven years, in the event that the income tax
    credits are recaptured or reduced. The face value of the income
    tax credits was $21 million as of May 30, 2010. We
    believe the likelihood of the recapture or reduction of the
    income tax credits is remote, and therefore we have not
    established a liability in connection with this guarantee.

The obligations and commitments tables above do not include any
    reserves for uncertainties in income taxes, as we are unable to
    reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of settlement of our
    reserves for income taxes. The liability for gross unrecognized
    tax benefits at May 30, 2010 was $53 million.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The process of preparing financial statements requires the use
    of estimates on the part of management. The estimates used by
    management are based on our historical experiences combined with
    management’s understanding of current facts and
    circumstances. Certain of our accounting estimates are
    considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal
    of our financial condition and results and require significant
    or complex judgment on the part of management. The following is
    a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by
    management.

Our Audit Committee has reviewed management’s development,
    selection, and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates.

Marketing Costs

—We incur certain costs to promote
    our products through marketing programs, which include
    advertising, customer incentives, and consumer incentives. We
    recognize the cost of each of these types of marketing
    activities as incurred, in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. The judgment required in determining when
    marketing costs are incurred can be significant. For
    volume-based incentives provided to customers, management must
    continually assess the likelihood of the customer achieving the
    specified targets. Similarly, for consumer coupons, management
    must estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by
    consumers in the future. Estimates made by management in
    accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on our
    historical experience with marketing programs with consideration
    given to current circumstances and industry trends. As these
    factors change, management’s estimates could change and we
    could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over
    different periods of time.


During fiscal 2010, we entered into over 120,000 individual
    marketing programs with customers and consumers, resulting in
    costs in excess of $2.5 billion. These costs are reflected
    as a reduction of net sales. Changes in the assumptions used in
    estimating the cost of any of the individual customer marketing
    programs would not result in a material change in our results of
    operations or cash flows.

Advertising and promotion expenses of continuing operations
    totaled $409 million, $381 million, and
    $377 million in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

Income Taxes

—Our income tax expense is based on our
    income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities
    available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax
    laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the
    taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities.
    Significant judgment is required in determining our income tax
    expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including
    evaluating uncertainties. Management reviews tax positions at
    least quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information
    becomes available. Deferred income tax assets represent amounts
    available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in
    future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences
    between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
    liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit
    carryforwards. Management evaluates the recoverability of these
    future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future
    expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of
    taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and
    available tax planning strategies. These estimates of future
    taxable income inherently require significant judgment.
    Management uses historical experience and short and long-range
    business forecasts to develop such estimates. Further, we employ
    various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to
    facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. To the
    extent management does not consider it more likely than not that
    a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is
    established.

Further information on income taxes is provided in Note 16
    to the consolidated financial statements.

Environmental Liabilities

—Environmental liabilities
    are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been
    incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated.
    Management works with independent third-party specialists in
    order to effectively assess our environmental liabilities.
    Management estimates our environmental liabilities based on
    evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required cleanup,
    our known volumetric contribution, other potentially responsible
    parties, and our experience in remediating sites. Environmental
    liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or
    other external determinations of what constitutes an
    environmental liability or an acceptable level of cleanup.
    Management’s estimate as to our potential liability is
    independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or
    indemnification arrangements. Insurance companies and other
    indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and
    periodically updated as to the general status of known claims.
    We do not discount our environmental liabilities as the timing
    of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily
    determinable. To the extent that there are changes in the
    evaluation factors identified above, management’s estimate
    of environmental liabilities may also change.

We have recognized a reserve of approximately $71 million
    for environmental liabilities as of May 30, 2010. The
    reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of
    the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the
    costs required to effect such remedy. Historically, the
    underlying assumptions utilized in estimating this reserve have
    been appropriate as actual payments have neither differed
    materially from the previously estimated reserve balances, nor
    have significant adjustments to this reserve balance been
    necessary. In fiscal 2010, based on changes in the regulatory
    environment applicable to a particular site, we reduced the
    recognized environmental liability by approximately
    $15 million.

Employment-Related Benefits

—We incur certain
    employment-related expenses associated with pensions,
    postretirement health care benefits, and workers’
    compensation. In order to measure the expense associated with
    these employment-related benefits, management must make a
    variety of estimates including discount rates used to measure
    the present value of certain liabilities, assumed rates of
    return on assets set aside to fund these expenses, compensation
    increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates,
    anticipated health care costs, and employee accidents incurred
    but not yet reported to us. The estimates used by management are
    based on our historical experience as well as current facts and
    circumstances. We use third-party specialists to assist
    management in appropriately measuring the expense associated
    with these employment-related benefits. Different estimates used
    by management could result in us recognizing different amounts
    of expense over different periods of time. We had recognized a
    pension liability of


$470 million and $317 million, a postretirement
    liability of $321 million and $281 million, and a
    workers’ compensation liability of $73 million and
    $76 million, as of the end of fiscal 2010 and 2009,
    respectively.

We recognized pension expense from Company plans of
    $47 million, $38 million, and $56 million in
    fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively, which reflected
    expected returns on plan assets of $161 million,
    $159 million, and $149 million, respectively. We
    contributed $123 million, $112 million, and
    $8 million to our pension plans in fiscal years 2010, 2009,
    and 2008, respectively. We anticipate contributing approximately
    $116 million to our pension plans in fiscal 2011.

One significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the
    discount rate. We select a discount rate each year (as of our
    fiscal year-end measurement date for fiscal 2009 and thereafter)
    for our plans based upon a hypothetical bond portfolio for which
    the cash flows from coupons and maturities match the

year-by-year

projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans. The
    hypothetical bond portfolio is comprised of high-quality fixed
    income debt instruments (usually Moody’s Aa) available at
    the measurement date. Based on this information, the discount
    rate selected by us for determination of pension expense was
    6.9% for fiscal year 2010, 6.6% for fiscal 2009, and 5.75% for
    fiscal 2008. We selected a discount rate of 5.8% for
    determination of pension expense for fiscal 2011. A
    25 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption as
    of the beginning of fiscal 2010 would decrease pension expense
    for our pension plans by $1.6 million for the year. A
    25 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption as
    of the beginning of fiscal 2010 would increase pension expense
    for our pension plans by $1.7 million for the year. A
    25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease
    pension expense by approximately $8.3 million for fiscal
    2011. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would
    increase pension expense by approximately $8.9 million for
    fiscal 2011. For our year-end pension obligation determination,
    we selected a discount rate of 5.8% and 6.9% for fiscal years
    2010 and 2009, respectively.

Another significant assumption used to account for our pension
    plans is the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
    In developing the assumed long-term rate of return on plan
    assets for determining pension expense, we consider long-term
    historical returns (arithmetic average) of the plan’s
    investments, the asset allocation among types of investments,
    estimated long-term returns by investment type from external
    sources, and the current economic environment. Based on this
    information, we selected 7.75% for the long-term rate of return
    on plan assets for determining our fiscal 2010 pension expense.
    A 25 basis point increase/decrease in our expected
    long-term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of
    fiscal 2010 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for
    our pension plans by approximately $5 million. We selected
    an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.75% to be used to
    determine our pension expense for fiscal 2011. A 25 basis
    point increase/decrease in our expected long-term rate of return
    assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 would
    decrease/increase annual pension expense for our pension plans
    by approximately $5 million.

When calculating expected return on plan assets for pension
    plans, we use a market-related value of assets that spreads
    asset gains and losses (differences between actual return and
    expected return) over five years. The market-related value of
    assets used in the calculation of expected return on plan assets
    for fiscal 2010 was $232 million higher than the actual
    fair value of plan assets.

The rate of compensation increase is another significant
    assumption used in the development of accounting information for
    pension plans. We determine this assumption based on our
    long-term plans for compensation increases and current economic
    conditions. Based on this information, we selected 4.25% for
    fiscal years 2010 and 2009 as the rate of compensation increase
    for determining our year-end pension obligation. We selected
    4.25% for the rate of compensation increase for determination of
    pension expense for fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008. A 25 basis
    point increase in our rate of compensation increase assumption
    as of the beginning of fiscal 2010 would increase pension
    expense for our pension plans by approximately $1 million
    for the year. A 25 basis point decrease in our rate of
    compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal
    2010 would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by
    approximately $1 million for the year. We selected a rate
    of 4.25% for the rate of compensation increase to be used to
    determine our pension expense for fiscal 2011. A 25 basis
    point increase/decrease in our rate of compensation increase
    assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 would
    increase/decrease pension expense for our pension plans by
    approximately $1 million for the year.

We also provide certain postretirement health care benefits. We
    recognized postretirement benefit expense of $9 million,
    $15 million, and $23 million in fiscal 2010, 2009, and
    2008, respectively. We reflected liabilities of


$321 million and $281 million in our balance sheets as
    of May 30, 2010 and May 31, 2009, respectively. We
    anticipate contributing approximately $36 million to our
    postretirement health care plans in fiscal 2011.

The postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also
    dependent on our assumptions used for the actuarially determined
    amounts. These assumptions include discount rates (discussed
    above), health care cost trend rates, inflation rates,
    retirement rates, mortality rates, and other factors. The health
    care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical
    cost data, the near-term outlook, and an assessment of likely
    long-term trends. Assumed inflation rates are based on an
    evaluation of external market indicators. Retirement and
    mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience.
    The discount rate we selected for determination of
    postretirement expense was 6.6% for fiscal year 2010, 6.4% for
    fiscal 2009, and 5.5% for fiscal 2008. We have selected a
    discount rate of 5.4% for determination of postretirement
    expense for fiscal 2011. A 25 basis point increase/decrease
    in our discount rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal
    2010 would not have resulted in a material change to
    postretirement expense for our plans. We have assumed the
    initial year increase in cost of health care to be 8.0%, with
    the trend rate decreasing to 5.0% by 2016. A one percentage
    point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would
    have the following effect:

We provide workers’ compensation benefits to our employees.
    The measurement of the liability for our cost of providing these
    benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs. One
    significant assumption we make is the discount rate used to
    calculate the present value of our obligation. The discount rate
    used at May 30, 2010 was 3.75%. A 25 basis point
    increase/decrease in the discount rate assumption would not have
    a material impact on workers’ compensation expense.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (including property, plant
    and equipment), Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible
    Assets

—We reduce the carrying amounts of long-lived
    assets, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets to their
    fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to
    be less than their carrying amounts (i.e., assets are deemed to
    be impaired). Fair value is typically estimated using a
    discounted cash flow analysis, which requires us to estimate the
    future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular
    asset(s) being tested for impairment as well as to select a
    discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated
    cash flows. When determining future cash flow estimates, we
    consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and
    anticipated operating conditions. Estimating future cash flows
    requires significant judgment by management in such areas as
    future economic conditions, industry-specific conditions,
    product pricing, and necessary capital expenditures. The use of
    different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could
    produce different impairment amounts (or none at all) for
    long-lived assets, goodwill, and identifiable intangible assets.

We utilize a “relief from royalty” methodology in
    evaluating impairment of our indefinite lived brands/trademarks.
    The methodology determines the fair value of each brand through
    use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an
    estimated “royalty rate” we would be able to charge a
    third party for the use of the particular brand. When
    determining the future cash flow estimates, we must estimate
    future net sales and a fair market royalty rate for each
    applicable brand and an appropriate discount rate to measure the
    present value of the anticipated cash flows. Estimating future
    net sales requires significant judgment by management in such
    areas as future economic conditions, product pricing, and
    consumer trends.

In determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to the
    estimated future cash flows, we consider the current interest
    rate environment and our estimated cost of capital. As the
    calculated fair value of our goodwill and other identifiable
    intangible assets generally significantly exceeds the carrying
    amount of these assets, a one percentage point increase in the
    discount rate assumptions used to estimate the fair values of
    our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets would not
    result in a material impairment charge.

RECENTLY
    ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
    guidance that requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to
    determine whether the enterprise’s variable interest or
    interests give it a controlling financial interest in a


variable interest entity. This analysis identifies the primary
    beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that
    has both of the following characteristics: the power to direct
    the activities of a variable interest entity that most
    significantly impact the entity’s economic performance, and
    the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could
    potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or
    the right to receive benefits from the entity that could
    potentially be significant to the variable interest entity. The
    provisions of this guidance are effective as of the beginning of
    our fiscal 2011. Earlier application is prohibited. We are
    currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.

RELATED-PARTY
    TRANSACTIONS

From time to time, one of our business units has engaged an
    environmental and agricultural engineering services firm. The
    firm is a subsidiary of an entity whose chief executive officer
    serves on our Board of Directors. Payments to this firm for
    environmental and agricultural engineering services and
    structures acquired totaled $0.3 million and
    $0.4 million in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, respectively.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The principal market risks affecting us during fiscal 2010 and
    2009 were exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and
    energy inputs, interest rates, and foreign currencies. These
    fluctuations impacted all reporting segments, as well as our
    trading and merchandising activities, which are presented as
    discontinued operations for all periods presented in our
    financial statements.

Commodities

—We purchase commodity inputs such as
    wheat, corn, oats, soybean meal, soybean oil, meat, dairy
    products, sugar, natural gas, electricity, and packaging
    materials to be used in our operations. These commodities are
    subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk. We
    enter into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using
    physical forward contracts or derivative instruments. We have
    policies governing the hedging instruments our businesses may
    use. These policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure
    for each of our businesses. We also monitor the amount of
    associated counter-party credit risk for all non-exchange-traded
    transactions. In addition, during our ownership of the trading
    and merchandising business (divested during quarter one of
    fiscal 2009), we purchased and sold certain commodities, such as
    wheat, corn, soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, oats, natural
    gas, and crude oil (presented in discontinued operations).

The following table presents one measure of market risk exposure
    using sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis is the
    measurement of potential loss of fair value resulting from a
    hypothetical change of 10% in market prices. Actual changes in
    market prices may differ from hypothetical changes. In practice,
    as markets move, we actively manage our risk and adjust hedging
    strategies as appropriate.

Fair value was determined using quoted market prices and was
    based on our net derivative position by commodity at each
    quarter-end during the fiscal year.


The market risk exposure analysis excludes the underlying
    commodity positions that are being hedged. The values of
    commodities hedged have a high inverse correlation to price
    changes of the derivative commodity instrument.

Interest Rates

—We may use interest rate swaps to
    manage the effect of interest rate changes on the fair value of
    our existing debt as well as the forecasted interest payments
    for the anticipated issuance of debt. During the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2010, we entered into interest rate swap contracts
    used to hedge the fair value of certain of our senior long-term
    debt. The maximum potential loss from a hypothetical change of
    1% in interest rates was approximately $24 million. At the
    end of fiscal 2009, we did not have any interest rate swap
    agreements outstanding.

As of May 30, 2010 and May 31, 2009, the fair value of
    our fixed rate debt was estimated at $4.1 billion and
    $3.7 billion, respectively, based on current market rates
    primarily provided by outside investment advisors. As of
    May 30, 2010 and May 31, 2009, a one percentage point
    increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our
    fixed rate debt by approximately $234 million and
    $196 million, respectively, while a one percentage point
    decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our
    fixed rate debt by approximately $256 million and
    $307 million, respectively.

Foreign Operations

—In order to reduce exposures
    related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we may
    enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions
    denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for
    certain of our processing operations. This activity primarily
    relates to hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing
    inventory, capital equipment, sales of finished goods, and
    future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.

The following table presents one measure of market risk exposure
    using sensitivity analysis for our processing operations.
    Sensitivity analysis is the measurement of potential loss of
    fair value resulting from a hypothetical change of 10% in
    exchange rates. Actual changes in exchange rates may differ from
    hypothetical changes.

Fair value was determined using quoted exchange rates and was
    based on our net foreign currency position at each quarter-end
    during the fiscal year.

The market risk exposure analysis excludes the underlying
    foreign denominated transactions that are being hedged. The
    currencies hedged have a high inverse correlation to exchange
    rate changes of the foreign currency derivative instrument.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Fiscal Year

—The fiscal year of ConAgra Foods,
    Inc. (“ConAgra Foods”, “Company”,
    “we”, “us”, or “our”) ends the
    last Sunday in May. The fiscal years for the consolidated
    financial statements presented consist of 52-week periods for
    fiscal years 2010 and 2008 and a 53-week period for fiscal year
    2009.

Basis of Consolidation

—The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of ConAgra Foods, Inc.
    and all majority-owned subsidiaries. In addition, the accounts
    of all variable interest entities for which we have been
    determined to be the primary beneficiary are included in our
    consolidated financial statements from the date such
    determination is made. All significant intercompany investments,
    accounts, and transactions have been eliminated.

Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates

—The
    investments in and the operating results of 50%-or-less-owned
    entities not required to be consolidated are included in the
    consolidated financial statements on the basis of the equity
    method of accounting or the cost method of accounting, depending
    on specific facts and circumstances.

We review our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for
    impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances
    indicate that the carrying amount of the investments may not be
    fully recoverable. Evidence of a loss in value that is other
    than temporary might include the absence of an ability to
    recover the carrying amount of the investment, the inability of
    the investee to sustain an earnings capacity which would justify
    the carrying amount of the investment, or, where applicable,
    estimated sales proceeds which are insufficient to recover the
    carrying amount of the investment. Management’s assessment
    as to whether any decline in value is other than temporary is
    based on our ability and intent to hold the investment and
    whether evidence indicating the carrying value of the investment
    is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs
    evidence to the contrary. Management generally considers our
    investments in equity method investees to be strategic long-term
    investments. Therefore, management completes its assessments
    with a long-term viewpoint. If the fair value of the investment
    is determined to be less than the carrying value and the decline
    in value is considered to be other than temporary, an
    appropriate write-down is recorded based on the excess of the
    carrying value over the best estimate of fair value of the
    investment.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

—Cash and all highly
    liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or
    less at the date of acquisition, including short-term time
    deposits and government agency and corporate obligations, are
    classified as cash and cash equivalents.

Inventories

—We principally use the lower of
    cost (determined using the

first-in,

first-out method) or market for valuing inventories other than
    merchandisable agricultural commodities. Grain, flour, and major
    feed ingredient inventories are principally stated at market
    value.

Property, Plant and Equipment

—Property, plant
    and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation has been
    calculated using primarily the straight-line method over the
    estimated useful lives of the respective classes of assets as
    follows:

Land improvements

1 - 40 years

Buildings

15 - 40 years

Machinery and equipment

3 - 20 years

Furniture, fixtures, office equipment, and other

5 - 15 years

We review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever
    events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the
    carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
    Recoverability of an asset considered

“held-and-used”

is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to
    the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from
    the use of the asset. If the carrying amount is greater than the
    undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the
    asset, the asset’s carrying amount is reduced to its
    estimated fair value. An asset considered

“held-for-sale”

is reported at the lower of the asset’s carrying amount or
    fair value.

Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible
    Assets

—Goodwill and other identifiable intangible
    assets with indefinite lives (e.g., brands or trademarks) are
    not amortized and are tested annually for impairment of value
    and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the
    carrying amount of the asset may be impaired. Impairment of
    identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives occurs when
    the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. If
    impaired, the asset’s carrying amount is reduced to its
    fair value. Goodwill is evaluated using a two-step impairment
    test at a reporting unit level. A reporting unit can be an
    operating segment or a business within an operating segment. The
    first step of the test compares the carrying value of a
    reporting unit, including goodwill, with its fair value. We
    estimate the fair value using level 3 inputs as defined by
    the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 21 for the
    definition of the levels in the fair value hierarchy. The inputs
    used to calculate the fair value include a number of subjective
    factors, such as (a) estimates of future cash flows,
    (b) estimates of our future cost structure,
    (c) discount rates for our estimated cash flows,
    (d) required level of working capital, (e) assumed
    terminal value and (f) time horizon of cash flow forecasts.
    If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair
    value, we complete the second step of the test to determine the
    amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized. In the
    second step, we estimate an implied fair value of the reporting
    unit’s goodwill by allocating the fair value of the
    reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than
    goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets). The
    impairment loss is equal to the excess of the carrying value of
    the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. Our
    annual impairment testing is performed during the fourth quarter
    using a discounted cash flow-based methodology.

Identifiable intangible assets with definite lives (e.g.,
    licensing arrangements with contractual lives or customer
    relationships) are amortized over their estimated useful lives
    and tested for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be
    impaired. Identifiable intangible assets that are subject to
    amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process
    similar to that used in evaluating elements of property, plant
    and equipment. If impaired, the asset is written down to its
    fair value.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

—Unless
    otherwise specified, we believe the carrying value of financial
    instruments approximates their fair value.

Environmental Liabilities

—Environmental
    liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations
    have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably
    estimated. We use third-party specialists to assist management
    in appropriately measuring the obligations associated with
    environmental liabilities. Such liabilities are adjusted as new
    information develops or circumstances change. We do not discount
    our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated
    cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable.
    Management’s estimate of our potential liability is
    independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or
    indemnification arrangements. We have not reduced our
    environmental liabilities for potential insurance recoveries.

Employment-Related
    Benefits

—Employment-related benefits associated
    with pensions, postretirement health care benefits, and
    workers’ compensation are expensed as such obligations are
    incurred. The recognition of expense is impacted by estimates
    made by management, such as discount rates used to value these
    liabilities, future health care costs, and employee accidents
    incurred but not yet reported. We use third-party specialists to
    assist management in appropriately measuring the obligations
    associated with employment-related benefits.

Revenue Recognition

—Revenue is recognized
    when title and risk of loss are transferred to customers upon
    delivery based on terms of sale and collectibility is reasonably
    assured. Revenue is recognized as the net amount to be received
    after deducting estimated amounts for discounts, trade
    allowances, and returns of damaged and

out-of-date

products. Changes in the market value of inventories of
    merchandisable agricultural commodities, forward cash purchase
    and sales contracts, and exchange-traded futures and options
    contracts are recognized in earnings immediately.

Shipping and Handling

—Amounts billed to
    customers related to shipping and handling are included in net
    sales. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods
    sold.

Marketing Costs

—We promote our products with
    advertising, consumer incentives, and trade promotions. Such
    programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons,
    rebates, and volume-based incentives. Advertising costs are
    expensed as incurred. Consumer incentives and trade promotion
    activities are recorded as a reduction of revenue or as a
    component of cost of goods sold based on amounts estimated as
    being due to customers and consumers at the end of the period,
    based principally on historical utilization and redemption
    rates. Advertising and promotion expenses totaled
    $409.3 million, $380.7 million, and
    $376.7 million in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008,
    respectively, and are included in selling, general and
    administrative expenses.

Research and Development

—We incurred expenses
    of $77.9 million, $78.0 million, and
    $66.5 million for research and development activities in
    fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

Comprehensive Income

—

Comprehensive
    income includes net income, currency translation adjustments,
    certain derivative-related activity, changes in the value of

available-for-sale

investments, and changes in prior service cost and net actuarial
    gains/losses from pension and postretirement health care plans.
    We generally deem our foreign investments to be essentially
    permanent in nature and, as such, we do not provide for taxes on
    currency translation adjustments arising from converting the
    investment in a foreign currency to U.S. dollars. When we
    determine that a foreign investment is no longer permanent in
    nature, estimated taxes are provided for the related deferred
    taxes, if any, resulting from currency translation adjustments.
    We reclassified $2.0 million of foreign currency
    translation net losses to net income due to the disposal or
    substantial liquidation of foreign subsidiaries and equity
    method investments in fiscal 2009.

Use of Estimates

—Preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
    principles requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect reported
    amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses as
    reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Actual
    results could differ from these estimates.

Reclassifications—

Certain prior year amounts
    have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

Accounting Changes

—In December 2007, the
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued
    guidance on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial
    statements. This guidance establishes accounting and reporting
    standards for the noncontrolling interest (minority interest) in
    a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This
    guidance requires that noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries
    be reported as a component of stockholders’ equity in the
    consolidated balance sheets. However, securities of an issuer
    that are redeemable at the option of the holder continue to be
    classified outside stockholders’ equity. The noncontrolling
    interest holder in the potato processing venture, Lamb Weston
    BSW, LLC (“Lamb Weston BSW” or the
    “venture”), has the contractual right to put its
    equity interest to us at a future date. Accordingly, the
    noncontrolling interest in this venture is classified within
    other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.
    This guidance also requires that earnings or losses attributed
    to the noncontrolling interests be reported as part of
    consolidated earnings and not as a separate component of income
    or expense and requires disclosure of the attribution of
    consolidated earnings to the controlling and noncontrolling
    interests on the face of the consolidated statement of earnings.
    We adopted the provisions of this guidance on a prospective
    basis, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements,
    as of the beginning of our fiscal 2010. We adopted the
    presentation and disclosure requirements of this guidance
    retrospectively in fiscal 2010.

In December 2007, the FASB issued guidance on business
    combinations that establishes principles and requirements for
    how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and
    measures the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any
    noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. We adopted the
    provisions of this guidance for our business combinations
    occurring on or after June 1, 2009.

In June 2008, the FASB issued guidance which provides that
    unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable
    rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating
    securities and must be included in the computation of earnings
    per share under the two-class method. This guidance was
    effective as of the beginning of our fiscal 2010. The adoption
    of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial
    statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued guidance for fair value
    measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework
    for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair
    value measurements. This guidance was effective as of the
    beginning of our fiscal 2009 for our financial assets and
    liabilities, as well as for other assets and liabilities that
    are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in our
    consolidated financial statements. As of the beginning of fiscal
    2010, we adopted additional new guidance relating to
    nonrecurring fair value measurement requirements for
    nonfinancial assets and liabilities. The adoption did not have a
    material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

—In
    June 2009, the FASB issued guidance that requires an enterprise
    to perform an analysis to determine whether the
    enterprise’s variable interest or interests give it a
    controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity.
    This analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable
    interest entity as the enterprise that has both of the following
    characteristics: the power to direct the activities of a
    variable interest entity that most significantly impact the
    entity’s economic performance, and the obligation to absorb
    losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to
    the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits
    from the entity that could potentially be significant to the
    variable interest entity. The provisions

Trading
    and Merchandising Operations

On March 27, 2008, we entered into an agreement with
    affiliates of Ospraie Special Opportunities Fund to sell our
    commodity trading and merchandising operations conducted by
    ConAgra Trade Group (previously principally reported as the
    Trading and Merchandising segment). The operations included the
    domestic and international grain merchandising, fertilizer
    distribution, agricultural and energy commodities trading and
    services, and grain, animal, and oil seed byproducts
    merchandising and distribution business. In June 2008, the sale
    of the trading and merchandising operations was completed for
    before-tax proceeds of: 1) approximately $2.2 billion
    in cash, net of transaction costs (including incentive
    compensation amounts due to employees due to accelerated
    vesting), 2) $550 million (face value) of

payment-in-kind

debt securities issued by the purchaser (the “Notes”)
    which were recorded at an initial estimated fair value of
    $479 million, 3) a short-term receivable of
    $37 million due from the purchaser, and 4) a four-year
    warrant to acquire approximately 5% of the issued common equity
    of the parent company of the divested operations, which has been
    recorded at an estimated fair value of $1.8 million. We
    recognized an after-tax gain on the disposition of approximately
    $301 million in fiscal 2009.

During fiscal 2009, we collected the $37 million short-term
    receivable due from the purchaser. See Note 4 for further
    discussion on the Notes.

We reflected the results of the divested trading and
    merchandising operations as discontinued operations for all
    periods presented. The assets and liabilities of the divested
    trading and merchandising operations have been classified as
    assets and liabilities held for sale within our consolidated
    balance sheets for all periods prior to the divestiture.

ACQUISITIONS

On April 12, 2010, we acquired Elan Nutrition, Inc.
    (“Elan”) for approximately $103 million in cash
    plus assumed liabilities. Approximately $66 million of the
    purchase price was allocated to goodwill and approximately
    $34 million was allocated to brands, trademarks and other
    intangibles. This business is included in the Consumer Foods
    segment.

During fiscal 2009, we completed various individually immaterial
    acquisitions of businesses and other identifiable intangible
    assets for approximately $22 million in cash plus assumed
    liabilities. Approximately $5 million of the purchase price
    was allocated to brands, trademarks and other intangibles.

On February 25, 2008, we acquired Watts Brothers, a
    privately held group which has farming, processing, and
    warehousing operations for approximately $132 million in

    $101 million. Approximately $20 million of the
    purchase price was allocated to goodwill. The Watts Brothers
    operations are included in the Commercial Foods segment.

On September 22, 2008, we acquired a 49.99% interest in
    Lamb Weston BSW, LLC (“Lamb Weston BSW” or the
    “venture”), a potato processing joint venture with
    Ochoa Ag Unlimited Foods, Inc. (“Ochoa”), for
    approximately $46 million in cash. Lamb Weston BSW
    subsequently distributed $20 million of our initial
    investment to us. This venture is considered a variable interest
    entity and is consolidated in our financial statements (see
    Note 7). Approximately $19 million of the purchase
    price was allocated to goodwill and approximately
    $11 million was allocated to brands, trademarks and other
    intangibles. This business is included in the Commercial Foods
    segment.

On July 23, 2007, we acquired Alexia Foods, Inc.
    (“Alexia Foods”), a privately held natural food
    company headquartered in Long Island City, New York, for
    approximately $50 million in cash plus assumed liabilities.
    Alexia Foods offers premium natural and organic food items
    including potato products, appetizers, and artisan breads.
    Approximately $34 million of the purchase price was
    allocated to goodwill and $19 million to brands, trademarks
    and other intangible assets. The business is included in our
    Consumer Foods segment.

On September 5, 2007, we acquired Lincoln Snacks Holding
    Company, Inc. (“Lincoln Snacks”), a privately held
    company located in Lincoln, Nebraska, for approximately
    $50 million in cash plus assumed liabilities. Lincoln
    Snacks offers a variety of snack food brands and private label
    products. Approximately $20 million of the purchase price
    was allocated to goodwill and $17 million to brands,
    trademarks and other intangible assets. The business is included
    in the Consumer Foods segment.

On October 21, 2007, we acquired manufacturing assets of
    Twin City Foods, Inc., a potato processing business, for
    approximately $23 million in cash. These operations are
    included in the Commercial Foods segment.

Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets acquired
    and liabilities assumed in these acquisitions were recorded at
    their respective estimated fair values at the date of
    acquisition. The fair values of the assets and liabilities
    related to the acquisition of Elan is subject to refinement as
    we complete our analyses relative to the fair values at the
    respective acquisition dates.

PAYMENT-IN-KIND

NOTES RECEIVABLE

In connection with the divestiture of the trading and
    merchandising operations, we received the Notes described in
    Note 2 that were recorded at an initial estimated fair
    value of $479 million.

The Notes were issued in three tranches: $99,990,000 original
    principal amount of 10.5% notes due June 19, 2010;
    $200,035,000 original principal amount of 10.75% notes due
    June 19, 2011; and $249,975,000 original principal amount
    of 11.0% notes due June 19, 2012.

The Notes permit payment of interest in cash or additional
    notes. The Notes may be redeemed in whole or in part prior to
    maturity at the option of the issuer of the Notes. Redemption is
    at par plus accrued interest. The Notes contain certain
    covenants that govern the issuer’s ability to make
    restricted payments and enter into certain affiliate
    transactions. The Notes also provide for the making of mandatory
    offers to repurchase upon certain change of control events
    involving the purchaser of the divested trading and
    merchandising operations, their co-investors, or their
    affiliates. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we
    received $115 million as payment in full of all principal
    and interest due on the first tranche of Notes from the
    purchaser, in advance of the scheduled June 19, 2010
    maturity date. In the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we received
    a cash interest payment on the Notes of $30 million from
    the purchaser. With the exception of these cash receipts, all
    interest payments have been made in-kind. The remaining Notes
    due June 19, 2011 and June 19, 2012, which are
    classified as other assets, had a carrying value of
    $490 million at May 30, 2010.

Based on market interest rates of comparable instruments
    provided by investment bankers, we estimated the fair market
    value of the remaining Notes was $514 million at
    May 30, 2010.

GARNER,
    NORTH CAROLINA ACCIDENT

On June 9, 2009, an accidental explosion occurred at our
    manufacturing facility in Garner, North Carolina. This facility
    was the primary production facility for our

Slim
    Jim

®

branded meat snacks. On June 13, 2009, the U.S. Bureau
    of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives announced its
    determination that the explosion was the result of an accidental
    natural gas release, and not a deliberate act.

We maintain comprehensive property (including business
    interruption), workers’ compensation, and general liability
    insurance policies with very significant loss limits that we
    believe will provide substantial and broad coverage for the
    anticipated losses arising from this accident.

Through May 30, 2010, we had received payment advances from
    the insurers of approximately $85.0 million for our initial
    insurance claims for this matter, $58.1 million of which
    has been recognized as a reduction to selling, general and
    administrative expenses. We anticipate final settlement of the
    claim will occur in fiscal 2011. Based on management’s
    current assessment of production options, the expected level of
    insurance proceeds, and the estimated potential amount of losses
    and impact on the

Slim
    Jim

®

brand, we do not believe that the accident will have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
    condition, or liquidity.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we determined that certain
    additional equipment located in the facility, with a book value
    of approximately $12 million, was impaired (included in the
    table above). We expect to be reimbursed by our insurers for the
    cost of replacing these assets, and we have recognized a
    $12 million insurance recovery in fiscal 2010 (included in
    the table above), representing the carrying value of these
    destroyed assets.

RESTRUCTURING
    ACTIVITIES

    Restructuring Plan

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, our board of directors
    approved a plan recommended by executive management related to
    the long-term production of our meat snack products. The plan
    provides for the closure of our meat snacks production facility
    in Garner, North Carolina, and the movement of production to our
    existing facility in Troy, Ohio. Since the accident at Garner,
    in June 2009, the Troy facility has been producing a portion of
    our meat snack products. Upon completion of the plan’s
    implementation, which is expected to be in the second quarter of
    fiscal 2012, the Troy facility will be our primary meat snacks
    production facility. The plan is expected to result in the
    termination of approximately 500 employee positions in
    Garner and the creation of approximately 200 employee
    positions in Troy.

In May 2010, we made a decision to move certain administrative
    functions from Edina, Minnesota, to Naperville, Illinois. We
    expect to complete the transition of these functions in the
    first half of fiscal 2011. This plan, together with the plan to
    move production of our meat snacks from Garner, North Carolina
    to Troy, Ohio, are collectively referred to as the 2010
    restructuring plan (“2010 plan”).

In connection with the 2010 plan, we expect to incur pre-tax
    cash and non-cash charges for asset impairments, accelerated
    depreciation, severance, relocation, and site closure costs
    estimated to be approximately $67.5 million, of which
    $39.2 million was recognized in fiscal 2010. We have
    recorded expenses associated with this restructuring

Restructuring Plan

During fiscal 2008, our board of directors approved a plan

(“2008-2009

plan”) recommended by executive management to improve the
    efficiency of our Consumer Foods operations and related
    functional organizations and to streamline our international
    operations to reduce our manufacturing and selling, general, and
    administrative costs. This plan includes the reorganization of
    the Consumer Foods operations, the integration of the
    international headquarters functions into our domestic business,
    and exiting a number of international markets. These plans were
    substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2009. The total
    cost of the

2008-2009

plan was $36.3 million, of which $8.5 million was
    recorded in fiscal 2009 and $27.8 million was recorded in
    fiscal 2008. We have recorded expenses associated with the

2008-2009

plan, including but not limited to, inventory write-downs,
    severance and related costs, and plan implementation costs
    (e.g., consulting, employee relocation, etc.).

2006-2008

Restructuring Plan

In February 2006, our board of directors approved a plan
    recommended by executive management to simplify our operating
    structure and reduce our manufacturing and selling, general, and
    administrative costs

(“2006-2008

plan”). The plan included supply chain rationalization
    initiatives, the relocation of a divisional headquarters from
    Irvine, California to Naperville, Illinois, the centralization
    of shared services, salaried headcount reductions, and other
    cost-reduction initiatives. The plan was completed during fiscal
    2009. No material expenses were recognized in fiscal 2009 or
    2008 in connection with this plan.

As part of the

2006-2008

restructuring plan, we began construction of a new production
    facility in fiscal 2007. We determined that we will divest this
    facility. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we
    recognized an impairment charge of $33.3 million to
    write-down the asset to its expected sales value. This charge is
    reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses within
    the Consumer Foods segment.

VARIABLE
    INTEREST ENTITIES

As discussed in Note 3, in September 2008, we entered into
    a potato processing venture, Lamb Weston BSW. We provide all
    sales and marketing services to the venture. Commencing on
    June 1, 2018, or on an earlier date under certain
    circumstances, we have a contractual right to purchase the
    remaining equity interest in Lamb Weston BSW from Ochoa (the
    “call option”). Commencing on July 30, 2011, or
    on an earlier date under certain circumstances, we are subject
    to a contractual obligation to purchase all of Ochoa’s
    equity investment in Lamb Weston BSW at the option of Ochoa (the
    “put option”). The purchase prices under the call
    option and the put option (the “options”) are based on
    the book value of Ochoa’s equity interest at the date of
    exercise, as modified by an

agreed-upon

rate of return for the holding period of the investment balance.
    The

agreed-upon

rate of return varies depending on the circumstances under which
    any of the options are exercised. We have determined that the
    venture is a variable interest entity and that we are the
    primary beneficiary of the entity. Accordingly, we consolidate
    the financial statements of the venture.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we established a line of
    credit with Lamb Weston BSW, under which we will lend up to
    $1.5 million to Lamb Weston BSW, due on August 24,
    2010. Borrowings under the line of credit, which are subordinate
    to Lamb Weston BSW’s borrowings from a syndicate of banks,
    bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 3%.

Our variable interests in this venture include an equity
    investment in the venture, the options, and the line of credit
    advanced to Lamb Weston BSW. Other than our equity investment in
    the venture, the line of credit extended to the venture, and our
    sales and marketing services provided to the venture, we have
    not provided financial support to this entity. Our maximum
    exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with this
    venture is equal to our equity investment in the venture and
    advances under the line of credit extended to the venture.

We also consolidate the assets and liabilities of several
    entities from which we lease corporate aircraft. Each of these
    entities has been determined to be a variable interest entity
    and we have been determined to be the primary beneficiary of
    each of these entities. Under the terms of the aircraft leases,
    we provide guarantees to the owners of these entities of a
    minimum residual value of the aircraft at the end of the lease
    term. We also have fixed price purchase options on the aircraft
    leased from these entities. Our maximum exposure to loss from
    our involvement with these entities is limited to the difference
    between the fair value of the leased aircraft and the amount of
    the residual value guarantees at the time we terminate the
    leases (the leases expire between December 2011 and October
    2012). The total amount of the residual value guarantees for
    these aircraft at the end of the respective lease terms is
    $38.4 million.

Amortizing intangible assets, carrying a weighted average life

    2010, 2009, and 2008, we recognized amortization expense of
    $7.8 million, $6.6 million, and $2.6 million,
    respectively. Based on amortizing assets recognized in our
    balance sheet as of May 30, 2010, amortization expense is
    estimated to average approximately $10.2 million for each
    of the next five years.

In connection with the acquisition of Elan in fiscal 2010, we
    allocated approximately $66 million of the purchase price
    to non-deductible goodwill and approximately $34 million to
    intangible assets (all of which is presented in the Consumer
    Foods segment).

In connection with the acquisitions of Alexia Foods, Lincoln
    Snacks, and Watts Brothers in fiscal 2008, we allocated
    approximately $73 million of the purchase price to
    non-deductible goodwill (of which $53 million and
    $20 million (including $3 million which was
    reclassified in fiscal 2009 upon finalization of the purchase
    price allocation) are presented in the Consumer Foods segment
    and Commercial Foods segment, respectively) and approximately
    $36 million to intangible assets (all of which is presented
    in the Consumer Foods segment).

In connection with the acquisition of Lamb Weston BSW in fiscal
    2009, we allocated approximately $19 million of the
    purchase price to non-deductible goodwill and approximately
    $11 million to intangible assets (all of which is presented
    in the Commercial Foods segment).

EARNINGS

Basic earnings per share is calculated on the basis of weighted
    average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is
    computed on the basis of basic weighted average outstanding
    common shares adjusted for the dilutive effect of stock options,
    restricted stock awards, and other dilutive securities.

    the computation of shares contingently issuable upon exercise of
    the stock options because exercise prices exceeded the annual
    average market value of our common stock.

The decline in the diluted weighted average shares outstanding

CREDIT
    FACILITIES AND BORROWINGS

At May 30, 2010, we had a $1.50 billion multi-year
    revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial
    institutions that matures in December, 2011. The multi-year
    facility has historically been used principally as a

back-up

facility for our commercial paper program. As of May 30,
    2010, there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit
    facility. Borrowings under the multi-year facility bear interest
    at or below prime rate and may be prepaid without penalty. The
    multi-year revolving credit facility requires us to repay
    borrowings if our consolidated

funded debt exceeds 65% of the consolidated capital base, or if
    fixed charges coverage, each as defined in the credit agreement,
    is less than 1.75 to 1.0. As of May 30, 2010, we were in
    compliance with the credit agreement’s financial covenants.

We finance our short-term liquidity needs with bank borrowings,
    commercial paper borrowings, and bankers’ acceptances. The
    average consolidated short-term borrowings outstanding under
    these facilities were $245.5 million for fiscal 2009, which
    included borrowings to finance the trading and merchandising
    operations prior to divestiture. We had no material short-term

Other indebtedness included $83 million and
    $89 million of debt of consolidated variable interest
    entities at May 30, 2010 and May 31, 2009,
    respectively. The liabilities recognized as a result of
    consolidating the Lamb Weston BSW entity do not represent
    additional claims on our general assets. The creditors of Lamb
    Weston BSW have claims only on the assets of the specific
    variable interest entity to which they extend credit.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we issued
    $500 million of senior notes maturing in 2014 and
    $500 million of senior notes maturing in 2019.

During fiscal 2009, we retired $357.3 million of
    6.75% senior long-term debt due September 2011,
    $27.6 million of 7.125% senior long-term debt due
    October 2026, $290.8 million of 6.7% senior long-term
    debt due August 2027, $17.9 million of 7% senior
    long-term debt due October 2028, $252.0 million of
    7.875% senior long-term debt due September 2010, and
    $4.1 million of 9.75% senior subordinated long-term
    debt due March 2021, prior to the maturity of the long-term
    debt, resulting in net charges of $49.2 million.

As discussed in Note 3, in September 2008, we entered into
    a potato processing venture, Lamb Weston BSW. We have determined
    that the venture is a variable interest entity and that we are
    the primary beneficiary of the entity. Accordingly, we
    consolidate the financial statements of the venture. During the
    second quarter of fiscal 2009, Lamb Weston BSW entered into a
    term loan agreement with a bank under which it borrowed
    $20.0 million of senior debt at an annual interest rate of
    4.34% due September 2018. During the third quarter of fiscal
    2009, Lamb Weston BSW restructured and repaid this debt and
    entered into a term loan agreement with a bank under which it
    borrowed $40.0 million of variable

(30-day

LIBOR+1.85%) interest rate debt due in June 2018. In the first
    quarter of fiscal 2010, we established a line of credit with
    Lamb Weston BSW, under which we will lend up to
    $1.5 million to Lamb Weston BSW, due on August 24,
    2010. Borrowings under the line of credit, which are subordinate
    to Lamb Weston BSW’s borrowings from a syndicate of banks,
    bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 3%.

Our most restrictive debt agreements (the revolving credit
    facility and certain privately placed long-term debt) require
    that our consolidated funded debt not exceed 65% of our
    consolidated capital base, and that our fixed charges coverage
    ratio be greater than 1.75 to 1.0. At May 30, 2010, we were
    in compliance with our debt covenants.

Interest paid from continuing and discontinued operations was
    $244.3 million, $261.2 million, and
    $275.2 million in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

Our net interest expense was reduced by $1.2 million due to
    the impact of the interest rate swap contracts entered into in
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. The interest rate swaps
    effectively changed our interest rates on the senior long-term
    debt instruments maturing in fiscal 2012 and 2015 from fixed to
    variable. For further discussion on these derivative
    instruments, see Note 19.

Our net interest expense was increased by $0.7 million and
    reduced by $1.2 million in fiscal 2010 and 2008,
    respectively, due to the net impact of previously closed
    interest rate swap agreements.

As part of the Watts Brothers purchase in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2008, we assumed $83.8 million of debt, of which we
    immediately repaid $64.3 million after the acquisition.

    common stock for approximately $100 million under this
    program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. We completed an
    accelerated share repurchase program during fiscal 2009. We paid
    $900 million and received 44 million shares under this

SHARE-BASED
    PAYMENTS

In accordance with stockholder-approved plans, we issue
    share-based payments under various stock-based compensation
    arrangements, including stock options, restricted stock,
    performance shares, and other share-based awards.

On September 28, 2006, the stockholders approved the
    ConAgra Foods 2006 Stock Plan, which authorized the issuance of
    up to 30 million shares of ConAgra Foods common stock. On
    September 25, 2009, the stockholders approved the ConAgra
    Foods 2009 Stock Plan, which authorized the issuance of up to
    29.5 million shares of ConAgra Foods common stock. The
    shares remaining from the ConAgra Foods 2006 Stock Plan were
    rolled into the 2009 Stock Plan. At May 30, 2010,
    approximately 33.1 million shares were reserved for
    granting additional options, restricted stock, bonus stock
    awards, or other share-based awards.

Stock
    Option Plan

We have stockholder-approved stock option plans which provide
    for granting of options to employees for the purchase of common
    stock at prices equal to the fair value at the date of grant.
    Options become exercisable under various vesting schedules
    (typically three to five years) and generally expire seven to
    ten years after the date of grant.

The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant
    using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
    weighted average assumptions for stock options granted:




Expected volatility (%)

22.94

18.16

Expected life of stock option (years)

4.75

The expected volatility is based on the historical market
    volatility of our stock over the expected life of the stock
    options granted. The expected life represents the period of time
    that the awards are expected to be outstanding and is based on
    the contractual term of each instrument, taking into account
    employees’ historical exercise and termination behavior.

    The closing market price of our common stock on the last trading

Compensation expense for stock option awards totaled
    $22.0 million, $23.8 million, and $26.7 million

Share
    Unit Plans

In accordance with stockholder-approved plans, we issue stock
    under various stock-based compensation arrangements, including
    restricted stock, restricted share equivalents, and other
    share-based awards (“share units”). These awards
    generally have requisite service periods of three to five years.
    Under each arrangement, stock is issued without direct cost to
    the employee. We estimate the fair value of the share units
    based upon the market price of our stock at the date of grant.
    Certain share unit grants do not provide for the payment of
    dividend equivalents to the participant during the requisite
    service period (vesting period). For those grants, the value of
    the grants is reduced by the net present value of the foregone
    dividend equivalent payments. We recognize compensation expense
    for share unit awards on a straight-line basis over the
    requisite service period. The compensation expense for our share
    unit awards totaled $19.6 million, $17.8 million, and
    $16.7 million for fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008,
    respectively. The tax benefit related to the compensation
    expense for fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $7.3 million,
    $6.8 million, and $6.1 million, respectively.

    value of $19.41, $21.00, and $25.28, respectively.

The total intrinsic value of share units vested was
    $18.7 million, $18.7 million, and $16.9 million
    during fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

At May 30, 2010, we had $20.2 million of total
    unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures,
    related to share unit awards that will be recognized over a
    weighted average period of 1.7 years.

Performance-Based
    Share Plan

Performance shares are granted to selected executives and other
    key employees with vesting contingent upon meeting various
    Company-wide performance goals. The performance goals are based
    upon our earnings before interest and taxes and our return on
    average invested capital measured over a defined performance
    period. The awards actually earned will range from zero to three
    hundred percent of the targeted number of performance shares and
    will be paid in shares of common stock. Subject to limited
    exceptions set forth in the performance share plan, any shares
    earned will be distributed at the end of the performance period.
    The value of the performance shares granted in fiscal 2009 and
    2010 was adjusted based upon the market price of our stock at
    the end of each reporting period and amortized as compensation
    expense over the vesting period.

    expense for fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $5.4 million,
    $2.1 million, and $7.0 million, respectively.

The total intrinsic value of share units vested (including

    2008 was $24.8 million, $11.7 million, and
    $15.2 million, respectively.

Based on estimates at May 30, 2010, the Company had
    $12.2 million of total unrecognized compensation expense,
    net of estimated forfeitures, related to performance shares that
    will be recognized over a weighted average period of
    1.6 years.

Restricted
    Cash Plan

We have granted restricted share equivalents pursuant to plans
    approved by stockholders that are ultimately settled in cash
    (“restricted cash”) based on the market price of our
    common stock as of the date the award is fully vested. The value
    of the restricted cash is adjusted based upon the market price
    of our common stock at the end of each reporting period and
    amortized as compensation expense over the vesting period
    (generally five years). The restricted cash awards earn dividend
    equivalents during the requisite service period (vesting period).

The compensation expense (benefit) for the restricted cash
    awards totaled $(1.0) million and $1.2 million for
    fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively, while the tax benefit
    (expense) related to the compensation expense for the same
    periods was $(0.4) million and $0.4 million,
    respectively. The total payments for share-based liabilities
    during fiscal 2009 and 2008 were $8.9 million and
    $11.5 million, respectively. There were no restricted cash
    awards outstanding at May 30, 2010.

Accounting guidance requires the benefits of tax deductions in
    excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a
    financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow in
    our statements of cash flows. This requirement has reduced
    (increased) net operating cash flows and increased (decreased)
    net financing cash flows by approximately ($1.5) million,
    ($0.7) million, and $1.8 million for fiscal 2010,
    2009, and 2008, respectively.

At May 30, 2010 and May 31, 2009, net deferred tax
    assets of $110.8 million and $112.1 million,
    respectively, are included in prepaid expenses and other current
    assets. At May 30, 2010 and May 31, 2009, net deferred
    tax liabilities of $466.0 million and $503.4 million,
    respectively, are included in other noncurrent liabilities.

During fiscal 2008, we adopted guidance which addressed
    accounting for the uncertainty in income taxes. As a result of
    the implementation of this guidance, we recognized a
    $1.2 million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits, with a corresponding adjustment to retained earnings.

The liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits at
    May 30, 2010 was $53.4 million, excluding a related
    liability of $14.8 million for gross interest and
    penalties. Included in the balance at May 30, 2010 are
    $4.6 million of tax positions for which the ultimate
    deductibility is highly certain but for which there is
    uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of
    the impact of deferred tax accounting, the disallowance of the
    shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual
    effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to
    the taxing authority to an earlier period. Any associated
    interest and penalties imposed would affect the tax rate. As of
    May 31, 2009, our gross liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits was $74.6 million, excluding a related liability
    of $14.5 million for gross interest and penalties.

The net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at May 30, 2010
    and May 31, 2009 that, if recognized, would favorably
    impact our effective tax rate was $32.6 million and
    $51.0 million, respectively.

We accrue interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax
    positions as part of income tax expense.

We conduct business and file tax returns in numerous countries,
    states, and local jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue
    Service (“IRS”) has completed its audit for tax years
    through fiscal 2008 and all resulting significant items for
    fiscal 2008 and prior years have been settled with the IRS.
    Other major jurisdictions where we conduct business generally
    have statutes of limitations ranging from 3 to 5 years.

We estimate that it is reasonably possible that the amount of
    gross unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by $0 to
    $5 million over the next twelve months due to various
    federal, state, and foreign audit settlements and the expiration
    of statutes of limitations.

We have approximately $46.5 million of foreign net

    fiscal 2011 and 2021 and $35.0 million have no expiration
    dates). Substantially all of our foreign tax credits will expire
    between fiscal 2013 and 2018. State tax credits of approximately
    $17.5 million expire in various years ranging from fiscal
    2013 to 2016.

We have recognized a valuation allowance for the portion of the
    net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards, and
    other deferred tax assets we believe will not more likely than
    not be realized. The net impact on income tax expense related to
    changes in the valuation allowance for fiscal 2010 was a benefit
    of $4.6 million. For fiscal 2009 and 2008, changes in the
    valuation allowance were charges of $3.8 million and
    $1.6 million, respectively. The current year change
    principally relates to decreases to the valuation allowances for
    foreign net operating losses and foreign capital losses, offset
    by increases related to state net operating losses and credits.

We have not provided U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative
    earnings of

non-U.S. affiliates

and associated companies that the company considers to be
    reinvested indefinitely. Deferred taxes are provided for
    earnings of non-U.S. affiliates and associated companies
    when we determine that such earnings are no longer indefinitely
    reinvested.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we completed the sale
    of approximately 17,600 acres of farmland to an unrelated
    buyer and immediately entered into an agreement with an
    affiliate of the buyer to lease back the farmland. We received
    proceeds of $75.0 million in cash, removed the land from
    our balance sheet, and recorded a deferred gain of
    $29.7 million (reflected primarily in noncurrent
    liabilities). The lease agreement has an initial term of ten
    years and two five-year renewal options. This lease will be
    accounted for as an operating lease. We will recognize the
    deferred gain as a reduction of rent expense over the lease term.

CONTINGENCIES

In fiscal 1991, we acquired Beatrice Company
    (“Beatrice”). As a result of the acquisition and the
    significant pre-acquisition contingencies of the Beatrice
    businesses and its former subsidiaries, our consolidated

post-acquisition

financial statements reflect liabilities associated with the
    estimated resolution of these contingencies. These include
    various litigation and environmental proceedings related to
    businesses divested by Beatrice prior to its acquisition by us.
    The litigation includes suits against a number of lead paint and
    pigment manufacturers, including ConAgra Grocery Products and
    the Company as alleged successors to W. P. Fuller Co., a lead
    paint and pigment manufacturer owned and operated by Beatrice
    until 1967. Although decisions favorable to us have been
    rendered in Rhode Island, New Jersey, Wisconsin, and Ohio, we
    remain a defendant in active suits in Illinois and California.
    The Illinois suit seeks

class-wide

relief in the form of medical monitoring for elevated levels of
    lead in blood. In California, a number of cities and counties
    have joined in a consolidated action seeking abatement of the
    alleged public nuisance.

The environmental proceedings include litigation and
    administrative proceedings involving Beatrice’s status as a
    potentially responsible party at 36 Superfund, proposed
    Superfund, or state-equivalent sites; these sites involve
    locations previously owned or operated by predecessors of
    Beatrice that used or produced petroleum, pesticides,
    fertilizers, dyes, inks, solvents, PCBs, acids, lead, sulfur,
    tannery wastes,

and/or

other
    contaminants. Beatrice has paid or is in the process of paying
    its liability share at 33 of these sites. Reserves for these
    matters have been established based on our best estimate of the
    undiscounted remediation liabilities, which estimates include
    evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required

clean-up,

the known volumetric contribution of Beatrice and other
    potentially responsible parties, and its experience in
    remediating sites. The reserves for Beatrice-related
    environmental matters totaled $69.6 million as of
    May 30, 2010, a majority of which relates to the Superfund
    and state-equivalent sites referenced above. The reserve for
    Beatrice-related environmental matters reflects a reduction in
    pre-tax expense of $15.4 million made in the third quarter
    of fiscal 2010 due to favorable regulatory developments at one
    of the sites. We expect expenditures for Beatrice-related
    environmental matters to continue for up to 20 years.

In limited situations, we will guarantee an obligation of an
    unconsolidated entity. At the time in which we initially provide
    such a guarantee, we assess the risk of financial exposure to us
    under these agreements. We consider the credit-worthiness of the
    guaranteed party, the value of any collateral pledged against
    the related

obligation, and any other factors that may mitigate our risk
    (e.g., letters of credit from a financial institution). We
    actively monitor market and entity-specific conditions that may
    result in a change of our assessment of the risk of loss under
    these agreements.

We guarantee certain leases and other commercial obligations
    resulting from the 2002 divestiture of our fresh beef and pork
    operations. The remaining terms of these arrangements do not
    exceed six years and the maximum amount of future payments we
    have guaranteed was $16.0 million as of May 30, 2010.

We have also guaranteed the performance of the divested fresh
    beef and pork business with respect to a hog purchase contract.
    The hog purchase contract requires the divested business to
    purchase a minimum of approximately 1.2 million hogs
    annually through 2014. The contract stipulates minimum price
    commitments, based in part on market prices, and, in certain
    circumstances, also includes price adjustments based on certain
    inputs. We have not established a liability for any of the fresh
    beef and pork divestiture-related guarantees, as we have
    determined that the likelihood of our required performance under
    the guarantees is remote.

We are a party to various potato supply agreements. Under the
    terms of certain such potato supply agreements, we have
    guaranteed repayment of short-term bank loans of the potato
    suppliers, under certain conditions. At May 30, 2010, the
    amount of supplier loans we have effectively guaranteed was
    $29.0 million. We have not established a liability for
    these guarantees, as we have determined that the likelihood of
    our required performance under the guarantees is remote.

We are a party to a supply agreement with an onion processing
    company. We have guaranteed repayment of a loan of this
    supplier, under certain conditions. At May 30, 2010, the
    term of the loan is 14 years. The amount of our guaranty
    was $25 million as of May 30, 2010. In the event of
    default on this loan by the supplier, we have the contractual
    right to purchase the loan from the lender, thereby giving us
    the rights to the underlying collateral. We have not established
    a liability in connection with this guaranty, as we believe the
    likelihood of financial exposure to us under this agreement is
    remote.

Federal income tax credits were generated related to our sweet
    potato production facility currently under construction in
    Delhi, Louisiana. Third parties invested in certain of these
    income tax credits. We have guaranteed these third parties the
    face value of these income tax credits over their statutory
    lives, a period of seven years, in the event that the income tax
    credits are recaptured or reduced. The face value of the income
    tax credits was $21 million as of May 30, 2010. We
    believe the likelihood of the recapture or reduction of the
    income tax credits is remote, and therefore we have not
    established a liability in connection with this guarantee.

We are a party to a number of lawsuits and claims arising out of
    the operation of our business, including lawsuits and claims
    related to the February 2007 recall of our peanut butter
    products and litigation we initiated against an insurance
    carrier to recover our settlement expenditures and defense
    costs. We recognized a charge of $24.8 million during the
    third quarter of fiscal 2009 in connection with the disputed
    coverage with this insurance carrier. During the second quarter
    of fiscal 2010, a Delaware state court rendered a decision on
    certain matters in our claim for the disputed coverage favorable
    to the insurance carrier. We intend to appeal this decision and
    continue to pursue this matter vigorously.

In June 2009, an accidental explosion occurred at our
    manufacturing facility in Garner, North Carolina. See
    Note 5 for information related to this matter.

An investigation by the Division of Enforcement of the
    U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
    (“CFTC”) of certain commodity futures transactions of
    a former Company subsidiary has led to an investigation of us by
    the CFTC. The investigation may result in litigation by the CFTC
    against us. The former subsidiary was sold on June 23,
    2008, as part of the divestiture of our trading and
    merchandising operations. The CFTC’s Division of
    Enforcement has advised us that it questions whether certain
    trading activities of the former subsidiary violated the
    Commodity Exchange Act and that the CFTC has been evaluating
    whether we should be implicated in the matter

based on the existence of the parent-subsidiary relationship
    between the two entities at the time of the trades. Based on
    information we have learned to date, we believe that both we and
    the former subsidiary have meritorious defenses. There have been
    discussions with the CFTC concerning resolution of this matter.
    We also believe the sale contract with the purchaser of the
    business provides us indemnification rights. Accordingly, we do
    not believe any decision by the CFTC to pursue this matter will
    have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or
    results of operations. If litigation ensues, we intend to defend
    this matter vigorously.

We are a party to several lawsuits concerning the use of
    diacetyl, a butter flavoring ingredient that was added to our
    microwave popcorn until late 2007. The cases are primarily
    consumer personal injury suits claiming respiratory illness
    allegedly due to exposures to vapors from microwaving popcorn.
    Another was brought by an ex-employee alleging that we
    fraudulently concealed the risks of diacetyl and therefore his
    recovery should not be limited to the otherwise exclusive remedy
    of workers compensation benefits. The final case is a putative
    class action contending that our packaging information with
    respect to diacetyl is false and misleading. We do not believe
    these cases possess merit and are vigorously defending them.

After taking into account liabilities recognized for all of the
    foregoing matters, management believes the ultimate resolution
    of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. It is
    reasonably possible that a change in one of the estimates of the
    foregoing matters may occur in the future. Costs of legal
    services are recognized in earnings as services are provided.

19.

DERIVATIVE
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Our operations are exposed to market risks from adverse changes
    in commodity prices affecting the cost of raw materials and
    energy, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. In
    the normal course of business, these risks are managed through a
    variety of strategies, including the use of derivatives.

Commodity futures and options contracts are used from time to
    time to economically hedge commodity input prices on items such
    as natural gas, vegetable oils, proteins, dairy, grains, and
    electricity. Generally, we economically hedge a portion of our
    anticipated consumption of commodity inputs for periods of up to
    36 months. We may enter into longer-term economic hedges on
    particular commodities, if deemed appropriate. As of
    May 30, 2010, we had economically hedged certain portions
    of our anticipated consumption of commodity inputs using
    derivative instruments with expiration dates through December
    2011.

In order to reduce exposures related to changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates, when deemed prudent, we enter into
    forward exchange, options, or swap contracts for transactions
    denominated in a currency other than the applicable functional
    currency. This includes, but is not limited to, hedging against
    foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital
    equipment, sales of finished goods, and future settlement of
    foreign-denominated assets and liabilities. As of May 30,
    2010, we had economically hedged certain portions of our foreign
    currency risk in anticipated transactions using derivative
    instruments with expiration dates through May 2017.

From time to time, we may use derivative instruments, including
    interest rate swaps, to reduce risk related to changes in
    interest rates. This includes, but is not limited to, hedging
    against increasing interest rates prior to the issuance of
    long-term debt and hedging the fair value of our senior
    long-term debt.

Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges

In fiscal 2009, we entered into an interest rate swap to hedge
    the interest rate risk related to our then-anticipated long-term
    debt refinancing. We designated this interest rate swap as a
    cash flow hedge of the forecasted interest payments related to
    this debt refinancing. There were no material amounts deferred
    in accumulated other comprehensive income related to designated
    cash flow hedges at May 30, 2010 or May 31, 2009.
    There were no other interest rate derivatives designated as cash
    flow hedges in any of the periods presented.


NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Fiscal
    years ended May 30, 2010, May 31, 2009, and
    May 25, 2008

Columnar
    Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts

In prior periods, we designated certain commodity-based and
    foreign currency derivatives as cash flow hedges qualifying for
    hedge accounting treatment. We discontinued designating such
    derivatives as cash flow hedges during the first quarter of
    fiscal 2008.

Gains and losses associated with designated commodity cash flow
    hedges were deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income
    until the underlying hedged item impacted earnings. At that
    time, we reclassified net gains and losses from cash flow hedges
    into the same line item of the consolidated statement of
    earnings as where the effects of the hedged item were recorded,
    typically cost of goods sold.

Hedge ineffectiveness for cash flow hedges may impact net
    earnings when a change in the value of a hedge does not offset
    the change in the value of the underlying hedged item. Depending
    on the nature of the hedge, ineffectiveness is recognized within
    cost of goods sold or selling, general and administrative
    expense. We do not exclude any component of the hedging
    instrument’s gain or loss when assessing ineffectiveness.
    The ineffectiveness associated with derivatives designated as
    cash flow hedges from continuing operations was not material to
    our results of operations in any period presented.

Derivatives Designated as Fair Value Hedges

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we entered into
    interest rate swap contracts to hedge the fair value of certain
    of our senior long-term debt instruments maturing in fiscal 2012
    and 2015. We designated these interest rate swap contracts as
    fair value hedges of the debt instruments. The notional amount
    of the interest rate derivatives outstanding at May 30,
    2010 was $842.7 million.

Changes in fair value of the derivative instrument are
    immediately recognized in earnings along with changes in the
    fair value of the item being hedged (based solely on the change
    in the benchmark interest rate). These gains and losses are
    classified within selling, general, and administrative expenses.
    In fiscal 2010, we recognized a net gain of $8.5 million on
    the interest rate swap contracts and a loss of $5.1 million
    on the senior long-term debt.

The entire change in fair value of the derivative instruments
    was included in our assessment of hedge effectiveness.

Economic Hedges of Forecasted Cash Flows

Many of our derivatives do not qualify for, and we do not
    currently designate certain commodity or foreign currency
    derivatives to achieve, hedge accounting treatment. We reflect
    realized and unrealized gains and losses from derivatives used
    to economically hedge anticipated commodity consumption and to
    mitigate foreign currency cash flow risk in earnings immediately
    within general corporate expense (within cost of goods sold).
    The gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating
    results in the period in which the underlying item being
    economically hedged is recognized in cost of goods sold.

Derivative Activity in Our Milling Operations

We also use derivative instruments within our milling
    operations, which are part of the Commercial Foods segment.
    Derivative instruments used to economically hedge commodity
    inventories and forward purchase and sales contracts within the
    Milling operations are

marked-to-market

such that realized and unrealized gains and losses are
    immediately included in operating results. The underlying
    inventory and forward contracts being hedged are also

marked-to-market

with changes in market value recognized immediately in operating
    results.

For commodity derivative trading activities within our milling
    operations that are not intended to mitigate commodity input
    cost risk, the derivative instrument is

marked-to-market

each period with gains and losses included in net sales of the
    Commercial Foods segment. There were no material gains or losses
    from derivative trading activities in fiscal 2010 or 2009. In
    fiscal 2008, net derivative gains from trading activities of
    $23.3 million were included in the results of operations of
    the Commercial Foods segment.

All derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet
    at fair value. The fair value of derivative assets is recognized
    within prepaid expenses and other current assets, while the fair
    value of derivative liabilities is recognized within other
    accrued liabilities. In accordance with FASB guidance, we offset
    certain derivative asset and liability balances, as well as
    certain amounts representing rights to reclaim cash collateral
    and obligations to return cash collateral, where legal right of

We enter into certain commodity, interest rate, and foreign
    exchange derivatives with a diversified group of counterparties.
    We continually monitor our positions and the credit ratings of
    the counterparties involved and limit the amount of credit
    exposure to any one party. These transactions may expose us to
    potential losses due to the risk of nonperformance by these
    counterparties. We have not incurred a material loss and do not
    expect to incur any such material losses. We also enter into
    futures and options transactions through various regulated
    exchanges.

At May 30, 2010, the maximum amount of loss due to the
    credit risk of the counterparties, had the counterparties failed
    to perform according to the terms of the contracts, was
    $56.1 million.

PENSION
    AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company and its subsidiaries have defined benefit retirement
    plans (“plans”) for eligible salaried and hourly
    employees. Benefits are based on years of credited service and
    average compensation or stated amounts for each year of service.
    We also sponsor postretirement plans which provide certain
    medical and dental benefits (“other benefits”) to
    qualifying U.S. employees.

We historically have used February 28 as our measurement date
    for our plans. Beginning May 28, 2007, we elected to early
    adopt accounting guidance addressing measurement dates of
    benefit plans. These provisions required the measurement date
    for plan assets and liabilities to coincide with the
    sponsor’s fiscal year-end. We used the
    “alternative” method for adoption. As a result, in
    fiscal 2008, we recorded a decrease to retained earnings of
    approximately $11.7 million, net of tax, and an increase to
    accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately
    $1.6 million, net of tax, representing the periodic benefit
    cost for the period from March 1, 2007 through our fiscal
    2007 year-end.

We recognize the funded status of our plans in the consolidated
    balance sheets. We also recognize as a component of accumulated
    other comprehensive loss, the net of tax results of the gains or
    losses and prior service

Level 1 assets are valued based on quoted prices in active
    markets for identical securities. The majority of the
    Level 1 assets listed above include the common stock of
    both U.S. and international companies, master limited
    partnership units, and real estate investment trusts, all of
    which are actively traded and priced in the market. Level 2
    assets are valued based on other significant observable inputs
    including quoted prices for similar securities, yield curves,
    indices, etc. The Level 2 assets listed above consist
    primarily of commingled equity investments where values are
    based on the net asset value of the underlying investments held,
    individual fixed income securities where values are based on
    quoted prices of similar securities and observable market data,
    and commingled fixed income investments where values are based
    on the net asset value of the underlying investments held.
    Level 3 assets are those where the fair value is determined
    based on unobservable inputs. The Level 3 assets listed
    above consist of alternative investments where active market
    pricing is not readily available. For Real Estate, the value is
    based on the net asset value provided by the investment manager
    who uses market data and independent third party appraisals to
    determine fair market value. For the Multi-Strategy Hedge Funds,
    the value is based on the net asset values provided by a third
    party administrator. For Private Equity, the investment manager
    provides the valuation using, among other things, comparable
    transactions, comparable public company data, discounted cash
    flow analysis, and market conditions. The valuations on the
    contracts with insurance companies are provided by third party
    administrators who use the terms of the contract along with
    available market data to determine the fair market value.

Level 3 investments are generally considered long-term in
    nature with varying redemption availability. Certain of our
    Level 3 investments have imposed redemption gates which may
    further restrict or limit the redemption of invested funds
    therein.

As of May 30, 2010, we have unfunded commitments for
    additional investments in the Private Equity funds totaling
    approximately $51 million. We expect the funds for these
    unfunded commitments will come from plan assets rather than the
    general assets of the Company.

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
    assumption for the pension plans, we consider the current asset
    allocation strategy, the historical investment performance, and
    the expectations for future returns of each asset class.

Our pension plan weighted-average asset allocations and our
    target asset allocations at May 30, 2010 and May 31,
    2009, by asset category were as follows:

The Company’s investment strategy reflects the expectation
    that equity securities will outperform debt securities over the
    long term. Assets are invested in a prudent manner to maintain
    the security of funds while maximizing returns within the
    Company’s Investment Policy guidelines. The strategy is
    implemented utilizing indexed and actively managed assets from
    the categories listed.

The investment goals are to provide a total return that, over
    the long term, increases the ratio of plan assets to liabilities
    subject to an acceptable level of risk. This is accomplished
    through diversification of assets in accordance with the
    Investment Policy guidelines. Investment risk is mitigated by
    periodic rebalancing between asset classes as necessitated by
    changes in market conditions within the Investment Policy
    guidelines.

Other investment is primarily made up of cash, hedge funds,
    private equity, master limited partnerships, and contracts with
    insurance companies.

FAIR
    VALUE MEASUREMENTS

FASB guidance on fair value measurements, which defines fair
    value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
    expands disclosures about fair value measurements, was effective
    as of the beginning of our fiscal 2009 for our financial assets
    and liabilities, as well as for other assets and liabilities
    that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in our
    consolidated financial statements. As of the beginning of fiscal
    2010, we adopted additional new guidance relating to
    nonrecurring fair value measurement requirements for
    nonfinancial assets and liabilities. These include long-lived
    assets, goodwill, asset retirement obligations, and certain
    investments. These items are recognized at fair value when they
    are considered to be other than temporarily impaired.

FASB guidance establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy
    based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price assets or
    liabilities. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair
    value are as follows:

Level 1—Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities,

Columnar
    Amounts in Millions Except Per Share Amounts

Level 2—Observable inputs other than those included in
    Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and
    liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical
    assets or liabilities in inactive markets, and

Level 3—Unobservable inputs reflecting our own
    assumptions and best estimate of what inputs market participants
    would use in pricing the asset or liability.

The following table presents our financial assets and
    liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis based
    upon the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair
    value measurements fall, as of May 30, 2010:

During fiscal 2010, a partially completed production facility

$33.3 million, which is included in selling, general and
    administrative expenses in the Consumer Foods segment (see
    Note 6). The fair value measurement used to determine this
    impairment was based on the market approach and reflected
    anticipated sales proceeds for these assets.

During fiscal 2010, we decided to close our meat snack
    production facility in Garner, North Carolina (see Note 6).
    We recognized an impairment charge of $16.5 million to
    write-down the associated property, plant and equipment with a
    carrying amount of $45.5 million to its fair value of
    $29.0 million. The fair value measurement used to determine
    this impairment was based on the income approach, which utilized
    cash flow projections consistent with the most recent

business plan, a terminal value, and a discount rate equivalent
    to a market participant’s weighted-average cost of capital.

During fiscal 2010, noncurrent assets held for sale from our

business with a carrying amount of $88.7 million were
    written-down to their fair value of $30.4 million,
    resulting in an impairment charge of $58.3 million
    ($39.3 million after-tax), which is included in results of
    discontinued operations (see Note 2). The fair value
    measurement used to determine this impairment was based on the
    market approach and reflected anticipated sales proceeds for
    these assets.

The carrying amount of long-term debt (including current
    installments) was $3.5 billion as of both May 30, 2010
    and May 31, 2009. Based on current market rates provided
    primarily by outside investment bankers, the fair value of this
    debt at May 30, 2010 and May 31, 2009 was estimated at
    $4.1 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively.

BUSINESS
    SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION

We report our operations in two reporting segments: Consumer
    Foods and Commercial Foods. The Consumer Foods reporting segment
    includes branded, private label, and customized food products,
    which are sold in various retail and foodservice channels,
    principally in North America. The products include a variety of
    categories (meals, entrees, condiments, sides, snacks, and
    desserts) across frozen, refrigerated, and shelf-stable
    temperature classes. The Commercial Foods reporting segment
    includes commercially branded foods and ingredients, which are
    sold principally to foodservice, food manufacturing, and
    industrial customers. The Commercial Foods segment’s
    primary products include: specialty potato products, milled
    grain ingredients, a variety of vegetable products, seasonings,
    blends, and flavors which are sold under brands such as

Lamb
    Weston

®

,

ConAgra
    Mills

®

,

    and

Spicetec

®

.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we completed the
    transition of the direct management of the Consumer Foods
    reporting segment from the Chief Executive Officer to the
    Consumer Foods President position. In conjunction with this
    organizational change, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal
    2010, we aligned our segment reporting to be consistent with the
    manner in which our operating results are presented to, and
    reviewed by, our Chief Executive Officer. All prior periods have
    been recast to reflect these changes.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we transferred the
    management of the
    Alexia

®

frozen food operations from the Consumer Foods segment to the
    Commercial Foods segment. Segment results have been recast to
    reflect this change.

In July 2010, subsequent to the end of our fiscal 2010, we
    completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of

Gilroy Foods &
    Flavors

tm

and fresh vegetable operations for $250 million in cash,
    subject to final working capital adjustments. Based on our
    estimate of proceeds from the sale of this business, we
    recognized impairment and related charges totaling
    $59 million ($40 million after-tax) in the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2010. We reflected the results of these
    operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Intersegment sales have been recorded at amounts approximating
    market. Operating profit for each segment is based on net sales
    less all identifiable operating expenses. General corporate
    expense, net interest expense, and income taxes have been
    excluded from segment operations.

Presentation of Derivative Gains (Losses) for Economic Hedges
    of Forecasted Cash Flows in Segment Results

In fiscal 2009, following the sale of our trading and
    merchandising operations and related organizational changes, we
    transferred the management of commodity hedging activities
    (except for those related to our milling operations) to a
    centralized procurement group. Beginning in the first quarter of
    fiscal 2009, we began to reflect realized and unrealized gains
    and losses from derivatives (except for those related to our
    milling operations) used to hedge anticipated commodity
    consumption in earnings immediately within general corporate
    expenses. The gains and losses are reclassified to segment
    operating results in the period in which the underlying item
    being

economically hedged is recognized in cost of goods sold. We
    believe this change results in better segment management focus
    on key operational initiatives and improved transparency to
    derivative gains and losses.

Foreign currency derivatives used to manage foreign currency
    risk of forecasted cash flows are not designated for hedge
    accounting treatment. We believe these derivatives provide
    economic hedges of the foreign currency risk of certain
    forecasted transactions. As such, these derivatives are
    recognized at fair market value with realized and unrealized
    gains and losses recognized in general corporate expenses. The
    gains and losses are subsequently recognized in the operating
    results of the reporting segments in the period in which the
    underlying transaction being economically hedged is included in
    earnings.

The following table presents the net derivative gains (losses)
    from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the
    foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions, under
    this methodology (in millions):

Based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the
    underlying hedged items, we expect to reclassify losses of
    $4.6 million and gains of $1.6 million to segment
    operating results in fiscal 2011 and 2012 and thereafter,
    respectively. Amounts allocated, or to be allocated, to segment
    operating results during fiscal 2010 and 2011 include
    $5.3 million of losses incurred during fiscal 2009.

During fiscal 2008, derivative instruments used to create
    economic hedges of such commodity inputs were

marked-to-market

each period with both realized and unrealized changes in market
    value immediately included in cost of goods sold within segment
    operating profit. In fiscal 2008, net derivative gains from
    economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and foreign
    currency risk of certain forecasted transactions were
    $62.6 million in the Consumer Foods segment and
    $22.5 million in the Commercial Foods segment.

At May 30, 2010, ConAgra Foods and its subsidiaries had
    approximately 24,400 employees, primarily in the United
    States. Approximately 53% of our employees are parties to
    collective bargaining agreements. Of the employees subject to
    collective bargaining agreements, approximately 25% are parties
    to collective bargaining agreements that are scheduled to expire
    during fiscal 2011.

Our operations are principally in the United States. With
    respect to operations outside of the United States, no single
    foreign country or geographic region was significant with
    respect to consolidated operations for fiscal 2010, 2009, and
    2008. Foreign net sales, including sales by domestic segments to
    customers located outside of the United States, were
    approximately $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion, and
    $1.2 billion in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
    Our long-lived assets located outside of the United States are
    not significant.

Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates,
    accounted for approximately 18%, 17%, and 15% of consolidated
    net sales for fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

ConAgra Foods, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    ConAgra Foods, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
    May 30, 2010 and May 31, 2009, and the related
    consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income,
    common stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the
    years in the three-year period ended May 30, 2010. These
    consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of ConAgra Foods, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
    May 30, 2010 and May 31, 2009, and the results of
    their operations and cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended May 30, 2010, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB
    Statement No. 109

(included in FASB ASC Topic 740,

Income Taxes

), as of May 28, 2007. As discussed in
    note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, the
    Company adopted the measurement date provisions of Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106,
    and 132(R)

(included in FASB ASC Topic 715,

Compensation—Retirement Benefits

), as of
    May 28, 2007.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    May 30, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO), and our report dated July 22, 2010 expressed an
    unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

The Company’s management carried out an evaluation, with
    the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer
    and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design
    and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of
    May 30, 2010. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as
    of the end of the period covered by this report, the
    Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management, with the participation of the
    Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, evaluated any change in the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting that occurred during the
    quarter covered by this report and determined that there was no
    change in our internal controls over financial reporting during
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 that has materially affected,
    or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
    control over financial reporting.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

The management of ConAgra Foods is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. ConAgra
    Foods’ internal control over financial reporting is
    designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. ConAgra
    Foods’ internal control over financial reporting includes
    those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the
    maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
    and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
    assets of ConAgra Foods; (ii) provide reasonable assurance
    that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that
    receipts and expenditures of ConAgra Foods are being made only
    in accordance with the authorization of management and directors
    of ConAgra Foods; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
    regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
    acquisition, use or disposition of ConAgra Foods’ assets
    that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
    Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluations of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of the changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

With the participation of ConAgra Foods’ Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management assessed the
    effectiveness of ConAgra Foods’ internal control over
    financial reporting as of May 30, 2010. In making this
    assessment, management used criteria established in

Internal
    Control—Integrated Framework

, issued by the Committee
    of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (“COSO”). As a result of this assessment, management
    concluded that, as of May 30, 2010, its internal control
    over financial reporting was effective.

The effectiveness of ConAgra Foods’ internal control over
    financial reporting as of May 30, 2010 has been audited by
    KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
    stated in their report, a copy of which is included in this

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

ConAgra Foods, Inc.:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    ConAgra Foods, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
    May 30, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, ConAgra Foods, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained,
    in all material respects, effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of May 30, 2010, based on the
    criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of May 30,
    2010 and May 31, 2009, and the related consolidated
    statements of earnings, comprehensive income, common
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years
    in the three-year period ended May 30, 2010, and our report
    dated July 22, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    those consolidated financial statements and includes an
    explanatory paragraph regarding the Company’s adoption as
    of May 28, 2007 of Financial Accounting Standards Board

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

ConAgra Foods, Inc.:

Under date of July 22, 2010, we reported on the
    consolidated balance sheets of ConAgra Foods, Inc. and
    subsidiaries (the Company) as of May 30, 2010 and
    May 31, 2009, and the related consolidated statements of
    earnings, comprehensive income, common stockholders’
    equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
    period ended May 30, 2010, which are included in the Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

of ConAgra Foods, Inc. for the fiscal year ended May 30,
    2010. In connection with our audits of the aforementioned
    consolidated financial statements, we also audited the related
    consolidated financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
    Item 15. This consolidated financial statement schedule is
    the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on this consolidated
    financial statement schedule based on our audits.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statement schedule,
    when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB
    Statement No. 109

(included in FASB ASC Topic 740,

Income Taxes

), as of May 28, 2007. As discussed in
    note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, the
    Company adopted the measurement date provisions of Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106,
    and 132(R)

(included in FASB ASC Topic 715,
