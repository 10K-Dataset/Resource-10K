ITEM 1.     BUSINESS 
 
a)   General Development of Business 
 
     Nebraska Consolidated Mills Company, which was originally incorporated in 
     Nebraska on September 29, 1919, changed its name to ConAgra, Inc. 
     ("ConAgra" or the "Company") on February 25, 1971, and since December 5, 
     1975, has been incorporated in Delaware. 
 
b)   Financial Information About Industry Segments 
 
     The Company's businesses are classified into three industry segments:  
     Food Inputs & Ingredients, Refrigerated Foods and Grocery/Diversified 
     Products.  The contributions of each industry segment to net sales and 
     operating profit, and the identifiable assets attributable to each 
     industry segment set forth in Note 15 "Business Segments" on pages  
     49 and 50 of the Company's 1996 Annual Report to Stockholders are 
     incorporated herein by reference. 
 
c)   Narrative Description of Business 
 
     The information set forth in the "Business Review" on pages 7 through 26 
     of the Company's 1996 Annual Report to Stockholders is incorporated 
     herein by reference. 
 
     The following comments pertain to the Company as a whole. 
 
     ConAgra operates "across the food chain," from basic agricultural inputs 
     to production and sale of branded consumer products.  As a result, 
     ConAgra uses many different raw materials, the bulk of which are 
     commodities.  Raw materials are generally available from several 
     different sources and ConAgra presently believes that it can obtain these  
     as needed. 
 
     Each business is highly competitive.  Many companies compete in one or 
     more of the markets served by ConAgra, some of which have greater sales 
     and assets than ConAgra. 
 
     Quality control processes at principal manufacturing places emphasize 
     applied research and technical services directed at product improvement 
     and quality control.  In addition, the Refrigerated Foods and the 
     Grocery/Diversified Products segments conduct research activities related 
     to the development of new products. 
 
     Many of ConAgra's facilities and products are subject to various laws and 
     regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, 
     the Federal Food and Drug Administration, and other federal, state, local 
     and foreign governmental agencies relating to the quality of products, 
     sanitation, safety and environmental control.  The Company believes that 
     it complies with such laws and regulations in all material respects, and 
     that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material  
     effect upon capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of 
     the Company. 
 
     ConAgra and its subsidiaries have more than 80,000 employees, primarily 
     in the United States. 
 
d)   Foreign Operations 
 
     The information set forth in the "Business Review" on pages 7 through 26 
     of the Company's 1996 Annual Report to Stockholders is incorporated 
     herein by reference.  The Company is not engaged in material operations 
     in foreign countries, nor are material portions of sales or revenues 
     derived from customers in foreign countries. 
 
ITEM 2.     PROPERTIES 
 
     The Company's corporate headquarters are located in Omaha, Nebraska.  The  
     headquarters and principal operating locations of each business are set 
     forth on the following list of "ConAgra Locations." 
 
     The Company maintains a number of distribution facilities, in addition to  
     distribution facilities and warehouse space available at substantially 
     all of its manufacturing facilities. 
 
     Utilization of manufacturing capacity varies by type of product 
     manufactured, plant and week.  In general, ConAgra operates most of its 
     manufacturing facilities in excess of 80% of standard industry capacity.  
     Standards vary by industry from 40 hours per week to 144 hours per week. 
 
     Most principal manufacturing facilities are held in fee.  However, 
     certain parcels of land, machinery and buildings, and substantially all 
     of ConAgra's transportation equipment used in its processing and 
     merchandising operations, including covered rail hopper cars and  
     river barges, are leased.

ITEM 3.     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
     In fiscal 1991, ConAgra acquired Beatrice Company ("Beatrice").  As a 
     result of the acquisition and the significant pre-acquisition tax and 
     other contingencies of the Beatrice businesses and its former 
     subsidiaries, the consolidated post-acquisition financial statements of 
     ConAgra reflected significant liabilities and valuation allowances 
     associated with the estimated resolution of these contingencies. 
 
     As a result of a settlement reached with the Internal Revenue Service in 
     fiscal 1995, ConAgra released $230.0 million of a valuation allowance and 
     reduced noncurrent liabilities by $135.0 million, with a resulting 
     reduction of goodwill associated with the Beatrice acquisition of $365.0 
     million.  Federal income tax returns of Beatrice for its fiscal 1990 and 
     various state tax returns remain open.  However, after taking into 
     account the foregoing adjustments, management believes that the ultimate 
     resolution of all remaining pre-acquisition Beatrice tax contingencies 
     should not exceed the reserves established for such matters. 
 
     Beatrice is also engaged in various litigation and environmental 
     proceedings related to businesses divested by Beatrice prior to its 
     acquisition by ConAgra.  The environmental proceedings include litigation 
     and administrative proceedings involving Beatrice's status as a 
     potentially responsible party at 43 Superfund, proposed Superfund or 
     state-equivalent sites.  Beatrice has paid or is in the process of paying 
     its liability share at 40 of these sites.  Beatrice has established 
     substantial reserves for these matters.  The environmental reserves are 
     based on Beatrice's best estimate of its undiscounted remediation 
     liabilities, which estimates include evaluation of investigatory studies, 
     extent of required cleanup, the known volumetric contribution of Beatrice 
     and other potentially responsible parties and Beatrice's prior experience 
     in remediating sites.  Management believes the ultimate resolution of 
     such Beatrice legal and environmental contingencies should not exceed the 
     reserves established for such matters. 
 
     In March 1996, the Environmental Protection Agency filed an action in 
     federal district court in Idaho against the Company as owner and operator 
     of a beef packing plant in Nampa, Idaho seeking civil monetary penalties 
     for alleged violations of the Clean Water Act.  The Company is defending 
     the action. 
 
     ConAgra is party to a number of other lawsuits and claims arising out of 
     the operation of its businesses.  After taking into account liabilities 
     recorded for all of the foregoing matters, management believes the 
     ultimate resolution of such matters should not have a material adverse 
     effect on ConAgra's financial condition, results of operation or 
     liquidity.
