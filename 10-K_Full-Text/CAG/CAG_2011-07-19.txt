PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

a)

General
    Development of Business

ConAgra Foods, Inc. (“ConAgra Foods”,
    “Company”, “we”, “us”, or
    “our”) is one of North America’s leading food
    companies, with consumer brands in 97% of America’s
    households sold in grocery, convenience, mass merchandise and
    club stores. ConAgra Foods also has a strong

business-to-business

presence, supplying frozen potato and sweet potato products, as
    well as other vegetable, spice, and grain products to a variety
    of well-known restaurants, foodservice operators, and commercial
    customers.

The Company began as a flour-milling company and entered other
    commodity-based businesses. Over time, through various
    acquisitions and divestitures, we significantly changed our
    portfolio of businesses, focusing on adding branded, value-added
    opportunities, while strategically divesting commodity-based
    businesses to become one of North America’s leading food
    companies. Executing this strategy involved the acquisition over
    time of a number of brands such as

Banquet

,

Chef
    Boyardee

®

,

PAM

®

,

Marie
    Callenders

®

,

    and

Alexia

®

.

    More notable divestitures have included a dehydrated garlic,
    onion, capsicum and fresh vegetable operation, a trading and
    merchandising business, packaged meat and cheese operations, a
    poultry business, beef and pork businesses, and various other
    businesses. For more information about our more recent
    acquisitions and divestitures, see “Acquisitions” and
    “Divestitures” below. Our development over time has
    also been aided by innovation and organic growth. Recent
    successes include:

We are focused on growing our core operations, expanding into
    adjacent categories, and increasing our presence in private
    label and international operations. Our core operations include
    the strategic product groups of convenient meals, potatoes,
    snacks, meal enhancers, and specialty items. We are also focused
    on sustainable sales and profit growth with strong and improving
    returns on invested capital. As part of continually
    strengthening our operating foundation, our major
    profit-enhancing initiatives have centered on and continue to
    include:

•

Enhancing our portfolio by developing through innovation and
    acquiring of products that resonate with consumers;

•

Implementing high-impact, insights-based marketing programs;

•

Partnering strategically with customers to improve linkage,
    strengthen relationships, and capitalize on growth opportunities;

•

Improving trade spending effectiveness and pricing analytics;

•

Achieving cost savings throughout the supply chain with
    continuous efficiency improvement programs; and

•

Implementing efficiency initiatives throughout the selling,
    general, and administrative functions.

The Company’s growth, efficiency, and portfolio improvement
    initiatives continue to be implemented with high standards of
    customer service, product safety, and product quality.

We were initially incorporated as a Nebraska corporation in 1919
    and were reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in December
    1975.

Pemmican

®

business have not been reclassified as discontinued operations.

During fiscal 2009, we completed the sale of our trading and
    merchandising operations (previously principally reported as the
    Trading and Merchandising segment). We reflected the results of
    these operations as discontinued operations for all periods
    presented.

General

The following comments pertain to both of our reporting segments.

ConAgra Foods is a food company that operates in many sectors of
    the food industry, with a significant focus on the sale of
    branded and value-added consumer products, as well as
    foodservice products and ingredients. We also manufacture and
    sell private label products. We use many different raw
    materials, the bulk of which are commodities. The prices paid
    for raw materials used in our products generally reflect factors
    such as weather, commodity market fluctuations, currency
    fluctuations, tariffs, and the effects of governmental
    agricultural programs. Although the prices of raw materials can
    be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors, we
    believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and
    generally available from numerous sources. We have faced
    increased costs for many of our significant raw materials,
    packaging, and energy inputs in the last twelve months. We seek
    to mitigate the higher input costs through productivity and
    pricing initiatives, and through the use of derivative
    instruments used to economically hedge a portion of forecasted
    future consumption.

We experience intense competition for sales of our principal
    products in our major markets. Our products compete with widely
    advertised, well-known, branded products, as well as private
    label and customized products. Some of our competitors are
    larger and have greater resources than we have. We compete
    primarily on the basis of quality, value, customer service,
    brand recognition, and brand loyalty.

Demand for certain of our products may be influenced by
    holidays, changes in seasons, or other annual events.

We manufacture primarily for stock and fill customer orders from
    finished goods inventories. While at any given time there may be
    some backlog of orders, such backlog is not material in respect
    to annual net sales, and the changes of backlog orders from time
    to time are not significant.

Our trademarks are of material importance to our business and
    are protected by registration or other means in the United
    States and most other markets where the related products are
    sold. Some of our products are sold under brands that have been
    licensed from others. We also actively develop and maintain a
    portfolio of patents, although no single patent is considered
    material to the business as a whole. We have proprietary trade
    secrets, technology, know-how, processes, and other intellectual
    property rights that are not registered.

Many of our facilities and products are subject to various laws
    and regulations administered by the United States
    Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug
    Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health
    Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign
    governmental agencies relating to the quality and safety of
    products, sanitation, safety and health matters, and
    environmental control. We believe that we comply with such laws
    and regulations in all material respects, and that continued
    compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect
    upon capital expenditures, earnings, or our competitive position.

Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates,
    accounted for approximately 18%, 18%, and 17% of consolidated
    net sales for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.



At May 29, 2011, ConAgra Foods and its subsidiaries had
    approximately 23,200 employees, primarily in the United
    States. Approximately 48% of our employees are parties to
    collective bargaining agreements. Of the employees subject to
    collective bargaining agreements, approximately 40% are parties
    to collective bargaining agreements that are scheduled to expire
    during fiscal 2012. We believe that our relationships with
    employees and their representative organizations are good.

Research
    and Development

We employ processes at our principal manufacturing locations
    that emphasize applied research and technical services directed
    at product improvement and quality control. In addition, we
    conduct research activities related to the development of new
    products. Research and development expense was $81 million,
    $78 million, and $78 million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and
    2009, respectively.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

The following risks and uncertainties could affect our operating
    results and should be considered in evaluating us. While we
    believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk
    factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks
    and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not
    currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect
    our business, performance, or financial condition in the future.

Deterioration
    of general economic conditions could harm our business and
    results of operations.

Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected
    by changes in national or global economic conditions, including
    inflation, interest rates, availability of capital markets,
    consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs
    (including fuel surcharges), and the effects of governmental
    initiatives to manage economic conditions.

Volatility in financial markets and deterioration of national
    and global economic conditions could impact our business and
    operations in a variety of ways, including as follows:

•

consumers may shift purchases to lower-priced private label or
    other value offerings, or may forego certain purchases
    altogether during economic downturns, which may adversely affect
    the results of our Consumer Foods operations;

•

decreased demand in the restaurant business, particularly casual
    and fine dining, may adversely affect our Commercial Foods
    operations;

•

volatility in commodity and other input costs could
    substantially impact our result of operations;

•

volatility in the equity markets or interest rates could
    substantially impact our pension costs and required pension
    contributions; and

•

it may become more costly or difficult to obtain debt or equity
    financing to fund operations or investment opportunities, or to
    refinance our debt in the future, in each case on terms and
    within a time period acceptable to us.

Increases
    in commodity costs may have a negative impact on
    profits.

We use many different commodities such as wheat, corn, oats,
    soybeans, beef, pork, poultry, and energy. Commodities are
    subject to price volatility caused by commodity market
    fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuations, and
    changes in governmental agricultural programs. Commodity price
    increases will result in increases in raw material costs and
    operating costs. We may not be able to increase our product
    prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these
    increased costs; and increasing prices may result in reduced
    sales volume and profitability. We have experience in hedging
    against commodity price increases; however, these practices and
    experience reduce, but do not eliminate, the risk of negative
    profit impacts from commodity price increases.

Increased
    competition may result in reduced sales or profits.

The food industry is highly competitive, and increased
    competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or
    the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer
    pressures. Competitive pressures also may restrict our ability
    to increase prices, including in response to commodity and other
    cost increases. In most product categories, we compete not only
    with other widely advertised branded products, but also with
    private label products that are generally sold at lower prices.
    A strong competitive response from one or more of our
    competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a consumer shift
    towards private label offerings, could result in us reducing
    pricing, increasing marketing or other expenditures, or losing
    market share. Our profits could decrease if a reduction in
    prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased
    sales volume.



The
    sophistication and buying power of our customers could have a
    negative impact on profits.

Many of our customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs,
    and food distributors, have consolidated in recent years and
    consolidation is expected to continue. These consolidations and
    the growth of supercenters have produced large, sophisticated
    customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength
    who are more capable of resisting price increases and operating
    with reduced inventories. These customers may also in the future
    use more of their shelf space, currently used for our products,
    for their private label products. We continue to implement
    initiatives to counteract these pressures. However, if the
    larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating
    strength

and/or

increased private label competition, our profitability could
    decline.

We must
    identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer
    food products to meet their preferences.

Consumer preferences evolve over time and the success of our
    food products depends on our ability to identify the tastes and
    dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to
    their preferences, including concerns of consumers regarding
    health and wellness, obesity, product attributes, and
    ingredients. Introduction of new products and product extensions
    requires significant development and marketing investment. If
    our products fail to meet consumer preference, or we fail to
    introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, then the
    return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our
    strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in marketing
    and innovation will be less successful. Similarly, demand for
    our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding
    the health effects of ingredients such as sodium, trans fats,
    sugar, processed wheat, or other product ingredients or
    attributes.

If we do
    not achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly
    competitive food industry, our profitability could
    decrease.

Our success depends in part on our ability to achieve the
    appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly
    competitive food industry, particularly in an environment of
    volatile input costs. We continue to implement profit-enhancing
    initiatives that impact our supply chain and general and
    administrative functions. These initiatives are focused on
    cost-saving opportunities in procurement, manufacturing,
    logistics, and customer service, as well as general and
    administrative overhead levels. If we do not continue to
    effectively manage costs and achieve additional efficiencies,
    our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease.

We may be
    subject to product liability claims and product recalls, which
    could negatively impact our profitability.

We sell food products for human consumption, which involves
    risks such as product contamination or spoilage, product
    tampering, and other adulteration of food products. We may be
    subject to liability if the consumption of any of our products
    causes injury, illness, or death. In addition, we will
    voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or
    damage. We have issued recalls and have from time to time been
    and currently are involved in lawsuits relating to our food
    products. A significant product liability judgment or a
    widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and
    profitability for a period of time depending on product
    availability, competitive reaction, and consumer attitudes. Even
    if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully
    pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that
    our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our
    reputation with existing and potential customers and our
    corporate and brand image.

We may
    not successfully complete proposed acquisitions or divestitures
    or integrate acquired businesses.

From time to time, we evaluate acquisition candidates that may
    strategically fit our business objectives. If we are unable to
    complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate and develop
    acquired businesses, our financial results could be materially
    and adversely affected. In addition, we may divest businesses
    that do not meet our strategic objectives, or do not meet our
    growth or profitability targets. We may not be able to complete
    desired or proposed divestitures on terms favorable to us. Gains
    or losses on the sales of, or lost operating income from, those
    businesses may affect our profitability. Moreover, we may incur
    asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures
    that reduce our profitability.



Our acquisition or divestiture activities may present financial,
    managerial, and operational risks. Those risks include diversion
    of management attention from existing businesses, difficulties
    integrating or separating personnel and financial and other
    systems, effective and immediate implementation of control
    environment processes across our employee population, adverse
    effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and
    customers, inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the
    accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired
    intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings,
    potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired
    businesses, and indemnities and potential disputes with the
    buyers or sellers. Any of these factors could affect our product
    sales, financial condition and results of operations.

If we
    fail to comply with the many laws applicable to our business, we
    may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and
    penalties.

Our facilities and products are subject to many laws and
    regulations administered by the United States Department of
    Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, the
    Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other
    federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies
    relating to the processing, packaging, storage, distribution,
    advertising, labeling, quality, and safety of food products, the
    health and safety of our employees, and the protection of the
    environment. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and
    regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative
    penalties and injunctive relief, civil remedies, including
    fines, injunctions, and recalls of our products. Our operations
    are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent
    regulations administered by the Environmental Protection Agency,
    which pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment
    and the handling and disposition of wastes. Failure to comply
    with these regulations can have serious consequences, including
    civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity.
    Changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving
    interpretations thereof, including increased government
    regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas
    emissions as a result of concern over climate change, may result
    in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other
    financial obligations for us, which could affect our
    profitability or impede the production or distribution of our
    products, which could affect our net operating revenues.

Our
    information technology resources must provide efficient
    connections between our business functions, or our results of
    operations will be negatively impacted.

Each year we engage in billions of dollars of transactions with
    our customers and vendors. Because the amount of dollars
    involved is so significant, our information technology resources
    must provide connections among our marketing, sales,
    manufacturing, logistics, customer service, and accounting
    functions. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the
    resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology
    infrastructure and to maintain the related automated and manual
    control processes, we could be subject to billing and collection
    errors, business disruptions, or damage resulting from security
    breaches. We began implementing new financial and operational
    information technology systems in fiscal 2008 and placed systems
    into production during fiscal 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011. If
    future implementation problems are encountered, our results of
    operations could be negatively impacted.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

In fiscal 1991, we acquired Beatrice Company
    (“Beatrice”). As a result of the acquisition and the
    significant pre-acquisition contingencies of the Beatrice
    businesses and its former subsidiaries, our consolidated
    post-acquisition financial statements reflect liabilities
    associated with the estimated resolution of these contingencies.
    These include various litigation and environmental proceedings
    related to businesses divested by Beatrice prior to its
    acquisition by us. The litigation includes suits against a
    number of lead paint and pigment manufacturers, including
    ConAgra Grocery Products and the Company as alleged successors
    to W. P. Fuller Co., a lead paint and pigment manufacturer owned
    and operated by Beatrice until 1967. Although decisions
    favorable to us have been rendered in Rhode Island, New Jersey,
    Wisconsin, and Ohio, we remain a defendant in active suits in
    Illinois and California. The Illinois suit seeks

class-wide

relief in the form of medical monitoring for elevated levels of
    lead in blood. In California, a number of cities and counties
    have joined in a consolidated action seeking abatement of the
    alleged public nuisance.

The environmental proceedings include litigation and
    administrative proceedings involving Beatrice’s status as a
    potentially responsible party at 37 Superfund, proposed
    Superfund, or state-equivalent sites. These sites involve
    locations previously owned or operated by predecessors of
    Beatrice that used or produced petroleum, pesticides,
    fertilizers, dyes, inks, solvents, PCBs, acids, lead, sulfur,
    tannery wastes,

and/or

other
    contaminants. Beatrice has paid or is in the process of paying
    its liability share at 34 of these sites. Reserves for these
    matters have been established based on our best estimate of the
    undiscounted remediation liabilities, which estimates include
    evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required

clean-up,

the known volumetric contribution of Beatrice and other
    potentially responsible parties, and its experience in
    remediating sites. The reserves for Beatrice-related
    environmental matters totaled $68.5 million as of
    May 29, 2011, a majority of which relates to the Superfund
    and state-equivalent sites referenced above. The reserve for
    Beatrice-related environmental matters reflects a reduction in
    pre-tax expense of $15.4 million made in the third quarter
    of fiscal 2010 due to favorable regulatory



developments at one of the sites. We expect expenditures for
    Beatrice-related environmental matters to continue for up to
    19 years.

We are a party to a number of lawsuits and claims arising out of
    the operation of our business, including lawsuits and claims
    related to the February 2007 recall of our peanut butter
    products and litigation we initiated against an insurance
    carrier to recover our settlement expenditures and defense
    costs. We recognized a charge of $24.8 million during the
    third quarter of fiscal 2009 in connection with the disputed
    coverage with this insurance carrier. During the second quarter
    of fiscal 2010, a Delaware state court rendered a decision on
    certain matters in our claim for the disputed coverage favorable
    to the insurance carrier. We appealed this decision and, during
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we received a favorable
    opinion related to our defense costs and the claim for disputed
    coverage was remanded to the state court. We continue to
    vigorously pursue our claim for the disputed coverage.
    Subsequent to the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we
    received formal requests from the U.S. Attorney’s
    office in Georgia seeking a variety of records and information
    related to the operations of our peanut butter manufacturing
    facility in Sylvester, Georgia. The Company believes these
    requests are related to the previously disclosed June 2007
    execution of a search warrant at the facility following the
    February 2007 recall of our peanut butter products. The Company
    is cooperating with officials in regard to the requests.

On June 9, 2009, an accidental explosion occurred at our
    manufacturing facility in Garner, North Carolina (the
    “Garner accident”). This facility was the primary
    production facility for our

Slim
    Jim

®

branded meat snacks. On June 13, 2009, the
    U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives
    announced its determination that the explosion was the result of
    an accidental natural gas release, and not a deliberate act.
    During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, Jacobs Engineering
    Group Inc., our engineer and project manager at the site filed a
    declaratory judgment action against us seeking indemnity for
    personal injury claims brought against it as a result of the
    accident. We intend to defend this action vigorously. During the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we settled our property and
    business interruption claims related to the Garner accident with
    our insurance providers.

We are a party to several lawsuits concerning the use of
    diacetyl, a butter flavoring ingredient that was added to our
    microwave popcorn until late 2007. The cases are primarily
    consumer personal injury suits claiming respiratory illness
    allegedly due to exposures to vapors from microwaving popcorn.
    Another case involved a putative class action contending that
    our packaging information with respect to diacetyl is false and
    misleading. Through the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we have
    received a favorable verdict, summary judgment ruling, and two
    dismissals in connection with these suits, and the class action
    motion in the packaging suit was denied. The verdict and the
    favorable summary judgment ruling were appealed and the summary
    judgment was affirmed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. We
    do not believe these cases possess merit and continue to
    vigorously defend them.

After taking into account liabilities recognized for all of the
    foregoing matters, management believes the ultimate resolution
    of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.

Settlement
    of Insurance Claim related to Garner, North Carolina
    Accident

On June 9, 2009, an accidental explosion occurred at our
    manufacturing facility in Garner, North Carolina (the
    “Garner accident”). This facility was the primary
    production facility for our

Slim
    Jim

®

branded meat snacks. On June 13, 2009, the U.S. Bureau
    of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives announced its
    determination that the explosion was the result of an accidental
    natural gas release, and not a deliberate act.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we reached a settlement of
    this matter with our insurance providers, and we recognized a
    gain, net of fiscal 2011 expenditures related to this matter, of
    approximately $105 million.

The costs incurred and insurance recoveries recognized, in
    fiscal 2011 and 2010, are reflected in our consolidated
    financial statements, as follows:

Restructuring
    Plans

In February 2011, our Board of Directors approved a plan
    recommended by executive management designed to optimize our
    manufacturing and distribution networks (the “Network
    Optimization Plan”, which we previously referred to as the
    “2011 plan”). The Network Optimization Plan consists
    of projects that involve, among other things, the exit of
    certain manufacturing facilities, the disposal of underutilized
    manufacturing assets, and actions designed to optimize our
    distribution network. Implementation of the plan is expected to
    continue through fiscal 2013 and is intended to improve the
    efficiency of our manufacturing operations and reduce costs.

In connection with the Network Optimization Plan, we currently
    estimate we will incur aggregate pre-tax costs of approximately
    $55 million, including approximately $22 million of
    cash charges. In fiscal 2011, we recognized charges of
    $31 million in relation to the Network Optimization Plan.

In March 2010, we announced a plan, authorized by our Board of
    Directors, related to the long-term production of our meat snack
    products. The plan provides for the closure of our meat snacks
    production facility in Garner, North Carolina, and the movement
    of production to our existing facility in Troy, Ohio. Since the
    Garner accident, the Troy facility has been producing a portion
    of our meat snack products. Upon substantial completion of the
    plan’s implementation by the end of fiscal 2011, the Troy
    facility has become our primary meat snacks production facility.



In May 2010, we made a decision to consolidate certain
    administrative functions from Edina, Minnesota, to Naperville,
    Illinois. The transition of these functions was completed in the
    first half of fiscal 2011. This plan, together with the plan to
    move production of our meat snacks from Garner, North Carolina
    to Troy, Ohio, are collectively referred to as the 2010
    restructuring plan (the “2010 plan”). In connection
    with the 2010 plan, we expect to incur pre-tax cash and non-cash
    charges of $68 million. In fiscal 2011 and 2010, we
    recognized charges of approximately $26 million and
    $39 million, respectively, in relation to these plans.

As part of a focus on cost reduction, we previously carried out
    a restructuring plan focused on streamlining our supply chain
    and reducing selling, general, and administrative costs (the

“2006-2008

restructuring plan”). As part of the

2006-2008

restructuring plan, we began construction of a new production
    facility in fiscal 2007. As a result of an updated assessment of
    manufacturing strategies and the related impact on this
    partially completed production facility, we decided to divest
    this facility. Accordingly, in fiscal 2010, we recognized a
    non-cash impairment charge of $33 million, representing a
    write-down of the carrying value of the assets to fair value
    based on anticipated proceeds from the sale. This charge is
    reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses within
    the Consumer Foods segment.

The Network Optimization Plan and the 2010 plan are collectively
    referred to as our restructuring plans.

Management continues to evaluate our manufacturing footprint and
    potential opportunities to generate cost savings. If such
    opportunities are identified, the Network Optimization Plan will
    be amended accordingly, and this could lead to significant
    additional restructuring expenses.

Acquisitions

In June 2010, we acquired the assets of American Pie, LLC, a
    manufacturer of frozen fruit pies, thaw and serve pies, fruit
    cobblers, and pie crusts under the licensed

Marie
    Callender’s

®

and

Claim
    Jumper

®

trade names, as well as frozen dinners, pot pies, and appetizers
    under the

Claim
    Jumper

®

trade name. We paid $131 million in cash plus assumed
    liabilities for this business. This business is included in the
    Consumer Foods segment.

During fiscal 2010, we completed the acquisition of Elan
    Nutrition (“Elan”), a privately held formulator and
    manufacturer of private label snack and nutrition bars, for
    approximately $103 million in cash. This business is
    included in the Consumer Foods segment.

In June 2011, we purchased various

Marie
    Callender’s

®

brand trademarks from Marie Callender Pie Shops, Inc., for
    approximately $58 million.

Divestitures

In July 2010, we completed the sale of substantially all of the
    assets of

Gilroy Foods &
    Flavors

tm

dehydrated garlic, onion, capsicum and

Controlled
    Moisture

tm

,

GardenFrost

®

,

Redi-Made

tm

,

    and fresh vegetable operations for $246 million in cash.
    Based on our estimate of proceeds from the sale of this
    business, we recognized impairment and related charges totaling
    $59 million ($40 million after-tax) in the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2010. We reflected the results of these
    operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

In May 2011, we completed the sale of the assets of our frozen
    handhelds operations for approximately $10 million. We
    recognized charges totaling $22 million ($14 million
    after-tax) relating to the impairment of the long-lived assets
    of the business. We reflected the results of these operations as
    discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Capital
    Allocation

During fiscal 2011, we received $554 million as payment in
    full of all principal and interest due on the remaining Notes
    received in connection with the divestiture of the trading and
    merchandising operations in fiscal 2009, in advance of the
    scheduled maturity dates.

During fiscal 2011, we repurchased approximately 36 million
    shares of our common stock for $825 million, and we repaid
    the entire principal balance of $248 million of our
    7.875% senior notes, which were due September 15,
    2010. During fiscal 2010, we repurchased 4 million shares
    of our common stock for $100 million.



During fiscal 2011, we paid dividends of $375 million.

SEGMENT
    REVIEW

We report our operations in two reporting segments: Consumer
    Foods and Commercial Foods.

Consumer
    Foods

The Consumer Foods reporting segment includes branded and
    private label food products that are sold in various retail and
    foodservice channels, principally in North America. The products
    include a variety of categories (meals, entrees, condiments,
    sides, snacks, and desserts) across frozen, refrigerated, and
    shelf-stable temperature classes.

In May 2011, we completed the sale of the assets of our frozen
    handhelds operations for approximately $10 million. We
    recognized charges totaling $22 million ($14 million
    after-tax) relating to the impairment of the long-lived assets
    of the business. We reflected the results of these operations as
    discontinued operations for all periods presented.

In February 2010, we completed the sale of our

Luck’s

®

brand for proceeds of approximately $22 million in cash,
    resulting in a pre-tax gain of $14 million ($9 million
    after-tax), reflected in selling, general and administrative
    expenses.

In June 2009, we completed the divestiture of the

Fernando’s

®

foodservice business for proceeds of $6 million in cash. We
    reflected the results of these operations as discontinued
    operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities
    of the divested

Fernando’s

®

business have been reclassified as assets and liabilities held
    for sale within our consolidated balance sheets for all periods
    prior to divestiture.

Commercial
    Foods

The Commercial Foods reporting segment principally includes
    commercially branded foods and ingredients, which are sold
    primarily to foodservice, food manufacturing, and industrial
    customers. The segment’s primary products include:
    specialty potato products, milled grain ingredients, and a
    variety of vegetable products, seasonings, blends, and flavors,
    which are sold under brands such as

ConAgra
    Mills

®

,

Lamb
    Weston

®

,

    and

Spicetec Flavors &
    Seasonings

TM

.

As discussed above, we reflected the results of the

Presentation of Derivative Gains (Losses) for Economic Hedges
    of Forecasted Cash Flows in Segment Results

Derivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign
    currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment.
    We believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain
    forecasted transactions. As such, these derivatives (except
    those related to our milling operations, see Note 19 to our
    Consolidated Financial Statements) are recognized at fair market
    value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized
    in general corporate expenses. The gains and losses are
    subsequently recognized in the operating results of the
    reporting segments in the period in which the underlying
    transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings.



The following table presents the net derivative gains (losses)
    from economic hedges of forecasted commodity consumption and the
    foreign currency risk of certain forecasted transactions, under
    this methodology (in millions):

Based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the
    underlying hedged items, we expect to reclassify gains of
    $34 million and losses of $2 million to segment
    operating results in fiscal 2012 and 2013 and thereafter,
    respectively. Amounts allocated, or to be allocated, to segment
    operating results during fiscal 2011 and thereafter include net
    losses of $3 million recognized within corporate expense
    prior to fiscal 2011.

Overall, our net sales increased $288 million to

    our Consumer Foods segment and a 6% increase in our Commercial
    Foods segment relative to results in fiscal 2010.

Consumer Foods net sales for fiscal 2011 were $8.0 billion,
    an increase of 1% as compared to fiscal 2010. Results reflected
    a 2% benefit from acquisitions, net of divestitures, a 1%
    decrease in volume from existing businesses, and essentially
    unchanged net pricing and mix. The decrease in volume from
    existing businesses reflected highly competitive pricing for
    some products, as well as lower consumption in certain product
    categories. The net pricing impacts for fiscal 2011 were not
    significant, reflecting the fact that price increases in the
    second half of the year were offset by pricing reductions
    earlier in the year related to competitive pressures.

Commercial Foods net sales were $4.3 billion in fiscal
    2011, an increase of $226 million, or 6% compared to fiscal
    2010. Net sales in our flour milling business were approximately
    $107 million higher in fiscal 2011 than in fiscal 2010,
    principally reflecting the pass-through of higher wheat prices.
    Results also reflected a $98 million increase in sales in
    our

Lamb
    Weston

®

specialty potato products business, reflecting higher volume of
    approximately 4% and flat net pricing and mix. The increase in
    sales volume included significant growth in sales of sweet
    potato products.



Selling,
    General and Administrative Expenses (includes General Corporate
    Expense) (“SG&A”)

SG&A expenses totaled $1.51 billion for fiscal 2011, a
    decrease of $308 million, or 17%, compared to fiscal 2010.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2011
    reflected the following:

•

a decrease in incentive compensation expense of
    $130 million,

•

a net benefit of $105 million in connection with the
    settlement of insurance claims, net of expenses incurred,
    related to the Garner accident,

•

charges totaling $35 million in connection with our
    restructuring plans,

•

a decrease in advertising and promotion expense of
    $37 million,

•

an increase in salaries and labor expense of $26 million,

•

a gain of $25 million from the receipt, as payment in full
    of all principal and interest due on the remaining Notes
    received in connection with the divestiture of the trading and
    merchandising operations in fiscal 2009, in advance of the
    scheduled maturity dates,

•

a decrease in charitable donations of $13 million,

•

a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of
    $11 million,

•

an increase in self-insured medical expense of
    $10 million, and

•

a decrease in property, sales, and use taxes of $10 million.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2010
    included the following:

•

charges totaling $36 million in connection with the 2010
    plan, consisting of charges related to our decision to move
    manufacturing activities in Garner, North Carolina to Troy,
    Ohio, and our decision to move administrative functions in
    Edina, Minnesota to Naperville, Illinois,

•

a charge of $33 million in connection with the impairment
    of a partially completed production facility,

•

a benefit of $15 million associated with a favorable
    adjustment to an environmental-related liability,

•

transaction-related costs of $14 million associated with
    securing federal tax benefits related to the Delhi, LA sweet
    potato production facility (the associated income tax benefits
    will be recognized in future periods),

•

a $14 million gain on the sale of the

Luck’s

®

brand, and

•

a net benefit of $8 million, representing SG&A
    expenses associated with the Garner accident that were more than
    offset by insurance recoveries (related charges of
    $12 million were recognized in cost of goods sold).

Consumer Foods operating profit increased $34 million in
    fiscal 2011 versus the prior year to $1.14 billion. Gross
    profits were $156 million lower in fiscal 2011 than in
    fiscal 2010 driven by the impact of higher commodity



input costs that were not fully offset by the benefit of price
    increases and supply chain cost savings initiatives. Other items
    that significantly impacted Consumer Foods operating profit in
    fiscal 2011 included:

•

a net benefit of $105 million in connection with the
    settlement of insurance claims, net of expenses incurred,
    related to the Garner accident,

•

a decrease in incentive compensation expense of $48 million,

•

a decrease in advertising and promotion expense of
    $42 million,

•

charges totaling $45 million in connection with the
    Company’s restructuring plans, and

•

the impact of foreign currencies, including related economic
    hedges, resulted in an increase of operating profit of
    approximately $27 million in fiscal 2011, as compared to
    fiscal 2010.

Items that significantly impacted Consumer Foods operating
    profit in fiscal 2010 included:

•

charges totaling $36 million in connection with our
    restructuring plans,

•

a charge of $33 million in connection with the impairment
    of a partially completed production facility, and

•

a $14 million gain on the sale of the

Luck’s

brand.

Commercial Foods operating profit decreased $34 million in
    fiscal 2011 versus the prior year to $505 million. Gross
    profits in our

Lamb
    Weston

®

specialty potato business were negatively impacted in fiscal
    2011 by significant increases in input costs which more than
    offset the benefit of increased sales volumes and a higher
    quality potato crop than that which was processed in fiscal 2010
    and the first half of fiscal 2011. Gross profits in our flour
    milling business improved in fiscal 2011 due to effective
    management of margins in a volatile wheat market, which more
    than offset the decrease in sales volumes. SG&A expenses
    were lower in the Commercial Foods segment in fiscal 2011 as
    compared to fiscal 2010, largely due to a $13 million
    decrease in incentive compensation expense. The Commercial Foods
    segment also recognized charges of $11 million in fiscal
    2011 in connection with our restructuring plans.

Interest
    Expense, Net

In fiscal 2011, net interest expense was $178 million, an
    increase of $17 million, or 11%, from fiscal 2010. Included
    in net interest expense was $42 million and
    $85 million of interest income in fiscal 2011 and 2010,
    respectively, principally from the Notes received in connection
    with the divestiture of the trading and merchandising business
    in June 2008. Interest expense in fiscal 2011 also reflected a
    net benefit of $13 million primarily resulting from
    interest rate swaps used to effectively convert the interest
    rates of certain outstanding debt instruments from fixed to
    variable (this hedge was terminated in fiscal 2011) and the
    benefit of the repayment of $248 million of debt in
    September 2010.

During fiscal 2010, we received $115 million as payment in
    full of all principal and interest due on a portion of the
    Notes, in advance of the scheduled maturity date. In December
    2010, we received $554 million as payment in full of all
    principal and interest due on the remaining Notes, in advance of
    the scheduled maturity dates. We expect net interest expense to
    be significantly higher in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011,
    reflecting lower interest income.

Income
    Taxes

Our income tax expense was $421 million and
    $361 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. The
    effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax
    expense to pre-tax income from continuing operations, inclusive
    of equity method investment earnings) was 34% for fiscal 2011
    and 33% in fiscal 2010. The lower effective tax rate in fiscal
    2010 was reflective of favorable changes in estimates and audit
    settlements, as well as certain income tax credits and
    deductions identified in fiscal 2010 that related to prior
    periods. These benefits were offset, in part, by unfavorable tax
    consequences of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
    and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

We expect our effective tax rate in fiscal 2012, exclusive of
    any unusual transactions or tax events, to be approximately 34%.



Equity
    Method Investment Earnings

We include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based
    on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates.
    Significant affiliates produce and market potato products for
    retail and foodservice customers. Our share of earnings from our
    equity method investments was $26 million ($6 million
    in the Consumer Foods segment and $20 million in the
    Commercial Foods segment) and $22 million ($5 million
    in the Consumer Foods segment and $17 million in the
    Commercial Foods segment) in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively.
    Equity method investment earnings in the Commercial Foods
    segment reflected improving market conditions in a foreign
    potato processing venture and continued difficult market
    conditions for our domestic potato ventures.

Results
    of Discontinued Operations

Our discontinued operations generated after-tax losses of
    $12 million and $19 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010,
    respectively. In fiscal 2011, we completed the sale of the
    assets of a small frozen foods business for approximately
    $10 million. We recognized after-tax impairment charges
    totaling $14 million in connection with this sale. In
    fiscal 2010, we decided to divest our dehydrated vegetable
    operations. As a result of this decision, we recognized an
    after-tax impairment charge of $40 million in fiscal 2010,
    representing a write-down of the carrying value of the related
    long-lived assets to fair value, based on the anticipated sales
    proceeds. The sale of this business for $246 million in
    cash was completed in July 2010. Operating results of
    discontinued operations in fiscal 2011 include the favorable
    resolution of a foreign tax matter relating to a divested
    business. Operating results of discontinued operations in fiscal
    2010 include charges related to certain legal and environmental
    matters of divested businesses.

Earnings
    Per Share

Our diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2011 were $1.88
    (including earnings of $1.90 per diluted share from continuing
    operations and a loss of $0.02 per diluted share from
    discontinued operations). Our diluted earnings per share in
    fiscal 2010 were $1.62 (including earnings of $1.66 per diluted
    share from continuing operations and losses of $0.04 per diluted
    share from discontinued operations). See

    sales in fiscal 2010 resulting from lower underlying wheat costs
    passed on to customers. This decrease was partially offset by
    improved pricing and mix in the Consumer Foods segment and the

    $7.94 billion, basically flat as compared to fiscal 2009.
    Results reflected flat volume and essentially unchanged net
    pricing and mix. Volume reflected a benefit of approximately 2%
    in fiscal 2009 due to the inclusion of the additional week of
    results. Excluding the impact of the additional week, volume
    increased 2% in fiscal 2010, reflecting successful innovation
    and marketing.

Commercial Foods net sales were $4.08 billion in fiscal
    2010, a decrease of $370 million, or 8%, compared to fiscal
    2009. Net sales in our flour milling business were approximately
    $330 million lower in fiscal 2010 than in fiscal 2009,
    principally reflecting the pass-through of lower wheat prices.
    Results also reflected a slight decrease in sales in our

Lamb
    Weston

®

specialty potato products business, reflecting lower volume of
    approximately 2%, partially offset by increased pricing. Volume
    reflected a benefit of approximately 2% in fiscal 2009 due to
    the inclusion of the additional week of results. Excluding the
    impact of the additional week, volume was essentially unchanged
    in fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009.

SG&A
    Expenses (includes General Corporate Expense)
    (“SG&A”)

SG&A expenses totaled $1.82 billion for fiscal 2010,
    an increase of 8% compared to fiscal 2009. We estimate that the
    inclusion of the extra week in the fiscal 2009 results increased
    SG&A expenses by approximately 2% in that fiscal year.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2010
    reflected the following:

•

an increase in incentive compensation expense of
    $99 million,

•

charges totaling $36 million in connection with the 2010
    plan, consisting of charges related to the Company’s
    decision to move manufacturing activities in Garner, North
    Carolina to Troy, Ohio, and the Company’s decision to move
    administrative functions in Edina, Minnesota to Naperville,
    Illinois,

•

a charge of $33 million in connection with the impairment
    of a partially completed production facility,

•

an increase in advertising and promotion expense of
    $29 million,

•

an increase in self-insured medical expense of $15 million,

•

a benefit of $15 million associated with a favorable
    adjustment to an environmental-related liability,

•

transaction-related costs of $14 million associated with
    securing federal tax benefits related to the Delhi, LA sweet
    potato production facility (the associated income tax benefits
    will be recognized in future periods),

•

a $14 million gain on the sale of the

Luck’s

®

brand,

•

increase in stock-based compensation expense of $13 million,

•

a decrease in charitable donations of $9 million, and

•

a net benefit of $8 million, representing SG&A
    expenses associated with the Garner accident that were more than
    offset by insurance recoveries.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2009
    reflected the following:

•

a charge of $50 million representing the net premium and
    fees paid to retire certain debt instruments prior to maturity,

•

a charge of $25 million related to a coverage dispute with
    an insurer,

•

a gain of $19 million from the sale of the

Pemmican

®

brand,

•

charges related to peanut butter and pot pie recalls of
    $11 million,

•

charges of $10 million related to the execution of our
    restructuring plans, and

•

$5 million of income, net of direct pass-through costs, for
    reimbursement of expenses related to transition services
    provided to the buyers of certain divested businesses.

Consumer Foods operating profit increased $164 million in
    fiscal 2010 versus the prior year to $1.1 billion. Gross
    profits were $262 million higher in fiscal 2010 than in
    fiscal 2009 driven by the impact of lower commodity input costs,
    and the benefit of supply chain cost savings initiatives.
    Consumer Foods SG&A expenses were higher in fiscal 2010
    than in fiscal 2009, reflecting a $34 million increase in
    incentive compensation expenses and a $22 million increase
    in advertising and promotion expenses. The Consumer Foods
    segment recognized a $14 million gain on the sale of the

Luck’s

®

brand in fiscal 2010. Charges totaling $36 million were
    recognized in the Consumer Foods segment in fiscal 2010 in
    connection with the 2010 plan, including charges related to our
    decision to move manufacturing activities in Garner, North
    Carolina to Troy, Ohio, and our decision to move administrative
    functions in Edina, Minnesota to Naperville, Illinois. An
    additional charge of $33 million was recognized in
    connection with the impairment of a production facility, as we
    made a decision to divest the partially completed facility. The
    Consumer Foods segment recognized a $19 million gain on the
    sale of the

Pemmican

®

brand, incurred costs of product recalls classified as SG&A
    expense of $11 million, and incurred costs of
    $8 million in connection with our restructuring plans in
    fiscal 2009. The impact of foreign currencies, including related
    economic hedges, resulted in a reduction of operating profit of
    approximately $9 million in fiscal 2010, as compared to
    fiscal 2009.

The Garner accident in June 2009 resulted in charges within
    SG&A totaling $47 million for the impairment of
    property, plant and equipment, workers’ compensation, site

clean-up,

and other related costs in fiscal 2010 (in addition to inventory
    write-downs and other related costs of $12 million
    recognized in cost of goods sold). The impact of these charges
    was offset by insurance recoveries of $58 million in fiscal
    2010 for the involuntary conversion of assets. Gross profits
    from

Slim
    Jim

®

branded products were $25 million and $51 million in
    fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively, reflecting the impact of the
    disruption of production due to the accident.

Commercial Foods operating profit decreased $3 million in
    fiscal 2010 versus the prior year to $539 million. Improved
    gross profits in the flour milling business were partially
    offset by reduced gross profits in the specialty blends and
    flavorings business and the specialty potato business. Gross
    profits continued to be negatively impacted by challenging
    conditions in the foodservice channel as well as high production
    costs associated with a high cost and poor quality potato crop
    in our specialty potato business. Commercial Foods SG&A
    expenses were higher in fiscal 2010 than in fiscal 2009,
    reflecting a $5 million increase in incentive compensation
    expenses. Commercial Foods operating profit for fiscal 2009
    reflected the benefit of the additional week of operations.

Interest
    Expense, Net

In fiscal 2010, net interest expense was $160 million, a
    decrease of $26 million, or 14%, from fiscal 2009. The
    reduction in net interest expense is primarily the result of
    increased capitalized interest and increased interest income in
    fiscal 2010. Interest income includes $83 million and
    $73 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively, from the

payment-in-kind

notes received in June 2008 in connection with the divestiture
    of our trading and merchandising operations.

Income
    Taxes

Our income tax expense was $361 million and
    $317 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. The
    effective tax rate (calculated as the ratio of income tax
    expense to pre-tax income from continuing operations, inclusive
    of equity method investment earnings) was 33% for fiscal 2010
    and 34% in fiscal 2009. The lower effective tax rate in fiscal
    2010 was reflective of favorable changes in estimates and audit
    settlements, as well as certain income tax



credits and deductions identified in fiscal 2010 that related to
    prior periods. These benefits were offset, in part, by
    unfavorable tax consequences of the Patient Protection and
    Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education
    Reconciliation Act of 2010.

Equity
    Method Investment Earnings

We include our share of the earnings of certain affiliates based
    on our economic ownership interest in the affiliates.
    Significant affiliates produce and market potato products for
    retail and foodservice customers. Our share of earnings from our
    equity method investments was $22 million ($5 million
    in the Consumer Foods segment and $17 million in the
    Commercial Foods segment) and $24 million ($5 million
    in the Consumer Foods segment and $19 million in the
    Commercial Foods segment) in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively.
    Equity method investment earnings in the Commercial Foods
    segment reflected continued difficult market conditions for our
    foreign and domestic potato ventures.

Results
    of Discontinued Operations

Our discontinued operations generated an after-tax loss of
    $19 million in fiscal 2010 and earnings of
    $364 million in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, we decided to
    divest our dehydrated vegetable operations. As a result of this
    decision, we recognized an after-tax impairment charge of
    $40 million in fiscal 2010, representing a write-down of
    the carrying value of the related long-lived assets to fair
    value, based on the anticipated sales proceeds. In fiscal 2009,
    we completed the sale of the trading and merchandising
    operations and recognized an after-tax gain on the disposition
    of approximately $301 million. In the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2009, we decided to sell certain small foodservice
    brands. The sale of these brands was completed in June 2009. We
    recognized after-tax impairment charges of $6 million in
    fiscal 2009, in anticipation of this divestiture.

Earnings
    Per Share

Our diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2010 were $1.62
    (including earnings of $1.66 per diluted share from continuing
    operations and a loss of $0.04 per diluted share from
    discontinued operations). Our diluted earnings per share in
    fiscal 2009 were $2.15 (including earnings of $1.35 per diluted
    share from continuing operations and $0.80 per diluted share
    from discontinued operations), respectively. See

“Items Impacting Comparability”

above as
    several other significant items affected the comparability of

year-over-year

results of operations.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Sources
    of Liquidity and Capital

Our primary financing objective is to maintain a prudent capital
    structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth
    objectives. If necessary, we use short-term debt principally to
    finance ongoing operations, including our seasonal requirements
    for working capital (accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and
    other current assets, and inventories, less accounts payable,
    accrued payroll, and other accrued liabilities) and a
    combination of equity and long-term debt to finance both our
    base working capital needs and our noncurrent assets.

At May 29, 2011, we had a $1.5 billion revolving
    credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions,
    which matures in December 2011. We expect to refinance the
    facility prior to maturity at terms that will enable us to
    maintain sufficient liquidity to support our business needs. The
    facility has historically been used principally as a

back-up

facility for our commercial paper program. As of May 29,
    2011, there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility.
    We did not draw upon this facility or the commercial paper
    program during fiscal 2011. Borrowings under the facility bear
    interest at or below prime rate and may be prepaid without
    penalty. The facility requires that our consolidated funded debt
    not exceed 65% of our consolidated capital base, and that our
    fixed charges coverage ratio be greater than 1.75 to 1.0. As of
    May 29, 2011, we were in compliance with these financial
    covenants.

As of the end of fiscal 2011, our senior long-term debt ratings
    were all investment grade. A significant downgrade in our credit
    ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under the
    revolving credit facility, although borrowing costs would
    increase. A downgrade of our short-term credit ratings would
    impact our ability to



borrow under our commercial paper program by negatively
    impacting borrowing costs and causing shorter durations, as well
    as making access to commercial paper more difficult.

In connection with the divestiture of the trading and
    merchandising operations in fiscal 2009, we received
    $550 million (face value) of the Notes issued by the
    purchaser of the divested business. During fiscal 2010, we
    received $115 million as payment in full of all principal
    and interest due on a portion of the Notes, in advance of the
    scheduled maturity date. During fiscal 2011, we received
    $554 million as payment in full of all principal and
    interest due on the remaining Notes, in advance of the scheduled
    maturity dates.

We repurchase our shares of common stock from time to time after
    considering market conditions and in accordance with repurchase
    limits authorized by our Board of Directors. In February 2010,
    our Board of Directors approved a $500 million share
    repurchase program with no expiration date. We repurchased
    approximately 4 million shares of our common stock for
    approximately $100 million under this program in the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2010. In December 2010, our Board of Directors
    increased the Company’s share repurchase authorization by
    $554 million, the amount of the early repayment of the
    remaining Notes. We repurchased approximately 36 million
    shares of our common stock for $825 million under this
    program in fiscal 2011. The Company’s total remaining share
    repurchase authorization was $129 million as of the end of
    fiscal 2011.

In July 2010, we completed the sale of substantially all of the
    assets of

Gilroy Foods &
    Flavors

tm

dehydrated garlic, onion, capsicum and

Controlled
    Moisture

tm

,

,

    and fresh vegetable operations for $246 million in cash.

On September 15, 2010, we repaid the entire principal
    balance of $248 million of our 7.875% senior notes,
    due on that date.

We expect to repay the entire principal balance of
    $343 million of our 6.75% senior notes, due
    September 15, 2011, with cash on hand.

Cash
    Flows

In fiscal 2011, we generated $19 million of cash, which was
    the net result of $1.35 billion generated from operating
    activities, $89 million generated from investing
    activities, $1.43 billion used in financing activities, and
    an increase of $10 million in cash and cash equivalents due
    to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Cash generated from operating activities of continuing
    operations totaled $1.34 billion for fiscal 2011 as
    compared to $1.43 billion generated in fiscal 2010. Results
    reflect increased income from continuing operations in fiscal
    2011. Improvement in our accounts payable balance largely offset
    increases in the inventory balance, reflecting the impact of
    higher commodity costs in our flour milling business. The

year-over-year

decrease in operating cash flows also reflects higher incentive
    payments made in fiscal 2011 (earned in fiscal 2010), than those
    made in fiscal 2010 (related to fiscal 2009 performance). We
    also contributed $129 million and $123 million to our
    Company-sponsored pension plans in fiscal 2011 and 2010,
    respectively. Cash payments of income taxes were
    $172 million and $291 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010,
    respectively, reflecting the benefit of changes in certain
    federal income tax laws that will allow us to defer the payment
    of a significant amount of income taxes recognized in fiscal
    2011 until future years. Fiscal 2011 operating cash flows also
    reflect the receipt of $142 million of interest due on the
    remaining Notes received in connection with the divestiture of
    the trading and merchandising operations in fiscal 2009, and
    insurance advances of $65 million for reimbursement of

out-of-pocket

expenses and foregone profits associated with the Garner
    accident. Cash generated from operating activities of
    discontinued operations was $12 million and
    $43 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively,
    primarily reflecting income from operations of the discontinued

Gilroy Foods &
    Flavors

tm

dehydrated vegetable business and reduced inventory balances
    within that business.

Cash used in investing activities of continuing operations
    totaled $166 million in fiscal 2011 and $352 million
    in fiscal 2010. Investing activities of continuing operations in
    fiscal 2011 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of
    $466 million and acquisitions of businesses and intangibles
    (including

American
    Pie

®

)

    totaling $149 million, partially offset by the receipt of
    $413 million, as payment in full of all amounts due on the
    remaining Notes received in connection with the divestiture of
    the trading and merchandising operations in fiscal 2009 (receipt
    of interest due



is reflected in operating cash flows), and sales of property,
    plant and equipment of $19 million. Investing activities of
    continuing operations in fiscal 2010 included capital
    expenditures of $482 million and acquisitions of businesses
    and intangibles (including Elan) totaling $107 million,
    partially offset by sales of businesses and brands (including
    the

Luck’s

®

brand) of $22 million and sales of property, plant, and
    equipment of $88 million. Also included in investing
    activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2010 was a cash
    inflow of $92 million (of the total receipt of
    $115 million) representing the payment in full of all
    principal and interest due on the first tranche of the Notes, in
    advance of the scheduled maturity date (the remaining
    $23 million is reflected as cash generated from operating
    activities of continuing operations), and insurance advances of
    $35 million for the replacement of property, plant and
    equipment destroyed in the Garner accident. We generated
    $255 million of cash from investing activities of
    discontinued operations in fiscal 2011 from the disposition of
    the

Gilroy Foods &
    Flavors

tm

dehydrated vegetable business.

Cash used in financing activities totaled $1.43 billion in
    fiscal 2011, as compared to cash used in financing activities of
    $405 million in fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2011, we
    repurchased approximately 36 million shares of our common
    stock for $825 million, we paid dividends of
    $375 million, and we decreased our debt by
    $294 million, including the repayment of the entire
    principal balance of $248 million of our 7.875% senior
    notes on September 15, 2010, due on that date, as well as
    the repayment of $35 million of bank borrowings by our Lamb
    Weston BSW potato processing venture. During fiscal 2011, we
    also received net proceeds of $60 million from employees
    exercising stock options, net of tax payments we made related to
    issuance of stock awards. During fiscal 2010, we paid dividends
    of $347 million, we repurchased $100 million of our
    common stock as part of our share repurchase program, and we
    reduced our long-term debt by $16 million. During fiscal
    2010, we also received net proceeds of $55 million from
    employees exercising stock options, net of tax payments related
    to issuance of stock awards.

We estimate our capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 will be
    approximately $475 million. Management believes that
    existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, existing
    credit facilities, and access to capital markets will provide
    sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs, planned
    capital expenditures, and payment of anticipated quarterly
    dividends for at least the next twelve months.

OFF-BALANCE
    SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We use off-balance sheet arrangements (e.g., leases accounted
    for as operating leases) where sound business principles warrant
    their use. We also periodically enter into guarantees and other
    similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary
    course of business. These are described further in
    “

Obligations and Commitments

,” below.

Variable
    Interest Entities Not Consolidated

We have variable interests in certain entities that we have
    determined to be variable interest entities, but for which we
    are not the primary beneficiary. We do not consolidate the
    financial statements of these entities.

We hold a 50% interest in Lamb Weston RDO, a potato processing
    venture. We provide all sales and marketing services to Lamb
    Weston RDO. We receive a fee for these services based on a
    percentage of the net sales of the venture. We reflect the value
    of our ownership interest in this venture in other assets in our
    consolidated balance sheets, based upon the equity method of
    accounting. The balance of our investment was $14 million
    at both May 29, 2011 and May 30, 2010, representing
    our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with
    this venture. The capital structure of Lamb Weston RDO includes
    owners’ equity of $27 million and term borrowings from
    banks of $50 million as of May 29, 2011. We have
    determined that we do not have the power to direct the
    activities that most significantly impact the economic
    performance of this venture.

We lease certain office buildings from entities that we have
    determined to be variable interest entities. The lease
    agreements with these entities include fixed-price purchase
    options for the assets being leased, representing our only
    variable interest in these lessor entities. These leases are
    accounted for as operating leases, and accordingly, there are no
    material assets or liabilities associated with these entities
    included in our balance sheets. We have no material exposure to
    loss from our variable interests in these entities. We have
    determined that we do not have the power to direct the
    activities that most significantly impact the economic
    performance of these entities. In making



this determination, we have considered, among other items, the
    terms of the lease agreements, the expected remaining useful
    lives of the assets leased, and the capital structure of the
    lessor entities.

OBLIGATIONS
    AND COMMITMENTS

As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements
    that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as
    debt agreements, lease agreements, and unconditional purchase
    obligations (i.e., obligations to transfer funds in the future
    for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or
    minimum prices, such as

“take-or-pay”

contracts). The unconditional purchase obligation arrangements
    are entered into in the normal course of business in order to
    ensure adequate levels of sourced product are available. Of
    these items, debt and capital lease obligations, which totaled
    $3.3 billion as of May 29, 2011, were recognized as
    liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease
    obligations and unconditional purchase obligations, which
    totaled approximately $946 million as of May 29, 2011,
    were not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance
    sheet, in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles.

A summary of our contractual obligations at the end of fiscal
    2011 was as follows (including obligations of discontinued
    operations):

The purchase obligations noted in the table above do not reflect
    open purchase orders of approximately $475 million, some of
    which are not legally binding. These purchase orders are
    expected to be settled in the ordinary course of business in
    less than one year.

We are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our
    long-term debt and capital lease obligations. The weighted
    average interest rate of the long-term debt obligations
    outstanding as of May 29, 2011 was approximately 6.4%.

As part of our ongoing operations, we also enter into
    arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments only
    upon the occurrence of a future event (e.g., guarantees of debt
    or lease payments of a third party should the third party be
    unable to perform). In accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, the following commercial commitments are
    not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.

In certain limited situations, we will guarantee an obligation
    of an unconsolidated entity. We guarantee certain leases and
    other commercial obligations resulting from the 2002 divestiture
    of our fresh beef and pork operations. The remaining terms of
    these arrangements do not exceed five years and the maximum
    amount of future payments we have guaranteed was approximately
    $13 million, included in the table above, as of
    May 29, 2011.

We have also guaranteed the performance of the divested business
    with respect to a hog purchase contract. The hog purchase
    contract requires the divested fresh beef and pork business to
    purchase a minimum of approximately



1.2 million hogs annually through 2014. The contract
    stipulates minimum price commitments, based in part on market
    prices, and in certain circumstances also includes price
    adjustments based on certain inputs.

We are a party to various potato supply agreements. Under the
    terms of certain such potato supply agreements, we have
    guaranteed repayment of short-term bank loans of the potato
    suppliers, under certain conditions. At May 29, 2011, the
    amount of supplier loans effectively guaranteed by us was
    approximately $34 million, included in the table above. We
    have not established a liability for these guarantees, as we
    have determined that the likelihood of our required performance
    under the guarantees is remote.

We are a party to various agreements with an onion processing
    company. We have guaranteed, under certain conditions, repayment
    of a portion of the loan held by this supplier for its onion
    processing related operations. At May 29, 2011, the amount
    of our guarantee was $25 million, included in the table
    above. In the event of default on this loan by the supplier, we
    have the contractual right to purchase the loan from the lender,
    thereby giving us secured rights to the underlying collateral.
    We have not established a liability in connection with this
    guarantee, as we believe the likelihood of financial exposure to
    us under this guarantee is remote.

Federal income tax credits were generated related to the
    construction of our sweet potato production facility in Delhi,
    Louisiana. Third parties invested in certain of these income tax
    credits. We have guaranteed these third parties the face value
    of these income tax credits over their statutory lives, a period
    of seven years, in the event that the income tax credits are
    recaptured or reduced. The face value of the income tax credits
    was $21 million as of May 29, 2011. We believe the
    likelihood of the recapture or reduction of the income tax
    credits is remote, and therefore we have not established a
    liability in connection with this guarantee.

The obligations and commitments tables above do not include any
    reserves for income taxes, as we are unable to reasonably
    estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our
    reserves for income taxes. The liability for gross unrecognized
    tax benefits at May 29, 2011 was approximately
    $56 million. The net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at
    May 29, 2011, that, if recognized, would impact our
    effective tax rate was approximately $36 million.
    Recognition of this tax benefit would have a favorable impact on
    our effective tax rate.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The process of preparing financial statements requires the use
    of estimates on the part of management. The estimates used by
    management are based on our historical experiences combined with
    management’s understanding of current facts and
    circumstances. Certain of our accounting estimates are
    considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal
    of our financial condition and results and require significant
    or complex judgment on the part of management. The following is
    a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by
    management.

Our Audit Committee has reviewed management’s development,
    selection, and disclosure of the critical accounting estimates.

Marketing Costs

—We incur certain costs to promote
    our products through marketing programs, which include
    advertising, customer incentives, and consumer incentives. We
    recognize the cost of each of these types of marketing
    activities as incurred in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. The judgment required in determining when
    marketing costs are incurred can be significant. For
    volume-based incentives provided to customers, management must
    continually assess the likelihood of the customer achieving the
    specified targets. Similarly, for consumer coupons, management
    must estimate the level at which coupons will be redeemed by
    consumers in the future. Estimates made by management in
    accounting for marketing costs are based primarily on our
    historical experience with marketing programs with consideration
    given to current circumstances and industry trends. As these
    factors change, management’s estimates could change and we
    could recognize different amounts of marketing costs over
    different periods of time.

We have recognized reserves of approximately $128 million
    for these marketing costs as of May 29, 2011. Changes in
    the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual
    customer marketing program would not result in a material change
    in our results of operations or cash flows.



Advertising and promotion expenses of continuing operations
    totaled $372 million, $409 million, and
    $381 million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

Income Taxes

—Our income tax expense is based on our
    income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities
    available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax
    laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the
    taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities.
    Significant judgment is required in determining our income tax
    expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including
    evaluating uncertainties. Management reviews tax positions at
    least quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information
    becomes available. Deferred income tax assets represent amounts
    available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in
    future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences
    between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
    liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit
    carryforwards. Management evaluates the recoverability of these
    future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future
    expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of
    taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings,
    and available tax planning strategies. These estimates of future
    taxable income inherently require significant judgment.
    Management uses historical experience and short and long-range
    business forecasts to develop such estimates. Further, we employ
    various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to
    facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. To the
    extent management does not consider it more likely than not that
    a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is
    established.

Further information on income taxes is provided in Note 16
    to the consolidated financial statements.

Environmental Liabilities

—Environmental liabilities
    are accrued when it is probable that obligations have been
    incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably estimated.
    Management works with independent third-party specialists in
    order to effectively assess our environmental liabilities.
    Management estimates our environmental liabilities based on
    evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required

clean-up,

our known volumetric contribution, other potentially responsible
    parties, and our experience in remediating sites. Environmental
    liability estimates may be affected by changing governmental or
    other external determinations of what constitutes an
    environmental liability or an acceptable level of

clean-up.

Management’s estimate as to our potential liability is
    independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or
    indemnification arrangements. Insurance companies and other
    indemnitors are notified of any potential claims and
    periodically updated as to the general status of known claims.
    We do not discount our environmental liabilities as the timing
    of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily
    determinable. To the extent that there are changes in the
    evaluation factors identified above, management’s estimate
    of environmental liabilities may also change.

We have recognized a reserve of approximately $70 million
    for environmental liabilities as of May 29, 2011. The
    reserve for each site is determined based on an assessment of
    the most likely required remedy and a related estimate of the
    costs required to effect such remedy. Historically, the
    underlying assumptions utilized in estimating this reserve have
    been appropriate as actual payments have neither differed
    materially from the previously estimated reserve balances, nor
    have significant adjustments to this reserve balance been
    necessary. In fiscal 2010, based on changes in the regulatory
    environment applicable to a particular site, we reduced the
    recognized environmental liability by approximately
    $15 million.

Employment-Related Benefits

—We incur certain
    employment-related expenses associated with pensions,
    postretirement health care benefits, and workers’
    compensation. In order to measure the annual expense associated
    with these employment-related benefits, management must make a
    variety of estimates including, but not limited to, discount
    rates used to measure the present value of certain liabilities,
    assumed rates of return on assets set aside to fund these
    expenses, compensation increases, employee turnover rates,
    anticipated mortality rates, anticipated health care costs, and
    employee accidents incurred but not yet reported to us. The
    estimates used by management are based on our historical
    experience as well as current facts and circumstances. We use
    third-party specialists to assist management in appropriately
    measuring the expense associated with these employment-related
    benefits. Different estimates used by management could result in
    us recognizing different amounts of expense over different
    periods of time. We had recognized a pension liability of
    $352 million and $470 million, a postretirement
    liability of $322 million and $321 million, and a
    workers’ compensation liability of $74 million and
    $73 million, as of the end of fiscal 2011 and 2010,
    respectively. We also had recognized a pension asset of
    $15 million as of the end of fiscal 2011, as certain
    individual plans of the Company had a positive funded status.



We recognized pension expense from Company plans of
    $55 million, $47 million, and $38 million in
    fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, which reflected
    expected returns on plan assets of $173 million,
    $161 million, and $159 million, respectively. We
    contributed $129 million, $123 million, and
    $112 million to our pension plans in fiscal years 2011,
    2010, and 2009, respectively. We anticipate contributing
    approximately $80 million to our pension plans in fiscal
    2012.

One significant assumption for pension plan accounting is the
    discount rate. We select a discount rate each year (as of our
    fiscal year-end measurement date) for our plans based upon a
    hypothetical bond portfolio for which the cash flows from
    coupons and maturities match the

year-by-year

projected benefit cash flows for our pension plans. The
    hypothetical bond portfolio is comprised of high-quality fixed
    income debt instruments (usually Moody’s Aa) available at
    the measurement date. Based on this information, the discount
    rate selected by us for determination of pension expense was
    5.8% for fiscal year 2011, 6.9% for fiscal 2010, and 6.6% for
    fiscal 2009. We selected a discount rate of 5.3% for
    determination of pension expense for fiscal 2012. A
    25 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption as
    of the beginning of fiscal 2011 would decrease pension expense
    for our pension plans by $8 million for the year. A
    25 basis point decrease in our discount rate assumption as
    of the beginning of fiscal 2011 would increase pension expense
    for our pension plans by $9 million for the year. A
    25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease
    pension expense by approximately $9 million for fiscal
    2012. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would
    increase pension expense by approximately $10 million for
    fiscal 2012. For our year-end pension obligation determination,
    we selected a discount rate of 5.3% and 5.8% for fiscal years
    2011 and 2010, respectively.

Another significant assumption used to account for our pension
    plans is the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
    In developing the assumed long-term rate of return on plan
    assets for determining pension expense, we consider long-term
    historical returns (arithmetic average) of the plan’s
    investments, the asset allocation among types of investments,
    estimated long-term returns by investment type from external
    sources, and the current economic environment. Based on this
    information, we selected 7.75% for the long-term rate of return
    on plan assets for determining our fiscal 2011 pension expense.
    A 25 basis point increase/decrease in our expected
    long-term rate of return assumption as of the beginning of
    fiscal 2011 would decrease/increase annual pension expense for
    our pension plans by approximately $5 million. We selected
    an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.75% to be used to
    determine our pension expense for fiscal 2012. A 25 basis
    point increase/decrease in our expected long-term rate of return
    assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2012 would
    decrease/increase annual pension expense for our pension plans
    by approximately $6 million.

When calculating expected return on plan assets for pension
    plans, we use a market-related value of assets that spreads
    asset gains and losses (differences between actual return and
    expected return) over five years. The market-related value of
    assets used in the calculation of expected return on plan assets
    for fiscal 2011 was $63 million higher than the actual fair
    value of plan assets.

The rate of compensation increase is another significant
    assumption used in the development of accounting information for
    pension plans. We determine this assumption based on our
    long-term plans for compensation increases and current economic
    conditions. Based on this information, we selected 4.25% for
    fiscal years 2011 and 2010 as the rate of compensation increase
    for determining our year-end pension obligation. We selected
    4.25% for the rate of compensation increase for determination of
    pension expense for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009. A 25 basis
    point increase in our rate of compensation increase assumption
    as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 would increase pension
    expense for our pension plans by approximately $1 million
    for the year. A 25 basis point decrease in our rate of
    compensation increase assumption as of the beginning of fiscal
    2011 would decrease pension expense for our pension plans by
    approximately $1 million for the year. We selected a rate
    of 4.25% for the rate of compensation increase to be used to
    determine our pension expense for fiscal 2012. A 25 basis
    point increase/decrease in our rate of compensation increase
    assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2012 would
    increase/decrease pension expense for our pension plans by
    approximately $1 million for the year.

We also provide certain postretirement health care benefits. We
    recognized postretirement benefit expense of $12 million,
    $9 million, and $15 million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and
    2009, respectively. We reflected liabilities of
    $322 million and $321 million in our balance sheets as
    of May 29, 2011 and May 30, 2010, respectively. We
    anticipate contributing approximately $32 million to our
    postretirement health care plans in fiscal 2012.



The postretirement benefit expense and obligation are also
    dependent on our assumptions used for the actuarially determined
    amounts. These assumptions include discount rates (discussed
    above), health care cost trend rates, inflation rates,
    retirement rates, mortality rates, and other factors. The health
    care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical
    cost data, the near-term outlook, and an assessment of likely
    long-term trends. Assumed inflation rates are based on an
    evaluation of external market indicators. Retirement and
    mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience.
    The discount rate we selected for determination of
    postretirement expense was 5.4% for fiscal 2011, 6.6% for fiscal
    2010, and 6.4% for fiscal 2009. We have selected a discount rate
    of 4.9% for determination of postretirement expense for fiscal
    2012. A 25 basis point increase/decrease in our discount
    rate assumption as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 would not
    have resulted in a material change to postretirement expense for
    our plans. We have assumed the initial year increase in cost of
    health care to be 7.5%, with the trend rate decreasing to 5.0%
    by 2016. A one percentage point change in the assumed health
    care cost trend rate would have the following effect:

We provide workers’ compensation benefits to our employees.
    The measurement of the liability for our cost of providing these
    benefits is largely based upon actuarial analysis of costs. One
    significant assumption we make is the discount rate used to
    calculate the present value of our obligation. The discount rate
    used at May 29, 2011 was 3.4%. A 25 basis point
    increase/decrease in the discount rate assumption would not have
    a material impact on workers’ compensation expense.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (including property, plant
    and equipment), Goodwill, and Identifiable Intangible
    Assets

—We reduce the carrying amounts of long-lived
    assets, goodwill, and identifiable intangible assets to their
    fair values when the fair value of such assets is determined to
    be less than their carrying amounts (i.e., assets are deemed to
    be impaired). Fair value is typically estimated using a
    discounted cash flow analysis, which requires us to estimate the
    future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular
    asset(s) being tested for impairment as well as to select a
    discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated
    cash flows. When determining future cash flow estimates, we
    consider historical results adjusted to reflect current and
    anticipated operating conditions. Estimating future cash flows
    requires significant judgment by management in such areas as
    future economic conditions, industry-specific conditions,
    product pricing, and necessary capital expenditures. The use of
    different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could
    produce different impairment amounts (or none at all) for
    long-lived assets, goodwill, and identifiable intangible assets.

We utilize a “relief from royalty” methodology in
    evaluating impairment of our indefinite lived brands/trademarks.
    The methodology determines the fair value of each brand through
    use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an
    estimated “royalty rate” we would be able to charge a
    third party for the use of the particular brand. When
    determining the future cash flow estimates, we must estimate
    future net sales and a fair market royalty rate for each
    applicable brand and an appropriate discount rate to measure the
    present value of the anticipated cash flows. Estimating future
    net sales requires significant judgment by management in such
    areas as future economic conditions, product pricing, and
    consumer trends.

In determining an appropriate discount rate to apply to the
    estimated future cash flows, we consider the current interest
    rate environment and our estimated cost of capital. As the
    calculated fair value of our goodwill and other identifiable
    intangible assets generally significantly exceeds the carrying
    amount of these assets, a one percentage point increase in the
    discount rate assumptions used to estimate the fair values of
    our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets would not
    result in a material impairment charge.

OTHER
    MATTERS

From time to time, one of our business units has engaged an
    environmental and agricultural engineering services firm. The
    firm is a subsidiary of an entity whose chief executive officer
    serves on our Board of Directors. Payments to this firm for
    environmental and agricultural engineering services and
    structures acquired totaled $0.3 million in both fiscal
    2011 and 2010.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The principal market risks affecting us during fiscal 2011 and
    2010 were exposures to price fluctuations of commodity and
    energy inputs, interest rates, and foreign currencies. These
    fluctuations impacted all reporting segments, as well as our
    trading and merchandising activities, which are presented as
    discontinued operations for all periods presented in our
    financial statements.

Commodity Market Risk

—We purchase commodity inputs
    such as wheat, corn, oats, soybean meal, soybean oil, meat,
    dairy products, sugar, natural gas, electricity, and packaging
    materials to be used in our operations. These commodities are
    subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk. We
    enter into commodity hedges to manage this price risk using
    physical forward contracts or derivative instruments. We have
    policies governing the hedging instruments our businesses may
    use. These policies include limiting the dollar risk exposure
    for each of our businesses. We also monitor the amount of
    associated counter-party credit risk for all non-exchange-traded
    transactions. In addition, during our ownership of the trading
    and merchandising business (divested during quarter one of
    fiscal 2009), we purchased and sold certain commodities, such as
    wheat, corn, soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, oats, natural
    gas, and crude oil (presented in discontinued operations).

Interest Rate Risk

—From time to time, we use
    interest rate swaps to manage the effect of interest rate
    changes on the fair value of our existing debt as well as the
    forecasted interest payments for the anticipated issuance of
    debt. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we entered into
    interest rate swap contracts used to effectively convert the
    interest rates of certain outstanding debt instruments from
    fixed to variable. During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we
    terminated these interest rate swap contracts. As a result of
    this termination, we received proceeds of $32 million. The
    cumulative adjustment to the fair value of the debt instruments
    being hedged, $35 million, was included in long-term debt
    and is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over
    the remaining lives of the debt instruments (through fiscal
    2014).

During the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we entered into
    interest rate swap contracts to hedge the interest rate risk
    related to our forecasted issuance of long-term debt in 2014
    (based on the anticipated refinancing of the senior long-term
    debt maturing at that time). The net notional amount of these
    interest rate derivatives at May 29, 2011 was
    $250 million. The maximum potential loss associated with
    these interest rate swap contracts from a hypothetical change of
    1% in interest rates is approximately $53 million. Any such
    gain or loss would be deferred in accumulated other
    comprehensive income and recognized in earnings over the life of
    the forecasted interest payments associated with the anticipated
    debt refinancing. At May 29, 2011, we had recognized an
    unrealized loss of $12 million in accumulated other
    comprehensive income for these derivative instruments.



As of May 29, 2011 and May 30, 2010, the fair value of
    our fixed rate debt was estimated at $3.6 billion and
    $4.1 billion, respectively, based on current market rates
    primarily provided by outside investment advisors. As of
    May 29, 2011 and May 30, 2010, a one percentage point
    increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our
    fixed rate debt by approximately $208 million and
    $234 million, respectively, while a one percentage point
    decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our
    fixed rate debt by approximately $232 million and
    $256 million, respectively.

Foreign Currency Risk

—In order to reduce exposures
    for our processing activities related to changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates, we may enter into forward exchange or
    option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency
    other than the functional currency for certain of our
    operations. This activity primarily relates to economically
    hedging against foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory
    and capital equipment, sales of finished goods, and future
    settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities.

Value-at-Risk

(VaR)

—We employ various tools to monitor our derivative
    risk, including

value-at-risk

(“VaR”) models. We perform simulations using
    historical data to estimate potential losses in the fair value
    of current derivative positions. We use price and volatility
    information for the prior 90 days in the calculation of VaR
    that is used to monitor our daily risk. The purpose of this
    measurement is to provide a single view of the potential risk of
    loss associated with derivative positions at a given point in
    time based on recent changes in market prices. Our model uses a
    95 percent confidence level. Accordingly, in any given one
    day time period, losses greater than the amounts included in the
    table, below, are expected to occur only 5 percent of the
    time. We include commodity swaps, futures, and options and
    foreign exchange forwards, swaps, and options in this
    calculation. The following table provides an overview of our
    average daily VaR for our energy, agriculture, and other
    commodities as well as the average daily foreign exchange VaR.
    Other commodities may include items such as packaging,
    livestock,

and/or

metals.

Prior to fiscal 2011, we presented analyses of market risk using
    a sensitivity analysis methodology. During fiscal 2011, we began
    using a VaR methodology for purposes of this presentation, as
    this is a methodology used by management in monitoring market
    risk, and we believe this is a more useful presentation to
    readers.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Fiscal Year

—The fiscal year of ConAgra Foods,
    Inc. (“ConAgra Foods”, “Company”,
    “we”, “us”, or “our”) ends the
    last Sunday in May. The fiscal years for the consolidated
    financial statements presented consist of 52-week periods for
    fiscal years 2011 and 2010 and a 53-week period for fiscal year
    2009.

Basis of Consolidation

—The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of ConAgra Foods, Inc.
    and all majority-owned subsidiaries. In addition, the accounts
    of all variable interest entities for which we have been
    determined to be the primary beneficiary are included in our
    consolidated financial statements from the date such
    determination is made. All significant intercompany investments,
    accounts, and transactions have been eliminated.

Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates

—The
    investments in, and the operating results of, 50%-or-less-owned
    entities not required to be consolidated are included in the
    consolidated financial statements on the basis of the equity
    method of accounting or the cost method of accounting, depending
    on specific facts and circumstances.

We review our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for
    impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances
    indicate that the carrying amount of the investments may not be
    fully recoverable. Evidence of a loss in value that is other
    than temporary include, but are not limited to, the absence of
    an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment, the
    inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity which
    would justify the carrying amount of the investment, or, where
    applicable, estimated sales proceeds which are insufficient to
    recover the carrying amount of the investment. Management’s
    assessment as to whether any decline in value is other than
    temporary is based on our ability and intent to hold the
    investment and whether evidence indicating the carrying value of
    the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time
    outweighs evidence to the contrary. Management generally
    considers our investments in equity method investees to be
    strategic long-term investments. Therefore, management completes
    its assessments with a long-term viewpoint. If the fair value of
    the investment is determined to be less than the carrying value
    and the decline in value is considered to be other than
    temporary, an appropriate write-down is recorded based on the
    excess of the carrying value over the best estimate of fair
    value of the investment.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

—Cash and all highly
    liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or
    less at the date of acquisition, including short-term time
    deposits and government agency and corporate obligations, are
    classified as cash and cash equivalents.

Inventories

—We principally use the lower of
    cost (determined using the

first-in,

first-out method) or market for valuing inventories other than
    merchandisable agricultural commodities. Grain, flour, and major
    feed ingredient inventories are principally stated at market
    value.

Property, Plant and Equipment

—Property, plant
    and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation has been
    calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated
    useful lives of the respective classes of assets as follows:

Land improvements

1 - 40 years

Buildings

15 - 40 years

Machinery and equipment

3 - 20 years

Furniture, fixtures, office equipment and other

5 - 15 years

We review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever
    events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the
    carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
    Recoverability of an asset considered

“held-and-used”

is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to
    the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from
    the use of the asset. If the carrying amount is greater than the
    undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the
    asset, the asset’s carrying amount is reduced to its
    estimated fair value. An asset considered

“held-for-sale”

is reported at the lower of the asset’s carrying amount or
    fair value.

Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible
    Assets

—Goodwill and other identifiable intangible
    assets with indefinite lives (e.g., brands or trademarks) are
    not amortized and are tested annually for impairment of value
    and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the
    carrying amount of the asset may be impaired. Impairment of
    identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives occurs when
    the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. If
    impaired, the asset’s carrying amount is reduced to its
    fair value. Goodwill is evaluated using a two-step impairment
    test at a reporting unit level. A reporting unit can be an
    operating segment or a business within an operating segment. The
    first step of the test compares the carrying value of a
    reporting unit, including goodwill, with its fair value. We
    estimate the fair value using level 3 inputs as defined by
    the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 21 for the
    definition of the levels in the fair value hierarchy. The inputs
    used to calculate the fair value include a number of subjective
    factors, such as estimates of future cash flows, estimates of
    our future cost structure, discount rates for our estimated cash
    flows, required level of working capital, assumed terminal
    value, and time horizon of cash flow forecasts. If the carrying
    value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we complete
    the second step of the test to determine the amount of goodwill
    impairment loss to be recognized. In the second step, we
    estimate an implied fair value of the reporting unit’s
    goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to
    all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including
    any unrecognized intangible assets). The impairment loss is
    equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over
    the implied fair value of that goodwill. Our annual impairment
    testing is performed during the fourth quarter using a
    discounted cash flow-based methodology.

Identifiable intangible assets with definite lives (e.g.,
    licensing arrangements with contractual lives or customer
    relationships) are amortized over their estimated useful lives
    and tested for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be
    impaired. Identifiable intangible assets with definite lives are
    evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used in
    evaluating elements of property, plant and equipment. If
    impaired, the asset is written down to its fair value.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

—Unless
    otherwise specified, we believe the carrying value of financial
    instruments approximates their fair value.

Environmental Liabilities

—Environmental
    liabilities are accrued when it is probable that obligations
    have been incurred and the associated amounts can be reasonably
    estimated. We use third-party specialists to assist management
    in appropriately measuring the obligations associated with
    environmental liabilities. Such liabilities are adjusted as new
    information develops or circumstances change. We do not discount
    our environmental liabilities as the timing of the anticipated
    cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable.
    Management’s estimate of our potential liability is
    independent of any potential recovery of insurance proceeds or
    indemnification arrangements. We do not reduce our environmental
    liabilities for potential insurance recoveries.

Employment-Related
    Benefits

—Employment-related benefits associated
    with pensions, postretirement health care benefits, and
    workers’ compensation are expensed as such obligations are
    incurred. The recognition of expense is impacted by estimates
    made by management, such as discount rates used to value these
    liabilities, future health care costs, and employee accidents
    incurred but not yet reported. We use third-party specialists to
    assist management in appropriately measuring the obligations
    associated with employment-related benefits.

Revenue Recognition

—Revenue is recognized
    when title and risk of loss are transferred to customers upon
    delivery based on terms of sale and collectibility is reasonably
    assured. Revenue is recognized as the net amount to be received
    after deducting estimated amounts for discounts, trade
    allowances, and returns of damaged and

out-of-date

Marketing Costs

—We promote our products with
    advertising, consumer incentives, and trade promotions. Such
    programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, coupons,
    rebates, and volume-based incentives. Advertising costs are
    expensed as incurred. Consumer incentives and trade promotion
    activities are recorded as a reduction of revenue or as a
    component of cost of goods sold based on amounts estimated as
    being due to customers and consumers at the end of the period,
    based principally on historical utilization and redemption
    rates. Advertising and promotion expenses totaled
    $371.9 million, $409.1 million, and
    $380.6 million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009,
    respectively, and are included in selling, general and
    administrative expenses.

Research and Development

—We incurred expenses
    of $81.4 million, $77.9 million, and
    $78.0 million for research and development activities in
    fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

Comprehensive Income

—

Comprehensive
    income includes net income, currency translation adjustments,
    certain derivative-related activity, changes in the value of

available-for-sale

investments, and changes in prior service cost and net actuarial
    gains/losses from pension and postretirement health care plans.
    We generally deem our foreign investments to be essentially
    permanent in nature and, as such, we do not provide for taxes on
    currency translation adjustments arising from converting the
    investment in a foreign currency to U.S. dollars. When we
    determine that a foreign investment, as well as undistributed
    earnings, are no longer permanent in nature, estimated taxes are
    provided for the related deferred taxes, if any, resulting from
    currency translation adjustments. We reclassified
    $1.6 million of foreign currency translation net gains to
    net income due to the disposal or substantial liquidation of
    foreign subsidiaries in fiscal 2011. We reclassified
    $2.0 million of foreign currency translation net losses to
    net income due to the disposal or substantial liquidation of
    foreign subsidiaries and equity method investments in fiscal
    2009.

Foreign Currency Transaction Gains and
    Losses

—We recognized net foreign currency
    transaction gains (losses) from continuing operations of
    $3.9 million, $(6.2) million, and $0.7 million in
    fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, in selling, general
    and administrative expenses.

Use of Estimates

—Preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
    principles requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect reported
    amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses as
    reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Actual
    results could differ from these estimates.

Reclassifications

—Certain prior year amounts
    have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

Accounting Changes

—In June 2009, the
    Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) amended
    its guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities.
    This guidance requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to
    determine whether the enterprise’s variable interest or
    interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable
    interest entity. This analysis identifies the primary
    beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that
    has both of the following characteristics: the power to direct
    the activities of a variable interest entity that most
    significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and
    the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could
    potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or
    the right to receive benefits from the entity that could
    potentially be significant to the variable interest entity. We
    adopted the provisions of this guidance effective as of the
    beginning of our fiscal 2011. The impact of the adoption of this
    guidance was not material to our financial statements.

DISCONTINUED
    OPERATIONS AND DIVESTITURES

Frozen
    Handhelds Operations

In May 2011, we completed the sale of substantially all of the
    assets of our frozen handhelds operations for $9.5 million
    in cash, subject to final working capital adjustments. We
    recognized impairment and related charges totaling
    $21.7 million ($14.2 million after-tax) in fiscal
    2011. We reflected the results of these operations as
    discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets of
    the discontinued frozen handhelds operations have been
    reclassified as assets held for sale within our consolidated
    balance sheets for all periods presented prior to divestiture.

    related to these agreements are not significant, and
    accordingly, are not deemed to be direct cash flows of the

In June 2009, we completed the divestiture of the

foodservice brand for proceeds of approximately
    $6.4 million in cash. Based on our estimate of proceeds
    from the sale of this business, we recognized impairment charges
    totaling $8.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.
    We reflected the results of these operations as discontinued
    operations for all periods presented.

Trading
    and Merchandising Operations

On March 27, 2008, we entered into an agreement with
    affiliates of Ospraie Special Opportunities Fund to sell our
    commodity trading and merchandising operations conducted by
    ConAgra Trade Group (previously principally reported as the
    Trading and Merchandising segment). The operations included the
    domestic and international grain merchandising, fertilizer
    distribution, agricultural and energy commodities trading and
    services, and grain, animal, and oil seed byproducts
    merchandising and distribution business. In June 2008, the sale
    of the trading and merchandising operations was completed for
    before-tax proceeds of: 1) approximately $2.2 billion
    in cash, net of transaction costs (including incentive
    compensation amounts due to employees due to accelerated
    vesting), 2) $550.0 million (face value) of

payment-in-kind

debt securities issued by the purchaser (the “Notes”)
    which were recorded at an initial estimated fair value of
    $479.4 million, 3) a short-term receivable of
    $37.2 million due from the purchaser, and 4) a
    four-year warrant to acquire approximately 5% of the issued
    common equity of the parent company of the divested operations,
    which was recorded at an estimated fair value of
    $1.8 million. We recognized an after-tax gain on the
    disposition of approximately $301.2 million in fiscal 2009.

During fiscal 2009, we collected the $37.2 million
    short-term receivable due from the purchaser. See Note 4
    for further discussion on the Notes.

We reflected the results of the divested trading and
    merchandising operations as discontinued operations for all
    periods presented.

The results of the aforementioned businesses which have been
    divested are included within discontinued operations. The

ACQUISITIONS

On June 28, 2010, we acquired the assets of American Pie,
    LLC (“American Pie”) for $131.0 million in cash
    plus assumed liabilities. American Pie is a manufacturer of
    frozen fruit pies, thaw and serve pies, fruit cobblers, and pie
    crusts under the licensed

and

Claim

trade names, as well as frozen dinners, pot pies, and appetizers
    under the

trade name. Approximately $51.5 million of the purchase
    price was allocated to goodwill and $61.3 million was
    allocated to brands, trademarks and other intangibles. The
    amount allocated to goodwill is deductible for income tax
    purposes. This business is included in the Consumer Foods
    segment.

On April 12, 2010, we acquired Elan Nutrition, Inc., a
    privately held formulator and manufacturer of private label
    snack and nutrition bars, for $103.5 million in cash plus
    assumed liabilities. Approximately $66.4 million of the
    purchase price was allocated to goodwill and $33.6 million
    was allocated to brands, trademarks and other intangibles. The
    amount allocated to goodwill is not deductible for income tax
    purposes. This business is included in the Consumer Foods
    segment.

On September 22, 2008, we acquired a 49.99% interest in
    Lamb Weston BSW, LLC (“Lamb Weston BSW” or the
    “venture”), a potato processing joint venture with
    Ochoa Ag Unlimited Foods, Inc. (“Ochoa”), for
    approximately $46.2 million in cash. Lamb Weston BSW
    subsequently distributed $20.0 million of our initial
    investment to us. This venture is considered a variable interest
    entity and is consolidated in our financial statements (see
    Note 7). Approximately $18.8 million of the purchase
    price was allocated to goodwill and approximately
    $11.1 million was allocated to brands, trademarks and other
    intangibles. The amount allocated to goodwill is deductible by
    the entity for income tax purposes. This business is included in
    the Commercial Foods segment.

During fiscal 2009, we completed other various individually
    immaterial acquisitions of businesses and other identifiable
    intangible assets for approximately $18.4 million in cash
    plus assumed liabilities. Approximately $15.1 million of
    the purchase price was allocated to goodwill, brands, trademarks
    and other intangibles.

For each of these acquisitions, the amounts allocated to
    goodwill were primarily attributable to anticipated synergies,
    product portfolios, and other intangibles that do not qualify
    for separate recognition.

Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets acquired
    and liabilities assumed in these acquisitions were recorded at
    their respective estimated fair values at the date of
    acquisition.

The pro forma effect of the acquisitions mentioned above was not
    material.

PAYMENT-IN-KIND

NOTES RECEIVABLE

In connection with the divestiture of the trading and
    merchandising operations in fiscal 2009, we received
    $550.0 million (face value) of

payment-in-kind

debt securities (the “Notes”) issued by the purchaser
    of the divested business. The Notes were recorded at an initial
    estimated fair value of $479.4 million.

The Notes were issued in three tranches: $99,990,000 original
    principal amount of 10.5% notes due June 19, 2010;
    $200,035,000 original principal amount of 10.75% notes due
    June 19, 2011; and $249,975,000 original principal amount
    of 11.0% notes due June 19, 2012. The Notes permitted
    payment of interest in cash or additional notes.

During fiscal 2010, we received $115.4 million as payment
    in full of all principal and interest due on the first tranche
    of the Notes, in advance of the scheduled maturity date. During
    fiscal 2011, we received $554.2 million as payment in full
    of all principal and interest due on the second and third
    tranches of the Notes, in advance of the scheduled maturity
    dates. As a result, we recognized a gain of $25.0 million
    in fiscal 2011.

At May 30, 2010, the second and third tranches of the
    Notes, which were classified as other assets in our consolidated
    balance sheet, had an aggregate carrying value of
    $490.2 million.

GARNER,
    NORTH CAROLINA ACCIDENT

On June 9, 2009, an accidental explosion occurred at our
    manufacturing facility in Garner, North Carolina (the
    “Garner accident”). This facility was the primary
    production facility for our

Slim

branded meat snacks. On June 13, 2009, the U.S. Bureau
    of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives announced its
    determination that the explosion was the result of an accidental
    natural gas release, and not a deliberate act.

    accident with our insurance providers. Through May 29,
    2011, the total payments received from the insurers was
    $167.5 million and all previously deferred balances have
    now been recognized. The insurance recoveries recognized in
    fiscal 2011, included in selling, general and administrative
    expenses, totaled $109.4 million, representing
    $84.0 million of reimbursement for business interruption, a
    $21.3 million gain on involuntary conversion of property,

RESTRUCTURING
    ACTIVITIES

Network
    Optimization Plan

During the third quarter of fiscal 2011, our Board of Directors
    approved a plan recommended by executive management designed to
    optimize our manufacturing and distribution networks. The plan
    consists of projects that involve, among other things, the exit
    of certain manufacturing facilities, the disposal of
    underutilized manufacturing assets, and actions designed to
    optimize our distribution network. The plan is expected to be
    implemented by the end of fiscal 2013 and is intended to improve
    the efficiency of our manufacturing operations and reduce costs.
    This plan is referred to as the Network Optimization Plan, which
    we previously referred to as the 2011 plan.

In connection with the Network Optimization Plan, we expect to
    incur pre-tax cash and non-cash charges for asset impairments,
    accelerated depreciation, severance, relocation, and site
    closure costs of $54.9 million. We have recognized,

and/or

expect to recognize, expenses associated with the Network
    Optimization Plan, including but not limited to, impairments of
    property, plant and equipment, accelerated depreciation,
    severance and related costs, and plan implementation costs
    (e.g., consulting, employee relocation, etc.). We anticipate
    that we will recognize the

    products. By the end of fiscal 2011, with the plan substantially
    implemented, the facility has become our primary meat snacks
    production facility.

Also in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we made a decision to
    consolidate certain administrative functions from Edina,
    Minnesota, to Naperville, Illinois. We completed the transition
    of these functions in fiscal 2011. This plan, together with the
    plan to move production of our meat snacks from Garner, North
    Carolina to Troy, Ohio, is collectively referred to as the 2010
    restructuring plan (“2010 plan”).

In connection with the 2010 plan, we expect to incur pre-tax
    cash and non-cash charges for asset impairments, accelerated
    depreciation, severance, relocation, and site closure costs of
    $68.0 million, of which $25.7 million was recognized
    in fiscal 2011 and $39.2 million was recognized in fiscal
    2010. We have recognized expenses associated with the 2010 plan,
    including but not limited to, impairments of property, plant and
    equipment, accelerated depreciation, severance and related
    costs, and plan implementation costs (e.g., consulting, employee
    relocation, etc.). We anticipate that we will recognize the
    following pre-tax expenses associated with the 2010 plan in the
    fiscal 2010 to 2012 timeframe (amounts include charges
    recognized in fiscal 2010 and 2011):

VARIABLE
    INTEREST ENTITIES

Variable
    Interest Entities Consolidated

We own a 49.99% interest in Lamb Weston BSW, LLC (“Lamb
    Weston BSW”), a potato processing venture with Ochoa Ag
    Unlimited Foods, Inc. (“Ochoa”). We provide all sales
    and marketing services to Lamb Weston BSW. Under certain
    circumstances, we could be required to compensate the other
    equity owner of Lamb Weston BSW for lost profits resulting from
    significant production shortfalls (“production
    shortfalls”). Commencing on June 1, 2018, or on an
    earlier date under certain circumstances, we have a contractual
    right to purchase the remaining equity interest in Lamb Weston
    BSW from Ochoa (the “call option”). Commencing on
    July 30, 2011, or on an earlier date under certain
    circumstances, we are subject to a contractual obligation to
    purchase all of Ochoa’s equity investment in Lamb Weston
    BSW at the option of Ochoa (the “put option”). The
    purchase prices under the call option and the put option (the
    “options”) are based on the book value of Ochoa’s
    equity interest at the date of exercise, as modified by an

agreed-upon

rate of return for the holding period of the investment balance.
    The

agreed-upon

rate of return varies depending on the circumstances under which
    any of the options are exercised. We have determined that Lamb
    Weston BSW is a variable interest entity and that we are the
    primary beneficiary of the entity. Accordingly, we consolidate
    the financial statements of Lamb Weston BSW.

As of May 29, 2011, we provided lines of credit of up to
    $15.0 million to Lamb Weston BSW. Borrowings under the
    lines of credit bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus
    200 basis points with a floor of 3.25%. In the first
    quarter of fiscal 2011, we repaid $35.4 million of bank
    borrowings of Lamb Weston BSW and took assignment of a
    promissory note from the joint venture, the balance of which was
    $36.1 million at May 29, 2011. The promissory note is
    due in December 2015. The promissory note is currently accruing
    interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 200 basis

points with a floor of 3.25%. The amounts owed by Lamb Weston
    BSW to the Company are not reflected in our balance sheets, as
    they are eliminated in consolidation.

Our variable interests in Lamb Weston BSW include an equity
    investment in the venture, the options, the promissory note,
    certain fees paid to us by Lamb Weston BSW for sales and
    marketing services, the contingent obligation related to
    production shortfalls, and the lines of credit advanced to Lamb
    Weston BSW. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our
    involvement with this venture is equal to our equity investment
    in the venture, the balance of the promissory note extended to
    the venture, the amount, if any, advanced under the lines of
    credit, and the amount, if any, by which the put option exercise
    price exceeds the fair value of the noncontrolling interest in
    Lamb Weston BSW on, or after, the put option exercise date.
    Also, in the event of a production shortfall, we could be
    required to compensate the other equity owner of Lamb Weston BSW
    for lost profits. It is not possible to determine the maximum
    exposure to losses from the potential exercise of the put option
    or from potential production shortfalls. However, we do not
    expect to incur material losses resulting from these exposures.

We also consolidate the assets and liabilities of several
    entities from which we lease corporate aircraft. Each of these
    entities has been determined to be a variable interest entity
    and we have been determined to be the primary beneficiary of
    each of these entities. Under the terms of the aircraft leases,
    we provide guarantees to the owners of these entities of a
    minimum residual value of the aircraft at the end of the lease
    term. We also have fixed price purchase options on the aircraft
    leased from these entities. Our maximum exposure to loss from
    our involvement with these entities is limited to the difference
    between the fair value of the leased aircraft and the amount of
    the residual value guarantees at the time we terminate the
    leases (the leases expire between December 2011 and October
    2012). The total amount of the residual value guarantees for
    these aircraft at the end of the respective lease terms is
    $38.4 million.

Due to the consolidation of these variable interest entities, we

BSW. The assets recognized as a result of consolidating Lamb
    Weston BSW are the property of the venture and are not available
    to us for any other purpose, other than as a secured lender
    under the promissory note and lines of credit.

Variable
    Interest Entities Not Consolidated

We also have variable interests in certain other entities that
    we have determined to be variable interest entities, but for
    which we are not the primary beneficiary. We do not consolidate
    the financial statements of these entities.

We hold a 50% interest in Lamb Weston RDO, a potato processing
    venture. We provide all sales and marketing services to Lamb
    Weston RDO. We receive a fee for these services based on a
    percentage of the net sales of the venture. We reflect the value
    of our ownership interest in this venture in other assets in our
    consolidated balance sheets, based upon the equity method of
    accounting. The balance of our investment was $13.6 million
    and $13.8 million at May 29, 2011 and May 30,
    2010, respectively, representing our maximum exposure to loss as
    a result of our involvement with this venture. The capital
    structure of Lamb Weston RDO includes owners’ equity of
    $27.3 million and term borrowings from banks of
    $49.5 million as of May 29, 2011. We have determined
    that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most
    significantly impact the economic performance of this venture.

We lease certain office buildings from entities that we have
    determined to be variable interest entities. The lease
    agreements with these entities include fixed-price purchase
    options for the assets being leased, representing our only
    variable interest in these lessor entities. These leases are
    accounted for as operating leases, and accordingly, there are no
    material assets or liabilities associated with these entities
    included in our balance sheets. We have no material exposure to
    loss from our variable interests in these entities. We have
    determined that we do not have the power to direct the
    activities that most significantly impact the economic
    performance of these entities. In making this determination, we
    have considered, among other items, the terms of the lease
    agreements, the expected remaining useful lives of the assets
    leased, and the capital structure of the lessor entities.

Non-amortizing

intangible assets are comprised of brands and trademarks.

Amortizing intangible assets, carrying a weighted average life
    of approximately 13 years, are principally composed of
    licensing arrangements and customer relationships. For fiscal
    2011, 2010, and 2009, we recognized amortization expense of
    $17.8 million, $7.8 million, and $6.6 million,
    respectively. Based on amortizing assets recognized in our
    balance sheet as of May 29, 2011, amortization expense is
    estimated to average approximately $16.5 million for each
    of the next five years, with a high expense of
    $18.3 million in fiscal year 2012 and decreasing to a low
    expense of $14.4 million in fiscal year 2016.

In connection with the acquisition of American Pie LLC in fiscal
    2011, we allocated approximately $51.5 million of the
    purchase price to deductible goodwill and approximately
    $61.3 million to intangible assets (all of which is
    presented in the Consumer Foods segment). In fiscal 2011, we
    also acquired $18.0 million of intangible assets in support
    of manufacturing reliability and other process technologies.

In connection with the acquisition of Elan in fiscal 2010, we
    allocated approximately $66.4 million of the purchase price
    to non-deductible goodwill and approximately $33.6 million
    to intangible assets (all of which is presented in the Consumer
    Foods segment).

In connection with the acquisition of Lamb Weston BSW in fiscal
    2009, we allocated approximately $18.8 million of the
    purchase price to deductible goodwill and approximately
    $11.1 million to intangible assets (all of which is
    presented in the Commercial Foods segment).

CREDIT
    FACILITIES AND BORROWINGS

At May 29, 2011, we had a $1.50 billion multi-year
    revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial
    institutions that matures in December 2011. The multi-year
    facility has historically been used principally as a

back-up

facility for our commercial paper program. As of May 29,
    2011, there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit
    facility. Borrowings under the multi-year facility bear interest
    at or below prime rate and may be prepaid without penalty. The
    multi-year revolving credit facility requires us to repay
    borrowings if our consolidated funded debt exceeds 65% of the
    consolidated capital base, or if fixed charges coverage, each as
    defined in the credit agreement, is less than 1.75 to 1.0. As of
    May 29, 2011, we were in compliance with the credit
    agreement’s financial covenants.

We finance our short-term liquidity needs with bank borrowings,
    commercial paper borrowings, and bankers’ acceptances. We
    had no material short-term borrowings outstanding in fiscal 2011
    and 2010.

Our net interest expense was reduced by $14.5 million and

    the impact of interest rate swap contracts entered into in

    2011, we terminated the interest rate swap contracts and
    received proceeds of $31.5 million. The cumulative
    adjustment to the fair value of the debt instruments being
    hedged (the effective portion of the hedge) is being amortized
    as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining lives of
    the debt instruments (through fiscal 2014).

Our net interest expense was increased by $1.0 million and
    $0.7 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively, due to
    the net impact of previously terminated interest rate swap
    agreements.

CAPITAL
    STOCK

We have authorized shares of preferred stock as follows:

Class B—$50 par value; 150,000 shares

Class C—$100 par value; 250,000 shares

Class D—without par value; 1,100,000 shares

Class E—without par value; 16,550,000 shares

There were no preferred shares issued or outstanding as of
    May 29, 2011.

We have repurchased our shares of common stock from time to time
    after considering market conditions and in accordance with
    repurchase limits authorized by our Board of Directors. In
    February 2010, our Board of Directors approved a
    $500.0 million share repurchase program with no expiration
    date. Upon receipt of payment for the final two outstanding
    tranches of the Notes from the purchaser of the trading and
    merchandising business, during fiscal 2011, our Board of
    Directors increased our share repurchase authorization by the
    amount of the payment, which was $554.2 million. We
    repurchased approximately 36.2 million shares of our common
    stock for approximately $825.0 million and approximately
    4.0 million shares of our common stock for approximately
    $100.0 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively, under
    this program. We completed an accelerated share repurchase
    program during fiscal 2009. We paid $900.0 million and
    received 44.0 million shares under this program in fiscal
    2009.

SHARE-BASED
    PAYMENTS

In accordance with stockholder-approved plans, we issue
    share-based payments under various stock-based compensation
    arrangements, including stock options, restricted stock units,
    performance shares, and other share-based awards.

On September 25, 2009, the stockholders approved the
    ConAgra Foods 2009 Stock Plan, which authorized the issuance of
    up to 29.5 million shares of ConAgra Foods common stock. At
    May 29, 2011, approximately 27.5 million shares were
    reserved for granting additional options, restricted stock
    units, performance shares, or other share-based awards.

Stock
    Option Plan

We have a stockholder-approved stock option plan that provides
    for granting of options to employees for the purchase of common
    stock at prices equal to the fair value at the date of grant.
    Options become exercisable under various vesting schedules
    (typically three to five years) and generally expire seven to
    ten years after the date of grant.

The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant
    using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
    weighted average assumptions for stock options granted:




Expected volatility (%)

22.83

22.94

The expected volatility is based on the historical market

    options granted. The expected life represents the period of time
    that the awards are expected to be outstanding

We recognize compensation expense using the straight-line method
    over the requisite service period. During fiscal 2011, 2010, and
    2009, the Company granted 6.2 million options,
    7.9 million options, and 7.7 million options,
    respectively, with a weighted average grant date value of $3.31,
    $2.73, and $2.84, respectively. The total intrinsic value of
    options exercised was $9.3 million, $8.4 million, and
    $0.3 million for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
    The closing market price of our common stock on the last trading
    day of fiscal 2011 was $25.04 per share.

Compensation expense for stock option awards totaled
    $19.9 million, $22.0 million, and $23.8 million
    for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The tax benefit
    related to the stock option expense for fiscal 2011, 2010, and
    2009 was $7.4 million, $8.2 million, and
    $9.1 million, respectively.

At May 29, 2011, we had $16.6 million of total
    unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures,
    related to stock options that will be recognized over a weighted
    average period of 1.3 years.

Cash received from option exercises for the fiscal years ended
    May 29, 2011, May 30, 2010, and May 31, 2009 was
    $71.6 million, $70.3 million, and $6.1 million,
    respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax
    deductions from option exercises totaled $3.4 million,
    $3.1 million, and $0.1 million for fiscal 2011, 2010,
    and 2009, respectively.

Share
    Unit Plans

In accordance with stockholder-approved plans, we issue stock
    under various stock-based compensation arrangements, including
    restricted stock units and other share-based awards (“share
    units”). These awards generally have requisite service
    periods of three to five years. Under each arrangement, stock is
    issued without direct cost to the employee. We estimate the fair
    value of the share units based upon the market price of our
    stock at the date of grant. Certain share unit grants do not
    provide for the payment of dividend equivalents to the
    participant during the requisite service period (vesting
    period). For those grants, the value of the grants is reduced by
    the net present value of the foregone dividend equivalent
    payments. We recognize compensation expense for share unit
    awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
    period. The compensation expense for our share unit awards
    totaled $21.2 million, $19.6 million, and
    $17.8 million for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009,
    respectively. The tax benefit related to the compensation
    expense for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 was $7.9 million,
    $7.3 million, and $6.8 million, respectively.

    unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures,
    related to share unit awards that will be recognized over a
    weighted average period of 2.0 years.

Performance-Based
    Share Plan

Performance shares are granted to selected executives and other
    key employees with vesting contingent upon meeting various
    Company-wide performance goals. The performance goals are based
    upon our earnings before interest and taxes and our return on
    average invested capital measured over a defined performance
    period. The awards actually earned will range from zero to three
    hundred percent of the targeted number of performance shares for
    performance periods ending in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 and
    will range from zero to two hundred percent of the targeted
    number of performance shares for the performance period ending
    in fiscal 2013. Awards, if earned, will be paid in shares of
    common stock. Subject to limited exceptions set forth in the
    performance share plan, any shares earned will be distributed at
    the end of the performance period. The value of the performance
    shares granted in fiscal 2009, 2010, and 2011 was adjusted based
    upon the market price of our stock at the end of each reporting
    period and amortized as compensation expense over the vesting
    period.

    The tax benefit related to the compensation expense for fiscal

The total intrinsic value of share units vested (including

Based on estimates at May 29, 2011, the Company had
    $7.4 million of total unrecognized compensation expense,
    net of estimated forfeitures, related to performance shares that
    will be recognized over a weighted average period of
    2.0 years.

Accounting guidance requires the benefits of tax deductions in
    excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a
    financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow in
    our statements of cash flows. Because the tax deductions in
    fiscal 2010 and 2009 were less than the recognized compensation
    expenses, our net operating cash flows increased and our net
    financing cash flows decreased by approximately
    $1.5 million and $0.7 million for fiscal 2010 and
    2009, respectively. There was no impact on our statement of cash
    flows for fiscal 2011.

    $3.3 million of tax positions for which the ultimate
    deductibility is highly certain but for which there is
    uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of
    the impact of deferred tax accounting, the disallowance of the
    shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual
    effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to
    the taxing authority to an earlier period. Any associated
    interest and penalties imposed would affect the tax rate. As of

May 30, 2010, our gross liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits was $53.4 million, excluding a related liability
    of $14.8 million for gross interest and penalties.

The net amount of unrecognized tax benefits at May 29, 2011
    and May 30, 2010 that, if recognized, would favorably
    impact our effective tax rate was $35.7 million and
    $32.6 million, respectively.

We accrue interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax
    positions as part of income tax expense.

We conduct business and file tax returns in numerous countries,
    states, and local jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue
    Service (“IRS”) has completed its audit for tax years
    through fiscal 2009 and all resulting significant items for
    fiscal 2009 and prior years have been settled with the IRS.
    Other major jurisdictions where we conduct business generally
    have statutes of limitations ranging from 3 to 5 years.

We estimate that it is reasonably possible that the amount of
    gross unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by $0 to
    $5 million over the next twelve months due to various
    federal, state, and foreign audit settlements and the expiration
    of statutes of limitations.

The change in the unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended

We have approximately $68.7 million of foreign net
    operating loss carryforwards ($23.8 million expire between
    fiscal 2012 and 2022 and $44.9 million have no expiration
    dates). Substantially all of our foreign tax credits will expire
    between fiscal 2016 and 2020. State tax credits of approximately
    $15.1 million expire in various years ranging from fiscal
    2013 to 2017.

We have recognized a valuation allowance for the portion of the
    net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards, and
    other deferred tax assets we believe are not more likely than
    not to be realized. The net impact on income tax expense related
    to changes in the valuation allowance for fiscal 2011 was a
    charge of $2.1 million. For fiscal 2010 and 2009, changes
    in the valuation allowance were a benefit of $4.6 million
    and a charge of $3.8 million, respectively. The current
    year change principally relates to increases to the valuation
    allowances for foreign net operating losses, offset by decreases
    related to state net operating losses and credits.

We have not provided U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative
    earnings of

non-U.S. affiliates

and associated companies that the Company considers to be
    reinvested indefinitely. It is not practicable to estimate the
    amount of U.S. income taxes that would be incurred in the
    event that we were to repatriate the cumulative earnings of

non-U.S. affiliates

and associated companies. Deferred taxes are provided for
    earnings of

non-U.S. affiliates

and associated companies when we determine that such earnings
    are no longer indefinitely reinvested.

OPERATING
    LEASES

We lease certain facilities, land, and transportation equipment
    under agreements that expire at various dates. Rent expense
    under all operating leases from continuing operations was
    $126.1 million, $127.2 million, and
    $134.3 million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009,
    respectively. Rent expense under operating leases from
    discontinued operations was $0.4 million,
    $3.2 million, and $5.9 million in fiscal 2011, 2010,
    and 2009, respectively.

    immediately entered into an agreement with an affiliate of the
    buyer to lease back the farmland. At that time, we received
    proceeds of $75.0 million in cash, removed the land from
    our balance sheet, and recorded a deferred gain of
    $29.7 million (reflected primarily in noncurrent
    liabilities). The lease agreement has an initial term of ten
    years and two five-year renewal options. This lease is being
    accounted for as an operating lease and we are recognizing the
    deferred gain as a reduction of rent expense over the lease term.

CONTINGENCIES

In fiscal 1991, we acquired Beatrice Company
    (“Beatrice”). As a result of the acquisition and the
    significant pre-acquisition contingencies of the Beatrice
    businesses and its former subsidiaries, our consolidated
    post-acquisition financial statements reflect liabilities
    associated with the estimated resolution of these contingencies.
    These include various litigation and environmental proceedings
    related to businesses divested by Beatrice prior to its
    acquisition by us. The litigation includes suits against a
    number of lead paint and pigment manufacturers, including
    ConAgra Grocery Products and the Company as alleged successors
    to W. P. Fuller Co., a lead paint and pigment manufacturer owned
    and operated by Beatrice until 1967. Although decisions
    favorable to us have been rendered in Rhode Island, New Jersey,
    Wisconsin, and Ohio, we remain a defendant in active suits in
    Illinois and California. The Illinois suit seeks

class-wide

relief in the form of medical monitoring for elevated levels of
    lead in blood. In California, a number of cities and counties
    have joined in a consolidated action seeking abatement of the
    alleged public nuisance. We have had successful outcomes in
    every case decided to date and although exposure in the
    remaining cases is unlikely, it is reasonably possible. However,
    given the range of potential remedies, it is not possible to
    estimate this exposure.

The environmental proceedings include litigation and
    administrative proceedings involving Beatrice’s status as a
    potentially responsible party at 37 Superfund, proposed
    Superfund, or state-equivalent sites; these sites involve
    locations previously owned or operated by predecessors of
    Beatrice that used or produced petroleum, pesticides,
    fertilizers, dyes, inks, solvents, PCBs, acids, lead, sulfur,
    tannery wastes,

and/or

other
    contaminants. Beatrice has paid or is in the process of paying
    its liability share at 34 of these sites. Reserves for these
    matters have been established based on our best estimate of the
    undiscounted remediation liabilities, which estimates include
    evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required

clean-up,

the known volumetric contribution of Beatrice and other
    potentially responsible parties, and its experience in
    remediating sites. The reserves for Beatrice-related
    environmental matters totaled $68.5 million as of
    May 29, 2011, a majority of which relates to the Superfund
    and state-equivalent sites referenced above. The reserve for
    Beatrice-related environmental matters reflects a reduction in
    pre-tax expense of $15.4 million made in the third quarter
    of fiscal 2010 due to favorable regulatory developments at one
    of the sites. We expect expenditures for Beatrice-related
    environmental matters to continue for up to 19 years.

In limited situations, we will guarantee an obligation of an
    unconsolidated entity. At the time in which we initially provide
    such a guarantee, we assess the risk of financial exposure to us
    under these agreements. We consider the credit-worthiness of the
    guaranteed party, the value of any collateral pledged against
    the related obligation, and any other factors that may mitigate
    our risk. We actively monitor market and entity-specific
    conditions that may result in a change of our assessment of the
    risk of loss under these agreements.

We guarantee certain leases and other commercial obligations
    resulting from the 2002 divestiture of our fresh beef and pork
    operations. The remaining terms of these arrangements do not
    exceed five years and the maximum amount of future payments we
    have guaranteed was $13.5 million as of May 29, 2011.

We have also guaranteed the performance of the divested fresh
    beef and pork business with respect to a hog purchase contract.
    The hog purchase contract requires the divested fresh beef and
    pork business to purchase a minimum of approximately
    1.2 million hogs annually through 2014. The contract
    stipulates minimum price commitments, based in part on market
    prices, and, in certain circumstances, also includes price
    adjustments based on certain inputs. We have not established a
    liability for any of the fresh beef and pork divestiture-related
    guarantees, as we have determined that the likelihood of our
    required performance under the guarantees is remote.

We are a party to various potato supply agreements. Under the
    terms of certain such potato supply agreements, we have
    guaranteed repayment of short-term bank loans of the potato
    suppliers, under certain conditions. At May 29, 2011, the
    amount of supplier loans we have effectively guaranteed was
    $34.4 million. We have not established a liability for
    these guarantees, as we have determined that the likelihood of
    our required performance under the guarantees is remote.

We are a party to a supply agreement with an onion processing
    company. We have guaranteed repayment of a loan of this
    supplier, under certain conditions. At May 29, 2011, the
    term of the loan is 14 years. The amount of our guaranty
    was $25 million as of May 29, 2011. In the event of
    default on this loan by the supplier, we have the contractual
    right to purchase the loan from the lender, thereby giving us
    the rights to the underlying collateral. We have not established
    a liability in connection with this guarantee, as we believe the
    likelihood of financial exposure to us under this agreement is
    remote.

Federal income tax credits were generated related to our sweet
    potato production facility in Delhi, Louisiana. Third parties
    invested in certain of these income tax credits. We have
    guaranteed these third parties the face value of these income
    tax credits over their statutory lives, a period of seven years,
    in the event that the income tax credits are recaptured or
    reduced. The face value of the income tax credits was
    $21.2 million as of May 29, 2011. We believe the
    likelihood of the recapture or reduction of the income tax
    credits is remote, and therefore we have not established a
    liability in connection with this guarantee.

We are a party to a number of lawsuits and claims arising out of
    the operation of our business, including lawsuits and claims
    related to the February 2007 recall of our peanut butter
    products and litigation we initiated against an insurance
    carrier to recover our settlement expenditures and defense
    costs. We recognized a charge of $24.8 million during the
    third quarter of fiscal 2009 in connection with the disputed
    coverage with this insurance carrier. During the second quarter
    of fiscal 2010, a Delaware state court rendered a decision on
    certain matters in our claim for the disputed coverage favorable
    to the insurance carrier. We appealed this decision and, during
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we received a favorable
    opinion related to our defense costs and the claim for disputed
    coverage was remanded to the state court. We continue to
    vigorously pursue our claim for the disputed coverage. In fiscal
    2011, we received formal requests from the
    U.S. Attorney’s office in Georgia seeking a variety of
    records and information related to the operations of our peanut
    butter manufacturing facility in Sylvester, Georgia. We believe
    these requests are related to the previously disclosed June 2007
    execution of a search warrant at our facility following the
    February 2007 recall of our peanut butter products. The Company
    is cooperating with officials in regard to the requests.

In June 2009, an accidental explosion occurred at our
    manufacturing facility in Garner, North Carolina. During the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.,
    our engineer and project manager at the site filed a declaratory
    judgment action against us seeking indemnity for personal injury
    claims brought against it as a result of the accident. We intend
    to defend this action vigorously. Any exposure in this case is
    expected to be limited to the applicable insurance deductible.
    See Note 5 for additional information related to this
    matter.

We are a party to several lawsuits concerning the use of
    diacetyl, a butter flavoring ingredient that was added to our
    microwave popcorn until late 2007. The cases are primarily
    consumer personal injury suits claiming respiratory illness
    allegedly due to exposures to vapors from microwaving popcorn.
    Another case involved a putative class action contending that
    our packaging information with respect to diacetyl is false and
    misleading. Through the date of this report, we have received a
    favorable verdict, summary judgment ruling, and two dismissals
    in connection with these suits, and the class action motion in
    the packaging suit was denied. The verdict and the favorable
    summary judgment ruling were appealed and the summary judgment
    was affirmed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. We do not
    believe these cases possess merit and continue to vigorously
    defend them. Any exposure in these cases is expected to be
    limited to the applicable insurance deductible.

After taking into account liabilities recognized for all of the
    foregoing matters, management believes the ultimate resolution
    of such matters should not have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. It is
    reasonably possible that a change in one of the estimates of the
    foregoing matters may occur in the future. Costs of legal
    services associated with the foregoing matters are recognized in
    earnings as services are provided.

DERIVATIVE
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Our operations are exposed to market risks from adverse changes
    in commodity prices affecting the cost of raw materials and
    energy, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. In
    the normal course of business, these risks are managed through a
    variety of strategies, including the use of derivatives.

Commodity futures and options contracts are used from time to
    time to economically hedge commodity input prices on items such
    as natural gas, vegetable oils, proteins, dairy, grains, and
    electricity. Generally, we economically hedge a portion of our
    anticipated consumption of commodity inputs for periods of up to
    36 months. We may enter into longer-term economic hedges on
    particular commodities, if deemed appropriate. As of
    May 29, 2011, we had economically hedged certain portions
    of our anticipated consumption of commodity inputs using
    derivative instruments with expiration dates through December
    2012.

In order to reduce exposures related to changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates, when deemed prudent, we enter into
    forward exchange, options, or swap contracts for transactions
    denominated in a currency other than the applicable functional
    currency. This includes, but is not limited to, hedging against
    foreign currency risk in purchasing inventory and capital
    equipment, sales of finished goods, and future settlement of
    foreign-denominated assets and liabilities. As of May 29,
    2011, we had economically hedged certain portions of our foreign
    currency risk in anticipated transactions using derivative
    instruments with expiration dates through May 2017.

From time to time, we may use derivative instruments, including
    interest rate swaps, to reduce risk related to changes in
    interest rates. This includes, but is not limited to, hedging
    against increasing interest rates prior to the issuance of
    long-term debt and hedging the fair value of our senior
    long-term debt.

Derivatives
    Designated as Cash Flow Hedges

During fiscal 2011, we entered into interest rate swap contracts
    to hedge the interest rate risk related to our forecasted
    issuance of long-term debt in 2014 (based on the anticipated
    refinancing of the senior long-term debt maturing at that time).
    We designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of
    the forecasted interest

payments related to this debt issuance. The unrealized loss
    associated with these derivatives, which is deferred in
    accumulated other comprehensive loss at May 29, 2011, was
    $11.8 million.

The net notional amount of these interest rate derivatives at
    May 29, 2011 was $250.0 million.

Hedge ineffectiveness for cash flow hedges may impact net
    earnings when a change in the value of a hedge does not offset
    the change in the value of the underlying hedged item. Depending
    on the nature of the hedge, ineffectiveness is recognized within
    cost of goods sold or selling, general and administrative
    expense. We do not exclude any component of the hedging
    instrument’s gain or loss when assessing ineffectiveness.
    The ineffectiveness associated with derivatives designated as
    cash flow hedges from continuing operations was not material to
    our results of operations in any period presented.

Derivatives Designated as Fair Value Hedges

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we entered into
    interest rate swap contracts to hedge the fair value of certain
    of our senior long-term debt instruments maturing in fiscal 2012
    and 2014. We designated these interest rate swap contracts as
    fair value hedges of the debt instruments.

Changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are
    immediately recognized in earnings along with changes in the
    fair value of the items being hedged (based solely on the change
    in the benchmark interest rate). These gains and losses are
    classified within selling, general and administrative expenses.
    In fiscal 2011 and 2010, we recognized a net gain of
    $23.0 million and $8.5 million, respectively, on the
    interest rate swap contracts and a loss of $29.7 million
    and $5.1 million, respectively, on the senior long-term
    debt. The notional amount of the interest rate derivatives
    outstanding at May 30, 2010 was $842.7 million.

We terminated the interest rate swap contracts during fiscal
    2011. As a result of this termination, we received proceeds of
    $31.5 million. The cumulative adjustment to the fair value
    of the debt instruments being hedged, $34.8 million, is
    included in long-term debt and is being amortized as a reduction
    of interest expense over the remaining lives of the debt
    instruments (through fiscal 2014). At the end of fiscal 2011,
    the unamortized amount was $27.6 million.

The entire change in fair value of the derivative instruments
    was included in our assessment of hedge effectiveness.

Economic Hedges of Forecasted Cash Flows

Many of our derivatives do not qualify for, and we do not
    currently designate certain commodity or foreign currency
    derivatives to achieve, hedge accounting treatment. We reflect
    realized and unrealized gains and losses from derivatives used
    to economically hedge anticipated commodity consumption and to
    mitigate foreign currency cash flow risk in earnings immediately
    within general corporate expense (within cost of goods sold).
    The gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating
    results in the period in which the underlying item being
    economically hedged is recognized in cost of goods sold.

Economic Hedges of Fair Values—Foreign Currency Exchange
    Rate Risk

We may use options and cross currency swaps to economically
    hedge the fair value of certain monetary assets and liabilities
    (including intercompany balances) denominated in a currency
    other than the functional currency. These derivatives are

marked-to-market

with gains and losses immediately recognized in selling, general
    and administrative expenses. These substantially offset the
    foreign currency transaction gains or losses recognized on the
    monetary assets or liabilities being economically hedged.

Derivative Activity in Our Milling Operations

We also use derivative instruments within our milling
    operations, which are part of the Commercial Foods segment.
    Derivative instruments used to economically hedge commodity
    inventories and forward purchase and sales contracts within the
    milling operations are

marked-to-market

such that realized and unrealized gains and losses are
    immediately included in operating results. The underlying
    inventory and forward contracts being hedged are also

marked-to-market

with changes in market value recognized immediately in operating
    results.

For commodity derivative trading activities within our milling
    operations that are not intended to mitigate commodity input
    cost risk, the derivative instrument is

marked-to-market

each period with gains and losses included in net sales of the
    Commercial Foods segment. There were no material gains or losses
    from derivative trading activities in fiscal 2011, 2010, or 2009.

All derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet
    at fair value. The fair value of derivative assets is recognized
    within prepaid expenses and other current assets, while the fair
    value of derivative liabilities is recognized within other
    accrued liabilities. In accordance with FASB guidance, we offset
    certain derivative asset and liability balances, as well as
    certain amounts representing rights to reclaim cash collateral
    and obligations to return cash collateral, where legal right of
    setoff exists. Amounts representing a right to reclaim cash
    collateral of $7.8 million and $8.6 million were
    included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our
    consolidated balance sheets at May 29, 2011 and
    May 30, 2010, respectively.

As of May 29, 2011, our open commodity contracts had a
    notional value (defined as notional quantity times market value
    per notional quantity unit) of $1.0 billion and
    $1.2 billion for purchase and sales contracts,
    respectively. As of May 30, 2010, our open commodity
    contracts had a notional value of $563.7 million and
    $577.1 million for purchase and sales contracts,
    respectively. The notional amount of our foreign currency
    forward and cross currency swap contracts as of May 29,
    2011 and May 30, 2010 was $292.7 million and
    $240.0 million, respectively. In addition, we held foreign
    currency option collar contracts with notional amounts of
    $86.4 million and $97.2 million as of May 29,
    2011 and May 30, 2010, respectively.

We enter into certain commodity, interest rate, and foreign
    exchange derivatives with a diversified group of counterparties.
    We continually monitor our positions and the credit ratings of
    the counterparties involved and limit the amount of credit
    exposure to any one party. These transactions may expose us to
    potential losses due to the risk of nonperformance by these
    counterparties. We have not incurred a material loss and do not
    expect to incur any such material losses. We also enter into
    futures and options transactions through various regulated
    exchanges.

At May 29, 2011, the maximum amount of loss due to the
    credit risk of the counterparties, had the counterparties failed
    to perform according to the terms of the contracts, was
    $55.2 million.

PENSION
    AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company and its subsidiaries have defined benefit retirement
    plans (“plans”) for eligible salaried and hourly
    employees. Benefits are based on years of credited service and
    average compensation or stated amounts for each year of service.
    We also sponsor postretirement plans which provide certain
    medical and dental benefits (“other benefits”) to
    qualifying U.S. employees.

We recognize the funded status of our plans in the consolidated
    balance sheets. We also recognize as a component of accumulated
    other comprehensive loss, the net of tax results of the gains or
    losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the
    period but are not recognized in net periodic benefit cost.
    These amounts will be adjusted out of accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) as they are subsequently recognized
    as components of net periodic benefit cost.

Level 1 assets are valued based on quoted prices in active
    markets for identical securities. The majority of the
    Level 1 assets listed above include the common stock of
    both U.S. and international companies, master limited
    partnership units, and real estate investment trusts, all of
    which are actively traded and priced in the market. Level 2
    assets are valued based on other significant observable inputs
    including quoted prices for similar securities, yield curves,
    indices, etc. The Level 2 assets listed above consist
    primarily of commingled equity investments where values are
    based on the net asset value of the underlying investments held,
    individual fixed income securities where values are based on
    quoted prices of similar securities and observable market data,
    and commingled fixed income investments where values are based
    on the net asset value of the underlying investments held.
    Level 3 assets are those where the fair value is determined
    based on unobservable inputs. The Level 3 assets listed
    above consist of alternative investments where active market
    pricing is not readily available and, as such, we use net asset
    values as an estimate of fair value as a practical expedient.
    For Real Estate, the value is based on the net asset value
    provided by the investment manager who uses market data and
    independent third party appraisals to determine fair market
    value. For the Multi-Strategy Hedge Funds, the value is based on
    the net asset values provided by a third party administrator.
    For Private Equity, the investment manager provides the
    valuation using, among other things, comparable transactions,
    comparable public company data, discounted cash flow analysis,
    and market conditions. The valuations on the contracts with
    insurance companies are provided by third party administrators
    who use the terms of the contract along with available market
    data to determine the fair market value.

Level 3 investments are generally considered long-term in
    nature with varying redemption availability. Certain of our
    Level 3 investments, with a fair value of approximately
    $407.8 million as of May 29, 2011, have imposed
    customary redemption gates which may further restrict or limit
    the redemption of invested funds therein.

As of May 29, 2011, we have unfunded commitments for
    additional investments in the Private Equity funds totaling
    approximately $37 million. We expect unfunded commitments
    to be funded from plan assets rather than the general assets of
    the Company.

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
    assumption for the pension plans, we consider the current asset
    allocation strategy, the historical investment performance, and
    the expectations for future returns of each asset class.

Our pension plan weighted-average asset allocations and our
    target asset allocations at May 29, 2011 and May 30,
    2010, by asset category were as follows:

The Company’s investment strategy reflects the expectation
    that equity securities will outperform debt securities over the
    long term. Assets are invested in a prudent manner to maintain
    the security of funds while maximizing returns within the
    Company’s Investment Policy guidelines. The strategy is
    implemented utilizing indexed and actively managed assets from
    the categories listed.

The investment goals are to provide a total return that, over
    the long term, increases the ratio of plan assets to liabilities
    subject to an acceptable level of risk. This is accomplished
    through diversification of assets in accordance with the
    Investment Policy guidelines. Investment risk is mitigated by
    periodic rebalancing between asset classes as necessitated by
    changes in market conditions within the Investment Policy
    guidelines.

Other investments are primarily made up of cash, hedge funds,
    private equity, master limited partnerships, and contracts with
    insurance companies.

FAIR
    VALUE MEASUREMENTS

FASB guidance establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy
    based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price assets or
    liabilities. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair
    value are as follows:

Level 1—Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities,

Level 2—Observable inputs other than those included in
    Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and
    liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical
    assets or liabilities in inactive markets, and

Level 3—Unobservable inputs reflecting our own
    assumptions and best estimate of what inputs market participants
    would use in pricing the asset or liability.

The following table presents our financial assets and
    liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis based
    upon the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair
    value measurements fall, as of May 29, 2011:

During fiscal 2010, a partially completed production facility
    with a carrying amount of $39.3 million was written-down to
    its fair value of $6.0 million, resulting in an impairment
    charge of $33.3 million, which is included in selling,
    general and administrative expenses in the Consumer Foods
    segment (see Note 6). The fair value measurement used to
    determine this impairment was based on the market approach and
    reflected anticipated sales proceeds for these assets. This
    production facility was sold in fiscal 2011, resulting in no
    material gain or loss.

During fiscal 2010, we decided to close our meat snack
    production facility in Garner, North Carolina (see Note 6).
    We recognized an impairment charge of $16.5 million to
    write-down the associated property, plant and equipment with a
    carrying amount of $45.5 million to its fair value of
    $29.0 million. The fair value measurement used to determine
    this impairment was based on the income approach, which utilized
    cash flow projections consistent with the most recent

business plan, a terminal value, and a discount rate equivalent
    to a market participant’s weighted-average cost of capital.

During fiscal 2010, noncurrent assets held for sale from our

business with a carrying amount of $88.7 million were
    written-down to their fair value of $30.4 million,
    resulting in an impairment charge of $58.3 million
    ($39.3 million after-tax), which is included in results of
    discontinued operations (see Note 2). The fair value
    measurement used to determine this impairment was based on the
    market approach and reflected anticipated sales proceeds for
    these assets.

The carrying amount of long-term debt (including current
    installments) was $3.2 billion as of May 29, 2011 and
    $3.5 billion as of May 30, 2010. Based on current
    market rates provided primarily by outside investment bankers,
    the fair value of this debt at May 29, 2011 and
    May 30, 2010 was estimated at $3.6 billion and
    $4.1 billion, respectively.

Presentation of Derivative Gains (Losses) for Economic Hedges
    of Forecasted Cash Flows in Segment Results

Derivatives used to manage commodity price risk and foreign
    currency risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment.
    We believe these derivatives provide economic hedges of certain
    forecasted transactions. As such, these derivatives (except
    those related to our milling operations, see Note 19 to our
    Consolidated Financial Statements) are recognized at fair market
    value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized
    in general corporate expenses. The gains and losses are
    subsequently recognized in the operating results of the
    reporting segments in the period in which the underlying
    transaction being economically hedged is included in earnings.

The following table presents the net derivative gains (losses)

Based on our forecasts of the timing of recognition of the
    underlying hedged items, we expect to reclassify gains of
    $33.7 million and losses of $2.1 million to segment
    operating results in fiscal 2012 and 2013 and thereafter,
    respectively. Amounts allocated, or to be allocated, to segment
    operating results during fiscal 2011 and thereafter include net
    losses of $3.0 million that were recognized prior to fiscal
    2011.

At May 29, 2011, ConAgra Foods and its subsidiaries had
    approximately 23,200 employees, primarily in the United
    States. Approximately 48% of our employees are parties to
    collective bargaining agreements. Of the employees subject to
    collective bargaining agreements, approximately 40% are parties
    to collective bargaining agreements that are scheduled to expire
    during fiscal 2012.

Our operations are principally in the United States. With
    respect to operations outside of the United States, no single
    foreign country or geographic region was significant with
    respect to consolidated operations for fiscal 2011, 2010, and
    2009. Foreign net sales, including sales by domestic segments to
    customers located outside of the United States, were
    approximately $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion, and
    $1.3 billion in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
    Our long-lived assets located outside of the United States are
    not significant.

Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates,
    accounted for approximately 18%, 18%, and 17% of consolidated
    net sales for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively,
    primarily in the Consumer Foods segment.

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates accounted for
    approximately 15% and 16% of consolidated net receivables as of
    May 29, 2011 and May 30, 2010, respectively, primarily
    in the Consumer Foods segment.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

ConAgra Foods, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    ConAgra Foods, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
    May 29, 2011 and May 30, 2010, and the related
    consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income,
    common stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the
    years in the three-year period ended May 29, 2011. These
    consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of ConAgra Foods, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
    May 29, 2011 and May 30, 2010, and the results of
    their operations and cash flows for each of the years in the
    three-year period ended May 29, 2011, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    May 29, 2011, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO), and our report dated July 19, 2011 expressed an
    unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

The Company’s management carried out an evaluation, with
    the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer
    and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design
    and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and
    procedures as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of
    May 29, 2011. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as
    of the end of the period covered by this report, the
    Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management, with the participation of the
    Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, evaluated any change in the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting that occurred during the
    quarter covered by this report and determined that there was no
    change in the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 that has
    materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
    affect, the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

The management of ConAgra Foods is responsible for establishing
    and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
    reporting as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. ConAgra
    Foods’ internal control over financial reporting is
    designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. ConAgra
    Foods’ internal control over financial reporting includes
    those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the
    maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
    and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
    assets of ConAgra Foods; (ii) provide reasonable assurance
    that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that
    receipts and expenditures of ConAgra Foods are being made only
    in accordance with the authorization of management and directors
    of ConAgra Foods; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
    regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
    acquisition, use or disposition of ConAgra Foods’ assets
    that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
    Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluations of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of the changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

With the participation of ConAgra Foods’ Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management assessed the
    effectiveness of ConAgra Foods’ internal control over
    financial reporting as of May 29, 2011. In making this
    assessment, management used criteria established in

Internal
    Control—Integrated Framework

, issued by the Committee
    of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (“COSO”). As a result of this assessment, management
    concluded that, as of May 29, 2011, its internal control
    over financial reporting was effective.

The effectiveness of ConAgra Foods’ internal control over
    financial reporting as of May 29, 2011 has been audited by
    KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
    stated in their report, a copy of which is included in this
    Annual Report on

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

ConAgra Foods, Inc.:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    ConAgra Foods, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
    May 29, 2011, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, ConAgra Foods, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained,
    in all material respects, effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of May 29, 2011, based on the
    criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of May 29,
    2011 and May 30, 2010, and the related consolidated
    statements of earnings, comprehensive income, common
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years
    in the three-year period ended May 29, 2011, and our report
    dated July 19, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    those consolidated financial statements.
