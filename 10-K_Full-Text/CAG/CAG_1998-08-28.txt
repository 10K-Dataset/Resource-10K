ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

a)   General Development of Business

     Nebraska Consolidated Mills Company, which was originally incorporated in
     Nebraska on September 29, 1919, changed its name to ConAgra, Inc.
     ("ConAgra" or the "Company") on February 25, 1971, and since December 5,
     1975, has been incorporated in Delaware.

b)   Financial Information About Industry Segments

     The Company's businesses are classified into three industry segments:
     Grocery & Diversified Products, Refrigerated Foods and Food Inputs &
     Ingredients.  The contributions of each industry segment to net sales and
     operating profit, and the identifiable assets attributable to each industry
     segment set forth in Note 18 "Business Segments" on pages 60 and 61 of the
     Company's 1998 Annual Report to Stockholders are incorporated herein by
     reference.

c)   Narrative Description of Business
     
     The information set forth in the "Business Review" on pages 22 through 34
     of the Company's 1998 Annual Report to Stockholders is incorporated herein
     by reference.
     
     The following comments pertain to the Company as a whole.
     
     ConAgra is a diversified food company that operates across the food chain,
     from basic agricultural inputs to production and sale of branded consumer
     products.  As a result, ConAgra uses many different raw materials, the bulk
     of which are commodities.  Raw materials are generally available from
     several different sources and ConAgra presently believes that it can obtain
     these as needed.
     
     Each business is highly competitive.  Many companies compete in one or more
     of the markets served by ConAgra, some of which have greater sales and
     assets than ConAgra.
     
     Quality control processes at principal manufacturing locations emphasize
     applied research and technical services directed at product improvement and
     quality control.  In addition, the Refrigerated Foods and the Grocery &
     Diversified Products segments conduct research activities related to the
     development of new products.
     
     Many of ConAgra's facilities and products are subject to various laws and
     regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture,
     the Federal Food and Drug Administration, and other federal, state, local
     and foreign governmental agencies relating to the quality of products,
     sanitation, safety and environmental control.  The Company believes that it
     complies with such laws and regulations in all material respects, and that
     continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect
     upon capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the
     Company.
     
     ConAgra and its subsidiaries have more than 80,000 employees, primarily in
     the United States.



ITEM 1.   BUSINESS (CONTINUED)

d)   Foreign Operations
     
     The information set forth in the "Business Review" on pages 22 through 34
     of the Company's 1998 Annual Report to Stockholders is incorporated herein
     by reference.  The Company is not engaged in material operations in foreign
     countries, nor are material portions of sales or revenues derived from
     customers in foreign countries.

ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES

The Company's corporate headquarters are located in Omaha, Nebraska.  The
headquarters and principal operating locations of each business are set forth on
the following list of "ConAgra Locations."

The Company maintains a number of distribution facilities, in addition to
distribution facilities and warehouse space available at substantially all of
its manufacturing facilities.

plant and week.  In general, ConAgra operates most of its manufacturing
facilities in excess of 80% of standard industry capacity.  Standards vary by
industry from 40 hours per week to 144 hours per week.

Most principal manufacturing facilities are held in fee.  However, certain
parcels of land, machinery and buildings, and substantially all of ConAgra's
transportation equipment used in its processing and merchandising operations,
including covered rail hopper cars and river barges, are leased.

ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In fiscal 1991, ConAgra acquired Beatrice Company ("Beatrice").  As a result 
of the acquisition and the significant pre-acquisition tax and other 
contingencies of the Beatrice businesses and its former subsidiaries, the 
consolidated post-acquisition financial statements of ConAgra reflected 
significant liabilities and valuation allowances associated with the 
estimated resolution of these contingencies.  The material pre-acquisition 
tax contingencies were resolved in fiscal 1995.

Beatrice is also engaged in various litigation and environmental proceedings
related to businesses divested by Beatrice prior to its acquisition by ConAgra. 
The environmental proceedings include litigation and administrative proceedings
involving Beatrice's status as a potentially responsible party at 47 Superfund,
proposed Superfund or state-equivalent sites.  Beatrice has paid or is in the
process of paying its liability share at 43 of these sites.  Substantial
reserves for these matters have been established based on the Company's best
estimate of its undiscounted remediation liabilities, which estimates include
evaluation of investigatory studies, extent of required cleanup, the known
volumetric contribution of Beatrice and other potentially responsible parties
and its experience in remediating sites.

In March 1997, the Environmental Protection Agency filed an action in federal
district court in Colorado against a subsidiary of the Company which operates a
pesticide formulation facility in Greeley, Colorado seeking civil monetary
penalties for violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; this
action was settled pursuant to a Consent Agreement in May 1998 which provides in
part for payment of a civil penalty of $203,000 by the subsidiary.  In June
1998, a subsidiary of the Company engaged in processing potatoes entered into a
Consent Decree with the Environmental Protection Agency in federal district
court in Idaho which provided in part for the payment of a civil penalty of
$160,000 by the subsidiary for violations of the Clean Air Act.  In March 1996,
the Environmental Protection Agency filed an action in federal district court in
Idaho against the Company as owner and operator of a beef packing plant in
Nampa, Idaho seeking civil monetary penalties for alleged violations of the
Clean Water Act; the Company is defending this action.

ConAgra is party to a number of other lawsuits and claims arising out of the
operation of its businesses.  After taking into account liabilities recorded for
all of the foregoing matters, management believes the ultimate resolution of
such matters should not have a material adverse effect on ConAgra's financial
condition, results of operations or liquidity.
